Yesterday , I met many newly arrived refugees , some just children , who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in Syria . One 7 year old girl told me she saw her neighbor ' s throat cut in front of her . Her family fled in the dark of night , walking several hours before they could cross into Jordan . Like every refugee I have met here , they weren ' t able to bring any belongings they came with only the clothes on their backs .
