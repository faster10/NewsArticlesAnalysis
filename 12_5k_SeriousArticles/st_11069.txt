In my five months attending about 90 ? candidate events across both parties , I ' d say there has been some change in Iowa . Voters are focusing on national issues , not just the parochial interests of a Midwestern farm state . Ethanol , which is made from ? corn and is thus a major concern ? in corn rich Iowa , has come up just a handful of times in the hundreds of questions I have heard . Instead , Iowans ask about the economy , terrorism , immigration , health care ? ? ? the same things Americans all over would ask if they could . The campaign for president has become more nationalized , and voters in Iowa reflect this .
