It would appear as though WWE is building towards Brock Lesnar vs . Bray Wyatt at WrestleMania 32 . If that s the case , Dallas is the first place Lesnar will likely get his hands on Bray . WWE s preview doesn t make it seem like he ll end up actually meeting Wyatt face to face tonight . Rather , it sounds as though Lesnar will show up , express his anger , and then turn Birmingham into Suplex City , courtesy of whichever WWE Superstars happen to get in his way on WWE Raw .
