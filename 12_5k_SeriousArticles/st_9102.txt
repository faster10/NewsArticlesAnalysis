The Broncos simply earned the victory by dropping seven to eight guys in coverage while still getting to the quarterback . Normally , a team can eat up its opponent on the ground when they play like that but the Patriots line and running backs could not exploit Denver s strategy . Denver also won the field position competition , which allowed Manning to take sacks while still backing up the Patriots deep in their own end . In a low scoring game the Patriots needed to take points whenever they could get them but they chose instead to extend drives unsuccessfully . Despite all of the above , the Patriots were a missed extra point away from tying the game . No one on Denver s sideline was comfortable when Brady hit Gronk for the potentially tying touchdown with 12 seconds to go . Up until that point the Patriots had , statistically , about a 5 chance of winning the game but Brady still threatened a comeback . That in itself earns the man the respect of his peers . He never stops fighting .
