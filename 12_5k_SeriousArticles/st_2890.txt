Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday it was inappropriate to link the crash to Russia ' s military strategy in Syria . Some have also pointed to a 2001 incident , when the Airbus 321 ' s tail section struck the tarmac on landing , as a possible cause of structural weakness . Faulty " tail strike " repairs have caused at least two catastrophic crashes in the past . However , the plane had passed safety checks and its operator , Kogalymavia , owner of the Metrojet brand , has said damage from the 2001 mishap was fully repaired and could not have been a factor in the Sinai crash .
