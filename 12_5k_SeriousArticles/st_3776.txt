John Crawford was not in the streets . He was in one of the nation ' s largest toy and gun retailers . If we ' re in a toy and gun store , and I ' m holding what could be either , isn ' t it at least plausible I ' m a customer ? If you swing by the barbecue grill section and pick up a grilling fork and lighter fluid , you don ' t magically become a knife wielding arsonist . Kids grab toy guns from the shelves and act out gun fights in the aisles all the time . They are never gunned down by the guys from " Call of Duty . "
