Willems : It all depends . A lot of people think of ideas as objects , or animals that you hunt . You go into the woods , you find an idea , you capture it and you bring it home . And ideas really are more like gardens . And every day , you ' re planting lots and lots of ideas . Some of them get eaten by birds , and never go anywhere . Some of them grow up to be really horrible things . Some wither and die . Every now and then , over time , some idea grows up to be big and beautiful and filled with fruit . You can cut that down and burn it for profit . So it ' s an evolution .
