Headteacher Mark Dumican is a born and bred Wiganer . ' The rivalry is incredibly fierce , it ' s all on even from school level , ' he said . ' It ' s in your blood , you get it knocked into you that whatever happens the rest of the year doesn ' t matter as long as you beat St Helens . My best scenario will be for Joe and Luke to both play really well and Joe to score in the corner with 10 seconds to go . '
