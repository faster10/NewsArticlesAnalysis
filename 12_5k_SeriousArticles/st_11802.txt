Carter made three of the 3 pointers , but there might be mounting pressure on him to come up with a bulk of the offense . The Tar Heels begin a stretch of three consecutive road games on Monday night at Louisville and end in a rematch with Boston College on February 9 . . . . The problem I have with putting them so high on the list is that not all their wins are as glorious as they could be . Against Boston College , the Tar Heels only made 11 of their 22 free throws .
