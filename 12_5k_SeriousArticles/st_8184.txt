Jacksonville Jaguars : The Jaguars have the opportunity to take a step forward in the AFC South by beating the Colts . However , they were in that position earlier this season and failed to capitalize when Jason Myers missed two potential game winning field goal attempts . The Jaguars offense put up good numbers that day ( 431 yards ) but managed just 13 points . Things have gotten better since then , however . The Jaguars have scored in the 30s three times since then and are averaging 25 . 6 points per game in November and December . Quarterback Blake Bortles is coming off a five TD day and gets his No . 2 receiver ( Allen Hurns ) back from injury this week . Jaguars 27 , Colts 17 . Mike DiRocco
