This isn ' t what the Republican Party wanted when it began sanctioning and limiting debates following the 2012 presidential election .

The Republican National Committee wanted to control the message and protect its candidates ( and brand ) , but that hasn ' t worked out so well . Trump , as it turns out , has been a bigger force and commands a louder megaphone than anyone else in the party . Just how much will he use it Thursday night at his veterans event ?
