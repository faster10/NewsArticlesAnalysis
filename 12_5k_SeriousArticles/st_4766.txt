This is not ? as if it needed to be spelt out ? to say that West is the new Bowie , or is as good as Bowie . It s not even to say that West is a great artist , or even a good person . All of those are value judgments , and only decades of posterity will tell whether West s importance , influence or popularity will approach Bowie s . Anyone is more than entitled to dislike West : as I say , he makes it easy . Even fans find it hard sometimes : he has said and done crass and questionable things , from his association with Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to his creepy support for the rapper Tyga s relationship with Kylie Jenner , which began when she was 17 ( the age of consent in California is 18 ) . But then , is anyone going to pretend that Bowie , too , wasn t a ( scary ) monster at certain points during his creative heyday ?
