The government is doing its best to showcase the stock exchange . In one of the busiest traffic intersections of Phnom Penh , there is a large stock market television screen that shows the stock market moves . It generates interest among individual retail investors who can watch the stock price as they sit in traffic . Institutional investors from Japan , Korea and China have also taken a bite of the recent IPO but whether that interest can be sustained is still a big question . Cambodia is new to the game . Risk and volatility are inherent in a frontier market . Corruption is a concern even though the government passed an anti corruption law in 2010 .
