" I think you can learn a lot from it , even though it was 30 0 , " Brady said on WEEI ' s Dennis Callahan Show . " Obviously Houston didn ' t play very well , but Kansas City forced them into a lot of bad football . But that ' s what I think Kansas City has done a great job of all year . They ' ve forced teams , whoever they ' ve played down the stretch ? they ' ve won 11 straight ? all of them into making a lot of bad plays .
