The Thanksgiving meal is known for indulgences , but remember that this is just one meal . One festive splurge doesn ' t have to wind up on your hips . If you go overboard on Thanksgiving Day , wake up the next morning excited to get back to your usual routine of healthy eating . Sticking to regular meal times , incorporating lean protein and fiber with every meal and focusing on foods that are filling yet low in calories ensures Thanksgiving remains just one day , not a week .
