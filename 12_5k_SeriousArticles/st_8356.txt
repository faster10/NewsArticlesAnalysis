Today , there might be a kid who is getting in trouble , has broken the law , he ' s had a fight in our center , he ' s told the staff to get lost . Tomorrow , that same kid might really start to make a change in their life . But equally there can be a kid doing really well today doing his best at school , behaving well . And tomorrow he might be out there stealing with a gang . So our work is never finished , in a sense . There ' s always something more that could happen , and I think that ' s the biggest frustration for us .
