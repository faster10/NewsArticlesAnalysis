Germany is taking in more refugees than any other EU state . It expects 800 , 000 to 1 million people , many from war zones in the Middle East , Africa and Afghanistan , to arrive in 2015 . Earlier in October , Bavaria threatened to take emergency measures , including sending some refugees back to Austria , if Merkel did not act to limit the flow . But it never followed through on its threat . Merkel has insisted there will be no limits and that Germany can cope .
