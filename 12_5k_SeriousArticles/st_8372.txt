I don t think there s fear , and I don t think it s disrespect for the people of Iowa . This is what it looks like when some guy stands up to the rules and the game and says , Screw yours I m looking out for me first . That s all this is . And you can say whatever you want , but I am not dumb . I m not gonna give you the gun and the bullet and stand still . You want to hit me , come get me , but I m not gonna put myself in your line of fire . That s what he s doing , if you ask me .
