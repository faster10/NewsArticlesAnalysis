At least a half dozen attendees shoved and tackled the protester , a black man , to the ground as he refused to leave the event , ? David Mark and ? Jeremy Diamond wrote . At least one man punched the protester and a woman kicked him while he was on the ground . This is borne out by the video , which is confusing at points ? it was filmed in a crowd ? but definitely shows Southall flailing about in a crowd of people that are swarming him while Trump himself yells to throw him out .
