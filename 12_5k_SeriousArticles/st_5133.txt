Miller : My uncle called me in the beginning of the build and said 343 . And I said , yeah . That ' s the number of firefighters that died in 9 11 . He said 343 feathers . I kind of looked at my drawings and design . I said maybe I could maybe make it happen . But the feathers are too big , and there wasn ' t enough room to make it happen . But wings in general mean a lot . And everybody has their own connection to them .
