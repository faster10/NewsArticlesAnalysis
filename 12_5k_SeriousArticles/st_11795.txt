It is not hard to agree with Kerr on this . Rodman in his prime versus Green would be a helluva matchup and highly entertaining to watch . You can almost picture the two fighting on the block for rebounds and trash talking at each other after big plays . Despite these theaterics , the two would probably be very evenly matched as CBS Sports ' Zach Harper simulation of the hypothetical game on NBA 2K16 shows . Of course , the simulation doesn ' t really incorporate the emotions Green and Rodman play with so we will just have to wait till time traveling is invented to witness the real thing .
