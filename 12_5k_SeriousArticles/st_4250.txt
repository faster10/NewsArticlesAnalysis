Some may be discouraged to see a black woman get an Oscar nod for playing a house cleaner never mind that women in their 40s of every stripe are having a hard time everywhere in Hollywood . Viola Davis is a gifted actor smokin ' hot ! but not buxom , biracial or conventionally beautiful . She already has a truckload of Tony and other theater awards , just got a SAG award , and works steadily .
