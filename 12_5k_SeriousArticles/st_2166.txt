We are told that Modi is yet again preparing to tour some foreign countries ? at least four more by November 25 . This has put a big question mark on the convening of the winter session of Parliament . Usually , the winter session begins on the third Monday of November ( 16th of this month ) . This is unlikely to happen unless , of course , Modi chooses to remain abroad as Parliament convenes . Or , is this part of the implementation of the Gujarat model ?
