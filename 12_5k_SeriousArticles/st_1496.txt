Mr Jolly agreed it was incorrect to describe somebody as a ' chair ' rather than a ' chairman ' or ' chairwoman ' . He added : ' I think it ' s one of the side effects of what we like to call political correctness . But I don ' t really see the need for it and we don ' t advocate using it . We think if a man ' s a chairman , he ' s a chairman . A woman ' s a chairwoman .
