Broncos coach Gary Kubiak has always found a way to run against Bill Belichick s Patriots . In 12 meetings since 2000 , Kubiak s teams have averaged 28 . 3 carries for 122 . 4 yards and scored 19 touchdowns . This season , running backs C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman combined for 29 carries for 172 yards and three scores in Week 12 . The Broncos absolutely need to run to give Manning help , and they ll run even when it s not working just to test the edge of the defensive front . With Dont a Hightower on the field in Week 12 , the Broncos averaged 2 . 9 yards over 15 carries and trailed 14 0 . After he was forced out , they had 15 carries , an 8 . 8 yard average and three touchdowns . That game turned when Hightower went down and the Broncos could run .
