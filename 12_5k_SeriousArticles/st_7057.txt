" We were watching the first episode where Cyrus starts the ' kill folder ' on Olivia , " the actress remembers . " We ' d all forgotten about it since the table read , and we all just lost our marbles . It was incredible . " She adds , " Cyrus can be so evil just when you think you were going to trust him ! I start to like the guy , and then he does something like that , and I ' m just like , ' You ' re dead forever now . . . , ' " then she laughs , " at least for another episode . "
