Much of this isn ' t even unique to conservatism . For most people politics is about personality , identity , and group loyalties . This is more like rooting for a sports team than support for particular ideas , ideology , or policy . It ' s always has been this way and probably always will be . Even plenty of deeply ideological people who marched in the streets during Bush ' s Iraq war made nary a peep when Obama bombed Libya lots of people on the other side would have soured on Iraq much sooner if the war had been ordered by President Hillary Clinton instead .
