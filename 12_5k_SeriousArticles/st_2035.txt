? ? Lost in the shuffle of that ridiculous ending in Cincinnati was the near miraculous touchdown catch made by Pittsburgh s Martavis Bryant in the third quarter . Given the tiny bit of real estate he had to work with , the somersault he had to execute to complete the play , and his ability to pin the ball against the back of his thigh , and then butt , I m giving Bryant higher marks for the difficulty of that grab than even Odell Beckham Jr . s one handed masterpiece last season .
