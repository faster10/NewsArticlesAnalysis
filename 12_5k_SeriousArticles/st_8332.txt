Marcus Thornton firing away and to get some serious revenge in a losing effort on Tuesday , scoring 32 points with six rebounds , three assists , three steals and five 3 pointers in 26 minutes . In the second half , he had a whopping 34 . 1 usage rate and an 80 . 3 true shooting percentage in 18 minutes . Thornton played just 11 minutes combined in his previous two , so we would obviously need to see it again . Although , he ll be in play tonight in DFS if Ariza is out .
