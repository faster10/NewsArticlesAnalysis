Think about how much would have been different . Alex Smith likely would have been traded then ( maybe even to the Broncos , who didn ' t appear to have much long term use for Tim Tebow ) , and not the following season after Colin Kaepernick beat him out . Heck , Kaepernick might have been more like Brock Osweiler ? forced to wait years before we saw his talent in action ? instead of a player who has risen to prominence and now since fallen from grace in such short order .
