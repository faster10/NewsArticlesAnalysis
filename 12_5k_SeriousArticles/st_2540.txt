I calculated the magnitude of this " rounding tax " after obtaining data on nearly 200 , 000 transactions from a multistate convenience store chain . The data reveal that the " rounding tax " is a myth . In reality , the number of times consumers ' bills would be rounded upward is almost exactly equal to the number of times that they would be rounded downward . It turns out rounding would have given customers in my study a tiny gain of about 1 cent per every 40 purchases .
