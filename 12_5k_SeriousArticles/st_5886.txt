So that ' s going on , and we have to integrate this new album , adapt it in this case , a little more adaptation , because it was a solo album . This is the first time this has ever happened , where he ' s touring with the E Street Band behind a solo album . But it ' s good , and we had the whole new album down in two days . Then you start kicking around ideas and doing older things . " My City of Ruins " ended up playing a major role in this show , really for the first time . It ' s always been an emotional song but sort of a specialty song , maybe an encore . This time it ended up playing a very , very different and central role .
