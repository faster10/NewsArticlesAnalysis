What is most frightening is that we have learned almost nothing from past mistakes . The leader of Jaish e Mohammad , Maulana Masood Azhar , was among the men we released in exchange for the passengers of IC 814 more than fifteen years ago . He was in Indian custody for five years before his release because the Indian justice system works at bullock cart pace . After his release he wrote a memoir filled with contempt for India before organising the attack on our Parliament . Why is he still a free man in Pakistan ? Where are the other terrorists who were released with him ? Why is Hafiz Saeed still wandering about spewing hatred against India at huge public rallies ? Is there any point in speaking to Pakistan s prime minister if he continues to be incapable of answering these questions ?
