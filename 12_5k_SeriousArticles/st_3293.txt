Instead it was proving hard for Defoe , who was already short of match fitness , having not played since October , to adapt to new team mates and a new system . He strayed offside because a ball was not played through to him quickly enough , he made a run down the side of the defence in anticipation of a pass from Fletcher that was delivered outside the defender rather than inside , so that Defoe found himself trying to deliver a cross from a difficult angle rather than a shot on goal from a more favourable position .
