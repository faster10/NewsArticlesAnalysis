Goalscorer Smith , making just his second appearance for the club , said : ' It ' s the best feeling ever . The ball just fell at my feet and I managed to lift it over the keeper . I actually thought Michael Paton was going to score before I did . My dad was in the crowd tonight but I haven ' t yet had a chance to speak to him . My mum was due to be here but she cancelled and she ' ll be gutted about that now ! '
