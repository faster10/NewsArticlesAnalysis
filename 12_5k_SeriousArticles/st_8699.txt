Kasich visited with the Tribune Editorial Board in late September . He is more conservative than the GOP hard liners want to admit . He ' s getting dogged for being too moderate , mostly because he approved the expansion of Obamacare in Ohio . But he is not as committed to reducing the federal debt as , say , Rand Paul or Ted Cruz . That makes GOP primary voters nervous . Nobody wants to install another big government Republican in the White House . Don ' t get me started on Medicare Part D .
