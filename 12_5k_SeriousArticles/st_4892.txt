Kerr : Having been through it in 1999 ( the last NBA lockout ) the end result was the players gave up more than the owners did and that ' s usually the way it works . You have 450 players versus 30 owners and the owners have other businesses , and generally speaking the owners are going to be able to weather the storm easier than the players are . That said , the owners are going to lose a lot of money in a lockout too . I think it ' s something that ' ll be resolved but usually the owners come out with the better end of the deal .
