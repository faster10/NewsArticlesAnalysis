The " real hero , " Zamudio said , was the man who grabbed the gunman first . " There was a gentleman who was wounded on top of the head , I think he got hit with a ricochet or something , ( a ) bullet grazed the top of his head , " but still he " initiated the contact " with the shooter . " Then other people were able to grab on and they were able to kind of contain him and pull him down . "
