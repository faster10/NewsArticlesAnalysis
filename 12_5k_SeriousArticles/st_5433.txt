The story was about his brother in law , a barber named Mark . As Valde told it , Mark was a small business owner who worked so hard that he didn t even take paid days off . But Mark was unable to afford health insurance until the Affordable Care Act became law . When it did , Mark bought insurance and then , when he started feeling ill , saw a physician who promptly diagnosed him with cancer with no hope for recovery . He died last year .
