The Panthers , as a run oriented team , take almost the opposite approach . Much of their passing game occurs out of heavier sets with multiple tight ends and backs aligned tight to the formation . From this , they feature seven man protections ( i . e . max protection ) , using No . 2 tight end Ed Dickson and either fullback Mike Tolbert or whoever is in at tailback ( Jonathan Stewart on base downs , occasionally Fozzy Whittaker on passing downs ) to block for Cam Newton .
