ALLYN : Well , right now , it ' s important to emphasize that the case is riddled with unknowns . Under questioning , Archer told investigators that he attacked in the name of Islam , but that connection shouldn ' t be overblown at this point in the investigation . Local reports are saying that his name was not immediately known to local imams . So the extent of even his religion is kind of sketchy right now . And it really speaks to a point underscored by Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney that the shooting shouldn ' t be seen as representative of Muslims or the faith of Islam . And again , no direct link to a terrorist organization has been established so far .
