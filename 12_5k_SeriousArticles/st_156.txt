Morgan s final credited script was my favorite ? X Files ? episode ever , Jose Chung s ? From Outer Space . The episode was dense with Morganishness : a fixation with storytelling and death , the Rashomon esque nature of truth and experience , the need for connection , pessimism about human nature offset by grace for it . In a Morgan episode , ? the truth that s out there to find or create is meaning that may or may not exist . Jose Chung s wasn t technically a mythology episode , but it was a comic comment on ? X Files ? mythology ? in a heady , heartfelt story about our need for mythology .
