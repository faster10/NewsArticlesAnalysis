" Four American tours in a row were either never started or never finished ( with Oasis ) and we were subtitled on television because of our accents . . . basically people couldn ' t understand a word we were saying . We also didn ' t have a front man like Bono or Chris Martin , we had a different kind of front man who was like Johnny Rotten , but I don ' t think anybody . . . would look back at it with regret , we did what we did on our own terms .
