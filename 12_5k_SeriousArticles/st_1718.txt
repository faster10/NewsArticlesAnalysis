The Panthers remind me a lot of the Seahawks two years ago : An extremely confident team not afraid of the big moment that jumps on teams early and can score quickly and in bunches and can score on defense . The Broncos have been known to stink it up and ruin Super Bowls : They lead the NFL with five Super Bowl losses and their last four losses to the Giants , Washington , 49ers and Seahawks were by a combined 179 48 ? an average score of 45 12 ? with no game closer than 19 points .
