Rubio and Cruz have a lot in common . They re both first term senators from the south , they re both 44 years old and they re both Cuban American . They also have similar policy positions on several issues like Obamacare ( repeal it ) , raising the federal minimum wage ( against it ) and normalizing relations with communist Cuba ( no way ) . In fact , Rubio even told NBC News ? on Thursday ? that the two share almost all the same views on the issues .
