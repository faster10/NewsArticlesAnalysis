" I am very attracted to colors , because I think it really lifts our spirit . It flatters a woman . Even if you ' re wearing a dark suit , it ' s important to have color to lift up mood . I try to take into consideration women ' s needs , and it has to be low maintenance and still fulfill an element of beauty and longevity . I think wardrobe is an investment , and the pieces that I create have that quality and workmanship that is timeless . "
