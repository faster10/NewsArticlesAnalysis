Fury starts with an orthodox start , eschewing the southpaw style many expected . Klitschko wants to finish this quickly it seems , driving the Mancunian back and looking for the jab . Fury is watchful though and very quick , alert to any opportunity to land his own jabs with that extra four inches or so of reach . Four times they come together and are immediately separated by the referee . Fury is is on the run , but he ' s the only one who ' s managed to land any jabs with his right . He raises his arms at the end of the round and it ' s hard to disagree that he took that round .
