After losing two bids , I finally found the apartment I would buy . Moser , the ultimate real estate matchmaker , found me the right space at a decent price . It wasn ' t love at first sight . ( The ' 80s decor was nearly enough to kill all desire . ) And it was not the prewar building I had pined for . But it was a good deal and with a little luck , everything fell into place . My bid was accepted . Contract signed .
