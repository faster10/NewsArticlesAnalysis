AQAP is regarded as one of the most active and dangerous of al Qaeda franchises . It has tried to launch several attacks on the U . S . homeland . On Christmas Day 2009 , a Nigerian recruited by the group attempted to blow up a plane flying into Detroit but failed because his device malfunctioned . The following October the group attempted to blow up planes heading to the United States with printer bombs disguised as air cargo . The packages were intercepted after a tip from Saudi intelligence . And in April 2012 , a British informant working for Saudi counterterrorism thwarted a new plot by the group to bomb a U . S bound airliner . The informant had infiltrated the group and was selected by them to launch the attack .
