Being " One Unknown " also told me that on that morning Jermaine Lindsay didn ' t set out to kill or maim me , Gill Hicks . He didn ' t know me , he didn ' t know what I thought or what I felt : to him I was conveniently placed in a group called " Them " as opposed to " Us . " I ' ve often thought , what if we had the chance to talk before he detonated his bomb ? I wasn ' t given a choice , I wasn ' t offered a chance to " defend " my life instead he presumed that I was his enemy .
