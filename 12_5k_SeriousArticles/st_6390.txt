The recent violence reached new heights with the suicide bombs that ripped through the Ankara peace march of 10 October . The government had taken few measures to protect the marchers what security personnel were on hand contented themselves with teargassing the survivors . Since then it has emerged that the families of the two men accused of the Ankara bombing ( one of whom was the brother of the Suru ? bomber ) had alerted the authorities to the fact that their relatives had joined Isis . Despite being officially pursued by police , the bombers were able to travel hundreds of kilometres to Ankara before breakfasting in a cafe and going by taxi to the station .
