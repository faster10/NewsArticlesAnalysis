We have been though at least a couple of generations together , for many of you your children , like mine , now have children of their own . And your support for Children In Need has been consistent and magnificent . You ' ve baked the bakes , you ' ve held the quizzes , you ' ve sold the calendars , you ' ve packed the CDs and the DVDs .
