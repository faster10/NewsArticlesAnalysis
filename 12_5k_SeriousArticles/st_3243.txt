Game ball : It wasn t always pretty Thursday night , but Stafford did what he needed to . He threw two first quarter touchdown passes and then made a crucial pass to TJ Jones late in the fourth quarter to get the Lions a first down they desperately needed , although in the end it didn t matter . Stafford has been a consistent quarterback the past month and a big reason for Detroit s turnaround . He finished 23 of 35 for 220 yards and two touchdowns , with no interceptions .
