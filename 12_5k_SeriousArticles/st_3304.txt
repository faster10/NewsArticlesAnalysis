April 2008 The global Olympic torch rally for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics begins but becomes a flashpoint for protests one month after the unrest in the Tibetan Autonomous Region . Thousands protested on the streets of San Francisco , and the unruly scene of the London leg of the torch run was labeled " a public relations nightmare " by the Times . " We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France , " a China spokeswoman said at the time . Meanwhile in Tibet , 30 people were convicted of arson , robbery and attacking government offices related to the March violence and receive prison sentences ranging from three years to life .
