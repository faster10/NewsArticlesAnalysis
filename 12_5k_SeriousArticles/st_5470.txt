He s peaking right now , Davis said . I think always in November and December , you ve seen him be at his best . It looks like he s in great shape . They are feeding him the ball a lot . He s being Shady . He s making the cuts and stopping on a dime and changing directions and making plays when they aren t there . We are going to have our hands full and we look forward to the challenge . We know he s going to be at his absolute best .
