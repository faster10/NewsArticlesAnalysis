One of the best aspects of Acorn . TV s programming is it lets you be an armchair traveler , visiting New Zealand with THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES SERIES 2 , Scotland with the terrific REBUS police procedurals from the Ian Rankin international bestsellers , or Australia with the addictive PRISONERS WIVES . ? Now with 19 2 SEASON 1 ( begins Monday , 18 January , with the first two episodes , followed by new episodes every Monday thru 18 March ) the hit Montreal police series 19 2 is available in this English language version . ? Where the original French language series , a huge domestic hit in French speaking Canada , featured two white cops , this version boasts interracial partners in that squad car who have a really troubled relationship . ? Nick Barron ( Adrian Holmes ? of ? ARROW ) , a difficult guy by any standards , has a marriage on the rocks ? he and his wife live separately and argue constantly over their sole son s custody ? while not coping too successfully with guilt over his previous partner s near fatal head injury that has made him a wheelchair bound relic in a nursing home . ? The newbie , handsome ? Ben Chartier ( square jawed Jared Keeso ) , may have spent 8 years in the sticks but for the Montreal cops he s a rookie ? and he resents it . ? His new partner doesn t trust him and , what s worse , his capture of a serial thief has led to a departmental investigation and tabloid coverage accusing the police of over reacting . ? We know Chartier was by the books and the thief is a vicious slimebucket but that doesn t stop the investigation . ? Keeso won a Best Actor Canadian Screen Award for his work here . ? And hey , it s a chance to tour Montreal ? without leaving that cozy armchair . ? ?
