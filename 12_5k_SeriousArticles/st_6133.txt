They disagreed with nonpartisan analyses that showed their tax plans losing trillions even when those scores were produced using the GOP preferred dynamic scoring techniques . They supported plans that will increase the U . S . debt but complained bitterly about raising the federal debt ceiling to accommodate those plans . "
