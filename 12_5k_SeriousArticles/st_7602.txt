I am sceptical when I hear figures for so called confirmed kills for British snipers , such as the 173 reported last week for a Royal Marine . How can they be sure ? People don ' t normally die straight away when you shoot them . It is also hard to tell from long range . The idea of sniping is that you fire from far enough away that you don ' t have to go down there and check . Killing more people doesn ' t make you a better soldier either .
