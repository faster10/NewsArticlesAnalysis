This will to dominate is what the more personal mass shootings have in common with the more impersonal ones that tend to get national news coverage . The goals are just smaller . Whereas a more typical shooter might ? shoot up his ex wife and her co workers to punish her for not wanting to be with him , more ambitious shooters like Elliot Rodger ? will rampage among strangers to punish women , collectively , for the same thing . Or perhaps an average shooter will unleash at a party because he thinks someone disrespected him , but your more grandiose types , modeling themselves on the Columbine killers , want to kill the world for not giving them the deference they feel due .
