INDIA NOT INTERESTED TO PLAY PAKISTAN : MIANDAD : Pakistan ' s former Test captain and great Javed Miandad Thursday said he had no doubt that neither the Indian government nor Indian Cricket board were interested in playing Pakistan . " They are just using delaying tactics . How can any country tell a host country where it should host its matches ? I don ' t see any benefit for us if we agree to play a hurriedly arranged series , we need to realise that the self respect of Pakistan cricket is paramount above every other consideration . "
