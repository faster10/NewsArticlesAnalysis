So , I m just frustrated with it . We shouldn t have to be punished for that . Every game , you know , calls after calls should have been made in our favor , but it goes to them . And , it s just not right . We are in the league , too . We re National Football League players . We got a team , too . We go out there and we sweat and we work hard , too . I don t give a crap about the name . We are players and we got feelings , too , and we want to win , too .
