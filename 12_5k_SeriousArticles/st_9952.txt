It looks like President Obama is poised to redouble U . S . efforts to support Syrian opposition forces fighting ISIS , the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad , as well as the al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front . Obama proposed an additional 500 million of assistance in June , and any strategy to deal with ISIS in Syria is going to need some forces on the ground willing to work as part of an expanded campaign there . The key question the administration will need to answer is whether it has learned from the past few years of failed efforts to strengthen the Syrian opposition multiple actors in the region have offered many forms of assistance to different factions of the Syrian opposition , and yet it is today weak and beleaguered . Additional money and weapons might help , but could also be squandered without a broader coordination strategy .
