Gwyneth Paltrow alert . Lady Goop sings ( a bit ) on this track , mainly because it seems to be all about her and Chris Martin having the world s most amicable divorce . She provides strategic backing vocals when he sings we swore on that night we d be friends til we died and he seems to call her everything from a goddess to a diamond and celestial . As ballads go , it s lovely and all but certainly not up with their finest work . It ends with Martin singing So if you love someone you should let them know , the light you left me will everglow .
