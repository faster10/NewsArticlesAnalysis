" He ' s under a lot of pressure , but he ' s handled it with grace , " Sam said . " He ' s doing the right thing . Sometimes doing the right thing , people don ' t like when you ' re doing the right thing , and that ' s really sad . He ' d do it again , too . Because that ' s who he is . That ' s the type of man I play for . A man who cares about his athletes and cares about you as an individual . "
