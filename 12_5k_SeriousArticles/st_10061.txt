Many Republican leaders are terrified of Trump . Rove predicted that if Trump were to win the nomination , the GOP will lose the White House and the Senate , and its majority in the House will fall dramatically . There s evidence to support this concern . A poll taken for the National Republican Congressional Committee reportedly found that if the GOP were to nominate Trump , a 48 percent plurality of respondents would be less likely to vote for a Republican congressional candidate . In Arizona , a survey found that with Trump atop the ballot , 30 percent of high efficacy Republicans would be less motivated to vote , and 20 percent would be less inclined to vote for down ballot Republican candidates .
