At this point , about 100 days before the New Hampshire primary , the race for the Republican nomination is still on the front nine . New Hampshire voters are notoriously slow in making up their minds , and there is some evidence that the process is even more glacial this electoral cycle due to the large number of candidates camped out in the Granite State . It remains to be seen whether Christie can pull off the political equivalent of a hole in one . But I , for one , hope he stays in the race for the duration , if for no other reason than to watch him take that uniquely Christie golf swing . Cue the driver !
