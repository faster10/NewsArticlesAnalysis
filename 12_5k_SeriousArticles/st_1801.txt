Despite the popularity of anal sex , male questions about its role in their lives still frequently come up in advice forums , which is another reason why we need to fight back against the idea that there s something shameful or problematic about anal play . For instance , in 2013 , a Reddit user asked , I am a straight guy , but I was introduced to anal toys such as beads and butt plugs by my gf ( now ex gf ) . Is it strange that I actually enjoy that kind of stuff ?
