That ' s when Nintendo started coming in . I loved Duck Hunt . Do you remember Gyromite ? What was that all about ? And then Zelda came out . That ' s when I was like it ' s all about video games . Zelda . Did you save the princess yet ? Did you get the fairy ? Where ' s the fairies at ? Wow , that was like the dopest .
