OSU has tinkered with its starting lineup over the past three games but appears to have found a consistent group with Gary Payton II , Malcolm Duvivier , Tres Tinkle , Olaf Schaftenaar and Drew Eubanks . Payton , a senior guard who is in contention for Pac 12 Player of the Year , has been stellar during league play . He is averaging 18 . 6 points , 8 . 7 rebounds , 5 . 9 assists and 2 . 3 steals in seven games while shooting 47 . 6 percent from the field .
