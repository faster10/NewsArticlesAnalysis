That said , the response in Pakistan of many quarters is equally disturbing . The conspiracy theory spin mill went into full swing spreading denial . On social media one sees many posts by reasonably educated and sane people portraying the incidents as false or some western conspiracy to malign Muslims . When Tashfeen Malik s ( one of the San Bernardino attackers ) Pakistani roots were discovered , they first went into full swing denying she had a Pakistan ID card . The National Database and Regulation Authority s ( NADRA s ) records indicated that the spin had to change . It is indicative of a broader delusional mindset to be in denial of the problems brewing at home . One does not need to dig deep to figure out how the unchecked religious preaching environment is radicalising the youth here . Go to a mosque and hear the Friday or early morning sermons and you will hear the radicalised message , not only against the west but also against other sects , often . Many a teacher at school and Islamic Studies professors at colleges and universities indulge in talk that borders on radicalisation . And then there are lecture circuits , of mostly the educated and well off , where the discussion turns to elements that are radical and xenophobic . Not only that but patronisation of such ideologies by the state s organs is widespread thanks to the penetration of like minded elements into various segments of the state machinery .
