After sitting down across from the actor , Sandoval described reading " messages ( that were ) mostly negative , some positive , declaring LaBeouf either a ' baby , ' an ' idiot , ' or a ' genius . ' Things about having to ' move on , ' or suggestions of ' death . ' They felt like tweets they probably were tweets . I read about thirteen notes in measured tones , opting out of the ones that were too harsh or too praiseworthy I thought about reading the whole bowl , but then got self conscious saying so many hurtful things to LaBeouf , who in that moment , just seemed like a mixed up kid . ( Frankly , I hope no one whips him , or worse , spritzes him with cologne . ) "
