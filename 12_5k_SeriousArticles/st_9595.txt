While it was trying to curry favour with the US led coalition by coalescing with it on IS , it was making it clear that the Kurds would not be allowed to use their frontline role against IS to advance their Kurdish autonomy separation agenda . And , at home , the electoral respectability of the predominantly Kurdish HDP party was a worry as reflected in the June election . There is , therefore , a concerted attempt to tar the moderate HDP with the militant PKK brush . The bombing raids and round ups of Kurds inside Turkey look like an attempt to create a security threat scenario for the Turkish state from inside and outside the country . Even though it is generally accepted that the blasts at the Ankara peace rally were the work of IS , President Erdogan seemed more inclined to blame all violence on the PKK . He reportedly said after the blasts in Ankara , The terrorist attack targeting civilian citizens today at the Ankara station is no different at all from the previous attacks in various locations against our soldiers , our police , our village guards , public servants and innocent citizens . There is thus an attempt to blame the Kurds and the PKK for all the killings and security problems in Turkey to create a siege mentality , with the ruling AKP party seen as the only alternative to crush Kurdish violence . If this narrative were to take hold , the AKP has the hope of winning the parliamentary elections . There is thus a concerted campaign to somehow mix up the HDP and PKK as one and the same .
