Hanover , N . H . ? It is hard to remember , but four years ago many Republicans ( and pundits ) , concerned about what they viewed as Mitt Romney s lackluster candidacy and a generally weak Republican field , were ? imploring New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie to enter ? their party s presidential race . Governor Christie demurred , claiming that he was not yet ready for a presidential run . As late as November 2013 , however , ? polls still showed him leading the field ? of prospective 2016 Republican candidates . Now that Christie has thrown his hat in the ring , however , it s not clear that voters are ready for him . Despite what many observers saw as a strong performance in the last Republican debate , Christie continues to lag in national polls , and last week Fox News announced that he had been relegated to the kiddie debate table , along with Rick Santorum , Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee , for the next Republican debate night .
