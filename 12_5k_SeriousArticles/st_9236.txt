The savviest musicians here flip Dylan ' s messages for their own aims , just as Dylan reappropriated protest songs by civil rights heroes . Celtic rock stalwarts Flogging Molly take on ' ' The Times They Are A Changin ' ' ' which itself was inspired by Irish drinking songs and reclaim it for Dublin . Sin ad O ' Connor recasts 1981 ' s born again ' ' Property of Jesus ' ' as a fiery church reform anthem . And Carly Simon smartly plays ' ' Just Like a Woman ' ' as a feminist ballad . When she sings ' ' You break just like a little girl , ' ' it sounds like she ' s telling Dylan to man up .
