Peter King mentioned earlier this week that it s not out of the question for every road team to win the wild card round . That being said , the Packers last three games and the Redskins last three games tell completely different stories . Something s obviously not right with the Packers right now , and on the road , they won t be able to stand up to the current momentum in Washington , led by Kirk Cousins . In the preseason , I had the Eagles ( as the No . 1 seed ) winning it all against the Patriots ? obviously that didn t pan out , but I still think the NFC s No . 1 seed will defeat the Patriots in Santa Clara . Carolina s MVP QB and underrated receivers will get revenge for their loss in Super Bowl XXXVIII .
