According to a blog post , Ibrabo claimed : ' Taylor isn ' t the first jihadist to broadcast his whereabouts via social media and in fact looking at the battlefield in Syria we see fighters from Canada , France , and other western countries making the same mistake . The benefit of material like this when examining foreign fighters is it allows investigators to establish the extent to which an individual is tied to a terrorist group like Daesh ( ISIS ) . In this manner they can better justify potential criminal charges against the individual and at the very least build grounds for their detention and investigation upon their return . '
