So the Tardios did what many parents across the country do : They made up their own rules , inside their own home , when it came to alcohol consumption and their underage children . As a mother of a 10 year old daughter and a 12 year old son , I ' ve often wondered if it ' s OK to give my children a sip of wine at dinner . Would I be sending an irresponsible message , or demystifying alcohol and thereby weakening its allure later on ?
