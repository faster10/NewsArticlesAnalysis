Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo practiced for the first time since fracturing his left collarbone in Week 2 , and he is expected to start Sunday s game against the Dolphins . Coach Jason Garrett said the Cowboys don t need for him to be Superman , and Romo said he won t try . Usually you just do your job , if you do it well enough , that will take care of the things that come with this game , Romo said . For me , it s about going out and being yourself . Dallas hasn t won since Romo was injured , sitting last in the NFC East at 2 7 . ? . ? . The Eagles could be without three key offensive players when they host the Buccaneers on Sunday . Quarterback Sam Bradford and running back Ryan Mathews , who suffered concussions last week , and left tackle Jason Peters ( back ) missed practice . ? . ? . Cardinals left guard Mike Iupati practiced on a limited basis just four days after he was taken off the field in Seattle in an ambulance . Iupati was injured during a violent collision with the Seahawks Kam Chancellor . It was scary , Iupati said . When your neck hurts and both of your arms go numb , it s a scary feeling . The 6 foot 5 inch , 331 pound lineman said he should be OK for the Cardinals game Sunday night against the Bengals . ? . ? . The Texans claimed quarterback Brandon Weeden off waivers with Brian Hoyer questionable for Sunday s game against the Jets because of a concussion . Weeden was released by the Cowboys on Tuesday because of Romo s return . ? . ? . The Lions named Rod Wood their new president . He ll oversee the business side of the organization and report directly to owner Martha Firestone Ford .
