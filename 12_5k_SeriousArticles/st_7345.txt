Clinton did learn her lesson in 2008 , and has invested heavily in her Iowa ground game . She ' s not going to get out organized again , to put this another way . Bernie has put together his own Iowa team and they feel confident they ' ll be up to the task , but Clinton began a lot earlier and probably has a slight advantage in this department . So far the polling is about as even as can be Hillary showed a bump a few weeks back , and now Bernie seems to be getting a bump . This means it ' s almost impossible to tell which direction the last minute movement will take . Since Bernie ' s currently up , he currently has the advantage here but that could change very quickly . Bernie is now focusing on making the " electability " argument , which he can do because of the head to head polling showing him to be the stronger Democratic candidate against either Trump or Cruz . This could change too , but it likely won ' t in one week ' s time .
