DELANEY DOWNER The HuffPost Politics podcast had two people named Murphy today . One is Sen . Chris Murphy ( D Conn . ) . The other is Becky Murphy of Summit Lake , Wisc . , who doesn ' t want to get kicked off food stamps like a million other Americans will this year , so she ' s doing her homework . " Every week I have to meet with a caseworker , which requires driving about 18 miles to the nearest town , and I have to show him my ' activity report form , ' " Murphy said . The activity report form is for Wisconsin food stamp recipients who are able bodied adults without dependents . Thanks to a federal policy change taking effect across the country , unemployed people who don ' t have kids in most states will no longer be allowed to have more than three months of nutrition assistance without working at least 20 hours a week .
