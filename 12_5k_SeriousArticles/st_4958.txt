( Budget Travel ) I ' ve never been a fan of the cold . As a kid , my favorite part of skiing was the hot chocolate , and I relished blizzards for the snow days , not the snowball fights . So when I booked a trip to the Icehotel in northern Sweden , my family and friends were amused and a bit concerned , especially when I got sick days before my flight . " You can ' t go to the Arctic with a cold ! " my mother admonished .
