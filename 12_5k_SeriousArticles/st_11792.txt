Using Reagan ' s approach would be a win win for taxpayers . President Obama ' s own deficit reduction commission , on which I served the Simpson Bowles commission followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code . The commission recommended lowering individual rates to 8 , 14 , 23 and corporate rates to 26 . I would push rates even lower , but the commission report , which was supported by conservatives and liberals , showed that it is possible to lower rates , stimulate growth , generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit .
