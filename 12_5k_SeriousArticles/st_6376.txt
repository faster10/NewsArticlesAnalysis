As the young men and women who make up military units , we know that we will usually share war ' s experiences . I know that when my toes are cold in the high Afghan desert , so are everyone else ' s . When I am hungry because the supply convoys have been attacked by the enemy , so is everyone else . And when I am scared , and the possibility of death becomes very real as the bullets and shrapnel rip through the air around us , I know that everyone else is scared , too .
