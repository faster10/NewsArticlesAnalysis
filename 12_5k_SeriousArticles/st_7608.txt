I had the pleasure of seeing Alan Rickman on stage on a few occasions , the first time being in Private Lives . After seeing his captivating performance as Snape in the first Harry Potter film , and watching every single movie with him that was available , I also met him at the Berlinale in 2006 where he was promoting the movie Snow Cake . Me and handful of other admirers met him at the cinema of the Sony Centre in Berlin . Despite it being a cold February evening Alan greeted all of us cheerfully . He was particularly taken aback by two very young german girls and their mother . They were over the moon once Alan showed up and he scolded them with a lot of humor , telling them they shouldn t be up at this hour . Alan was incredibly sweet and patient with them . Eventually they asked for an autograph and Alan bowed down , looked each of them in the eye , while asking , with a very gentle voice : Wie hei ? en Sie ? He took his time with every single person present since he knew we had waited in the bone chilling cold . I shall never forget what a patient and gentle soul he was .
