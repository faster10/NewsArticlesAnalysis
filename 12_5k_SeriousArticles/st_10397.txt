NOTED : RACIALLY TINGED BATTLE ERUPTS OVER NEW SANDERS ADS . The Sanders and Clinton campaigns spent Thursday night in a knock down war of words that started when Bernie Sanders released a new television ad earlier in the day . The powerful ad is set to the music of Simon and Garfunkel s " America " and showcases crowds of supporters across the country coming to see the Vermont Senator . David Brock , a top Clinton ally and head of a pro Clinton super PAC , told the Associated Press that " from this ad it seems black lives don ' t matter much to Bernie Sanders . " It s bad enough that Hillary Clinton is raising millions in special interest money in her super PACS . It is worse that she would hire a mudslinger like David Brock . She should be ashamed of her association with Brock , Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said in a statement , ABC s MARYALICE PARKS reports .
