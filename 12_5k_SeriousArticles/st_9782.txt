Tomorrow , the religious radio slot Thought for the Day will feature a vicar from Guildford saying I often find myself singing along to the venerable tune Rebel Rebel . But as I somewhat tunelessly belt out the words Hot tramp , I love you so , I think to myself Isn t this a bit like Jesus ? Because after Jesus had been in the wilderness for a while , he must have looked a bit of a tramp . And it was certainly hot out there . So I think Mr Bowie was asking us all to love Jesus . Good morning .
