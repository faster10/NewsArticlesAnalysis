Following criticism that the Democratic Party had limited debates to help Clinton , New Hampshire ' s largest newspaper and MSNBC said Tuesday they would host an additional debate next week just before the first in the nation primary . But the Democratic National Committee chairwoman said the party had " no plans " to sanction more debates , and Clinton ' s campaign said she ' d only participate if the other candidates agree . So far , only Martin O ' Malley has said he ' ll participate .
