When it came to foreign policy , Christie generally took a much more hardline approach than on domestic affairs . When asked how he would deal with the Syrian war , he recommended imposing a no fly zone . Someone asked me what I would do if the Russians violated it . I would shoot them down . They would have been warned , he noted . Later , when asked about how to deal with the Syrian refugee problem he argued that it was caused in part by Obama s failure to keep his word . He drew a red line against the use of chemical weapons , then did nothing when Assad crossed it . Christie called for greater international support , including from the US , to help settle refugees , but at the same time he opposed allowing them into the US due to security concerns . When pressed by a college student why we would expect US military involvement in Syria to turn out any better than when the US intervened in Iraq , some of the famous Christie bluster appeared . What would you do ? he shot back . Would you let Assad stay in power to murder a quarter million of his people ? The US s responsibility , he insisted , was to empower the Syrian people to prevent genocide as well as the imposition of an Islamic state . In a line that received perhaps the greatest applause of the event , Christie noted somewhat acidly that , We can talk about American imperialism which is a nice college word but reality is more nuanced .
