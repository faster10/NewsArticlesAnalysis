" UNHCR is extremely concerned about the dangers for anyone trying to flee across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden , where there are no search and rescue operations , " the agency said in a statement . " Last year , 246 lives were reported lost in sea crossings to Yemen . UNHCR appeals to all ships in the area to be extra vigilant and assist any boats in distress . We also ask that countries with vessels in waters near Yemen including surveillance and anti piracy vessels instruct their ships to help with rescues . "
