As a former drug and alcohol abuser ( clean and sober for more than 26 years ) , I know something about the work that goes into transforming a life . One of the first things I learned in Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous was that alcoholism and drug addiction are not excuses for injuring yourself or others . Part of recovery is making a list of people you ' ve harmed , making amends to them personally and accepting the consequences of your past actions . I didn ' t make an announcement to the world and I still don ' t think I have all the answers , but I came out of it knowing a lot more .
