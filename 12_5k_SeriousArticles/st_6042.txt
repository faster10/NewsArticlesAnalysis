Let s put this in human language : Donald Trump doesn t prop up two publications that have always been reliant on wealthy donors to create the illusion of not being a complete failure in the marketplace . He doesn t lend his name to the marquee of annual merch and huckster conventions that charge true believers stupid sums to get the opportunity to buy a copy of Marco Rubio s book before asking for his autograph . He doesn t pay ghostwriters like my dad for hundreds of op eds !
