? In 2014 , the Packers seemed to have the NFC championship game wrapped up . Safety Morgan Burnett , for some reason , gave himself up and slid down after an interception with about five minutes left . The Seahawks ended up scoring and getting an onside kick when Brandon Bostick muffed it . Seattle drove to take the lead after recovering that onside kick . The Packers tied it at the end of regulation , but eventually lost in overtime on a deep touchdown pass to Jermaine Kearse .
