" Even when I do really big pieces , I do them strips by strips so you have to paste , you have to involve people . It ' s a whole process . And I like that . For me , that ' s where the artwork is . But I use technology more and more , because that ' s a great way to share , that ' s a great way to be in touch with people . It ' s just a great way to do something and spread it to millions of people through the Internet . "
