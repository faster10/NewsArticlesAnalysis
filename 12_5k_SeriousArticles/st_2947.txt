Reggie OK : There was some hope Reggie Jackson would be considered by East coaches to play in the NBA All Star Game , but that all for naught when the reserves were released Thursday . Andre Drummond was selected , the first Pistons player since Allen Iverson in 2009 , while the Miami Heat ( Dwyane Wade , Chris Bosh ) and Toronto Raptors ( Chris Paul , DeMar DeRozan ) were the only teams with two players in . " I talked to him ( Friday ) morning , just to see how he was , " Van Gundy said . " He was fine . He didn ' t expect to make it . " Van Gundy said Jackson , who ' s averaging 19 . 2 points and 6 . 5 assists per game , has a reason to be disappointed but the guard heavy East made it difficult . " I think Jeff Teague has a reason to be disappointed , I think Kemba Walker has reason to be disappointed , " Van Gundy said . " Kyrie ( Irving ) would have made it had he been healthy the whole time . "
