As historian Nell Irvin Painter wrote in her 2010 book , A History of White People , while much of our nation s historical interest in race has centered on black and white , there has always been a debate about the terms of whiteness itself . Rather than a single , enduring definition of whiteness , Painter writes , we find multiple enlargements occurring against a backdrop of black white dichotomy . These enlargements include the gradual , often contested , inclusion of Irish , Italian and other non Anglo Saxon Europeans into the fold of white America .
