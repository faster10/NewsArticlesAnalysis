What s different this season ? The Wolves drafted 6 11 , 250 pound Karl Anthony Towns from Kentucky with the first overall pick . He s 19 years old and his monstrous upside suggests that he ll have a bright future in the league . They also signed Nemanja Bjelica from Serbia , the Euroleague MVP from last season . He has yet to play a game in the NBA , but his 11 . 9 points and 8 . 6 rebounds are an encouraging sign for Minnesota . Sam Mitchell had taken over the coaching duties while Saunders was in the hospital , and will continue to coach the team this season .
