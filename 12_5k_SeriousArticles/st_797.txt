You have to realize that people are always going to be confused or sometimes threatened by someone who has the confidence to do something different . It takes a lot of confidence to go natural , especially if you ' ve never gone natural . You don ' t know how to style it and you ' re struggling with what you ' re doing . I think a lot of times people see that and go " Wow . She ' s a lot stronger than I am , " and that intimidates them or makes them uncomfortable .
