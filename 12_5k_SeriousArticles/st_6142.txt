I don ' t like feeling stuck in a particular operating system , social network or piece of software . It ' s not that I won ' t commit to a product or company it ' s that I don ' t trust any of them enough to get married to one of them . Once they own me , they ' ll start either selling my data to other companies , limiting my Web experiences to the ones that help sell their clients ' products or otherwise screwing with me as a consumer and person .
