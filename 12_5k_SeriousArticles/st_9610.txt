Winston Churchill once said of the United States that " You can always count on Americans to do the right thing , after they have tried everything else . " While I share his conclusion , we need not confirm his pessimism . We do not have to destroy our social fabric before we find out that Islamophobia is wrong . To my fellow Americans who are Muslim , I pledge that I will be guided by love for you as human beings and by hope not fear . To all Americans , please join in this pledge . As Martin Luther King , Jr . put it , " We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of destiny . " What we weave for our future , we must weave together . I know that the only thing that can truly rend that garment is ourselves .
