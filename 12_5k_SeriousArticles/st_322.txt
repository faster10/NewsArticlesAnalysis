And I ' ve felt relief as well that people are registering Patsey ' s loftiness in praising me I feel like her spirit is being uplifted , really , because what I met in those pages of Solomon Northup ' s book was heartbreaking and it still breaks my heart and inspiring , and I had the privilege of bringing her back to life . I ' m just happy and filled with gratitude to have had the experience in the first place and for it to be so well received .
