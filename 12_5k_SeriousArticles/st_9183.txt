Jackie reported her rape , plus two other similar gang rapes she learned about at the same Phi Kappa Psi fraternity , to Dean Nicole Eramo , head of UVA ' s Sexual Misconduct Board . Eramo told Jackie she could file a report with the police and that the university would support her if she did so , though the university did not exactly encourage her to report the crime . Jackie still has not filed a criminal or civil suit . It was not until Rolling Stone started poking around and asking questions about the rape allegations that the university began to investigate the matter .
