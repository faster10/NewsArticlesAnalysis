FABER : IT ' S INTERESTING YOU BRING THAT UP . THAT ' S A KEY CONSIDERATION NOT TO GET TOO IN THE WEEDS , BUT IF YOU PROCEED WITH IT BEING TAXABLE , THEN OTHER COMPANIES COULD CONTACT YOU . THEY WOULD NOT IN ANY WAY INTERFERE WITH IT . WHEREAS IF YOU PROCEED AS IT BEING NON TAXABLE OR HOPE TO , IT SEEMS TO PRECLUDE YOUR ABILITY TO TALK TO POTENTIAL BUYERS FOR THE BUSINESS . IS THAT GOING TO BE PART OF HOW YOU THINK ABOUT GOING ABOUT TO DO THIS ? WHETHER OR NOT YOU MAY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THOSE WHO MIGH WANT TO BUY YAHOO !
