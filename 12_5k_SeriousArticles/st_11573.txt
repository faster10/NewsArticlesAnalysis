" It ' s a little bit of a chicken and an egg , " Higley said . " People don ' t want to be the pioneers , if you will , to go in where there ' s no supporting infrastructure . So if you ' re a family and you ' re told the place is clean , but there ' s no school open , are you going to move your family back into that area ? How are you going to encourage them to come back so that you really do have a functioning town again ? "
