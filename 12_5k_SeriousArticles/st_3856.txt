I thought maybe he d take me back for Sunday s 49ers game , for old times sake , said the knee brace , doing his best Tessio from the end of The Godfather ? incidentally , the Rams Twitter has taken to calling Gurley The Toddfather ( jury is still out on that nickname , though I suppose it s as adequate as my suggestion , Go Go Gadget Gurley . ) . It s not like Todd suffered with me on his knee . I was there for the Arizona game , the Green Bay game . But no . He s moving on . I thought about trying to make him jealous , telling him that Adrian Peterson had reached out to me . But I have too much pride . I m not some wrist guard .
