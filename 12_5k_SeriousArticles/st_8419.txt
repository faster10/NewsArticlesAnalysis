AFTER SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING , CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS DOUBLE DOWN ON GUN CONTROL MEASURES . Democrats in Congress are insisting that Wednesday ' s deadly shooting in San Bernardino , California , is a turning point in the gun control debate . " I think we are reaching a tipping point , " Sen . Chuck Schumer told a group of reporters as he and fellow top Democrats announced they ' d be forcing votes on two gun amendments attached to an Obamacare repeal bill Thursday afternoon . " What gives us the right to have moments of silence when we do nothing to act upon the causes of grief ? " House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi added . Two suspects in the San Bernardino shooting , Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik , opened fire at a social services center late Wednesday morning , killing 14 and injuring 17 . According to ABC ' s ALI WEINBERG , Schumer and Pelosi ' s comments are nearly identical to what they both said months earlier , after previous mass shooting events . But Democrats ' efforts to pass gun control measures still face deep opposition from Republicans in Congress . http : abcn . ws 1Q3wVzJ
