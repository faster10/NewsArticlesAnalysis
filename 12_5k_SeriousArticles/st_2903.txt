I know there is an overall point about the young guys being focused enough to follow the game plan , but what is the point of answering a question about Russell with something Clarkson did incorrectly ? Yes , Russell eventually got lumped in there as well for making the same mistake of going under the screen against Lillard , which is just asking to be lit up on the court . However , the idea that young guys are getting too comfortable under Scott ' s " tutelage " right now seems laughable .
