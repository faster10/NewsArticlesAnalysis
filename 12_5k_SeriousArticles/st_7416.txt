Arnold : In second grade , I was getting bullied a lot for my tics . A lot of my friends got bullied , too . When my mom made the decision to pull me out of that school , I felt like I was leaving behind all the kids that were being bullied , too . I figured if that was just my little second grade class being bullied , what about the whole world ? So I went to my mom and we made Jaylen ' s Challenge . We talk about Tourette syndrome , how bullying isn ' t good , and how you can prevent bullying .
