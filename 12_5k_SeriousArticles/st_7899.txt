Hillary Clinton seems to be a natural debater . Whether this is true or not ( how " authentic " this read may be , in other words ) , she certainly seemed in her element during both the last debate as well as during her 11 hours of questioning by the Benghazi committee . Up until this point in the campaign , Clinton was noticeably stiff and exuded an air of caution . She ' s definitely not a natural campaigner , unlike her husband . But in the first debate , she came alive in a way not previously seen this year . So it ' s doubtful that she ' ll play it safe this Saturday night , and she may indeed strongly go after Bernie once again . Especially since there will only be three people on the stage , making the contrasts between Clinton and Sanders much clearer .
