VACCHIANO : Maybe it s because the Giants defense is so bad . Maybe it s because Darrelle Revis gets most of the attention . But cornerback Dominique Rogers Cromartie has been a terrific player for the Giants . And tough , too , playing through a bunch of injuries . Despite no pass rush , and big hole on the other side of the field when Prince Amukamara wasn t there , DRC just keeps making big plays for the Giants . His overall coverage has been outstanding , too .
