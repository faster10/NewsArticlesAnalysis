Cerone : It ' s a little bit easier for us , since we ' re not a show about superheroes , and John Constantine doesn ' t have superpowers . In a way , we ' re more of a horror show than a comic book show . For us , as a horror show , it might be easier than other straight comic book adaptations . For us , the draw of the show was the character himself . John Constantine is a character we haven ' t seen on television . He isn ' t afraid to thumb his nose at any form of evil . He ' s just a really fun , inventive character . His costume is a trench coat and a skinny tie . He fits our reality .
