Motivation has always been the driving force behind Brady and New England head coach Bill Belichick , and they will no doubt remember that loss and use it to their advantage here . The home field of Gillette Stadium can only help , as the Patriots have won the past five home meetings SU , with four of them decided by six points or more . Brady will also welcome the return of wide receiver Julian Edelman , who was his top target before breaking a bone in his foot back in Week 10 against the New York Giants .
