Clinton was milder in her criticism of Sanders suggesting his ideas were nice , but unrealistic . She also got in a few good lines in response to an audience member who suggested some felt she was dishonest , " They throw all this stuff at me , and I ' m still standing , " Clinton said , adding that the attacks come " because I ' ve been on the front lines of change and progress since I was your age . Don ' t get discouraged . It ' s hard . If it were easy , hey , there wouldn ' t be any contest . But it ' s not easy . There are very different visions , different values , different forces at work , and you have to have somebody who is a proven fighter somebody who has taken them on and won , and kept going , and will do that as president .
