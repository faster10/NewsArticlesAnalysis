It makes me very proud of her country too ? and yet more ashamed of my own ? America ? where Donald Trump can plausibly calculate that he will help his political chances by proposing to bar all Muslims from United States shores . The question Americans must ask themselves is : Why are Canadians so calm about a transaction that provokes hysteria in the US ? Why have Republican candidates for president and Republican ( and some Democratic ) congressmen and governors reacted to US President Barack Obama s plan to bring in 15 , 000 Syrians , over a far longer period of time , after the kind of vetting process normally required in order to be nominated secretary of state , as if he had agreed to surrender American national security on a whim ?
