" C " : " I know you should pay what you owe . But I don ' t want to pay for all those deaths . I ' ll be absolutely f ed if I have to pay . I want to get out of this but I want a clean slate . If I pay my debt to the law then that means jail and if I pay on the street then that means death . I don ' t want to go to jail or to die . "
