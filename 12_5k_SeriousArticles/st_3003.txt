But as we walked out of the film , my delighted kids asked me if I had liked it , and I didn t quite know what to say . I had liked quite a bit of it , but I couldn t decide how the ending sat with me . Charlie Brown spends most of the movie being humiliated , mortified , embarrassed , made fun of , and scapegoated . This is proper . The role of Charlie Brown in the Peanuts universe is to be ever hopeful , and to be ever disappointed , like a Prometheus who awakens every morning and thinks , Well , surely today no eagle will descend from the heavens and devour my liver . Charlie Brown tries he fails he can t stand it , he just can t stand it he tries again .
