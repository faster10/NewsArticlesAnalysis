Saudi born Abd Al Rahim Al Nashiri , a suspect in the USS Cole bombing , is the first detainee to face one of the new military commissions , but his trial won ' t begin until late this year and the prosecutor in the case has said there is no guarantee he would be released even if acquitted . Al Nashiri ' s case is emblematic of much of the controversy swirling around Guantanamo . The CIA inspector general found in 2004 that he was water boarded and had a power drill revved close to his head while being interrogated in 2002 at a " black site " in Thailand , which may complicate the task of prosecuting him . The new commissions prohibit admission of evidence obtained by cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
