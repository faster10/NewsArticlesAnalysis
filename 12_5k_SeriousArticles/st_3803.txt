Fitzgerald may well have been the league ' s best slot man this season . He ran 57 percent of his routes from that location , per PFF ' s tracking , catching 52 balls for 606 yards and three scores . He ' s a picture perfect route runner with arguably the best set of hands in the league , and he ' s one of the strongest wide receivers in football . But he may not even be the worst slot matchup for Finnegan , who is stronger than he is fast . That ' s why John Brown , who ran 36 . 1 percent of his routes from the slot this year and caught 22 passes for 344 yards and three scores of his own from that spot , might be an even tougher guard for Finnegan . They call Brown " Smokey " for a reason , and Finnegan could be liable to get , well . . . smoked , if he ' s matched up one on one with Brown in the slot .
