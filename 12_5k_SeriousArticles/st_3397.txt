I got introduced to an elite porter , Sakhovat . I was shocked to discover he could earn 5 , 000 6 , 000 rubles ( U . S . 170 ) a day . Most Russians with a higher education don ' t earn that much . In theory , Sakhovat could get up to 150 , 000 rubles a month ( U . S . 4 , 500 ) . The key to his success is that he was one of the first porters at Sadovod when it opened and he built up his own client base .
