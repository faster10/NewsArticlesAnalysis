Surprisingly , James Starks got the start at tailback over Eddie Lacy ? and promptly saw carries on the first three offensive plays . ? Starks was more of a threat in the passing game , as he caught five passes for 45 yards . ? Lacy , coming off back to back 100 yard performances , finished with just five carries for four yards . ? Interestingly enough , John Crockett ? who was signed off the practice squad hours before the game ? provided a change of pace at tailback and turned his five carries into 22 rushing yards . ?
