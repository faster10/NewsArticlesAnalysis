What I think people have missed is that there s a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for Hillary out there . You can talk about Bernie all you want , but in Iowa he said if he got 170 , 000 people out to vote , he was going to win ? and she still won , said Sen . Jeanne Shaheen ( D N . H . ) . And that s because she had a lot of enthusiastic supporters who came out , and that s what s happening in New Hampshire , too .
