So , what ' s a good Republican to do to lift floors ? Heaven forbid , some forms of government intervention may actually be necessary . That ' s , at least , what Ronald Reagan concluded . He became a champion of an earned income tax credit , helping to raise the income of people willing to work for meager wages . Bill Clinton expanded the Reagan program and it proved a powerful tool in closing the inequality gap in the mid 90s . If Reagan and Clinton could agree on a successful tactic to help more families enter the middle class , can ' t today ' s Republicans come up with imaginative new approaches ?
