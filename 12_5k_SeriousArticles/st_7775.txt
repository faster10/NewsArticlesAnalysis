The kick worked so well that even the perpetually stoic Saban smiled in devilish delight . And the decision may offer a key insight into Saban s evolution as a coach , as it was a tacit admission that Alabama may not have been able to stop the Tigers devastating spread attack . The coach known for creative defensive schemes was smart enough to realize that he wasn t smart enough to stop Watson on Monday night . We were tired on defense and weren t doing a great job of getting them stopped , Saban said , and I felt like if we didn t do something or take a chance to change the momentum of the game that we wouldn t have a chance to win .
