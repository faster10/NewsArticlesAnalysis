Claude Jones , who was executed in 2000 , was sitting in a car when an accomplice killed a liquor store owner during a robbery in 1990 . The only admissible evidence against Jones was a hair found at the site of the crime . DNA forensics could not prove it was his , but less than a decade later , improved techniques showed that it was the victim ' s hair , not Jones ' . Regardless , Texas Gov . George W . Bush and appeals courts denied Jones a reprieve , and he was executed .
