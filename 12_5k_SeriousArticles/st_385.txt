Funny , a week of walking up and down the main artery of the self proclaimed heart of moral debauchery , and nary a Bible verse could be heard .

And yet let a midsize city try to add sexual orientation to its municipal nondiscrimination policy or a high school senior bring a same gender date to prom , and you would think it was the apocalypse .
