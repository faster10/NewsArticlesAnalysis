" For me the criticism of " Kony 2012 " is unfair , because if I am to say it is fair then I wouldn ' t be here . Right now I wouldn ' t have been able to go to school . You wouldn ' t have been able to speak to me right now because I had no hope in my life . I reached even a point when I said , ' I can even die now ' because I thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering , you know . "
