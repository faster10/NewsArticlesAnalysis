FARC forced more than 150 abortions , prosecutor alleges : Colombia s chief prosecutor says his office has documented more than 150 forced abortions carried out by the country s main rebel force , FARC . And he says that estimate could rise . Eduardo Montealegre says the evidence indicates that forced abortion was a policy of the FARC , known in English as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia . He says the procedures were usually forced on female guerrillas so they could remain combatants . The comment to reporters late Thursday comes as the government is nearing the conclusion of talks with FARC aimed at ending a half century of guerrilla conflict .
