We get the point of the competition : Players can showcase five different skills ( one timers , passing , puck control , stick handling and goalie goals ) through four relays . But this event topped our list of the most disappointing events because the crowd clearly lacked the same energy that it ? showed with the others . Maybe it s the fact that this is the most team centric event ? ? ? how are you supposed to cheer on Evgeny Kuznetsov ( Washington Capitals ) and Kris Letang ( Pittsburgh Penguins ) in the same event if you ' re fans of those teams ? That s not allowed .
