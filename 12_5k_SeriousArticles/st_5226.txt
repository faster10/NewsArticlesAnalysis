Start of the Week : Jameis Winston vs . Saints : This one screams duh ! The Saints pass defense is historically bad . Their 35 passing touchdowns allowed through 12 games is the most in NFL history . Saints Bucs has the highest Vegas total of the week at 51 points , with the Bucs as 3 . 5 point favorites and an implied team total of 27 . 25 . And how great have Winston and Marcus Mariota been as the Nos . 1 and 2 picks in the 2015 draft ? Both Tampa Bay and Tennessee s arrows are screaming upward . The Bucs are pushing for a Wild Card playoff spot , and the offense has been phenomenal as a whole . Winston had that big five touchdown Week 11 against the Eagles , but has surrounded it with five games with one or zero touchdown passes his past six outings . The ceiling for Winston probably isn t as high as Cam Newton s last week against New Orleans , but Winston has a Brian Hoyer type Week 12 performance in him at the very least . Hoyer completed 77 . 8 percent of his passes with two touchdowns against the Saints that day . Winston has also shown some rushing ability when the Bucs enter the red zone , as he has five touchdowns on the ground . No team has allowed more fantasy points to quarterbacks the past five weeks or on the season than the Saints .
