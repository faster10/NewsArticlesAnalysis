' If England wins the World Cup for me it is only a surprise because you won only once and you won when I was three years old so only because of that I would say , oh that ' s a surprise but because of the players and the experience and the stature that almost all of them have , it wouldn ' t be a surprise but at the same time , if they don ' t go through the group phase it is not a surprise either to me .
