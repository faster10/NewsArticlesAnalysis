I feel like a broken record , heaping praise on " A Separation , " but I really can ' t find anything wrong with it . My natural instinct is to try and bring some sort of balance to a review . Find a crack in the armor of a great film or some small bit of light in a dreadful one , but there is really nothing to criticize here and I get the feeling that upon a second viewing , it may rise even higher in my various top 10 lists .
