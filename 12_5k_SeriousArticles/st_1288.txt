Kevin Huber : The punter ' s performance can ' t be overlooked in the loss . In a close , low scoring game in which field position was important , Huber did his job . Three of his six punts were downed inside the 20 ( at the 6 , 18 and 19 yard lines , respectively ) . Only two of his punts were returned , with Antonio Brown collecting just eight total return yards on them . In years past , Brown has been a Bengals killer on special teams , returning punts from Huber for touchdowns . But Brown didn ' t have a single one in three games this year .
