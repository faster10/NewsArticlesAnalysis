The problem here is that s a lot harder than it sounds . As Brian Beutler notes at the New Republic , it s not as if this oil is sitting around in giant stashes of barrels that the US can load onto C 5s and fly back to the homeland . It s in the ground , in the form of vast liquid reserves . If the US is going to take it , US troops would have to guard the facilities for years , given that Iraqis , Kurds , Syrians , and other local countries and or political factions consider oil their own .
