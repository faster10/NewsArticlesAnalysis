Key moment : Carolina led 14 0 before four minutes had even elapsed . With Wilson under pressure from Kawann Short , the quarterback threw an ill advised pass over the middle , looking for Marshawn Lynch , and right into the hands of star linebacker Luke Kuechly , who easily ran it 14 yards into the end zone . Wilson entered the game having thrown two interceptions in his previous 243 pass attempts . But he threw two in his first four attempts Sunday . He was heavily pressured on both interceptions . Short , who had two sacks in the Week 6 win at Seattle , played a key role in forcing Wilson into the pick six interception .
