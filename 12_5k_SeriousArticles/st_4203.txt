Connelly : What Koryta has done is remarkable . My first book wasn ' t published until I was 36 . Now he ' s almost thirty and on his ninth book . You know I ' m bragging about how I ' m on book 25 and he ' s probably thinking about 75 . That ' s hard for me to imagine , what he ' s doing . I feel like I ' m making up for lost time . That ' s part of what drives me . For some reason , I don ' t know why I had this idea , maybe because I was 36 when my first book was published , but I wanted to write 36 books before I ' m done . I love the play " Glengarry Glen Ross . " In the movie , Alec Baldwin says , " Always be closing . " I feel the same way . For me closing is writing , always be doing it .
