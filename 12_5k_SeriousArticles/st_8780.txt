For instance , let s take the stabbing story . Carson wrote in his autobiography that before he found God as a teenager he was an angry and violent teen , as evidenced by the fact that he once tried to stab someone , whom he now says was a relative .

Carson is angrily denying the allegation that he was not in fact a danger to those around him .
