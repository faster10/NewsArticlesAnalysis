The most significant changes , at least in terms of the game s outcome , are on the Patriots side . In Week 12 , the Pats didn t have wide receivers Julian Edelman ( broken foot ) or Danny Amendola ( sprained knee ) , linebacker Jamie Collins ( illness ) , nickel cornerback Justin Coleman ( broken hand ) or tight end Michael Williams ( knee ) . And they lost linebacker Dont a Hightower ( sprained left MCL ) in the second quarter and tight end Rob Gronkowski ( sprained and bruised knee ) in the fourth .
