There is no need to take this country back , because it hasn ' t gone anywhere . . . except forward . . . toward a more perfect union where the " All American look " is getting a little bit harder to define .

Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has talked about reforming health care , and Obama is the one who got it done yet his critics say he ' s done nothing since he ' s been in office .
