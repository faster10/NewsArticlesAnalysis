Some of Qutb s complaints about materialism , consumerism and economic inequality , in fairness , are more redolent of left wing moralizing , and those elements too can be found in contemporary Islamist rhetoric . But he was especially obsessed with the widespread secularism of American life , with the growing cultural influence of black people ( whom he described as bestial and noisy ) and with the sexual and intellectual freedom of women . Remember , this was 1949 ! He sounds like a horndog Baptist preacher out of some overcooked satirical novel when he inveighs against the seductive capacity of the American female , found in her expressive eyes , and thirsty lips in the round breasts , the full buttocks , and in the shapely thighs . Whatever research Qutb may have undertaken on that subject during his time in Colorado and California was for the benefit of Islam , to be sure .
