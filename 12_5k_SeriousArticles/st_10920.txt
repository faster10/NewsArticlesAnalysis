It is not the first time United Way has stepped in to help those most in need . For example , following the 9 11 attacks , United Way of New York City created the September 11th Fund in partnership with The New York Community Trust , raising and distributing more than 500 million . Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 , United Way of NYC partnered with the Brooklyn Community Foundation to found and fund the NYC Haitian Hope Healing Fund to address the short and long term needs of affected individuals residing in New York . And following last year ' s Hurricane Irene , United Way of New York State set up the Hurricane Irene Recovery Fund to help those in need .
