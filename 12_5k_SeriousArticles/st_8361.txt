On the other hand , Sam has already seen the bit where Oscar Isaac s Poe Cameron gets the full effect of Kylo Ren s evil Force powers in multiple trailers , and the inevitable deaths of major characters are unlikely to damage a kid who s sat through the demises of Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda . I ll be making my final decision after Tuesday , when I ll see the movie ( without Sam ) myself . If there s just too much dark side horror on show , The Force Awakens might have to wait until he s older .
