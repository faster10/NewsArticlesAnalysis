The Brady Manning debate is over , but Brady has one final order of business . The quarterbacks have split their four playoff meetings , and Manning has won the last two ( 2006 and 2013 AFC Championship Games ) . Today , Brady has a chance to outshine Manning again and maybe end his career in the process . Brady has four Super Bowl rings to Manning s one . Brady has 10 AFC Championship Game appearances to Manning s nine postseason one and dones . And Brady has a flurry of playoff records that Manning won t be able to touch . But sometime down the road , Brady surely doesn t want to hear Manning close a conversation with : Yeah , but I got you with the last three . The better quarterback will almost be the key to his team advancing today .
