" The Last Stand " represents his first starring role in eight years , and it seems there ' s plenty more gas in his tank . The timing for a primed , pumped , itchy trigger finger shoot em up leaves something to be desired , no doubt , but with Nicolas Cage unaccountably AWOL this January , Arnie has the knucklehead R rated action field pretty much to himself . What ' s more , " The Last Stand " brings it . If you park your brain outside , and double park any misgivings about vicarious gun mayhem right alongside , it ' s passable fun .
