It will be interesting to see what the 600 price point means for the PC market . It s likely Oculus exclusive titles simply aren t going to have that big a market for a good while , although we ve always known that was going to be true to some extent . A slow uptake on PC VR is a clear win for Sony ? even if its headset is a similar price to the Rift , the PS4 already has a huge install base and new buyers will have to spend significantly less for a very good VR experience .
