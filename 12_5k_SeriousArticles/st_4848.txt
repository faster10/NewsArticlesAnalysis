When I headed out to join the protests outside the Koza Ipek offices , I expected to find the leftwing enthusiasts who characterised the 2013 Gezi Park protests , and who have periodically gathered to protest about government oppression since then . Instead , I found a crowd that resembled attendees at an open air mosque , split neatly between dark clothed men and colourful headscarf wearing women on either side of the road . A hoarse man walked up and down the gap in the middle with a megaphone , his slogans of support echoed loudly by the gender segregated crowd . If anything , the women shouted louder , brandishing copies of Koza Ipek owned newspapers and posters which read : We Will Not Be Silenced and The Last of the Dictators . I talked to an elderly woman who had travelled from a suburb more than 30km away to show her support . We had to come , she said . This cannot happen . In breaks during the chanting , she read from a pocket sized Qur an .
