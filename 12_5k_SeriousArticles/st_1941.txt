What s remarkable is how long it s taken for the tech giants to be on the receiving end of this outrage . That delay surely owes something to what distinguishes these companies from the corporate behemoths of the past . For one thing , we feel ourselves dependent on them in a way that was rarely true of a Shell or General Electric . As John Harris argued in the Guardian , Google is so tightly woven into our lives that a consumer boycott is almost unimaginable . It s hard to be outraged when you know you can t break away .
