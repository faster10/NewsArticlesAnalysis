Adelson : That is what makes this matchup in particular so intriguing : It is strength vs . strength , and will dictate who ends up winning the game . Hood will have the opportunity to break a few long runs in the game . Clemson is strong up front , but it is not an impenetrable force all the time . Of the 11 rushes it has given up that have gone 25 yards or more , eight have come in the final month of the season . And North Carolina is one of the best at preventing negative run plays .
