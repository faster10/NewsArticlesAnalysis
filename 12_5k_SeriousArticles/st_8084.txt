Dodgy results will happen to all sides of course . But I ' m talking about the ones that should have been avoided . This season for example , if they ' d won a game they were winning at Swansea , if they hadn ' t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at Stoke , and if they ' d kept the lead at 10 man Liverpool , Arsenal would be top . Those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points , have stopped Arsenal being serious title contenders this season .
