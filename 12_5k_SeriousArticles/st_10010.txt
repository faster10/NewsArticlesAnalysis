As three point dogs versus New England , the Broncos ' team total is just under 21 points in AFC title week . . . . " Our defense is what ' s guiding us . Let ' s be clear , " were Peyton Manning ' s words after last Sunday ' s win over Pittsburgh . A limited game manager now , Manning ' s role versus the Patriots will be to protect the ball , eat clock , keep Brady off the field , and make advantageous pre snap adjustments . Peyton has been particularly dreadful at home this season , going 93 of 162 passing ( 57 . 4 ) for 1 , 054 yards ( 6 . 52 YPA ) with a 1 : 8 TD to INT ratio across six games at Mile High . He topped 225 passing yards in one of those games . Now facing a Pats pass defense that finished 2015 second in sacks ( 49 ) and 13th in Football Outsiders ' DVOA , Manning is a strong DFS target for New England ' s D ST . . . . The Broncos ' best hope of generating offense will be on the ground , where C . J . Anderson ( 15 113 2 ) and Ronnie Hillman ( 14 59 1 ) had success running on New England in Week 12 . Patriots SLB Jamie Collins ( illness ) was inactive for that game , however , while WLB Dont ' a Hightower ( knee ) left in the second quarter . Both should be at or near full strength in this rematch . Despite Anderson ' s superior effectiveness , the Broncos have maintained an even backfield split , playing Anderson on 50 of their Week 19 downs and Hillman on 45 . Anderson logged 17 touches to Hillman ' s 16 . Anderson has severely outplayed Hillman since Denver ' s Week 7 bye , averaging 6 . 12 yards per carry with six touchdowns on 100 rushing attempts compared to Hillman ' s 3 . 68 YPC clip and five scores on 157 runs . The Broncos will be hurting themselves if they continue to utilize Hillman equally at Anderson ' s expense .
