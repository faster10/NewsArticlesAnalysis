Obviously a Donald and the bad guy piece is not interesting for me to participate in , Sater wrote in an email to AP .

He credited Sater s stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives , although he did not provide details . Wolf told the AP to write about Sater s past at your own risk but did not cite specific concerns .
