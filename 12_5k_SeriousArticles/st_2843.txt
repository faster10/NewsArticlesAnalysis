" I don ' t think that ' s a competitive play , " Belichick said in 2014 . " There hasn ' t been a field goal under 20 yards that ' s been missed in 10 years . When the extra point was part of the game originally , we had players in other positions who were kicking , surfaces were a lot less ideal than what they are now . It was a tougher play . Now , we ' ve made it a non play , and I don ' t think non plays are good for the game . "
