Unfortunately , al Maliki ' s removal would not diminish the influence of Iran and Tehran ' s Shiite militias . Iran will continue to be the key determinant of Iraqi policy and politics for Iraq ' s Shiite parties and Shiite militias regardless of the prime minister . Iran is skilled in power politics and in asserting Iranian prerogatives . Iranian strategic goals depend on an acquiescent and accommodating Iraqi government . If Iran were to pressure al Maliki to step down , he would surely be replaced by someone Iran could influence .
