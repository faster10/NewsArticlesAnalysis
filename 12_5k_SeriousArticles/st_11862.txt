What does it say to Costel and Vito ? said Allardyce . There s more pressure , perform better . Somebody else is knocking on their door now . I don t know what will happen , but I know Pickford won t be going anywhere , that s for sure . If there was to be an offer from somebody else for either Costel or Vito , I d probably call them in and say : What do you want to do ? Does it suit you and does it suit us ? If that happens , we ll talk about it .
