With this month s Paris climate convention moving rapidly into view , we bring you the second of our special editions focusing on the environment . On one spread we analyse the US rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and what it signifies for environmentalism in North America . Elsewhere we take an all round view of pollution caused by cars ? from S ? o Paulo , where an urban highway closure is a blueprint for green activists , to Britain , where the first mass production hydrogen vehicles went on sale last week . We also catch up with the latest significant twist in the Volkswagen vehicle emissions scandal . Plenty of food for thought for motorists !
