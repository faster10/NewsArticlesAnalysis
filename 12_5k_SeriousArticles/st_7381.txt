When I woke up today I felt quite drained , quite tired . As the day went on and I decided to play , I started to focus a little bit better . But definitely , on the court tonight , I was more emotional than normal . I was talking to myself after every single point almost , from the first point through till the last , which was obviously not ideal . That uses up a lot of energy . Again , that just makes you more up and down throughout the match as well .
