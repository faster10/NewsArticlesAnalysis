He was blown away here they all were by a 21 year old Texan who has rewritten the record books . By the time Woods and McIlroy stood on the tee at 2 . 30pm local time , Spieth had spoiled it for just about everyone .

The world finally saw the two biggest names in golf paired in the final round of a major , only for it to be part of a distant undercard . Maybe that was why Sunday ' s round fell flat for Woods , not McIlroy .
