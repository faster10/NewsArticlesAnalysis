I believe that proposals to register , restrict and target Muslims in America because of their faith are not only very wrong but counterproductive to the goal of eliminating the radicalization of Muslim youth . Since our founding , the free exercise of religion , unfettered by government , has been a bedrock of civil society and a boon to the flourishing of religious expression and faith based works . The framers of our government knew well the lessons of history , that political persecution directed at any one religion puts all religions in jeopardy . Politicians and others who ignore or violate this basic truth of the American creed are false patriots .
