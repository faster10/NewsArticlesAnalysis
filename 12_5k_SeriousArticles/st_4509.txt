The spaceport , originally conceived as a hub for Virgin Galactic operations , is now shared by fellow tenants such as SpaceX and UP Aerospace , who have granted Google room to work there . The Guardian reports that Google has taken over hangar space from Virgin at a cost of 1 , 000 per day , and has been working on SkyBender there since last summer . Google also established its own flight control center at the facility , and has set up a series of transceivers to test the SkyBender signal reception . The Guardian further details Google s efforts to build electronic communication installations around the facility , and the various difficulties the project faced in setting up the system .
