He looked pretty good , so , so far so good , Swinney said Monday during a teleconference . The Ohio State Buckeyes enjoyed a longer winter break , and therefore more practice time , than the Oregon Ducks . If they do that , the Tigers can make Alabama bring extra pressure , something the Tide have rarely had to do this season . Maybe they can do a walk through in the morning and maybe a little extra film session . Based on Alabama s performance against MSU , and that I just think the line should be 7 . That was kind of the most normal time of my life . We are who we are , they are who they are . Clemson fans are going to read this , or they re going to read some tweet or message board post , I ll get ripped for being a moron or a hater or a moronic hater , and if form holds after my wrong pick of Oklahoma over Clemson in the Orange Bowl , there will be a few homophobic slurs mixed in with all the grouchies coming my way .
