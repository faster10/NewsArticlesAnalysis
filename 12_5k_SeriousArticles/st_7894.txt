Controversy aside , the upcoming Democratic debate will be notable because it will be the first one held this year on broadcast television . People who want to watch the debate will be able to do so without a cable or satellite subscription , and without having to livestream it on their computers . It may not draw a bigger audience than , say , the first two Republican debates ( with over 20 million viewers each ) , but it may draw a different audience , being on CBS .
