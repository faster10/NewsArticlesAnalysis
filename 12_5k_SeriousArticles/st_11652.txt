Now , for those of you who haven ' t actually seen a Doritos Locos Taco in person ( i . e . productive citizens who don ' t drink past 2 : 30 in the morning ) they ' re just what they sound like . Tacos . . . wrapped in shells . . . made from giant Doritos . It ' s amazing ! It ' s culinary Xanadu ! It ' s as if Taco Bell ' s marketing executives were poking around in my dreams .
