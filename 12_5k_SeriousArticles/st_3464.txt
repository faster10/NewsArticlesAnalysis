Mickin Sahni of Stone Ridge , Virginia As a first generation Indian American , I have heard from my parents the turmoil on the subcontinent as their parents were forced to India while their friends were forced to Pakistan . Bhutto ' s effort to reconcile the differences between the two countries was one of her main missions . Indians throughout the world remember her as a peaceful link between the two nuclear superpowers and could only sympathize with Pakistanis grieving throughout the world . Hopefully her efforts were not in vain .
