The Rams aren t exactly a cultural institution in St . Louis . They had the league s lowest attendance this season ( 52 , 402 ) and lowest percentage of the stadium filled on game days ( 80 . 2 percent ) . Obviously , the threat of losing the team to Los Angeles affected those numbers . But in the last six years , the Rams have never been higher than 27th in percentage of capacity , and never filled more than 87 percent of the stadium in a season .
