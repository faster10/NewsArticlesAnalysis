Sheikha Lubna : A young woman , actually a perfume creator , who sells exclusively to Saks Fifth Avenue in Dubai , decided to create a perfume with my name . So I had two mandates from her . One , I had to smell it , otherwise if it doesn ' t smell good I ' m not going to take it as a name . So one , I had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume . And it ' s an Arabic perfume by the way .
