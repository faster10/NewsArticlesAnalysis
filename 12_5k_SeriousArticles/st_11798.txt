Here s an example of Tom Brady beating the blitz , although it wasn t out of an empty set . On their opening possession the Patriots anticipated a Chiefs blitz with Brady in the shotgun , and the Chiefs played man coverage behind it . They doubled Gronkowski , with slot corner Ron Parker playing outside leverage and Berry doubling Gronkowski . Gronkowski ran a sit route at the sticks on third and 13 , Parker got inside of Gronkowski , giving Brady an area to deliver the ball . Brady , off of outstanding pocket movement , threw Gronkowski open away from the defense .
