There were comical moments like when Chicago s E Twaun Moore crashed to the floor in the first quarter trying to defend a crossover by Curry , who buried a 19 foot jumper . There was a neat pass from Shaun Livingston to Leandro Barbosa for a reverse layup that made it 41 20 early in the second . There was also a somewhat scary moment when the Bulls Aaron Brooks tripped Rose , sending him into Curry as they raced out to defend a 3 from the corner with 4 : 28 left in the half .
