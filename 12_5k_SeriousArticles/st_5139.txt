Bernie Sanders , Martin O ' Malley , and Hillary Clinton want to raise Social Security benefits and pay for them with new taxes . Sanders advocates a tax on Wall Street trading . Martin wants those with earnings above 250 , 000 to pay more Social Security . Hillary would raise the ceiling ( now 118 , 500 ) on taxable Social Security earnings . It ' s good to hear these Democrats want to fund their proposed benefit hikes , but this won ' t resolve the existing 26 trillion shortfall .
