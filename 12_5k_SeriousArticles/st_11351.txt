This is a dumb story . It s rare that you come across a story that s so implausible that you can dismiss it out of hand without further investigation , but this is definitely one of those times . The KKK was a powerful organization with a national network that operated in semi secrecy and had ties to major leadership in this country , sure . ? You know , back in the 20s . Or even the 60s . But while ? there are still 72 active KKK organizations in the U . S . , it s a disparate , dare I even say nostalgic ( for racists ) organization . They can commit localized acts of hate and even terrorism , but they don t put people in Congress , folks .
