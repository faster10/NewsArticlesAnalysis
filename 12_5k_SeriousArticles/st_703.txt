We ve been hearing from certain members of the international Syrian support group , I d say from one member , doubts about whether the Syrian Kurds , more specifically the Democratic Union Party PYD , should be invited to the talks . I believe that without that participant the talks will fail to deliver the result we expect , which is a final political settlement in Syria , Lavrov said , pointing out that the Kurds make up to 15 percent of Syria s population and inhabit a considerable , moreover crucial territory .
