Ron Rivera : He might be a first time head coach in the Super Bowl , but he ' s no stranger to the title game . He was a linebacker for the 1985 Chicago Bears team that won the championship . He was the defensive coordinator in Chicago in 2006 when the Bears reached the title game . He has a unique ability to keep players focused on the moment . In part because of what he experienced with the " Super Bowl Shuffle " Bears in ' 85 , he understands the importance of letting players be who they are . That in turn helps the Panthers play loose . That ' ll be particularly crucial during the media circus that is the Super Bowl . Rivera is not afraid to take a chance on fourth down , which is why he earned the nickname " Riverboat Ron " in 2013 . This game won ' t be too big for him .
