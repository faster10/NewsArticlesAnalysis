New York ' s campaign finance system is built for the big donor not the average voter . Individuals can contribute up to 60 , 800 to a single candidate , more than 10 times the limit to presidential candidates . The end result is that the vast majority of citizens who can ' t afford to make big donations feel shut out and disconnected from those that represent them . In addition to small donor public financing , lowering contribution limits will enhance the participation of citizens in New York ' s political system .
