Wait a minute how can the 2CV be one of our favorite Bond cars while also being one of the worst ? We re glad you asked . The 2CV is no doubt a lovable little people s car , and made for an entertaining addition to For Your Eyes Only , one of Bond s lighter films . But while we loved seeing Bond behind the wheel of one , the fact remains that the 2CV can t hold a candle to any of his other prime rides in almost any measurable category . It s one of the worst , but we love it all the same .
