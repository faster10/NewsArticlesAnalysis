" Reid gives us an inside threat , " Stanford forward Grant Verhoeven said . " I don ' t have that part of my game , yet , where I can post a guy up and get off a hook shot . When we have that , we can work it in to him and work it out . It stretches out the defense . They have to play him tight , which allows us 3 pointers . We ' re missing him , but we are playing well . We ' d love to have him back . "
