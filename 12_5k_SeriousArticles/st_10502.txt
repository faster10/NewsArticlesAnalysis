History shows that marginal tax rates were raised on the very highest bracket to 94 in the midst of World War II . History also shows that almost no one paid tax in this bracket . Why do it then ? Because a top rate of 94 made lower rates of 50 and 70 look more palatable . Is the Buffett Rule a first step toward lowering the 30 flat rate to those making more than 250 , 000 , or raising other middle class taxes ? It is hard to see anything very good happening here .
