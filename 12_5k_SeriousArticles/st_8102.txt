Opposition manager Marko Nikolic was left stunned by the pitch invasions . ' Maybe we can hope something like that happen everywhere in the world but not here in England , ' he said . ' We were a bit surprised , I must say . It was a strange thing to be part of game in England and game stopping three times in one half , then for 10 mins . Maybe that was a little bit disturbing for both sides , for us definitely , but I don ' t think it was decisive . '
