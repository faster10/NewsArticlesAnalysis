His death removes a man who loved his country so much that sometimes he hated it , and who loved no one , even himself . Love was not a feature of human life that he had much interest in or sympathy for . He was mainly preoccupied with power and justice in the individual life , in the community and in the historical perspective . He was not shy about saying that behind his icy exterior was an icy interior . Shy is the wrong word . He was not shy about anything .
