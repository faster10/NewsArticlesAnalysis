Resisting his charm , as the T Wolves are discovering , is futile . Towns is a 6 ' 11 " , 244 pound prodigy who was attending shoe sponsored camps when he was eight and guarding Kevin Durant in the summer when he was 16 . But he also taught himself to play piano , golf and Ultimate Frisbee . He lists Len Bias as his favorite athlete , never mind that Bias died almost a decade before he was born . I ve got a Bias jersey too , Towns mentions with a wink .
