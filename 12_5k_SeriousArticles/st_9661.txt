None of this defeatism diminishes Andy Murray s status as an all time great himself , since no one with two grand slam final victories over Djokovic , an Olympic gold medal and a one man Davis Cup triumph is less than that . Nor does it lessen the quasi paternal feelings of my friend and me . If anything , in fact , we love him more than ever after another January fortnight spent getting up for him in the middle of the night and enduring his screechy tantrums .
