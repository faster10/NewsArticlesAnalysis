They ve just been consistent , said LeBron James , who lost to Golden State in the finals last season with Cleveland . Think the most impressive thing is the way they ve been playing at a high level for so long . I think it comes with a lot of health . They ve been healthy . They ve been the most healthy team I ve ever seen in NBA history and they have great talent . Those guys all play for one common goal and that s to win and that s all that matters .
