Stu and Brad quickly become friends and repeatedly run into each other throughout the year in far flung parts of the continent , and travel they do . " The Big Year " takes them from Maine to Key West to Arizona to Attu Island , Alaska , the westernmost island in the Aleutians , closer to Russia than it is to the Alaskan mainland ( of course the production didn ' t actually shoot there , but they did shoot in the Yukon ) . The scenery and wildlife on display are at times breathtaking .
