When a technology reaches this point of invisibility , it has reached its ultimate goal : becoming part of our routine , with no compromise between us and the technology . The technology meets us 100 of the way , right where we want it and need it , right at the point where it improves our lives and takes nothing away . It doesn ' t take our attention , it doesn ' t slow us down , and it doesn ' t make us change the way we live our lives .
