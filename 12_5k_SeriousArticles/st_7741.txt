So what ' s the big change ? Facebook will be switching profile pages , perhaps optionally at first , to a new format called " Facebook Timeline . " I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format . I ' m someone who thrives on trying new things , but this change was radical even for me . Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back , so I stuck with it for a few days .
