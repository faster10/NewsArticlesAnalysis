When beer halls start to seem too rowdy and loud , head to much calmer Vol de Nuit in Greenwich Village . Although the bare bones , redbrick courtyard and its metal caf chairs and tables won ' t win any design awards , Vol de Nuit ' s distance from the street makes it a serene locale for sipping one of the Belgian beers that pair amiably with the mussels and fries the only things on the menu . The bar ' s interior is decorated with a pressed tin ceiling , hurricane lamps , and a small bar cozied up against a back corner and dimly lit with bare red lightbulbs . It ' s all quite soothing . After a few sips , you could imagine yourself transported to a sleepy side street in New Orleans ' s French Quarter . 148 W . 4th St . , 212 982 3388 , voldenuitbar . com , beer from 6 .
