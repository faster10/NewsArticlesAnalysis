Petra Nemcova : Growing up in the Czech Republic at the time Czechoslovakia was a beautiful childhood because I didn ' t understand the whole concept of communism . I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened . I had a really beautiful childhood . . .

But our parents gave us something more valuable than money they gave us so much love and that ' s priceless .
