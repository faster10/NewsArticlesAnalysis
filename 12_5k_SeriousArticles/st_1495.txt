As for Osweiler ' s starting debut , Kubiak said , " it ' s encouraging . The thing that he ' s going to be able to do is see a lot of good things , but he ' s also going to look at some things and say , ' I could have been better in this situation . ' I think he ' s going to take a lot from that . But it was encouraging , I think , for a first start in this league . "
