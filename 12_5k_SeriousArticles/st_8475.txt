I tell Ben of how my mom used to chuckle when I would call her nearly crying in frustration at his stubbornness not only would she would remind me that I had been similarly temperamental , but she genuinely reveled in his strong personality . And her laughing , while maddening , helped me to better appreciate him by seeing him through someone else ' s eyes . When he rides his balance bike , I remind him that Grandma Heather gave it to him , somehow foreseeing that a gift that would grow with him would allow her to remain tangibly present in his life after her death .
