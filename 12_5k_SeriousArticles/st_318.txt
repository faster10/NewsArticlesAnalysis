My parents raised all of us to just pursue our hearts ' desires . They were like " figure out what your purpose is on this world and then do it and do it to excellence no matter what it is , whether it ' s being a janitor or a doctor , as long as you ' re filling your life ' s purpose then we ' re good . " No pressure to pursue one thing or another , although I will say my father was very upset when I dropped physics though .
