Dylan ' s mention of Shakespeare raises a question . The playwright ' s final work was called " The Tempest , " and some have already asked : Is Dylan ' s " Tempest " intended as a last work by the now 71 year old artist ? Dylan is dismissive of the suggestion . " Shakespeare ' s last play was called ' The Tempest . ' It wasn ' t called just plain ' Tempest . ' The name of my record is just plain ' Tempest . ' It ' s two different titles . "
