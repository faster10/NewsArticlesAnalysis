It is an open secret in Washington that the Congressional Black Caucus despises Emanuel . A longtime caucus member told me that normally when they meet with the president , the chief of staff attends the meetings . But in the time Obama has been in the White House , Emanuel didn ' t attend one meeting , and has always given a cold shoulder to black members of Congress . And if you ask black political operatives , pollsters and insiders , they all have a " why I can ' t stand Emanuel " story .
