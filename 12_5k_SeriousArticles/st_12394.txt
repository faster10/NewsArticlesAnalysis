Race in the United States is not merely about who likes or who doesn ' t like you , or who calls you the N word or does not want to live next to you . Racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change . But these institutions are made of people , and people do have to talk . And drink coffee . And who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race ? Maybe they will even think about things in a different way .
