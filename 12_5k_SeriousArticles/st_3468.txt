Kimberley Brewer of Ottawa , Ontario Although I have no ties , either familial or political , to Benazir Bhutto , I am deeply saddened and enraged by her murder . This noble leader , who championed women ' s rights in a society rife with discrimination toward fully half the population , has been felled by cowards who seek to thwart progress and peace . My heart goes out to all who mourn her loss as I do , and my condemnation to those responsible for this horrific act of barbarism .
