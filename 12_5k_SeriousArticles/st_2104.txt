The project will also hunt for such secret chambers in other tombs of royalty . Minister of Antiquities Mamduh al Damati revealed the team began with King Tutankhamun s tomb . However , he refrained from confirming that one of the two entrances may actually be a gateway to Queen Nefertiti s tomb . He did add that more experiments , including some using advanced thermography equipment , will be conducted to confirm that there are , in fact , hidden chambers in King Tut s tomb before Egypt s authorities breach the wall , which would destroy over 3 , 000 year old artwork that has withstood the test of time .
