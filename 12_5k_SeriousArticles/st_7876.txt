Congratulations , you ' re now a developer . At least , according to your phone . You should see a new item pop up in the About menu , called " Developer options " . Within that menu , you can change a few options namely " Window animation scale " , " Transition animation scale " and " Animator duration scale " ? to . 5x or lower . This should speed up your phone by reducing the time it spends animating transitions between windows and apps . ?
