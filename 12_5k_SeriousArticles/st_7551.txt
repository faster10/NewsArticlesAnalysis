In this debate , the proportion of words a candidate was able to speak was almost the same as the proportion of turns they had to speak ? which indicates a far more orderly debate than what the Republicans have experienced , in which the candidates are giving more thought out responses and having fewer impromptu exchanges . Webb had the most words per turn , possibly because so much of his turns were spent complaining about how little time he had to speak . Still one more time , Chafee was the real outlier , not only receiving few turns to speak but also not using his turns when he had them . Clinton and Sanders were most certainly the winners ? or at least they talked the most .
