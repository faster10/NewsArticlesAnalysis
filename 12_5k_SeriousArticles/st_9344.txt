I think there ' s sometimes an element of fear of traveling in general people don ' t think it ' s safe to do . If you read the U . S . State Department warnings , you ' d never go anywhere . I certainly wouldn ' t be in Beirut now ! They worry about everything that could go wrong and then they talk themselves out of it , which is sad as I feel very safe in most countries . Even more safe than I do in the U . S . !
