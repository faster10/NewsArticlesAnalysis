Songs sung by the White Stripes ' lead singer , Jack White , pull me out of a dark cloud . His tunes are upbeat , jazzy , and funky . The track " We ' re Going to Be Friends " makes me feel happy and hopeful , while " Seven Nation Army " motivates me to get up and move . " Why Can ' t You Be Nicer to Me ? " reminds me that I ' m not the only person having a tough time . Listening to it , I feel less alone . Cindy Karnitz , Rockford , Illinois
