As for the Patriots , it s all about what team shows up on Saturday . Are they really the team that went 2 4 the last six games ? Because , if the team from December shows up , a team that had little semblance of offense , couldn t protect Brady , and started leaking on defense , the Chiefs will throttle them , much like they did at Arrowhead last September . Reid s team is that good and won t be intimidated by the Patriots or Gillette Stadium .
