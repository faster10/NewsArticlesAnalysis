My mom wallowed in self pity for a few days , thinking about how uh , crappy , it would be to have to walk around with a bag of stool taped to her stomach for the rest of her life , but did her best to clutch at her usual spunky , snarky self . She was focused on regaining the strength to climb the stairs of her townhouse in Brooklyn and hoped to make it home in time for the birth of my second son several weeks later which she had graciously allowed to take place in her home .
