" I ' m beyond thrilled to be working with Jonathan Ames and Sir Patrick Stewart , " said Seth Macfarlane in a statement . " Jonathan ' s creative talent is formidable , and his writing style is wholly original , hilarious , and provocative . And of course , Patrick Stewart is one of the greatest actors alive today . His skill and versatility are unmatched , and he will excel as the star of his own show . Thank you Starz for allowing us to bring Walter Blunt to life ! "
