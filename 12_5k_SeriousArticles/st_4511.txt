We have had a lot of conversations with both fighters and it ' s a fight I think needs to happen this year . If we strike a deal , and there ' s still some way to go , then it ' s a fight I would like to put on in a big stadium on one of the last two Saturdays in May . We have spoken to Wembley and numerous other stadiums already I believe this fight would draw a crowd of 70 , 000 or 80 , 000 .
