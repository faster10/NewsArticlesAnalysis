On Saturday , defensive end Derek Wolfe added to the war of words when he told the Denver Post : I hate everything about them . They re always in my way . They re always in my way to get what I want . I ve got a ton of respect for the whole organization . They ve got great players ? Tom Brady s a great player . Bill Belichick s a great coach . I ve got a ton of respect for them . I just hate them .
