" This president has failed America ' s women , " Romney told a campaign event Wednesday in Virginia . " As I go across the country and ask women what can I do to help , what they speak about day in and day out is help me find a good job , or a good job for my spouse . And help my kid , make sure my children have a bright future , better schools and better job opportunities . That ' s what the women of America are concerned about and the answers are coming from us and not from Barack Obama . "
