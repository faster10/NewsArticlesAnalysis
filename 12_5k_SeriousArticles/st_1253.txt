Honestly , it makes you wonder if Republicans in Congress are in cahoots with the immigrant smugglers . One is putting money into the pocket of the other . If you want to know why the United States has had such a tough time controlling illegal immigration over the years , there ' s one reason . What other law enforcement operation can you think of where the harder you crack down , the wealthier and more powerful the bad guys get so they can come back and fight you even harder the next time ?
