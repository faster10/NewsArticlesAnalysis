As someone who worked at " SNL " for eight years , I can assure you this was not happenstance , but rather was by design . To me , the " I love cats " line shows that " SNL " grasps what many on the right refuse to . As I heard firsthand when I attended the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism two weeks ago , ISIS will despicably use any means to recruit people . Consequently , as ludicrous as it may seem , saying " we love cats " to young girls is not beyond ISIS .
