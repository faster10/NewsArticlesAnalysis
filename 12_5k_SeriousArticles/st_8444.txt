My second daughter , Anabelle , was born with the neurological disorders lissencephaly and microcephaly . Lissencephaly means " smooth brain " and microcephaly means " small head . " What this means is that while she was in utero , her brain stopped developing , due to a random miswriting of her genetic code . Now almost 4 , she is cognitively still a newborn . She cannot hold up her own head , she eats through a gastronomy tube in her stomach , she requires oxygen support when she sleeps and she cannot control her own body temperature . She has quadripalegic cerebral palsy , is legally blind and has severe epilepsy .
