I think the bad taste in the mouth bit has been used by every head coach in the NFL at one time or another . I highly doubt that players like Suh sie even paid attention . Campbell sounds like another rah rah coach who wants his team to believe they are better than what they really are instead of acknowledging that they have many areas of need . There s a coach in Buffalo that tries to convince his players that they re all All Pros instead of letting them know that they need to improve or risk losing their jobs . Complacency and b . s . will get your azz whooped everytime , right Wrecks ?
