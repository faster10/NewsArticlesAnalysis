The Iowa Republican caucuses ? could set records on Feb . 1 , thanks to both regular caucusing and hate caucusing . Ted Cruz , the son of a pastor , is expected to bring out the evangelical conservative crowd ? about 25 of Iowa s population , but anywhere from 55 to 60 of caucus voters . And Donald Trump should bring in all new participants to the process . Of course , there s also going to be strong turnouts from anti Trump , anti Obama , anti Hillary and anti establishment camps .
