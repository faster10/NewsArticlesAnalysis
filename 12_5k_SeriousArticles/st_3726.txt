Brady ' s pass was caught by Amendola , and Amendola had a chance to get by one Buffalo Bills defender and take it the rest of the way for a long touchdown . But the whistle had blown so play stopped . Referee Gene Steratore explained that a whistle had inadvertently blown when Amendola caught the ball , so the ball was dead at the spot Amendola made the catch , and Rex Ryan was given a penalty for interfering with the line judge on the sideline who apparently blew the whistle .
