Schuffenhauer retired from bobsledding after the 2006 Torino Games , where he was part of the two man team that finished 14th . He had two children and a girlfriend , Ruthann Savage , whom he met in 2004 , and he felt responsible for them . Supporting a family on the meager money bobsledders get was impossible , and it was time to find a job and settle down in Utah . That worked for two years , until the desire to compete came back when he saw the team racing at Park City . He became obsessed with going to Vancouver .
