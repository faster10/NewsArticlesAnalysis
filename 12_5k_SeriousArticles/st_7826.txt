AA : Ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . But in this context ( ISIS ) will . . . be pushing in Ramadi because that ' s an area they have lots of support . It also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . The concept of success is hugely important to them it ' s what sustains the recruitment effort of ISIS . Nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it ' s very important for them to be seen to be succeeding .
