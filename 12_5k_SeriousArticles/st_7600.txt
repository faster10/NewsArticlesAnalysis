Ben McAdoo ' s name has received more hype in recent days , even being called the " front runner " by some in the local and national media . Schefter went on to say that being a head coach again isn ' t Coughlin ' s only avenue moving forward . The Miami Dolphins just hired Adam Gase ( former Bears OC ) to be their HC and he ' s one year younger than McAdoo . That meeting must not have gone almost as well as hoped , as Adam Schefter reported that Coughlin did not feel that it was a good fit with the Eagles .
