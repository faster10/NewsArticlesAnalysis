The Raiders second drive of the game stalled when Carr tried to hit Crabtree on the sidelines on third and 9 ( a delay of game penalty stretched out what was going to be a third and 4 ) . Crabtree caught the pass and got his feet down as one official ruled it a catch . But another came in to overrule it when Crabtree lost control of the ball a step or two out of bounds . The Raiders chose not to challenge the play and had to punt , one of four punts in as many possessions in the first half .
