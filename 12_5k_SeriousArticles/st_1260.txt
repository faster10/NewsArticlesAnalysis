I mean he ' s a tough matchup for everybody . He ' s got size and speed , so he ' s a tough match up . He definitely made some big plays today . The touchdowns were big . It was a good defense . They were giving up 11 points a game in the last however many weeks , so we knew it was a challenge . They had a lot of good players , and I thought we just made a few more plays than they did .
