At the start of the play , Wilkins lines up in his blocking back position , then rolls to his left down the sideline . Punter Andy Teasdall , who got ripped by Dabo Swinney for attempting a fake punt in the ACC Championship Game against North Carolina , did not disappoint . The redshirt junior dropped a near perfect pass to Wilkins , who made it all the way to the Oklahoma 13 yard line . It was the first time in school history a defensive tackle caught a pass .
