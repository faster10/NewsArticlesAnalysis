Parker : I was in a grass roof banda in West Pokot , where I ' d been working on a new bridge project . I was staring at a bat hanging from the ceiling and listening to a rat run around on the floor , trying to fall asleep . It was at that moment , 10 : 18 p . m . , when my cell phone rang . It ' s very interesting because I normally do not have cell phone reception in this area . . . . I thought it might be my wife , so I answered the phone .
