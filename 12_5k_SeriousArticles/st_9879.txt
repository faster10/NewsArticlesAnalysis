' For me , Chelsea ' s best player is Branislav Ivanovic . He ' s the best defender in Europe . I don ' t understand why nobody talks about him . It ' s strange because I think he ' s complete . He ' s got everything . He ' s very strong , he ' s got a good jump , he ' s fast and he ' s got good technique . He ' s a warrior . ' It ' s fair to say Robert Pires isn ' t a bad judge .
