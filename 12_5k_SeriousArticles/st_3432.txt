I doubt the first lady would be happy to see Sasha or Malia dancing to " Partition " the way Beyonce does in her music video . Not because dancing seductively or expressing sexuality through song is inherently wrong . But doing so at 15 and 12 while singing " I just want to be the girl you like " isn ' t ideal . Currently , Vevo is heavily promoting the video , and the song jumped from No . 97 to No . 23 on Billboard in one week .
