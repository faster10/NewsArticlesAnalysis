" A friend contacted me to tell me about the project and I was immediately charmed by the principle , " Roux wrote in an e mail from France , here translated with help from ahem Google Translator . " I wanted to participate in this project because it concerns my life passions : mountain climbing and skiing . It provides an opportunity for people to live the feelings and emotions that I feel in the mountains , to show them its beauty , its vastness , its purity . It is also an opportunity to make them aware that these wild places are magical and we must take care of them if we want to keep them intact so our children will have the chance to see these glaciers too .
