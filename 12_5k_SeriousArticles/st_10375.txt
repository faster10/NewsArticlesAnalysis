The constitution says Sharia is the main source of legislation , and establishes that the ( unelected ) scholars of al Azhar , the ancient center of Muslim learning , shall be consulted on Sharia matters . The draft speaks of equality for all , but orders that the state should " balance between a woman ' s obligations to family and public work . " It also says the state must " protect ethics and morals and public order , " and guard the " true nature of the family . "
