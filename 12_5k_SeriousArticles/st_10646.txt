Thank you , thank you very much . I love you people . I love you people . Thank you . Unbelievable . I have to start by saying , I absolutely love the people of Iowa . Unbelievable . So on 16 June when we started this journey , there were 17 candidates . I was told by everybody , Do not go to Iowa . You couldn ' t finish even in the top ten . I said , But I have friends in Iowa I know a lot of people in Iowa I think they ' ll really like me . Let s give it a shot . They said , ' Don ' t do it . I said , ' I have to do it . ' And we finished second and I want to tell you something : I ' m just honoured . I ' m really honoured .
