" I lived in a little hut with a backpack and went to the beach every day , " Moore recalled . " I wrote a lot of songs out there . ' Everything But You ' is strictly from that experience . I didn ' t know what I wanted to do with my life . I ' ve always been a little bit like that . I worked a bunch of odd jobs , but I realized out there that with my personality , unless I was doing music , there was no way I was going to be happy . "
