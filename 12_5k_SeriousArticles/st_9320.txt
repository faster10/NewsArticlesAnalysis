If Italy ' s highest court overturns the lower court ' s decision , it effectively revalidates the trial court ' s sentence , which means 26 years in prison for Knox . Italy would then have to put in a request to U . S . authorities for extradition , and it would remain to be seen if that would be granted . If the court does not overturn the appeals ruling , Knox could not be tried again for the same crime under the " double jeopardy " rule .
