Back to southpaw from Fury and this loose , seemingly random style is working brilliantly for him : he hasn ' t boxed very well but he ' s making Klitschko look like the inexperienced one . The champion looks around and has to jump back to avoid the big wild left hook . Then our Gareth gets a mention : the commentators note he has Fury two up . Klitschko pulls out of a big right hand at the end and Carl Froch says something similar to one of my friends on Facebook : that Klitschko looks like he might have hurt his hand .
