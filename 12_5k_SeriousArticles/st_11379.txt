The pressure put on by the vaunted Royals bullpen can play mind games with a lineup , and as expected , Luke Hochevar , Kelvin Herrera , Ryan Madson and Wade Davis were extremely tough on the potent Blue Jays lineup . Yes , Herrera did give up a three run double to Troy Tulowitzki in Game 5 ( no shame in that ) and Madson , probably the weakest link in the pen , did give up a game tying dramatic two run blast to Jose Bautista in Game 6 ( no shame in that either ) . Mostly , when you re playing KC , the relief core is so good that opponents are basically playing a six inning game . . . or less . That means pressure to score early and often . So having said that . . .
