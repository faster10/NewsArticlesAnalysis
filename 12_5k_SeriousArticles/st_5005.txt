My point is not merely that puritanism of all stripes has common roots and common goals , and always calls for a return to some bygone era of virtue that almost certainly never existed . That s a point worth making , but here s the real secret sauce that binds the insane doctrines of ISIS to the Republican Party madhouse of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz : They both perceive all this decadence and moral relativism and loss of faith as the consequence of 200 odd years of democratic malpractice . One side has the decency to say openly that the legacy of 1776 and 1789 was complete bullshit from the get go , nothing more than a high minded pretext for imperial conquest and endless self indulgence . The other side ? and I think you know the one I mean ? must pretend that democracy is or was a good idea , at least until it was distorted by Communist mind control or the Black Panthers or the 14th Amendment , while doing everything possible to undermine it .
