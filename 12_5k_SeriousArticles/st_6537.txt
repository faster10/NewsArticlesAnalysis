President Obama has an opportunity to unite Congress and the American people behind a cause on which they seem ( for a change ) to agree . This is not the same country that Obama addressed last year , when Syrian President Bashar al Assad ' s use of chemical weapons came to light . In September 2013 , 55 of Americans opposed airstrikes against al Assad even if the President were to secure congressional approval . Today , 60 of Americans , including majorities in both parties , support air and drone strikes against ISIL in Syria .
