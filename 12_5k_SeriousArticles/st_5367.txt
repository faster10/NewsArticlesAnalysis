Is he a bad guy ? Ray Rice did a very bad thing . Not because it was caught on tape but because he hit her , and no one has any right to hit another person . It is never a solution in a conflict . People are not necessarily good or bad . They are complex . Ray Rice has shown that he needs help . With counseling and perhaps other treatment and the desire to change many abusers can become good partners . But it takes work and commitment . Time will tell .
