" I had a really weird moment where , straight after shooting the christening pictures , I was doing a job in Colorado and I changed planes in Denver . And I walked through the airport , and it was like that ' Being John Malkovich ' poster where everyone in the airport was reading ' People ' magazine and this picture on the cover , and this picture was like staring at me everywhere . It was just really strange moment , when you ' re like ' Wow this picture is like everywhere . ' "
