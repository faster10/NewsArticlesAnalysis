Economic security and national security go hand in hand . So at the heart of our strategy is our decision to see through our long term economic plan and use our renewed economic strength to invest further in our security . As a result , the United Kingdom will be the only major country in the world which is simultaneously going to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of our GDP on defence and the UN target of spending 0 . 7 per cent of our GNI on development , while also increasing investment in our security and intelligence agencies and in counter terrorism .
