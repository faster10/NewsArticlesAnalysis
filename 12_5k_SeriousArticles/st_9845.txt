1 . The Spurs vs . the 1 4 5 pick and roll of the Warriors . This is the problem for every team , the Steph Curry Draymond Green high pick into the short roll that allows Green to spot up , kick to the corner shooter ( if help comes ) , or lob to the other big ( if applicable ) . It ' s been unsolvable the past two years at its core , it ' s about deciding what you ' re willing to live with . You have to choose something , it ' s impossible to guard everything . You have to choose to surrender something , whether it ' s the Draymond Green 3 pointer , the corner three , or , in the worst case scenario , a Curry 3 pointer .
