I don ' t know what he said exactly but I don ' t agree with that . I think there are different kinds of innovation . I would say that companies like Microsoft and Cisco are still very innovative in a different way . Microsoft is looking at driving the shift towards cloud . Cisco is looking at driving the shift towards internet of things . Yes , there will be newer companies that will be born and I think those newer companies will grow big . We ' ve seen that with Google and Facebook . But there are other companies which are emerging to be bigger like Uber and Airbnb . There ' s always a wave of companies that get started , grow big and then there ' s the next wave . That doesn ' t mean that the first set of companies stop innovating .
