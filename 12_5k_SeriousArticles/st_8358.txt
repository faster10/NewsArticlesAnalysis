The head of Bush s Super PAC apparently sees the campaign differently . Since Right to Rise ( R2R ) has raised ten times the money brought in by the campaign , it s easy to imagine who s calling the shots . Mike Murphy , according to some , is on a personal vendetta against Marco Rubio , whom Bush loyalists consider disloyal for having entered the race . As a result , R2R has spent an astonishing 20 million on ads attacking the Florida Senator ? about one third of the Super PAC s ad spending to date , and more than the group has spent undermining any other candidate .
