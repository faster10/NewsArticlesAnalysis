We learned a few things on Monday night , those of us watching Anderson Cooper on " AC360 , " about Alex Teves , one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora , Colorado . We learned that in high school , " for no reason whatever , " as his father put it , Alex always wore white T shirts and blue jeans , and that one day some 400 to 500 kids from the school wore the same outfit , declaring an unofficial " Alex Teves Day .
