Carolina will be ready to burst the dream cloud and dreamy season the Cardinals have been riding . There s no blueprint for Cam Newton , a behemoth of a QB with a howitzer for an arm and legs like a leopard .

Unlike the past , when a bad game or bad season would have sent Newton pouting and packing , he seems to be a man in full this year .
