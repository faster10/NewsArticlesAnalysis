Khan didn ' t commit suicide using his pyjamas because Syrian prison inmates are not allowed to wear clothes . They are usually stripped down to their underwear and any garment that may pose danger to the prison guards is removed . Even if we did accept that there might be a slight chance he was given pyjamas to wear and that he somehow had the energy and the power to climb to one of the metal rings in the ceiling very popular in the Syrian prisons for their effectiveness in bearing the weight of young men when they are left hanging upside down by tying only one leg and leaving the body to swing around under extreme beating during " investigations " he physically couldn ' t have been able to tie the pyjamas around his neck then on the ring because they are usually too high .
