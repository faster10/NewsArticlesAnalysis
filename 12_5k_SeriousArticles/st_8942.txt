Edmund will not quickly forget the first game of his debut in the sport s oldest and most prestigious team tournament . Thunderous applause greeted every point but he could have done without the horn that interrupted his serve at 15 30 , and another as he won the point . An official then walked along his sight line as he served to save the first of two break points . Edmund finished the job after 12 minutes , as the Belgian No1 stuck his backhand in the net . Welcome to the Davis Cup .
