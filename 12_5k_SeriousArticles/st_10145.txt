Olsen : A good living room needs a comfortable place to sit , a place to rest your drink , and a place to read a book . But people default to the school dance arrangement , where everything is pushed back against the walls . So I start by moving the furniture closer together , toward the center of the room . Then I fill out the arrangement with occasional chairs and tables to create functional seating areas . It makes the space feel so much more intimate and conversational .
