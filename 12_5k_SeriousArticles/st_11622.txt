I didn t want to do a character because I wanted this to be me . I wanted to speak from my heart about how I felt because people really don t know me . They know Vivian Banks , but they don t know Janet Hubert . It s the one thing I keep getting over 25 years in my struggle to take my reputation back from someone who purposefully destroyed it and would not stand up ? ? and I m listening to Pinkett Smith say , Stand up and boycott the awards . Nobody cares .
