Ask a boy today who his hero or heroine is . The answer , or lack thereof , will speak volumes . We must teach our boys what is to be loved and imitated . As the writer Tom Wolfe said , we must engage in a great relearning . It is our generation ' s task to instruct and train our boys to be men . As Proverbs says , train a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not turn from it .
