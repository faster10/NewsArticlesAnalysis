I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers , my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country , Haley said . My story is really not much different from millions of other Americans . Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America . They wanted better for their children than for themselves . That remains the dream of all of us , and in this country we have seen time and again that that dream is achievable .
