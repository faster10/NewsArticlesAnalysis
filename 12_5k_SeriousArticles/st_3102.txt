What it ' s about : If you really need to know what " Desolation of Smaug " is about , start with J . R . R . Tolkien ' s " The Hobbit , " as that ' s the basis for Peter Jackson ' s trilogy . But Jackson has taken some liberties with translating Tolkien ' s children ' s classic to the big screen . As hobbit Bilbo Baggins joins 13 dwarves on their mission to reclaim their land from the vile dragon Smaug , the crew encounter mythical obstacles as well as a character of Jackson ' s own imagination , Evangeline Lilly ' s elf Tauriel .
