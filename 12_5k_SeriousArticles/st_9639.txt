' I started with McLaren Honda when I was three years old a replica from my father I will finish with McLaren Honda , but the real one . That will be one third of my life . It will end with great experiences , great memories , great friendships , but normal life will start the day I retire . I don ' t think I ' ll become a driver manager or anything . After 15 or 16 or 17 years of Formula One it ' s enough . '
