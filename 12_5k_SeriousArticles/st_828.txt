This time around , many leaders of ethnic parties are upset that the NLD is running candidates in ethnic strongholds , potentially cleaving the opposition vote . Suu Kyi has argued that her party is a nationwide force for democracy and needs to compete head to head with the ruling Union Solidary and Development Party ( USDP ) , the military s proxy , which is contesting seats across the country . The USDP prevailed in 2010 polls that the NLD boycotted because they were clearly rigged in the military s favor . ( The SNLD also declined to take part since its leader was in jail , having been sentenced to 93 years imprisonment he was released in an amnesty in 2012 . ) Suu Kyi s message is direct : vote for the NLD so we can form a government and then change the country .
