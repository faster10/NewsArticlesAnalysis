We don t know when the grieving Volquez will take the ball again , or how much Young might be compromised in his Game 4 start by throwing 53 pitches in Game 1 , or how Familia , burned when he tried a quick pitch gimmick , might be damaged by Alex Gordon hitting a ninth inning , game tying bolt over the centerfield wall , or what both managers might do if they need major bullpen help again in Game 2 . Such is the beauty of baseball . Every pitch is an invitation for a surprise .
