Shaped by the precocious comedic smarts of talent on a roll Jonah Hill ( who not only costars but also developed the story with Michael Bacall and is one of the executive producers ) , the movie morphs into an action comedy with a tonal complexity that marks it as a very contemporary creative project . It ' s part homage and part wink at the past . It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years . It bridges slapstick and action . It ' s quick witted with its pop references . Oh , have you heard ? Depp makes a delightful cameo appearance !
