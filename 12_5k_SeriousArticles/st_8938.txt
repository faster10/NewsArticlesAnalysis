But it doesn ' t matter what ' s happened in the past really . It ' s about what happens on Sunday night . Stan Wawrinka beat Rafa in the final here a couple of years ago and he had never beaten him in 12 attempts . When he beat Novak here in the quarter finals , it was the same thing , as well : he had lost 14 straight matches and then Stan beat him in the quarterfinals . So there ' s no reason it ' s not possible for me to win .
