Terry , 34 , said he was ' deeply hurt ' by the incident and will never play for England again . Capello agreed his international career was probably over . ' I don ' t think he has the chances to play with the national team more , ' said Capello , ' But I saw some young players that played with me are improving . Chris Smalling is playing and Phil Jones . I ' m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well . '
