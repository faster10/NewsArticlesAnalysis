Another climate issue worth consideration is an immediate one : the crisis caused by ? high levels of lead ? in the drinking water of Flint , Michigan . The problem could foreseeably recur anywhere in the country , but the candidates have yet to explain how their administration would handle it better than Obama s EPA ( or Governor Rick Snyder s administration , for that matter ) . Fortunately , the Democrats are already talking about Flint without much prompting . Sanders called for Snyder , a Republican , to resign , while Clinton slammed the governor in the NBC debate but didn t call for his resignation . O Malley also told me he wants to see resignations over Flint , calling the situation an example of utter incompetence and arrogance , and a huge failure by the state on a couple of levels . Asked who should bear the brunt of the failure , O Malley told me , ultimately the responsibility is the governor s . But he stopped short of directly calling for Snyder to step down , saying only , I think someone should resign . ? ( There have been a few lower level resignations in the Snyder administration already . )
