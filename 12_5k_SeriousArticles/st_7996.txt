Skinny : Dont a Hightower is the straw that stirs the drink for this category . He s the main man . He started the Broncos game but got hurt before the half . The game completely changed defensively after he left . He did not play in the Eagles or Dolphins game , and played sparingly on a bad knee against the Jets . The more time he has now to try and get that sprained knee back closer to 100 percent , the better the defense will be particularly when it comes to shutting down an opponent s run game . If he s still hobbled , it s trouble . The Pats will need him , especially against either Cincy or KC .
