The Brady Manning matchup is nostalgia at its finest . It should be acknowledged . It ' s a matchup of surefire Hall of Famers for what is likely the last time .

It won ' t be , however , both quarterbacks leading drive after drive , wowing onlookers as they one up each other for 60 minutes . ? The outcome will have less to do with Brady v . Manning than some might care to admit .
