There are frequent protests against gangs and gun violence in poor neighborhoods in Chicago . You might not have heard about them or noticed the small news stories about them because they don ' t protest on Michigan Avenue . Rich white people have no influence with the gangs and poor people who commit those crimes . They do have influence with the City Council , the mayor and those people who make rules for the police . That ' s why they protest on Michigan Avenue , when police shoot poor people .
