Most magical moment in the park : Adams had gone to the Grand Canyon in 2000 for training , and she says she didn ' t really appreciate her home park until she got back . " I was driving back into work when something clicked and I realized how much I loved this place . Having been surrounded by the sunburnt colors of the Grand Canyon , I saw how much I loved the color green . I really appreciated this park . It was just the right size for me . "
