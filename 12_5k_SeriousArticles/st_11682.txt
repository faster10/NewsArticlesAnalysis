Growing up , I attended a parish with Irish , Polish and black Catholics , and observed that the spiritual gifts of black Catholics were often diminished . When it was suggested that we include a gospel song in the liturgy , we were told that was not Catholic . " Ave Maria " was sung , but not " Mary had a Baby , " a Negro spiritual . I learned about St . Theresa the " Little Flower , " but not St . Benedict the Black . A Kwanzaa table was a no no .
