We have had the opportunity to get to know some of these children and see their smiles light up their face when they receive their backpack of food each Friday , feel their arms hug us tight in gratitude and hear some of their personal stories . Like how the food in the backpack doesn ' t only nourish them throughout the weekend , but some of it goes in the family soup to feed all their siblings as well . Or how they ' re so glad they have more to eat on the weekends than the toothpaste they previously only had to eat .
