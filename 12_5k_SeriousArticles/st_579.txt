I ' ve had so many letters from parents or medical professionals who will say , I didn ' t even think about how casually I ' ll tell someone oh , I have a disabled child . It never even occurred to them that if they really stop to think about it , their child may have a specific medical condition that can be defined as paralysis or autism or being an amputee . . . . it ' s how we use words and how they shape what we think about difference and other people in our community .
