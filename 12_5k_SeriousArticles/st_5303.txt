MARISSA MAYER : WE STILL DO FEEL THAT THE FORWARD SPIN WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IS VERY LIKELY TO BE TAX EFFICIENT . BUT THAT SAID WE DID OVERALL SEE INDICATIONS CERTAINLY IN THE MARKET AROUND UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TAX TREATMENT AND THE DURATION OF TIME IT MIGHT TAKE IN ORDER TO GET TO RESOLUTION . GIVEN THAT WE FEEL IT ' S PRUDENT AT THIS TIME TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES LIKE THE REVERSE SPIN BUT THIS IS REALLY A BOARD LEVEL QUESTION , SO I CAN ALSO HAND THAT TO MAYNARD .
