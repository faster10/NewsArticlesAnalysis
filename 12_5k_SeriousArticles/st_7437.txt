" If it is repeal Obamacare ( the health care reform law enacted last year ) , do we think in two weeks or a month Obama ' s going to go , ' You guys were right , ' and sign onto it ? I don ' t think so . So you better look at what your goals are and what you ' re willing to accept , or don ' t do it . "
