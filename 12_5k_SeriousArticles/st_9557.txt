BOND , JAMES BOND : Craig ' s strengths start with his physicality : his head ' s like a block of English granite , he ' s tough without ever hurrying , and he ' s amazing at hand to hand fighting in close quarters . Combine that with his world weariness he admits he ' s an assassin , knows himself , is wry but never silly , and he ' s the best Bond since Connery . He ' s a little quippier than before and it works , sneaky funny , talking to a mouse out of the corner of his mouth .
