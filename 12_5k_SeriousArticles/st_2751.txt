Based on Andy Diggle ' s Vertigo comic book ( itself loosely inspired by the old DC comic ) , the movie doesn ' t really flow it just spurts out in quick , oily jets . It ' s actually less like a comic book and more like a 90 minute trailer : all the best bits stuck end to end and the filler condensed into a pithy line or ( better yet ) a clubby music cue . ( The Kills ' " U R A Fever " comes up twice once for a fight scene and then again for a sex scene but there ' s no doubt the fight is the turn on , and it lasts much longer , too . )
