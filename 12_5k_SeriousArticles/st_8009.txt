In a recent piece , Robert Wright , of the New America Foundation , wrote : " In common usage , a ' terrorist ' is someone who attacks in the name of a political cause and aims to spread terror to foster fear that such attacks will be repeated until grievances are addressed .

I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be whitewashed and ignored " at which point , God willing , " the American zombies wake up and revolt . "
