Our coaches do a good job of monitoring ( the collective fatigue factor ) , Curry said . Obviously we want to play as much as we can , but you rack up minutes and have to keep the big picture in mind . We have such a deep team that it s not an issue of running guys ragged out there on the floor with heavy minutes every night . If we take care of our business , the starters don t need to play 40 plus , the bench comes in and does what they have to do and everybody is taking care of their jobs , so we want to keep that formula .
