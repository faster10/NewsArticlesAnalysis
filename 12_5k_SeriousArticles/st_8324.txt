Until there were 55 seconds left in the fourth quarter of the Warriors at Pacers game , it was all about how the Warriors put on an offensive exhibition for some of the prettiest offense you ve ever seen all season en route to going 23 0 . Then , Klay Thompson suffered a bad right ankle sprain with 54 seconds left , he was in some serious pain , and couldn ' t return to finish the 131 123 victory .
