Yuck . The LTD from A View to a Kill makes this list with ease , thanks to the fact that it wasn t even used ironically or for any particular purpose . It was just there . Thankfully , it wasn t seen for long in the movie . Nothing about the legend of James Bond suggests that he would ever be caught voluntarily behind the wheel of a mid 1980s American sedan , and a base model Ford at that measure . At least make it a Cadillac if you re going to go that route .
