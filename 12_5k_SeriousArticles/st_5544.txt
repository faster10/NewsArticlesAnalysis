It seems like just yesterday that I was previewing the first weekend of the college football season . Artavis Scott , Hunter Renfrow and Charone Peake were the Tigers passing attack with a combined 13 catches for 176 yards . And the Tigers are in the National Championship because of it . Luckily for Bama , where Coker has been average , the defense has been phenomenal . Alabama has dominated opponents up front all season , but the Tigers will be the best overall offensive line that the Alabama defensive front has had to face .
