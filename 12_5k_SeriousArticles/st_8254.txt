Cole : I think it ' s an extraordinary opportunity . There are only so many things we can do that make us feel better . We pick up the newspapers and we want to cry every day . We turn on the news and we want to jump out the first window , jump in front of the first truck . And there ' s not a lot you can look forward to right now . . . but you can make yourself look better , and if you look better , you ' ll feel better , and it becomes self fulfilling . I think fashion can do that to you .
