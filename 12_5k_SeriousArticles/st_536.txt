However let ' s be honest , I really , really liked Jonathan but he didn ' t need to be there , not for the fame nor for the money , so I think it was not only inevitable that he would leave when s hit the proverbial fan . If I had his life in LA I certainly would be on the first flight home . Big Brother is a massive head game . Only the strong and the ones who need it most survive the long haul .
