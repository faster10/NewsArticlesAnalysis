" Obviously one of the best teams that I ve ever seen , certainly that I ve ever coached against , " Stevens said of the Warriors . " The way that they ve started is incredible . The energy with which they play is incredible . And as skilled as they are , it seems that that s how much fun they have and how connected they are as a team . Heck of a challenge . Nobody s conquered it yet , so we ll give it our best shot . "
