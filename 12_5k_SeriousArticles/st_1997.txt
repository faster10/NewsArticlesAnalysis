Sanchez loves to run . One of his Italian adventures at Udinese came when he left his house close to the club ' s Stadio Friuli outside the city to drive into the centre on a shopping trip only to lose his keys . A more pampered player might have called his agent to send a car . But whether out of embarrassment or just because he thought nothing of the ' hardship ' , Sanchez ran the four miles home to get a spare set of keys and then ran back to his car .
