What makes this especially fun is that everything that makes Donald Trump a runaway success is a creation of conservatism . He is their Be Careful What You Wish For candidate . ( This guy put it about as succinctly and hilariously as anyone can . ) National Review can stand athwart history and yell stop , but they re standing in front of a snowball they ve been pushing down a hill for the last half century . Even the hand wringing that Donald Trump is such an ugly and hateful candidate is hilarious from a rag that started out defending liberty and segregation .
