While compromises in the design of the tax are unavoidable in a federation with 29 states , two Union Territories and the Union government , it is nevertheless important to get the fundamentals right . The economically advanced states do not really have a case for demanding the inter state tax , even if it is 1 . The argument that the levy is meant to compensate these states for the spending on infrastructure is fallacious because infrastructure is created to accelerate growth in output and employment . Indeed , many states , in addition , give generous incentives to attract investments . Ironically , while exports to other countries are zero rated from GST , tax is sought to be levied on inter state trade !
