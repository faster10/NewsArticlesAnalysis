The potential for this incredibly layered dynamic . . . when you first meet ( Philip and Elizabeth ) , they ' re in this brittle place . It makes for a great springboard into a series . That ' s where the journey is over the season this roller coaster of them trying to figure out what their path is , what the present is and what the future is . "
