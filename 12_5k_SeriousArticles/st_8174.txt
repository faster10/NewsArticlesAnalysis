Anti feminists have it wrong . No one , myself included , wants Jackie ' s story to be true ( that ' s absurd and offensive ) , but we cannot apologize for erring on the side of a fair , compassionate and credulous hearing of a woman ' s account . What feminists want as we all should is a culture in which it is safe for women to report sexual assault when it happens , where they can trust that their families , their peers , the police and courts and , yes , the media will respond with sensitivity and compassion , not skepticism and shame .
