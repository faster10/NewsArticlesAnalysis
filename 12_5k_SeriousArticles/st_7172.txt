The only survivor is 2 year old Abuzar , who is in a coma with gunshot wounds to the head . " Four days ago , Abuzar was playing on my lap . Today , he is in a coma . But I ' m praying that he will also die . What ' s the point of him living ? " cries Taraj Ahmad , Sardar ' s nephew . " If he survives , what do I tell him ? That his family was all murdered ? But this baby is a fighter . That ' s why he ' s still alive . Sardar will live on in him . "
