So we were moved to set up the imaginatively titled Kate and Justin Rose Foundation . Our aim is to inspire children from the inside out through nutrition , education and experiences . Our organization has developed from feeding children in need from five schools on the weekends to creating vegetable gardens at school where they learn to grow fresh vegetables that they can then take home with them , to providing the children with a monthly allowance so they can choose their own books , to setting up field trips to broaden their horizons .
