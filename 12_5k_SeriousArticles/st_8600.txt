The fact I was able to handle everything that has happened the last few days is a good sign . I wasn t perfect today ? far from it ? and I didn t expect to be before I went on the court . I did show a lot of emotion and was very expressive on the court , animated from almost the first point of the match , the first game of the match ? and I expected to feel that way . But I think in the next few days I will definitely be a lot calmer , get some good rest in and I think I will be fine now .
