Translation : There s a lot to unpack in this line . Obama got criticized in 08 for being too slick because he read off a fancy clear teleprompter . He also got slammed for having Greek columns erected on stage while he was announced as the Democratic nominee . Buzzfeed convinced Obama to use a selfie stick last year during a promo video about healthcare , and he was also spotted using it while on a trip to Alaska last year . In a Tea Party speech in 2010 , Palin asked How s that hopey , changey thing working out for ya ? , referring to Obama s 2008 campaign slogan of Hope and Change . Plus , she even got to slide in another insult about community organizers .
