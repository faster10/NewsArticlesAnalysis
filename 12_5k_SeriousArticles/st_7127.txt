" I think it ' s a joke to deal with it . You know , obviously , there ' s no possible way , " said Hewitt . " I know my name ' s now been thrown into it . I don ' t think anyone here would think that I ' ve done anything ( like ) corruption or match fixing . It ' s just absurd . For anyone that tries to go any further with it , then good luck . Take me on with it . It ' s disappointing . I think throwing my name out there with it makes the whole thing an absolute farce . "
