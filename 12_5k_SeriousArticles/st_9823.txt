' The offer we make as a federation is , if there is more information out there , if this German journalist feels there is a list , or whatever he ' s got , please let us know what it is . We need to bring this to a close as quickly as possible . That can be done by the IAAF ' s ethics committee , it can be done by WADA . We would go to Berlin and look at what he ' s got but we have to get as much information as we can on this .
