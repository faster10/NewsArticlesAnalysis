If there was one Republican winner in Ohio , it was probably Portman . As Romney ' s practice partner for his debate preparations , Portman played a crucial role in Romney ' s success during the first presidential debate , the only event over the past few months that seemed to move the polls in Romney ' s direction . This was actually the fourth campaign in which Portman has played this role , and some GOP insiders are probably contemplating that perhaps it is time for Portman to be a presidential candidate rather than just playing one during debate practice .
