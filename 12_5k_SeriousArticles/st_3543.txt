The Cowboys are seemingly splitting Hardy into two different people . There ' s Hardy , star football player and Hardy , the hot tempered misogynist who ' s choked out a woman before . The former is all the Cowboys see . The latter is who he really is and how " people outside the building , " as Garrett put it , see him . It ' s who he is to fans who don ' t care about the Cowboys ' win loss record and who he is to the greater public when violent sideline outbursts happen on national television . In reality , he ' s one in the same . ?
