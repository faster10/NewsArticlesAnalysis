Rubio , who makes Shakespeare s lean and hungry Cassius seem like an underachiever , has to know that in her testimony Clinton herself referred to the confusion that ensued after the installations at Benghazi were ? overrun . To this day , no one is absolutely sure what happened . Was it a terrorist attack led or instigated by an al Qaeda affiliate , or was it sparked by a spontaneous demonstration caused by an anti Muslim video ? ( There were demonstrations in Egypt the same day and Tunisia a few days later . ) For Clinton to have said one thing at one moment and another thing at another moment could have been nothing more than an accurate reflection of the confusion of the time and the evolving intelligence assessment .
