" Every picture you see of a dog we ' ve helped , every story that we tell , it ' s a happy ending . This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter , " Manning said , beaming . " It ' s living happily ever after at home . And that ' s why we ' re called the Fairy DogParents , because much like ( in ) Cinderella , we ' re in the background . The dog doesn ' t even know we exist , and we ' re just making sure it gets to the ball . "
