Despite the obvious need to raise rates now , Ms Yellen would presumably argue that her caution is still justified . The US might be a tower of strength , but that is relative to a global economy that is still fragile , to put it mildly . Raising rates when the rest of the world is cutting them should not put her off , though the US economy is strong enough to handle a marginal rise , and besides , the chances of it being anything more than a quarter of 1 per cent are practically zero .
