Good question . It ' s always dangerous to speak of a country of 319 million as having a singular will , or of an election expressing that will . That ' s particularly true when only about 40 of eligible voters show up for midterm elections . Like every party that wins , the GOP will claim that " the American people " have endorsed its agenda in full , and therefore if President Barack Obama stands in its way , then he ' s thwarting the public ' s desires .
