In Flagstaff , Arizona , revelers fill the streets to watch a 6 foot , lighted aluminum and copper pine cone be lowered from the roof of the historic Weatherford Hotel downtown . Organizers chose a pine cone to represent Flagstaff ' s mountainous locale amid the largest contiguous Ponderosa pine forest in North America . Begun in 1999 , the event includes two pine cone drops : one at 10 p . m . to coincide with New York ' s Times Square celebration and another at midnight to mark Arizona ' s big moment .
