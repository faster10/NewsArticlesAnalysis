Dave Viscusi of Schenectady , New York That was one of the best Super Bowls Super Bowl parties I have ever been to . We made 4 different kinds of pizza ( BBQ chicken , cheese , sausage and peppers ) , boneless buffalo wings , BBQ ribs , chips of all kinds , apple martinis , some beer and topped off the Giants victory with some CHAMPAGNE ! GO G Men . . . Eli deserves every ounce of credit he gets for this Super Bowl . . . Way to throw it right in the arrogant Patriots ' face !
