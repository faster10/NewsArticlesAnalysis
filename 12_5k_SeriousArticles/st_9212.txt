Lucas may have blathered about quests and initiatic trials , but he knew that Star Wars was actually an excuse for boys to exercise their motorised toys . The series increasingly concentrates on chases , races and aeronautical dogfights in which spacecraft are zapped by pilots with well oiled trigger fingers , as if the films were rehearsals for the video games spun off from them . In The Empire Strikes Back , Han Solo voluntarily navigates his way through an asteroid field , dodging debris while C 3PO , in a tizz as usual , calculates that his chances of survival are 3 , 720 to 1 . Return of the Jedi stages a version of the Ben Hur chariot race in a forest of sequoias in The Phantom Menace , Anakin steers his way to victory in a futuristic F1 tournament , zooming through desert crevasses and tunnels of rock as his competitors crash and burn around him , and in Attack of the Clones he won t bestir himself to rescue Obi Wan until he finds a vehicle with a proper cockpit and the right speed capabilities . What matters in Star Wars is velocity , not profundity .
