No current Republican candidate with any serious shot at becoming president would dare say or propose anything along these lines . Instead they occupy different spheres within the realm of climate change denialism . Some , like Ted Cruz , say the science is bullshit and the scientists who produce it are cooking the books . Others , like Chris Christie , say climate change is probably real and yeah humans are probably contributing to it , but that s no reason to actually do anything about it . Ben Carson doesn t actually know what climate change is . If you mention cap and trade to a Republican , they ll scoff and start ranting about cap and tax . Jim Inhofe might even throw a snowball at you .
