What it means : It means no Nadal in the draw , clearing the way for No . 4 seed Stan Wawrinka , the 2014 champion , who was due to meet Nadal in the quarterfinals , and No . 2 seed Andy Murray , who anchors this half of the draw . While Nadal hasn t been his old self over the last two years on tour , his absence opens up the draw for a number of lurkers , including Milos Raonic , David Ferrer , John Isner and Australian Bernard Tomic .
