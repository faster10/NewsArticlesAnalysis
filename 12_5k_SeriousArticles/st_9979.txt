I have no grudge against the Red Sox in any way , shape or form . I am not a Yankees guy . I have admired the pride of New England folk ever since Hester Prynne took a high hard one , oh about letter high . I have long liked Sweet Baby James and Marvelous Marvin and Tip and Yaz and Eck and El Tiante and Oil Can and Big Papi and the Pops and the Pats . I even thought for a few years that " Boston Legal " was the best show on TV .
