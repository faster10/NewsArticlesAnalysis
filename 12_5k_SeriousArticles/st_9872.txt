Iman : I don ' t feel like we ever lost that feeling like we ' re creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia . I feel like now because we followed our dreams it ' s like ' they ' re not just refugees anymore . ' We don ' t have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild it ' s such a beautiful dream but not ours . In our culture , anything creative is not really respected or appreciated . But I feel like now but even with our new deal we ' re still trucking along . I feel like we inspire people .
