" The enormous impact ' Heroes ' had on the television landscape when it first launched in 2006 was eye opening , " said NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke . " Shows with that kind of resonance don ' t come around often and we thought it was time for another installment . We ' re thrilled that visionary creator Tim Kring was as excited about jumping back into this show as we were and we look forward to all the new textures and layers Tim plans to add to his original concept . Until we get closer to air in 2015 , the show will be appropriately shrouded in secrecy , but we won ' t rule out the possibility of some of the show ' s original cast members popping back in . "
