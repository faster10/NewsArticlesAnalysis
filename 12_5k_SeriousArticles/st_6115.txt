Felipe is a kind , affectionate Brazilian gentleman , 17 years my senior , whom I ' d met on another journey ( an actual planned journey ) that I ' d taken around the world a few years earlier in an effort to mend a severely broken heart . Near the end of those travels , I ' d encountered Felipe , who had been living quietly and alone in Bali for years , nursing his own broken heart . What had followed was attraction , then a slow courtship , and then , much to our mutual wonderment , love .
