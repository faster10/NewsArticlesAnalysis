O Malley is frustrated that he s had few opportunities to talk climate in the official debates . ? Just one question on climate change would have allowed us to have an exchange about a clean electric grid , he told me . ? It s possible , a week out from Iowa , that he ll get a small window at Monday night s forum to make up for that . But it will likely come too late to make a difference . If Iowa is the end of the line for O Malley , he ll deserve credit for having pushed Clinton ( and , arguably , Sanders ) to lay out stronger and more detailed proposals for solving the planet s biggest challenge . But it ll be a shame that he never got the chance to push Clinton , especially , ? harder and further . ?
