' I respect the opinions . and then for me I try to focus on driving my race car first and working with my team and getting the best out of the situation . I am very lucky to have such a car . It is very seldom in F1 that I can be on pole and win the race at every grand prix . The team is doing an unbelievable job . The other guys are not getting closer and that is great . My focus is on that . '
