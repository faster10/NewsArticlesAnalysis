In a Sunday interview with NBC s Matt Lauer , Sanders announced his plan to fight this primary to the end . I hope we win , but if we lose by two points , so what ? we re going to go to New Hampshire , then we re going to go to South Carolina , then we re going to go to Nevada , he told the Today show anchor . We are in this to the end . Sanders is in it to win it , and that gets to the truth of California supporter Jeremy Schafer s statement . Win or lose , Sanders will stand as a historic presence in the Democratic Party .
