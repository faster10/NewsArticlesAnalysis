A man who brings to audiences of millions tracks that sound like Autechre or Gary Glitter or both , co produced by Glaswegian former happy hardcore DJ turned electronica experimentalists or gender subversive Venezuelan noise musicians , with lyrics about slavery , deities and the drug trade . A man who has posed difficult questions about the nature of masculinity in popular culture , and blended rap s braggadocio with equal measures of doubt and fear . A man who can get Paul McCartney making records that will be pumped out of Jeeps in Atlanta , and with one phone call fill the stage for the Brits with the cream of underground grime stars . There is nobody else ? nobody ? this weird in the mainstream .
