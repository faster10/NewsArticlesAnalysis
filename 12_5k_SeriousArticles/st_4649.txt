Well , in short , the 4 inch iPhone ( this time with updated hardware ) ? could be the answer to Apple s problems , but not a long term solution . While the sales are expected to grow as Apple nears the launch of its next iPhone , Apple needs another iPhone ( product ) and this is a strategy that has been followed by many , but has never successfully worked for anyone . Shocking however , is the fact that Apple even stooped to the idea of delivering a another ? affordable iPhone ( after the iPhone 5c ) , which is something that other players like Samsung , Sony and HTC are trying to shake off , by delivering fewer phones in a year .
