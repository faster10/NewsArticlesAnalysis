Travis Tygart , the head of the US anti doping agency whose investigation ultimately brought down Armstrong , had no great objection to him rejoining the cancer battle . ' As long as it ' s not a sanctioned competition that falls under the rules , it ' s not a direct concern , ' said Tygart , who only last week said he now feels ' sorry ' for Armstrong and other riders in the light of the CIRC report into the doping culture in cycling and is now prepared to discuss reducing the American ' s life ban from sport . ' That ' s outside the technical rules . '
