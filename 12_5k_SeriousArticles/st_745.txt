" Perfect love is crawling inside another body and finding a miniature replica of myself , stealing the replica because I fear its destruction , and painting it with a semi gloss lacquer to ensure its longevity . Somewhere there is a room of min iatures formed to look like me , or almost like me . I worry there is a group of people searching for this room and they desire to burn it to ashes and to burn themselves to ashes and to insert those ashes into my body . "
