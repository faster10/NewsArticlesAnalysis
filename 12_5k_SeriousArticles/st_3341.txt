? Try and conceive of how many players you can replace Green with and get the same combination of skills , effort , energy and intelligence . Blake Griffin ? Not a good enough defender . Kawhi Leonard ? Yeah , he doesn ' t exactly ignite a team with his incredible charisma ( though Leonard is very , very close on the basketball stuff . ) Anthony Davis ? Not a good enough defender or passer , and not as quick . LeBron James ? Could never operate with Green ' s reserved usage , able to fully complement players without needing the ball , though James is honestly the best comparison . LaMarcus Aldridge ? Not even remotely as versatile . Paul Millsap ? That ' s probably the closest , but amazingly , not as good of a shooter . These players can all be considered " better " than Green , but would they do what he does , for a team that is obliterating the league in every capacity ? Are the Warriors really better if you replace Draymond Green with any one of these guys ? They ' d certainly be better in areas , but as well balanced ?
