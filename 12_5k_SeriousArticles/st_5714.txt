' I ' ve been begging the police , why from the time I saw the pictures of you just standing by him with his hands to his side , does he end up seconds later with a bullet in him ? ' Ms Hunt said . ' And then if he ' s running , why you had to put in more bullets , and I don ' t even know how many ? That ' s what I want to know . Would they have done that to any white boy ? '
