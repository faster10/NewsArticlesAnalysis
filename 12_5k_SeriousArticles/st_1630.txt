The closest thing to a serious snub is probably the exclusion of D Angelo s Black Messiah , the most acclaimed album of last year , which wasn t eligible until this one . But even that omission wasn t really a surprise : Beauty Behind the Madness was a much bigger ( and frankly much more contemporary ) R B album that sold almost four times as many copies in its first week , and has already produced two No . 1 hits . What was much less predictable is that D Angelo would still manage to garner a nomination for Record of the Year , when not a single song from that album has charted on the Hot 100 ? or even , for that matter , in the Top 10 on the R B hip hop chart .
