Will . i . am : What I ' ve noticed with BEP Experience was it was the Christmas thing to do , it was the New Year ' s thing to do when families got together . I read Tweets like , " Oh my gosh , I haven ' t had that much fun with my daughter in years . I haven ' t had that much fun with my wife in years . I haven ' t had that much fun with my brother for years . " When families come together and they ' re doing this Black Eyed Peas experience with songs that they all know , it ' s great . It ' s a great extension of the Peas . And it goes back to all the work I did going back up to Seattle working on Code Natal , which is now Kinect . It ' s been a great journey and I ' m proud of the result .
