Is this how we want to live ? Should we not have a right to be forgotten ? During the Cold War , we despised totalitarian regimes that kept a dossier on every citizen , holding compromising information in store for the day that it served to discredit him or her . I remember learning that the FBI kept files on dissidents in the ' 60s and ' 70s . I remember learning a few months ago , thanks to Edward Snowden , that the NSA is spying on us . Nobody thinks that is a good thing .
