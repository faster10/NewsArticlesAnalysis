Quinto : It was very different to produce this , just simply based on the budget . I mean , Margin Call was about a 3 . 5M film and this is a half of a million dollar film . So we had less resources and less time . It was also different because it was our friends and literally their family you know , Victor and Phil are brothers and Victor ' s mom is in the movie and Anna ' s mom is in the movie . It really was a friends and family affair . We had a lot of good times while making it but we basically holed ourselves up in a hotel out by JFK and just were there for pretty much two weeks banging away all hours and shooting multiple pages a day . It was definitely a brisk experience but luckily the style of the film allowed for that to happen . It was really fun , but definitely a brief encounter .
