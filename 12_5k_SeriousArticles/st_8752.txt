As for mental health , Republicans are right that it is sometimes related to gun violence . But it s also true that in some cases their budget cuts have reduced mental health services . To his credit , Rep . Tim Murphy , R Pennsylvania , has introduced a bill that would improve our disastrous mental health system , perhaps reducing the number of people who snap and turn to violence . Yet some Democrats are wary of the bill because Republicans like it . That s absurd : We need better mental health services just as we need universal background checks .
