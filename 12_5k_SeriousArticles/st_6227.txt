Kidnappings are not just limited to Boko Haram ' s antics in the northern part of Nigeria but are widespread throughout the country . Every Christmas , Nigerians who live in the Western world often travel back to Nigeria for the holidays . The sheer presence of so many foreigners often means an sharp uptick in the number of ransom kidnappings . Whenever I return to Nigeria , I follow sharp instructions from my mother not to tell too many people I ' m coming back , not to announce my arrival ahead of time , and not too stay in one place for too long . We ' ve become even more cautious after my uncle was kidnapped three years ago .
