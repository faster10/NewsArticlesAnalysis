Now , should Collins have pulled Harvey after the walk to Cain on 3 2 ? Better question , but Collins would say later , " If you ' re going to let him face just one guy , you shouldn ' t have sent him out there . " I don ' t agree Collins easily could have told Harvey , " You get one baserunner , that ' s it . " But Familia also could have blown it if he had inherited one baserunner instead of two .
