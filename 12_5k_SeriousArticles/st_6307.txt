A lot of this is because of the inordinate power of the football coach . Pinkel makes more than 4 million a year , and if you include the 1 million paid to BYU for this weekend ' s game , any administrator is relatively expendable in a fiscal sense . Then there ' s the power structure within the sport , where a coach can decide who to recruit , who to play , who to renew on scholarship . If student athletes revolt against a president or chancellor , there ' s little fear of reprisal as long as the coach is in support . If players revolt against their coach ? That ' s a different story .
