A new company set up by Disney polices this Expanded Universe content , correcting errant subplots and ensuring that fan fiction does not trespass on the main narrative . Lucas himself checks the consistency of new storylines by consulting the Star Wars Encyclopedia , but he sometimes has trouble regulating what happens on a plurality of ever more distant planets : in such an expansive universe , even God finds it hard to be omniscient . In outlying galaxies , wars frequently break out between over zealous innovators and fans who protect an orthodox version of events . There was predictable outrage when Chewbacca was killed off in a tangential novel . Chuck Wendig has recently published another such spinoff , which contains a gay soldier called Sinjir Rath Velus when readers objected that the sexual dissident was not children friendly , Wendig answered back by re enacting the battle in the first film , hurling insults like the warheads Luke fires from his X wing fighter . You re not the Rebel Alliance , you re not the good guys , he ranted . You re the fucking Empire , man . You re the shitty , oppressive , totalitarian Empire . The expanded universe here contracts to the size of a padded cell .
