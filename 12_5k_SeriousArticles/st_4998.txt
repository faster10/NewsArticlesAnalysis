Clinton s post Parisian lurch to the right is obviously a strategic maneuver designed to fend off charges that she s a terrorist coddling crypto Muslim in the mold of Barack Hussein Obama . It should also serve to remind both Clinton s fans and detractors who she really is : a classic Cold War liberal , progressive on domestic social issues ( at least within the frame of neoliberal economic and fiscal policy ) but supremely hawkish when it comes to foreign policy and national security . Whether that combination reflects genuine principle or sheer political calculation I couldn t say , and with Hillary Clinton I m not sure there s a difference . In her best possible incarnation , she might be President Hubert Humphrey , albeit imprisoned by a political climate HHH could never have imagined .
