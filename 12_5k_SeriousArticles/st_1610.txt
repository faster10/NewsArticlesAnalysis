Now , Skyfall did something similar as well , but there was a deftness to its touch that helped make this rather glaring contradiction seem less pronounced . What Spectre attempts is to tie together several plot threads that we didn ' t even know had been left dangling in each entry since Casino Royale , and make it feel like the filmmakers have been building up to some grand reveal . Unfortunately , that reveal doesn ' t really hang together as well as it could , and kind of falls apart in the execution ( as does the forced romance between Bond and Lea Seydoux ' s Dr Madeleine Swann , which I guarantee will elicit unprompted guffaws ) .
