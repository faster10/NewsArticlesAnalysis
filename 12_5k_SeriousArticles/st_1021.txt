" The Louis Dreyfus Foundation has a focus on giving back . It ' s a new project for us , it ' s now one year old and the whole idea was about education . For example in Israel , the youth orchestra includes Arabic children together with Jewish children who are learning through music how to love together . You know ' education ' is a magic word . And this magic word also becomes important in our foundation educating the farmers on how to produce sustainably and to feed themselves . "
