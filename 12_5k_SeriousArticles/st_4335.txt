' I think Coach Rivera was one of the main reasons why I wanted to be here , ' Tillman said . ' He ' s a guy that I had a lot of respect for when I was in Chicago . I love his leadership and his qualities as a coach , and he ' s done a good job with the Panthers . There ' s a good group of guys here like Thomas Davis , Greg Olsen , Luke Kuechly and Cam Newton . I got a good vibe here . '
