Golden State Warriors This is a hugely risky move . Taking on Jackson ' s contract ties up a lot of money , and they still have a high payroll . It could work out . Stephen Curry Jackson Dorrell Wright David Lee Bogut is a pretty good starting five . But Curry and Bogut have injury questions , Jackson is getting older , and that ' s a lot of money . The Warriors have turned towards the future but still needs a lot to go right for them .
