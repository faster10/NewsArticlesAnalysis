There are now several countries , principally Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Turkey , France and the U . S . , that have aligned themselves with the angry minority . The strategic problem for these countries is that even if rebels are militarily successful and force al Assad from power , the new government would be one that roughly 55 of the population does not want and or fears . This means that without a negotiated way forward , we know that the outcome of arming or supporting the rebels means at a minimum only sustained violence and instability in Syria and for the region .
