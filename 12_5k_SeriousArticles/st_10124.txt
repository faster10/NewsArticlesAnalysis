Verdasco hit 90 winners and 20 aces to bamboozle and frustrate Nadal , who said : He played better than me . He played more aggressive than me . He took more risks than me ? and he won . He was playing amazing tennis in the last set . If your opponent is ready to hit all the balls at 100 , then you are in trouble . He had a lot of success hitting all the balls full power in the fifth . I have to congratulate him .
