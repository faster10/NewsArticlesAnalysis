Another case working its way through the penal system is that of Robert Cutler , a U . S . Fulbright Scholar teaching biology at a Chiang Mai University . The police accuse him of sexually abusing young boys , something Cutler denies . Col . Apichart had him under surveillance for weeks . The photos show Cutler talking to groups of young boys on the street and taking other boys swimming at a local pool . A video of a police search of his apartment revealed semi clothed youths in his bedroom . All this will form part of the case against him , which is due to start later this month .
