They played with a ton of heart . SC has been a mess this season , Steve Spurrier stepped down earlier and this will be the final game of their year . SC should not be too much of a problem to overcome though the spread is somewhat high . But Watson and the Tigers had yet another answer : with 8 : 05 left , the quarterback kept it himself with his third TD run of the afternoon to stretch it to 34 25 with the PAT sailing wide right . The game is scheduled for a 12 : 00 p . m . start time and it will be televised nationally on ESPN .
