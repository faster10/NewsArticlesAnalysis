The way I work with Nicky and Roma is firstly I do the writing of the melodies in the songs , and that ' s kind of the solitude moment for me in the studio , which I enjoy very much . When I have the melody the idea of the melody I play that to Nicky and Roma . . . . I get to see their reaction immediately . Is this a song for the album ? And I can see from their reaction " Yes , this is going to work , " or perhaps it ' s not .
