We are facing a team that is full of confidence and in a very good moment of their season . We are well aware of how difficult it will be . They have a lot of pace and defend very well . We know that we are in a position where we want to get more points . We have a chance to be ourselves again and kick start our season . We have seen that Selhurst Park is a really tough place to go but we are looking forward to going there . '
