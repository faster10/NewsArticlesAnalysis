" I ' ve been disappointed this year because you guys treated him like expletive , " Durant said . " He ' s a legend , and all I hear is about how bad he ' s playing , how bad he ' s shooting and it ' s time for him to hang it up . You guys treated one of our legends like expletive , and I didn ' t really like it . So hopefully now you can start being nice to him now that he decided to retire after this year . "
