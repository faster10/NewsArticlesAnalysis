For those playing along at home , pay closer attention to the SAG finalists , no matter how wonky some seem . Most of the folks who vote for those awards are members of the Academy ' s actors branch , who will in turn select the nominees for the Oscars ' acting prizes . The HFPA has no membership overlap with the Academy and only an honorific bearing on the race . The catch is that SAG uses a nominating committee , so it ' s only a sample of the organization ' s taste . ( Also , a shoutout to all you fabulous television folks , who are recognized by both groups , even though film gets the bulk of the awards emphasis at this time of the year . Love y ' all ! ) ?
