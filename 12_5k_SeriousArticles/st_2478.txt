Considering the title , Mellencamp has made a remarkably dark record . " No One Cares About Me " is about a guy out of work , ditched by his wife , mourning a father , a son and his only friend , over an old timey hillbilly strut .

" The dude in " Each Day of Sorrow " insists he would kill himself " if I weren ' t so afraid . "
