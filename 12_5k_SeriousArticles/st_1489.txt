The Inez , 146THE LOOK : Red suede espadrilles that make me feel like I ' m wearing fancy dress . Stylish , chic , sexy . . . these shoes are none of those things . BEST FOR : Nothing . Even for wedges , these are painfully uncomfortable . WORST FOR : Comfort and style . They ' re very narrow on the toe . Comfort rating : 2 . Not as painful as some , but for such relatively low heels at only three inches , they are awful .
