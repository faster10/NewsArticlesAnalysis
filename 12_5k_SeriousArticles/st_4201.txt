Koryta : I feel like I ' m exactly a decade behind Michael . He ' s at twenty years in publishing , I ' m at ten . When I came in there were a group of writers who are standard bearers . You look at what they ' re doing and think this is what I have to go chase . The first book I wrote that was published , my editor was telling me go read Michael Connelly . I said " I am " and he said , " Try again . " Ten years later I ' m still getting that advice from everyone . What Michael ' s been able to sustain for twenty years is almost unprecedented in terms of the quality of the books continuing to improve . It ' s just remarkable . Hopefully my books are improving . One of the ways I find motivation to improve is looking at someone who is already at a high level and continues to get better with each book . That ' s really what you want to emulate .
