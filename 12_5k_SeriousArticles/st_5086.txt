The premiere ratings suggest " Downton " could grow to be even more popular as the season progresses . Last year 8 . 2 million viewers tuned in on the night of the season three finale , and more than 4 million tuned in later , for a total of 12 . 3 million . The second to last episode of the season did even better once delayed viewership was totaled up : 12 . 4 million . That ' s the next " personal best " for the drama to beat .
