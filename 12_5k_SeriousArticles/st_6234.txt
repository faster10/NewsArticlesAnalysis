The problem for the NLD is , however , that polling in key electorates shows that , in a first past the post system , the ruling military turned civilian Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) could win between 15 and 20 per cent of the seats . Added to a small but influential ultra nationalist party and a swag of ethnic parties that will probably do well in their regions , the NLD might struggle to achieve a majority and , if so , will likely only do so in coalition with smaller parties .
