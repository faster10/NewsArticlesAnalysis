Having the bye made all the difference for me , Quinn said . Had it not been for those byes , I don t know if I would have handled it in the same way or been able to go through the process in the same way . I didn t have the mental challenge to say , Oh , I should be looking at this opponent or this thing , because we didn t even know who we were playing yet that first weekend . It got harder the longer the process went , but the first interviews were a really cool experience to meet owners and general manager and share your philosophy with people around the league . I met guys like Ron Wolf and Ernie Accorsi , who were helping advise some of the searches , and I thought that part was awesome .
