A former police chief in Redlands said the media frenzy was understandable and , at this stage , not a problem for the investigation because officials had finished searching the property and released it back to the owner . There s probably nothing in terms of impacting the investigation or harming it that will come from the media footage , said Jim Bueermann , reached on his cellphone shortly after he visited the scene . There s so much media interest in this , this was probably a logical consequence or logical event of their releasing the property . They can t hold the property forever .
