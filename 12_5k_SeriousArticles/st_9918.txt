" Prisoners , " directed by Denis Villeneuve ( " Incendies " ) from a script by Aaron Guzikowski , is no shallow payback thriller . It ' s a dazzingly potent , ambitious and complex movie , a film that forces you to ask questions that have no easy answers . What I ' ve described is merely the film ' s first act . There are a great many twists and turns both suspenseful and thematic to come . Yet at the heart of " Prisoners " is something primitive and elemental and gripping , an obsession with torture , morality and the impotence of the justice system that speaks to our time as intensely ( and maybe controversially ) as the pitch dark vigilante thrillers of the ' 70s once spoke to theirs .
