Upon his release , Williams ' Alan Parrish is once again forced to play Jumanji alongside his former crush Sarah ( Bonnie Hunt ) and kid siblings Peter and Judy ( a mini Kirsten Dunst ! ) . As the game continues and the creatures of the jungle create mass destruction across the city , Williams takes the audience for a ride on the crazy train . While this could qualify as more of an action adventure film as opposed to a comedy , there are always laughs when Williams is involved .
