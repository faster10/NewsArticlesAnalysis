The single best measure in the autumn statement is the announcement to devolve business rates to local councils . This may not sound like exciting stuff , but it will , for the first time in ages , introduce a dose of tax competition into our rigid system of local governance . The UK is currently one of the most centralised countries in the world . The national level accounts for 95 of all tax revenue , which is a higher share than in France a degree of centralisation that would have made Chairman Mao proud . This arrangement destroys the link between economic activity and tax revenue at the local level . From a council s perspective , revenue is not something that is generated locally through commerce and enterprise , but something that is handed down from the top . This allows them to be obstructionist : They can afford to treat economic activity as a nuisance to be fended off , rather than as something desirable to be facilitated .
