It wasn ' t hard to get started . The Gehles , like others who use CaringBridge , set up what is essentially their own personal Web site . There ' s a journal area where the patient or a loved one can enter background information as well as updates on the patient ' s condition . And there ' s a guestbook area where friends and family members can leave messages of comfort and support . Guests can choose to be alerted via e mail if there ' s a new journal entry .
