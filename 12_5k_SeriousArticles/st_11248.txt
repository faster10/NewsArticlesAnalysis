Helen : And mine was such trial and error before Vanessa was born . I had no skills in diaper changing or feeding or any of the things that you ' re required to do as a mother . I enjoyed having a girl the mother daughter shopping , dressing up and doing those things together . There ' ll be difficult times , especially when girls start growing up , and it ' s not easy , but you get through it . You just have to be patient and give them their space and recognize who they are .
