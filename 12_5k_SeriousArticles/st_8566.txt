And the burden of the appeals process on the criminal justice system is huge . A recent report from Amnesty International shows the average cost to carry a death penalty case from prosecution to execution is three to 10 times more than a case with a life sentence . Very often , a life sentence costs the state less than 1 million . Some death penalty cases have cost more than 10 million . The excruciatingly long , and necessary , appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case , and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions . Is it worth the price ?
