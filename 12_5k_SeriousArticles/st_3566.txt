It doesn t have to do with one player , said Kawhi Leonard , who scored a team high 24 points on 7 of 15 shooting . Everybody should be on the same page . We are missing Duncan . He s a great basketball mind . He knows this organization inside and out . We ve got new guys on the floor that don t know the plays sometimes or even defensive schemes for us . We ve just got to keep moving on . Everybody has to get better .
