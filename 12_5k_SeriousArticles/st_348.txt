Detroit Lions : Matthew Stafford should continue to be a good play for fantasy owners Thursday night against Green Bay . He has improved every game and been much more consistent under new offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter . The two work well together and seem to understand each other . Expect this to continue against the Packers , who have given up 19 . 5 fantasy points per game since Week 9 ( 26th in the league ) . Don ' t be surprised if Calvin Johnson finds the end zone again , either . Michael Rothstein
