It feels like Americans are in that stage of a Jimmy Stewart movie before our hero finally steps forward to remind the townspeople that they re Americans , for goodness sake , and they ve got to stop running around like chickens with their heads cut off . That always works in the movie , because the townsfolk have only temporarily lost sight of their better selves . I don t think America s problem is that it lacks a Jimmy Stewart . The problem is that its loss of self runs much , much deeper .
