The word " bonnaroo " is New Orleans slang for " the best on the streets , " and the Bonnaroo festival has grown into that name over the past eight years , winning Rolling Stone magazine ' s " Best Festival " award in 2008 . In addition to promoting mainstream and independent rock , hip hop , and electronic groups , Bonnaroo also features a stand up comedians ' tent and a " silent disco " tent where everyone gets a pair of headphones that sync up with the music for late night dancing without the noise complaints . Over 80 , 000 people will head to the festival outside of Nashville to see headliners including Bruce Springsteen , Phish , and Snoop Dogg .
