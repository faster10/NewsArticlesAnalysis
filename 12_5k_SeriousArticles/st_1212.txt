My coach and I are the only two that know . Throughout my career I ' ve always sort of kept them between him and I , and we ' re the only two that are really going to be able to help each other get to the goals that we have . We work well together . We ' re more relaxed now than we ever have been and we ' re having fun , so who knows what can happen ? The sky is the limit . We have a lot to do and the Olympics will be here before we know it .
