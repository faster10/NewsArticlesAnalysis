Beckenbauer just pips his great rival Moore by virtue of the fact he led his country to two major trophies , rather than one . Like Moore , Beckenbauer was a stylish defender , perhaps even more comfortable with the ball than without it . On the losing side as Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966 , ' Der Kaiser ' would have his time . Made captain in 1971 , he led his country to the European Championship in 1972 and , his crowning glory , the World Cup in 1974 .
