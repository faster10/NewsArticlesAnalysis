In this bit , an enormous , tasseled hat descends from the ceiling and lands on Colbert s head . The hat is an outward signifier of authority , allowing Colbert to issue proclamations that automatically become law . ( If someone gives you the finger , you get to keep that finger . ) The pronouncements made from under the hat s brim can be as reasonable as defending the practice of ? ghosting ? from parties or as far fetched as demanding that movies be just as good as their trailers , but they all align in presenting the world the way the Colbert watching populace feels it should be . After all , Colbert is a ? benevolent ? dictator . ( Also , John Cleese recently showed up with his own furry hat to engage in combat by headwear with Colbert . ) The bizarre wish fulfillment and nitpicky social commentary make the big furry hat one of ? Late Show s most fun new accessories .
