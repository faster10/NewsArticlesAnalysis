Like many families in Yemen with no alternatives , Mariam ' s sons left her and their young children to migrate to Saudi Arabia for work . She is 60 years old and sits in a one room hut which she built , together with her children , 10 years ago . She now shares it with her seven grandchildren . She tells me that like many others in the village , her sons were day laborers , and forced to migrate illegally to Saudi Arabia to look for work .
