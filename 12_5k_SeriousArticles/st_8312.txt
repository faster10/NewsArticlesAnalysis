The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses , including passengers , crew members and islanders , who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated . Schettino is also expected to take the stand in his defense to explain his theory that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4 , 000 people , not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32 . No passengers died on impact . All of the 32 victims died during the evacuation , which makes Schettino ' s alleged errors fundamental in proving his guilt or innocence .
