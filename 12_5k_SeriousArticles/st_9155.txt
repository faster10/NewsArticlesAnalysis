Originally , when we were planning out Superior Spider Man , editorial was like " This is a six issue arc , " and we said " No , we can go longer than that . " Then it was " OK a year , " and then we said , " You know if we go a little further , we can make it to the movie ! " It was a lot of faith from Marvel editorial , and I ' m grateful they let me try it .
