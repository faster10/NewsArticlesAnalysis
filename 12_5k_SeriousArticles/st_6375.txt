Then the silent series of snapshots layered upon one another : dead dogs on the side of the road with tongues hanging out of their mouths , a dead child with black eyes , Marines dying in helicopter crashes , Marines dying in gunbattles , Marines being killed accidentally by other Marines , destroying people ' s homes with artillery , killing other human beings violently , being terrified , being glad that you were killing other human beings violently , being exhausted , looking into the devastated eyes of the people whose homes you had just destroyed with artillery , sweating in the 110 degree heat for too long , being hunted , babies crying , things exploding , wishing you were anywhere else on the planet than where you were , bullets snapping by you , being horrified about making a mistake , thinking that at any moment you will be dead , thinking that you would not want to be anywhere else on the planet because this was your war and you were glad you didn ' t miss it , land mines , snipers , and the terror in your buddy ' s voice over the radio as he lies trapped underneath his vehicle begging for someone to get him some air support because they were taking fire from all directions and were sure that they were all about to die .
