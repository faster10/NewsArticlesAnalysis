The social network is trying to balance the less strict settings with two other privacy protections . When new underage users sign up for a Facebook account , their posts will be shown to a more limited audience by default only to friends instead of friends of friends . If a teen decides to change the setting to Public , she or he will see a pair of pop up warnings explaining what " public " means . One warns they could end up " getting friend requests and messages from people they don ' t know personally . " Default settings for existing teens with profiles won ' t change or affect past posts .
