Both al Nusra and Zawahiri rejected the Islamic State ' s takeover attempt . Al Nusra ' s leader said simply that " the Front ' s banner will remain as it is , without changing anything . " In a letter in June , Zawahiri declared that al Nusra was " an independent branch of al Qaeda that follows al Qaeda ' s General Command " and instructed the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant to disband and return to Iraq . The Islamic State rejected Zawahiri ' s instruction , in a rare act of open defiance toward the global leadership of al Qaeda . An audio message attributed to Baghdadi said , " We will not compromise , and we will not give up . "
