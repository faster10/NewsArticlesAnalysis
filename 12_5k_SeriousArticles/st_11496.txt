Freshman year is when I first found out I was undocumented . I was waiting at registration and when the clerk was going through my paperwork , she asked if I knew my Social Security number . I told her I ' d get it from my mom later . When I got home , my parents had told me about my " story . " I remember feeling ashamed of myself , that I was one of them , a " beaner . " I mean how could someone like me , someone who looks white , be an undocumented immigrant ?
