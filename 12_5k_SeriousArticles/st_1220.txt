I think most young men want to be wanted and proceed when they think they are . Yes , there are rapists who think they are wanted and that it ' s just incidental that they have a knife in their hand when she consents . But these are the criminal and pathological minds that not only won ' t follow this regime , they won ' t even think it applies to them . Other measures of avoidance and protection are necessary to save women from sociopaths . It ' s laughable to think this kind of predator would even notice , much less follow , these rules .
