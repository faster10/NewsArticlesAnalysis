" Thank your for your recent book order . I have enclosed a check to you for 2 . 95 . The reason for this is that this book is only in ' Very Good ' condition , while I mistakenly described it as being in ' Near Fine ' condition in my listing . Please accept my apologies for the error . ( Also , please note , the soiling that you see on the dust jacket is actually on the Mylar and not the dust jacket itself . ) "
