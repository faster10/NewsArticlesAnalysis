When asked how GFH could be owed more than 20m by Leeds , a GFH spokesman told the Mail on Sunday : ' As a result of the poor financial situation which they inherited at the club , GFH extended funding of around 20m of cash between July 2012 to November 2013 to keep the club solvent , acquire new players , give new contracts to existing players , pay down existing debt and meet other day to day liabilities as they fell due when the club ' s revenues were insufficient to do this .
