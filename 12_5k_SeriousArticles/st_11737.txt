The comedies that put Apatow on the map ( " Knocked Up , " " The 40 Year Old Virgin " ) took off from broadly italicized concepts , but " This Is 40 " lets you know in its title that it ' s less about a concept than a state of being . Pete and Debbie were supporting characters in " Knocked Up , " and now they ' re turning 40 , with two lovely daughters ( nicely played by Apatow ' s own daughters , Maude and Iris ) and two crusty fathers ( a terrific Albert Brooks and John Lithgow ) , who each have young families of their own . The couple still love each other , but their relationship is a mess a whirlwind of fights , lies , negotiations , teamwork , good sex , bad sex , and general confusion .
