Each gorilla group or family is headed by an adult male silverback . They are massive creatures , weighing up to 500 pounds , and are fiercely protective of their brood . Around them baby mountain gorillas tumble and play . They beat their chests just like their father , though the display is far less impressive . If you look closely , you may notice some of the mountain gorillas have lost a hand or a foot . Poachers ' snares are a problem , even in a well protected park in Rwanda I visited .
