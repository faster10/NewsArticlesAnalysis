Coker completed 25 of 30 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns against Michigan State . Instead of pounding away at a Michigan State defense that was stacked to stop Heisman Trophy victor Derrick Henry from running wild , Alabama aired it out . Saban doesn t leave anything to chance , but this is the same guy who had us thinking Connor Cook was the next Peyton Manning . It s always great when you can make a team one dimensional . That might be his greatest accomplishment of all .
