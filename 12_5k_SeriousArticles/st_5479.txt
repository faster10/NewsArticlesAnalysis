The past came to haunt us when the last minute news of the death of Mullah Omar , the former spiritual head of the Taliban , was deliberately leaked , motivated by spoilers to not only derail the talks but raise serious doubts about Pakistan s intentions . With this huge setback the talks failed and Kabul witnessed several major terrorist attacks , forcing Ashraf Ghani to backtrack on his peace initiative , deciding to only resume talks when Pakistan was ready to talk honestly about peace in Afghanistan . This week s conference is a real opportunity for the two countries to work out their differences and negotiate a settlement . To quote a former Afghan government official ( and now consultant ) , Habib Wayand , This conference is a chance to out flank the spoilers on both sides and produce a far sighted vision for the region , producing strategies for achieving lasting peace and prosperity . For its part , Afghanistan needs to avoid pursuing irresponsible and irrational anti Pakistan agendas , blaming Pakistan for every terrorist incident . Kabul needs to concentrate on job creation to prevent the exodus of young Afghans from the country and or their being recruited by insurgent groups .
