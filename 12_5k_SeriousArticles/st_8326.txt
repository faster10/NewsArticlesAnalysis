Of course , he has to get on the court first . If he is out , we ll likely see more minutes going to Shaun Livingston , Leandro Barbosa ( if he can make it back ) , Brandon Rush and Ian Clark . Andre Iguodala would probably be a nice DFS target with a few more minutes in the second unit with a higher usage rate . Iggy also had a good game with six points , three rebounds , five assists , five steals and one block on Monday .
