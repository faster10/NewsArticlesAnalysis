Sunday night s Critics Choice Awards broadcast live from the Barker Hanger in Santa Monica on A E won t necessarily shed much light on Oscar favorites . ? Primarily because these awards allow six nominees , not five . ? The Critics Choice also added , once the box office blockbuster finally opened after their voting deadline , the new STAR WARS which has been rightly dubbed STAR WARS GREATEST HITS for its assembling everything anyone might have loved from the past entries and repackaged them to launch a new franchise now that Disney owns Lucasfilm . ? But the Motion Picture Academy of Arts Sciences didn t choose STAR WARS as one of their eight Best Picture nominees and the J . J . Abrams entry is a longshot to win at the Critics Choice .
