" When you have diabetes , every second you ' re thinking about your blood sugar , " says Morgan . " You ' re wondering if you ' re high , if you ' re low , if you ' re OK , if you ' re giving yourself enough insulin , if you ' re not giving yourself enough insulin . With the artificial pancreas it takes that worry away because it ' s doing it for you . It lets you know if something ' s wrong . That way you ' re not always worrying about your blood sugar . "
