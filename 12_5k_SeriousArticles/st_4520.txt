The next day , the battle escalated , with advisers from both camps taking shots on the progressive question in interviews and on social media . And on Wednesday , this tug of war over who gets to define progressive moved to the CNN ? ? sponsored Democratic forum in New Hampshire , where Sanders buckled down on his claim that Clinton cannot call herself a progressive . Some of my best friends are moderates , but you can t be a progressive and a moderate at the same time . He continued : I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes 15 million from Wall Street . During her time with the moderators , Clinton gave her response . I know who stands with me , she said . I know what I ve done but I don t think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country .
