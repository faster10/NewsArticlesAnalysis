No . Different . Laughs I ' m not an interviewer . That ' s not what I do . But I am good at conversation . And , at worst , the people who do my show are acquaintances . I ' ve never had anybody that I didn ' t know . Actually , that ' s not true . Henry Rollins , which is one of my favorite episodes , I didn ' t really know him before I talked to him . No , they ' re great fun and we talk about so many different things . For me , it ' s really enjoyable and the audience seems to dig it too .
