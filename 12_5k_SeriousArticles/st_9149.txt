At only one point during the event did Christie s reputation for bullying critics appear to come close to being validated . A woman asked him to reconcile his views on abortion ? Christie is pro life , but with exceptions for rape , incest and the health of the mother ? with his support of capital punishment . In an interesting response , he answered that he views capital punishment as a means of defending the state , which is the same justification for his pro life stance which is designed to defend the unborn child . When the woman pressed him by asking what a woman who was impregnated through rape was supposed to do during the many months it might require getting a rape conviction , Christie bristled . Let s not get cute here , he chided the questioner , arguing that forensic evidence would immediately establish evidence for rape and discounting the likelihood that women will falsely claim rape to justify an abortion . What I m basically saying here is that we need to take the woman s word . To be clear , Christie softened his tone near the end of the exchange , and the woman thanked him for his response .
