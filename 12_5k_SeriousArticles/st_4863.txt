He was all over the place chasing the ball , Carroll said of Rubin . His play at the line of scrimmage was really stout . Taking on double teams , and splitting double teams , and making big tackles . And he does chase the football . He s been doing that all year long , and that s exactly what happens to guys that run like that , he s there . Earl Thomas is the first guy there and goes flying by the ball , and then Rubin got his hands on it and would not give it up .
