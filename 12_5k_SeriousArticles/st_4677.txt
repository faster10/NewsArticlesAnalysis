Pope a native of West Palm Beach , Florida , and the former lead singer of the Warped Tour vets Hey Monday admits she was hesitant at first to audition for " The Voice . " Last year , while still a member of her band , Pope turned down an offer to audition for Season Two . But after moving to Los Angeles to try her hand at a solo career , struggling to pay the bills and exhausting all her contacts in the music business , Pope says she was forced to reconsider her options when The Voice came calling again . " I almost passed on it again , " she admits . " I don ' t know why . . . just being in the band world , you tend to get a little proud . A part of me just didn ' t want to do this show because I wanted to do it from the ground up . I really wanted to do it the old fashioned way , which is kind of impossible nowadays especially when everyone thinks you ' re going to sound exactly like your band and no one ' s interested . "
