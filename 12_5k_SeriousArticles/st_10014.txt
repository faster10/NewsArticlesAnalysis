Divisional Round hero Fitzgerald has the path of least resistance in Arizona ' s receiver corps . Fitz runs nearly 60 of his routes in the slot , where he ' ll take on 32 year old journeyman Finnegan after Seahawks slot man Doug Baldwin caught eight balls against Carolina last week . After last Saturday night ' s 8 176 1 explosion versus Green Bay , Fitzgerald is averaging 114 yards with ten touchdowns in eight career playoff games . . . . Rather than utilize top CB Josh Norman to shadow last week , the Panthers employed Norman at left cornerback only , where he mainly dealt with Tyler Lockett ( 3 75 1 ) in coverage . Norman has been mortal over his last four games , giving up 163 yards and two touchdowns on 24 targets , 16 of which ( 66 . 7 ) have been complete . He still needs to be viewed as a difficult matchup , of course , but the charting stats are notable with Norman set to face a near equal distribution of Floyd and John Brown in Week 20 . Floyd does run a small majority of his routes against right cornerbacks ( McClain ) , and theoretically has a slightly better draw than Brown . Brown sees more slot action than Floyd , however , and will get plenty of chances against slow footed Finnegan . In DFS tournaments , Floyd ' s superior recent production will lead to a far higher ownership rate . And while I would agree Floyd is the better on paper play , rostering Brown would be a great way to secure monster big play ability and diversify oneself from much of the field . 4 . 34 speedster Brown has been no slouch himself lately , clearing 80 yards and or hitting pay dirt in all but one of Arizona ' s last eight games .
