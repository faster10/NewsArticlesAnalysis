The third option , which will most likely be employed by a litany of Republicans , is that they will try to ignore Trump . When asked if they support him , the candidate will not mention his name , but robotically aver : " I support my party ' s nominee . " A clever candidate would then send a dog whistle message to moderate voters by saying that they are not running for President and are tired of the partisan vituperation that is permeating American politics . The candidate will then say that they are ready to work with whoever is elected President . With that response , the candidate is signaling that he she is under duress to say that he she supports the party nominee , even though this is not the case .
