That Rose used the phrase as a public taunt , and was so widely applauded for doing so , plays into the problem . This was not history s greatest hashtag or hashtag of the year , even though it may be one of 2016 s most memorable . No type of consensual sex act should be wielded as a weapon to humiliate someone , even if that person has been responsible for slut shaming you . Two wrongs don t make a right . There s plenty to criticize West for , such as using Rose s stripper history to slut shame her , but that doesn t make it okay for her to in turn use anal play as an insult .
