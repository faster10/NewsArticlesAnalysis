LENNON : After what we saw from Wright this season , not very . At least in the short term . Despite the scary sound of spinal stenosis , Wright apparently was able to manage the condition , and should continue to be a productive member of the lineup . Terry Collins believed the team ' s schedule of sitting Wright every three or four days kept him healthy and that ' s a protocol they ' ll have to stick to for the rest of his career . Next year , Wright will have to deal with the condition for a full season , rather than just three months , but the experience should help . Wright also navigated a rigorous playoff travel schedule , starting with four cross country flights in a week ' s time , so the more spaced out regular season shouldn ' t be quite as demanding .
