' Hartley has more poor days at the office than Tom Youngs , ' added Cockerill . ' Tom ' s discipline and attitude to physicality is right on the line . It is not over the line , it is not under the line , it is right on it every time he plays . I don ' t know what Tommy ' s disciplinary record is but I think it is a lot better than the other bloke ( Hartley ) . Even mine is better than that ! '
