The children love the small 1880s farmhouse , which Alexis renovated and furnished several years before they were born . I keep special toys in the house , and lots of unusual books and things to catch their interest . We decided to have Thanksgiving there this year , at the very large soapstone topped kitchen table , amid the hubbub of preparation for the afternoon dinner . I wanted the table to be seasonal , indicative of turkeys and harvest , and I wanted everything to be for the children .
