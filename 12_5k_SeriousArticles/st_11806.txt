Essentially a balloon is a nylon bag known as an envelope filled with hot air , which is created by burning liquid propane in a steel burner . More heat makes the balloon rise , less makes it descend . Balloons fly in the direction of the wind . Dunnington described hot air ballooning as " man ' s first form of flight . " The French invented it in 1793 and since then it has been developed for sport and tourist rides . Balloons have also been used by the military .
