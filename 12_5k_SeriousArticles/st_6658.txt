When I shot " Training Day , " he was , " Absolutely you ' ve got to shoot down there in South Central where else you gonna shoot it ? ! " And I remember one day down on the set with Denzel , I was filming and I couldn ' t find him , and I looked up on the porch , and he was up there on the porch with all these older women , and they were cooking for him , and all the young kids were around , and he was just hanging out where all the people were . And that told me right away what kind of person he was .
