Indeed , if you read the Gospel narratives closely , it ' s not easy to say what actually happened . All four of them skip the actual Resurrection . That is , we never see Jesus waken . The first inkling of change comes when a few women close to him visit the tomb . Accounts differ on who turned up at the tomb that morning : Mary Magdalene , a close friend of Jesus , alone or with Mary , his mother , and with Salome ( who is either Mary ' s sister or the mother of apostles James and John ) .
