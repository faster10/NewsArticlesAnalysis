The best part about this is that Beckham is actually a good player , and will draw significant attention from the Patriots secondary on Sunday ( I m thinking simply Malcolm Butler one on one with safety help from Devin McCourty over the top , at a minimum ) . If the Giants want to keep up with what Brady is going to do to their soft defense , they will need Beckham to make big plays ? and unlike so many other Pats trash talkers in the past , he has a good chance to back it up .
