Golden State was disappointed with its performance in a loss at Detroit to begin the trip on Saturday , during which it shot a season low 36 percent from the field . The Warriors picked things up on the offensive end and made a statement with a 132 98 thrashing of the Cleveland Cavaliers in an NBA Finals rematch on Monday . The Bulls are adjusting to life without Joakim Noah ( shoulder ) , and Pau Gasol tried to pick up the slack in the middle all by himself with 31 points , 12 rebounds and three blocks in a 111 101 win at Detroit on Monday . Chicago shot 52 . 4 percent from the floor against that same Pistons defense that proved to be so much trouble for Golden State on Saturday .
