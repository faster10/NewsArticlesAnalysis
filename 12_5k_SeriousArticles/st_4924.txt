Bernie Sanders has a similar issue . With his economic ideas , Sanders is a steamroller ? the most aggressive exchange of the night came when Sanders critiqued Clinton s ties to Wall Street , from policy to donations . ( This prompted a strange and memorable counter from Clinton , who referenced female voters and Sept . 11 in an effort to show her quality as a political figure . ) But on everything else , and especially firearms , Sanders is muddled . There were parts of that bill which agree with ? I disagree , he said in reference to a law granting legal immunity to gun dealers and manufacturers . I am certainly , absolutely , willing to look at that bill again and make sure there s a stronger bill . This was a far cry from the quasi revolutionary rhetoric Sanders has become known for , and it hurt him ? he looked smaller on stage when he wouldn t give a simple answer on guns . Sanders performance left the impression that the Vermont senator doesn t want to be president . He wants to pull Clinton to the left and reshape the national Democratic Party s approach to economics . Outside of those ( vital ) issues , Sanders has nothing to say .
