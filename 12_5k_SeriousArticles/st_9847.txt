Aldridge usually can just shoot over defenders like Green , or back them down . But that ' s what makes Green exceptional , his ability to win matchups he should not be able to . If they leave Green in single coverage , and Aldridge cooks , can he be efficient enough to keep pace with the Warriors ' perimeter attack ? If they ' re forced to double , can they recover on shooters quick enough ? This a major concern for both sides , and if the Spurs signed LaMarcus Aldridge for anything , it ' s for this moment .
