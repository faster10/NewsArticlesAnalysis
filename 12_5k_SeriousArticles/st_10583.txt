Fatherhood should begin not with having a baby , but being thoughtful earlier about how one would support a child . Questions about becoming a father are not that different from those for a would be mother : Are you in a stable , committed relationship ? How well do you and your partner know each other ? How much do you trust each other ? Do you have enough education to secure a good job ? If you and or your partner are employed , do you earn enough to support your family ? Are you ready for the lifelong responsibilities of being a parent ?
