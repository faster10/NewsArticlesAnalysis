Variety critic Maureen Ryan wrote that thanks to exceptional work from Hamilton director ? Thomas Kail and several sterling supporting performances , much of Grease Live ! was as sweet and tasty as root beer float All in all , Grease Live ! got most of the big things right ? the colorful aesthetic , the rip roaring big dance numbers , the goofy , careening energy . If the central romance was a snooze , well , never mind ? that raucous hand jive will linger in the memory much longer . ?
