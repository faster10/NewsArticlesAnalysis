Martin O ' Malley ' s problem is that he ' s never given a clear definition of why he ' s running . He says he ' s a different kind of Democrat than either Bernie or Hillary , but his positions are pretty close to both of theirs on a multitude of issues . The differences are mainly ones of degree , not ideology . O ' Malley is trying to stake out some sort of position between Hillary and Bernie , but not to any noticeable success yet .
