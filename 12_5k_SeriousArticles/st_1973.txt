Sometimes , I feel disconnected from Gaza , but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa , I realize that it ' s where I and a thousand refugees belong . I find myself crying , missing a place I have never been to , but it ' s where my parents and my grandparents lived . I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land , the fence of roses they had , and her climbing trees and cutting fruits . How I miss that place .
