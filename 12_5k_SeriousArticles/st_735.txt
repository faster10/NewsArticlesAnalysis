A spiky Gothic fantasy with more than a passing resemblance to a Thai temple , the monument to Sir Walter Scott is a beloved fixture of the Edinburgh skyline . Just 61m high , the climb to the top doesn ' t sound daunting until you find yourself wedged into the preposterously tiny spiral staircase . The final curve is so notoriously tight that squeezing yourself out the final doorway requires the flexibility of a spelunker . Edinburgh mystery writer Ian Rankin once set the scene of the crime at the top of the Scott Monument , with much of the story focusing on the physics of getting a stiff cadaver down the twisty staircase . Not a claustrophobe ? This might make you think otherwise .
