So you re strongly implying that your son is suffering PTSD the day after boasting of being proud clingers of our guns , the same week he gets arrested with a weapons charge ? And hasn t it been over a year since a verbal and physical altercation involving Track and other family members , one that a police spokesperson said that alcohol was believed to have been a factor in ? And did you really not once mention the woman who s the alleged victim of your son s behavior ? Yeah , thanks , Obama .
