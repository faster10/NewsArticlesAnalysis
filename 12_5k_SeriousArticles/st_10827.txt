" The five year plans are no longer just economic in focus . Much attention is also given to environmental protection ( there are targets for cutting carbon emissions and curbing energy use ) and to social programmes such as health insurance . In the absence of democracy , the five year plans are the closest thing to an election manifesto for the Communist Party , laying out its longer term priorities . But since the party still has overwhelming power , the plans carry more weight than ordinary manifestos . All major actors ? local officials , banks and big companies , both state owned and private ? change their strategies and their rhetoric to look like they are in line with the plans . "
