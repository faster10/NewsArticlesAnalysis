I ' ve spoken to neighbors , athletes and colleagues , those who own guns and those who never have , about the gun issue , and all seem to fall in the middle . So , I don ' t quite buy the hard line we ' re told exists between those Americans for and against gun control . We are not as far apart as Congress or lobbyists would have us believe . None of the people I ' ve spoken to think like gun crazed NRA lobbyists or gun hating liberals . Real life is never black and white .
