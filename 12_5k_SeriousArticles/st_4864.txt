Cincinnati s strong start was no illusion . Between a defense that is harder to score on than any in the N . F . L . and an offense that can stretch the field , the Bengals started 8 0 and looked nearly unbeatable . Then the Houston Texans beat them soundly and now they go on the road to face the red shot Cardinals team . Mike Iupati , the left guard who is charged with protecting the Cardinals aging and frail quarterback and running back , was taken off the field in an ambulance last week with a neck injury . Arizona says he has been cleared to play , but if he is unable to go , or is limited , it could affect the Cardinals s game plan .
