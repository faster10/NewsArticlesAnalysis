If you ' re not a famous comic , you can get away with saying almost anything . I perform regularly in the comedy clubs in New York City which feature in my opinion the top comedians in the nation . But still , night after night you will hear material far worse than anything Maher , C . K . or even " the entertainer " Limbaugh would have articulated . There ' s no shortage of jokes that are anti everyone , including anti women , anti gay , anti minority , anti overweight people , etc .
