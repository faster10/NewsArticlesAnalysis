Reputed to be one of the USA ' s most haunted houses ( if there are degrees of hauntedness ) , St Louis ' Lemp Mansion has a long history of odd occurrences . Charles Lemp committed suicide in the house in 1949 and , ever since , strange things have taken place at the house , including doors that swing open spontaneously , glasses that leap off tables and break , and a tragically short lived reality TV show . Today , the mansion operates as a restaurant and inn that capitalizes on the morbid fame through murder mystery dinner theatre , Halloween parties and weekly tours by a noted ' paranormal investigator ' . Stay the night if you dare .
