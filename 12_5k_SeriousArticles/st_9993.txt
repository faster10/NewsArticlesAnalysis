" My bare arm set the detector off , and it raised the question of what was in my arm , " Lampitt said . " I got an X ray , and it indicated there might have been some kind of tool left in there at the time of the accident . But I thought it was peculiar that ( doctors ) thought it was a tool but didn ' t know what kind of tool , and they told me if it ' s not bothering you , leave it alone . "
