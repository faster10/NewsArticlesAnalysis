1 . India and Pakistan will have a comprehensive bilateral dialogue . The new word comprehensive replaces composite in the structured dialogue between the two sides . The composite dialogue , initiated in 1997 by the then prime ministers IK Gujral and Nawaz Sharif , had progressed unsteadily till it hit a roadblock after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks . The comprehensive dialogue will have the eight baskets of issues that were part of the earlier composite dialogue , and two additional components . Two new components are humanitarian issues and religious tourism . Already on the table were peace and security , confidence building measures , Jammu and Kashmir , Siachen , Sir Creek , Wullar barrage Tulbul navigation project , economic and commercial cooperation , counter terrorism , narcotics control and people to people contacts .
