7 . Patriots at Texans , Sunday , 8 : 30 , O U 45 : The Texans lead the league in plays from scrimmage . The Patriots gave up a lot of points but it was three return touchdowns mainly and that really gums up the works . Will Rob Gronkowski ( 24 ) play ? Why is he wearing a knee brace if the injury was a knee bruise ? I have no answers . Stay tuned . LeGarrette Blount ( 19 ) is not good . Please get him out of your lineups . James White ( 10 ) is getting the vast majority of the snaps .
