Hudson and Boone Isaacs elaborated on the current state of diversity within the Academy . Because the Academy hadn t publicly provided detailed membership numbers in the past , the most widely reported number came from a 2012 Los Angeles Times investigation , which found that only 6 percent of Oscar voters were people of color , and only 23 percent were women . But according to Hudson , that number is now up to 7 percent people of color and 24 percent women , and the Academy hopes to double that before 2020 .
