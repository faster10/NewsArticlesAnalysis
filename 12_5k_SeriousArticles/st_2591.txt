I taught law and I practiced law . I believe that there ' s even a strong argument this case doesn ' t have what ' s called standing under the law . But in any event , we would , of course , look at what the Supreme Court said , and then I would get to work on trying to figure out what it actually meant and how it would be applied in practice . And I would still be committed to doing everything I could to protect those hardworking immigrants who are here making a contribution to our country , making an economic contribution as well .
