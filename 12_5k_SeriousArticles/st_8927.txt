Remember when the Yankees were a managerial meat grinder ? They may not yet be the Steelers ( three coaches ? three ! ? in the 46 seasons since 1969 . THREE ! ) but they have had just two managers in the 20 seasons spanning 1996 2015 , and Joe Girardi hasn t won a postseason game since Game 5 of the 2012 ALDS . Yes , there are some Yankees fans who wouldn t exactly weep if Girardi were replaced , but the point is the Yankees leadership still is enamored with him .
