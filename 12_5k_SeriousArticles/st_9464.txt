15 . Colts at Jaguars , Sunday , 1 : 00 , O U OFF : Will Andrew Luck ( 32 ) play ? It s reportedly very unlikely . Is Blake Bortles ( 34 ) good ? He seems to be a product of garbage time , which is rare . And I stipulate that prevent defenses generally do work . However , nine touchdowns in 99 attempts down multiple scores . And 12 touchdowns in the fourth quarter for a team that s usually out of the game by then . ?
