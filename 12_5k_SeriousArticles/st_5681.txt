PAUL : ? No . I don t think we re any safer ? I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court . As we go further and further into debt , we become less and less safe . This is the most important thing we re going to talk about tonight . Can you be a conservative and be liberal on military spending ? Can you be for unlimited military spending and say , Oh , I m going to make the country safe ? No , we need a safe country , but , you know , we spend more on our military than the next 10 ? countries combined . ? I want a strong national defense , but I don t want us to be bankrupt .
