England have lost 2 1 to both Italy and Uruguay in Brazil , failing to qualify from the group stage for the first time since Sweden in 1958 , but Dyke said : ' Everybody thought we played really well in the first game against Italy and narrowly lost . In the second game it could have gone either way . We were not humiliated . They were narrow defeats , but it is for the football people , not for me , to identify why we did not win . '
