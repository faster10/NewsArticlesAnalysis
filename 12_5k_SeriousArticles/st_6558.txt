Tommy Evans , my producer , and Luis Grahame Yool , our cameraman , get to work and set up the first live shot . It ' s cold in Smolensk there are still piles of snow here and there . None of us have had much sleep . Luis arrived 12 hours ahead of us , Tommy and I flew in from Macedonia . All of us took the 400 kilometer drive from Moscow to get here . Each of us intent on our job , each of us grappling with the enormity of the day .
