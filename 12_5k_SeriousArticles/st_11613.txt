The speculation tying the timing of Letterman ' s departure to the introduction of Jimmy Fallon in February as the newest host of " The Tonight Show " probably has some validity . It ' s no secret that Letterman wanted to be Carson ' s successor and long saw NBC ' s " Tonight " as the crown jewel of late night TV , which it had been throughout the reigns of Allen , Paar and Carson . After being passed over for Leno , Letterman subsequently saw the NBC job go to Conan O ' Brien , to Leno again and then to Fallon .
