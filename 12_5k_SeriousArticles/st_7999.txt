Skinny : Having Edelman back will provide another pair of sure hands on the punt return along with Amendola . So that area should improve and not be quite as risky .

The punt team is fine when Ryan Allen gets the ball off , and since the gaffe against Philly , has done a better job making sure everyone is blocked . And no worries about Gostkowski . He s money .
