Mulder and Scully Meet the Were Monster compliments Jose Chung s ? From Outer Space by making bittersweet ? comedy , philosophical complaint , ? and meta commentary ? out of the show s other modality . It was a Monster of the Week episode ? that ? deconstructed certain metaphors ? common to the sci fi and horror ? genres , specifically that of the alienated outsider . Guy Mann , a gentle but still troubled version of the ? underground man archetype , ? crippled by self awareness and warped by modernity , could be used as a case study in an Existentialism 101 class that includes Dostoevsky , Camus , Wright , Sartre , Hesse , and , of course , ? Lee Kirby . It cleverly subverted some of the show s problematic perspectives ? the romance with conspiracy thinking the allegory for religious faith ? and just as cleverly reorganized them around ? better , sounder ideas , like wonder for the natural world ( still a treasure trove of secrets ) ? and empathy for the strangers among us . And yet , it was sugared with a sincere , knowing love for the show : the presence ? of comedian actor podcasting ? X Files ? fan ? Kumail Nanjiani Mulder s ring tone is ? The X Files ? theme song ( I m guessing it came from that Hollywood A . D . flick ) and the grave marker for Kim Manners , the late , great ? X Files ? director , whose credits include Morgan s first script , Humbug , the aforementioned Quagmire , and the show s most delightfully disturbing hour , Home . The underlying message : the Monster of the Week episodes really were the best , weren t they ? To paraphrase that headstone : Mulder and Scully Meet the Were Monster kicked it in the ass .
