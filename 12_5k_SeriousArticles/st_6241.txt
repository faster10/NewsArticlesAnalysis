Eddie didn t have a great week , so we went with James , Packers coach Mike McCarthy said . The idea was to come in there with a one two punch . What can I say about Crockett ? He s a guy that s just been working super hard and we felt like he deserved an opportunity . The initiative was more for special teams , but as we got going in the game and the things that were happening in the game and with his running style , I decided to stick him in there and he gave us a big spark . I think you see the way his teammates react to him and just the energy that he brings . So it was a good jolt for us .
