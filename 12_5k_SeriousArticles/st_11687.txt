I have experienced the tension and the joys of being both black and Catholic in my 25 years of ministry . I struggle with the fact that many of my brothers and sisters of African descent do not know this history or see themselves mirrored in the leadership within the Catholic Church in the United States . It is why I went on to study and teach at a graduate school , to help my brothers and sisters understand , and see their story as a part of the Catholic Church .
