As much as 10 per cent of the 60 million population of France is Muslim , largely from the French old colonies in Africa . The French have always prided themselves on their approach to secularism , which is different from the " melting pot " approach of the UK where migrant communities congregate in specific areas like Southall . In France , religion is strictly the private affair of an individual . There has been a strict separation between the church and the state for over a century now . The French have pursued a policy of assimilation . Whatever their colour or religion , as long as migrants speak French and adopt the French way of life , they will be integrated into French society . That is why France is introspecting why despite its best efforts to integrate minority youth , they have become radicalised . The French are also quite clear that we , in India , have dealt better with radicalisation and want to learn from us .
