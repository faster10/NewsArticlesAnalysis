Staring at those photographs , I was horrified . I had nightmares for years about getting shot in the head myself , or what my father thought about as he was dying . My grandmother only saw the handsome , charismatic young man her son once was . Fortunately for me , I have since seen photos of him in happier times : as a chubby baby boy smiling with his prom date . Who knew why my grandmother showed me . Maybe she wanted me to see the violence that took his life . Or what guns do when not used responsibly . I know she wanted the person who killed her son caught and punished . That didn ' t happen .
