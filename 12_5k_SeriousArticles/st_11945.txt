Historically the USSR did not share the introduction of Syrian troops to Lebanon in 1976 , something , about which the Soviets were neither consulted nor informed . In general the Syrian vision over Lebanon ( part of Greater Syria ) , or its contacts with Hezbollah in the 1980s could not be shared with Moscow . Moscow would also understand the Syrian enmity towards Iraq as damaging to the Arab cause . The level of closeness between Syria and the USSR also diminished the possibilities of Soviet policies in Iraq . The Soviets did not have a real desire to partake in the 1973 Arab Israeli war , as they were reluctant to risk detente with the United States . So while they were clearly not happy with the Arabs for risking what they had going on they were still obligated to contribute in microscopic portions like transporting Moroccan units to the line of fire in the Levant for example . While the Soviet Union would eventually place the PLO as a lever on anti imperialism , they did not exactly see eye to eye with Syria on this question . After the attack to the Palestinian movement by the Syrian army in October 1976 , only the Soviet Committee of the Afro Asian Solidarity reacted with a declaration in which it stated it did not understand why Syria attacked its natural allies in the struggle against imperialism . While the Soviet Union did not agree with Syria ' s actions , the Communist Party of the Soviet Union did not risk jeopardizing their relationship either .
