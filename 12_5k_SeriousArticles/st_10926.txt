The researchers chose not to disclose the names of the manufacturers studied so that their results could draw general attention to the product segment without focusing on specific brands . At present , not much is known about the health effects that occur from the levels of VOCs found in homes , according to the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency . Among the many chemicals considered VOCs are formaldehyde , benzene , toluene , perchlorethylene and acetone . The crib mattresses analyzed in this study did not contain those organic compounds . Understanding the sleeping environment is important to the health of infants and adults , added Richard Corsi , chair of the Department of Civil , Architectural and Environmental Engineering . " We need to better understand the complex sleep microenvironment to improve it and reduce the harmful effects of related pollutants on infants , " Corsi said . The National Science Foundation and the Nordic Research Opportunity program funded the project . Boor conducted the research in Finland , where he currently lives . The University of Texas at Austin is committed to transparency and disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest . All UT investigators involved with this research have filed their required financial disclosure forms with the university . None of the researchers have reported receiving any research funding that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of such a conflict . Notes for ParentsFindings suggest reuse of an older crib or an extended airing out period may help reduce infant VOC exposures . Reuse of crib mattress must be considered carefully because older mattresses might contain toxic substances , such as flame retardants , that have been banned .
