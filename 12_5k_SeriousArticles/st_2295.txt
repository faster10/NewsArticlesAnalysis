So I am happy to have never had a " Half My Heart Is in Iraq " sticker on my car because now , nearly nine years after the start of the Iraq War , people don ' t shake their heads and look down when I talk of my husband ' s deployments . They don ' t suck in their breaths and say to me , " What a waste . " My family doesn ' t have to suffer the comments and opinions of others for our part in a war that was never ours to choose at least not now , though I suppose that could still change .
