Avena : For all the hazards and disasters that occur , be it natural or man made , the children are the ones that suffer the most . They are the most vulnerable . Though not related to us in any way , even as total strangers , our hearts lead us to do something , anything , that can help lighten the load of these people . We may not be able to help everyone , but those that we can help by whatever means possible , then it is something worth doing .
