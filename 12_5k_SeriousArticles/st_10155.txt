Maybe in Welch ' s world , it is possible to go around with a big wad of money and buy off people at the drop of a hat , but the idea that someone from the Obama administration wandered through the top echelons of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to buy their cooperation in fixing the unemployment numbers is absurd on its face . Perhaps someone could be found who would be willing to be bought , but the rest would be singing their story on the national news .
