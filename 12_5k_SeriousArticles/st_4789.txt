My read of al Nusra , however , is that , like Zarqawi , it does not aspire to be a political player and is unlikely to settle for a political role in the new government . Instead , it may aim to play the spoiler for any transitional government and use its resources and political violence to empower and encourage other like minded extremists . With time and opportunity , al Nusra could not only add to regional instability in the Middle East , but also rekindle global jihad .
