I ' d say it looks good but it won ' t be any time soon . Because I just finished my movie and Larry ' s finishing a movie that he did for HBO ( the Jon Hamm starring Clear History ) . So by the time he writes some more and says , " Do you want to do them ? " the earliest we ' d start filming , if we did , would be the fall . We ' ll see . But I think it ' s pretty good .
