Facebook is relaxing its rules for teenagers . The 13 to 17 year old set now has the option to share photos , updates and comments with the general public on Facebook . That means strangers , and companies collecting data for advertisers and marketing companies , will be able to see select posts . Teenagers will also be able to turn on the Follow feature for their profiles , which would allow anyone they ' re not friends with to see their public posts in the main news feed .
