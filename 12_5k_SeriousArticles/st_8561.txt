New England won ' t know who they are playing until the Wild Card round concludes this weekend . " A lot of guys are banged up , so it ' s part of football season " . All but one of those attempts went to running backs , with Brandon LaFell being the lone exception on a pass that lost a yard . We obviously wanted to establish the run and try to control the game that way . They must finish ! With both Dont ' a Hightower and Chandler Jones getting then week off , both should hopefully be primed to go in two weeks .
