" We know this evil can be all around us , but we know in the end it ' s the strength that you provide , the hope ultimately that you provide , that can help these folks deal with this terrible tragedy and recover . And we ' ll stand with them , Lord , here across the ocean and the United States . We ' ll do our best to hold them in our arms , to be with them in this time of terrible grief and terrible tragedy .
