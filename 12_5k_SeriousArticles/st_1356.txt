But Melanie Amaro , 18 , redeemed it completely . FINALLY ! We heard her entire amazing performance of Beyonce ' s " Listen " cutting her off would have seemed illegal . I got total Whitney Houston Leona Lewis vibes from Melanie ' s voice alone . The fact that she has such a real , unassuming personality on top of the voice makes me want to go buy her entire album right now . It was so refreshing to see such a good natured reaction to the crowd ' s overwhelming reception . There ' s nothing worse than an 18 year old who knows she ' s the s . The judges were nearly passing out with excitement . " This is why I do this . People like you inspire me , " said Nicole , who will never come close to singing as well as Melanie in her life . She ' s the best contestant we ' ve seen by far .
