James ' sexual experience or rather the lack of it is a defining element in the story . " Adventureland " comes with the usual farcical peccadilloes of teen comedy barf gags , car wrecks and inopportune erections as well as several familiar supporting players from the Judd Apatow stable . Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are engagingly upbeat as the mutually besotted park managers , and Martin Starr ( from " Freaks and Geeks " ) is James ' cerebral , pipe smoking buddy , Joel . ( Mottola directed a couple of episodes of Apatow ' s short lived Fox series " Undeclared . " )
