Coaches aren ' t allowed to coach the All Star game two seasons in a row . And that rule really works this year . Popovich is the best basketball coach alive , and it somehow feels like he gets better every single year . The Spurs have the NBA ' s highest point differential and most stout defense despite losing so badly in that aforementioned contest against Golden State . This is remarkable , and shows just how far ahead of everyone else they were heading into that game . ?
