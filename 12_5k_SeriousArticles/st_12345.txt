Kansas City wasted time with poor clock management at the end of both halves . At the end of the game , trailing 27 13 after two fourth quarter field goals by Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski , the Chiefs took 5 : 16 to drive 80 yards . Charcandrick West scored a 1 yard touchdown to cut New England s lead to 27 20 , but there was only 1 : 13 left to play and the Patriots recovered Kansas City s onside kick attempt , essentially ending the game .
