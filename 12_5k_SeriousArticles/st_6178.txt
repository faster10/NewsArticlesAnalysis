LENNIE JAMES : I have to say it was slightly odd really , because it was getting back into the headspace and then going back even further into the rabbit hole . So that was on one level the trickiest part of the whole episode was going back to who he was at that point , and I actually had to go back and watch the episode , which is something I never do and I was quite surprised in myself that I did . But it actually did prove very , very helpful .
