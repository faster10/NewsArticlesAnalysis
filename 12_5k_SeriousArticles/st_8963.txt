I am not angry that in a deposition last year Deen admitted to using the N word . It is unfair to judge her based on only this , because no one is at his or her best during a deposition . No , I am angry because her views on race when she is in a more relaxed environment not under pressure , with plenty of time to think and choose her words are so wrongheaded that they require an apology . Now I fear that she has 75 million reasons to never look back .
