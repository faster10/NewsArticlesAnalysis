The fact is that the death penalty isn ' t justice , it ' s revenge . And in seeking it out , we would be engaging in something Tsarnaev is alleged to have sought in the name of Muslims killed in Iraq and Afghanistan . ( He made his motive clear when he scrawled " Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop " as he hid from police in a boat . ) Indeed , the death penalty is nothing more than institutionalized revenge . And while seeking revenge makes for great action movies , in real life it lowers our own standards .
