But let ' s not be too sanguine . World elites are beginning to understand that climate change is a very serious threat , but they aren ' t yet acting like it . As Plumer says , the current batch of measures being discussed in Paris is " laughably inadequate " to keeping warming under 2 degrees Celsius . The key test for the talks will be whether the current moderate policy momentum can be consolidated and strengthened ( particularly with independent verification of emission numbers ) . With a bit of luck , 2016 will look reasonably good for climate policy , but there is still very far to go before the progress is anywhere close to good enough .
