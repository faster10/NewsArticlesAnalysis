Why they ll win : The Patriots are going to put a lot of pressure on the Broncos ' offense . Until the Broncos show they can create anything vertically in the passing game , it makes sense to press the receivers and load up against the run as well . And New England has a very good , sound defense . Offensively , the Patriots looked a lot better with Julian Edelman back in the lineup . The Patriots are favored to win for a good reason . They ' re battle tested , as healthy as they ' ve been in weeks , and have the great Brady running the show . ?
