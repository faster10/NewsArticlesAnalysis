' He had a bad injury last year ( wrist ) but has recovered well . I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings although I don ' t know exactly how high he can go . I ' ve practised with him a couple of times , I haven ' t seen him play loads , but when you serve as well as he does it helps . I would imagine he ' s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while . '
