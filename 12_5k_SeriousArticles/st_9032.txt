" One of the traditions is that the justices come out from behind the red curtain , and they come out in groups of three , " Hofstedt said . " And this is right after the court marshal has done the ' Oyez , Oyez , Oyez , ' chant that ' s very famous and that ' s been going on all the way back to the days of John Marshall . And that brings the court to attention , everybody rises , the justices come out and that sort of brings that moment together . "
