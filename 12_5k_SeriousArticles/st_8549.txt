Gansa : ( laughs ) I did ! Everybody here just thought it was hysterical . First of all , to be on " SNL " means that we are in the national conversation and so it ' s an honor . People are watching the show and talking about it and talking about Claire ( Danes ) and Damian ( Lewis ) and Mandy ' s ( Patinkin ) performance and therefore it ' s easily parodied . But that is just a compliment to what they are doing and I thought they were brilliant . I thought the people that portrayed them were just hysterical and I know that Anne Hathaway and Claire are friends so it was fun . It was well done .
