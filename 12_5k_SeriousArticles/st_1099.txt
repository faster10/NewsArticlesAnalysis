Would this be more mental than physical ? Murray was asked on his way back from practice on Saturday . Both are obviously important , Murray said . They kind of go hand in hand . If you want to win against Novak , it s going to be physical . He returns very well , he is solid off both sides , moves great . You don t get lots of free points . Pretty much all of the matches I have played against him in slams have been very tough physically .
