Barkley : Barack has been a friend of mine for a long time . I met him when I was writing my last book , and he was running for Senate , and I got to know him , and we stayed in contact . I consider him a friend . I think he ' d make a fantastic president . I want to make it clear that if I didn ' t think he could do the job , I wouldn ' t vote for him . I think he ' d make a fantastic president . And I ' m not voting for him because he ' s black . I think he ' s a great person .
