The Jenkins song has a similar structure , a similar melody and many of the same lines , but what Cash added was his distinctive directness " I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die " is all Cash and that uptempo chicka chicka rhythm . He never denied using Jenkins ' song . " He will tell you in a minute that he stole the song , " his longtime bassist , Marshall Grant , told Hilburn . " But he made it a more interesting song . " ( Cash did , though , end up paying Jenkins 75 , 000 . )
