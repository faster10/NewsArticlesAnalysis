Jacksonville Jaguars : Sunday should be a favorable matchup for the Jaguars . The Ravens are giving up the fourth most passing yards per game in the NFL ( 283 . 9 ) and have given up 16 touchdown passes while intercepting an NFL low three passes . QB Blake Bortles ( 17 TD passes ) and receivers Allen Robinson ( 707 yards , six TDs ) and Allen Hurns ( 635 yards , six TDs ) , provided he plays , should be able to put up good numbers . The Jaguars have been very good against the run ( 94 . 3 yards per game allowed , seventh in the NFL ) and Ravens QB Joe Flacco has thrown only 10 touchdown passes with eight interceptions . This points to a Jaguars victory , except they keep making mistakes at critical times that cost them chances to win games ( Indianapolis , Tampa Bay , New York Jets ) . Until those stop happening , it ' s hard to pick the Jaguars to beat anybody . Ravens 24 , Jaguars 17 . Mike DiRocco
