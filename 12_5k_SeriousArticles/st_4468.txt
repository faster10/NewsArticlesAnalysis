The twin towers in New York fell more than 14 years ago the statute of limitations on post 9 11 panic has expired . Yet , Americans have never been more fearful . I ve increasingly come to feel that I don t recognise my own country . I was a little boy in the early 1960s , and , of course , we all had mushroom cloud nightmares then . But the threat of nuclear war was real , not imagined . And even the anti Communist paranoia of that time could not eclipse Americans fundamental self confidence . The besetting national sin has always been self righteousness and complacency , not fear and loathing .
