Historically , the caucuses have been viewed with some disdain . Some years ago , ? The New York Times ? called them quaint and suggested that Iowans were too far removed from the mainstream of American concerns to have this responsibility . Others have argued that because Iowa is not as diverse as the nation ( though , again , it s more diverse than its stereotype ) , its voters should not be entrusted to winnow ? the field . Barack Obama s win in 2008 might ? have dispelled that ? line of criticism . But there are still questions about whether Iowans focus on their own parochial issues or reflect national trends as they vet the candidates .
