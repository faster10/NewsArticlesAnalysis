It s a bit more complicated for Democrats . The out in the open voting can take hours to complete , with attendees having to cast their vote by physically standing in an area delegated to that candidate . If a Democratic hopeful fails to get 15 percent of the vote , they are eliminated in the first round . A so called realignment period then takes place , where voters who have lost a candidate are free to support another , often through methods of persuasion . Those results are collated across the state in all precincts and eventually translated into votes for delegates who will represent their states at the party conventions this summer .
