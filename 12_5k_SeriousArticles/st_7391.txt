It s a tribute to the great player that he is , the career that he s had so far in the NHL and the player that he s going to go down as when he s finished playing and that s as one of the best players to ever play in the NHL , Subban said . He s one of my favorite players growing up and it s a sign of respect . For me , it s a huge honor for that five minutes I was Jaromir Jagr . It s pretty cool . ?
