Lofgren : They ' ve been off and on , but we got together in the second week of January . We had to address what was in front of us , which was a lot , and kind of take our time and experiment and let things evolve . There ' s so many changes . Certainly the biggest change of all is Clarence , which is a terrible loss . I ' ve been in the band for 28 years , and I ' m pretty sure it ' s accurate to say that the band has never gone on the road with three and a half albums of new material . When Bruce put out the " Darkness On The Edge of Town " package , there were 23 unreleased songs and they never toured behind that . And then you had 11 new songs . All this material is really valid and great and we ' ve never integrated it into our show , which is already hundreds of songs that we haven ' t presented in over two years . It was an abnormal amount of new material to disseminate . It ' s just a giant , beautiful jigsaw puzzle of music .
