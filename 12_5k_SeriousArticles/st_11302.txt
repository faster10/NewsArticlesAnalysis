Roberts : Now he never really admitted to smoking marijuana . . . . The United States Olympic Committee isn ' t going to sanction him , it looks like , but did call his actions disappointing . But to the greater issue that you were talking about , in terms of his endorsement deals , do you think anybody is going to say , well , this is the straw that broke the camel ' s back with this guy ? He had one incident back in 2004 . But are you going to dump Michael Phelps because of this picture ?
