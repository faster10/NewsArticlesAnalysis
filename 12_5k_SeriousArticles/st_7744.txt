Clemson had a remarkable performance in a 37 17 win over Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl . A six game losing streak undermined a 5 0 start as they dropped out of contention last week . Bama s dominance on defense made it possible to rest Henry , so expect him to be ready for a heavy workload in the title game . One could argue that , given college football s increasing parity over the past 20 years , Saban s accomplishments eclipse even that of Bryant . Maybe the analysts are right and Alabama wins another National Championship , but I tend to believe they will be wrong yet again when it s all said and done . Meanwhile , Clemson coaches and players appreciate the point spread motivation .
