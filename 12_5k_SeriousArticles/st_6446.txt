What Holmes tells you is be careful , label everything , make sure everything is organized and accessible . That way , not only will you know where to find it , but you will remember it better . We really only know what we can remember at any given moment . It doesn ' t matter if you memorized the information , and it ' s in your attic somewhere . If you can ' t access it when you need it , you might as well not know it at all .
