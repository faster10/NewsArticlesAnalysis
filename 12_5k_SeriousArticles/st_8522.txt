Vin Weber , a prominent GOP strategist , told me that many Republicans remain in denial mode about the possibility of Trump s nomination . How can you be the leader in national polls , Weber says , and in the early states , and maybe even in money , and be counted out ? In spite of saturation media coverage , Weber thinks the Trump effect on the GOP is understated . The attention of commentators has often been focused on the horse race aspect of the campaign or on the narrative of insider vs . outsider , rather than on what Weber calls Trump s transformational message .
