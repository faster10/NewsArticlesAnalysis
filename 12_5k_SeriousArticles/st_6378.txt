So , if any of you reading this are struggling with post combat emotions , please consider these three simple things things that took me a long time to understand : You are not alone , it ' s OK if you are not OK and it really does help talk to someone about it . There is no shame in not being Superman . Call your buddies from the war . Call the Wounded Warrior Project . Call the Veterans Affairs ' hot line . Do whatever you need to do to talk about what you are feeling .
