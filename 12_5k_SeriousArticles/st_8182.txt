Cincinnati Bengals : Only once since Marvin Lewis took over as head coach in 2003 have the Bengals swept the Steelers in a season . Pittsburgh has done the same thing to the Bengals six times during that span . Of course , the Steelers can t do that this year , having already lost this season s first meeting . But it does appear that a Steelers win will happen this week . Why ? Because of health . Unlike the previous time these teams played , Pittsburgh has the healthier roster . The Bengals have been without defensive backs Adam Jones and George Iloka in practice this week , raising questions about what the secondary could look like Sunday afternoon . Consistent offensive health has been a big reason why the Steelers are averaging more than 35 points and 525 yards in the four games since these teams last met . Steelers 24 , Bengals 21 .
