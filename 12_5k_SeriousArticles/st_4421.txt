The new situation has raised the hopes of an early resolution of the issue . However , it is important to note that this is only the first step and there is considerable work to do before the tax is introduced . Once the Bill is passed ? and it has to be ratified from half the number of states ? the next task is to constitute the GST Council and set the business in motion . The Council should draw up a clear time table and put out a detailed work plan to conform to it . Each of the states , besides the Union government , will have to pass its own GST legislation . There is considerable bargaining to do before the final decisions are taken on the list of exemptions , the structure of rates , the place of supply rules , training of tax collectors , mechanism to deal with the issues of transition when the VAT is replaced by GST and taxpayer services .
