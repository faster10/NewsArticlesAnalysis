Getting featured on iTunes is obviously awesome , but what exactly does it get you ? When Apple included our app on its featured lists , we enjoyed a predictable flow of downloads almost identical in volume every single day we were parked there . Especially fascinating , the " New Notable " list gave us almost exactly twice as many daily downloads as the " What ' s Hot " list . I ' m assuming this is because , when you tap the " Featured " tab on the " App Store " app , " New Notable " pops up by default .
