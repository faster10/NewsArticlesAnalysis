Rosewall is now 81 and stopped playing tennis only about three years ago because of persistent pain in his right shoulder . He collapsed in Rome in 2011 and was hospitalized for several days but has rebounded well from the scare and said he now took heart medication . He still has the firm handshake and brisk gait of a younger man . He still parts his thick hair on the left and still weighs 143 pounds , just as he says he did when he finally stopped competing at the highest level .
