Since taking the helm at the Fed in February last year , Ms Yellen has , so far at least , been the model of caution . That is exactly what the White House wanted when she took over from Wall Street stooge Ben Bernanke ? a steady hand at the wheel , nothing in the way of perceived conflicts of interest , and a vast improvement on several of her predecessors . Unlike them , though , her current crisis is self inflicted . What the Fed has needed over the past 12 months is someone willing to act rather than someone reluctant to do so . ?
