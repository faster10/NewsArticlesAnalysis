But Miley is not the only person who craves fame . America is filled with people like Miley . Just watch any " Real Housewives of , " " American Idol " auditions , " The X Factor , " etc . Even I enjoy making appearances on cable TV . Of course , I don ' t appear on these shows like Cyrus , scantily clad with my tongue hanging out and twerking nonstop . ( And I ' m sure not many people would want to see me do that . )
