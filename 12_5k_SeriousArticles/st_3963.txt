You can try to offload some of your costs by offering your guys equity on the other hand , everybody tries to get free ( or close to free ) apps by offering developers equity . So unless you can really sell them on the strength of your idea ( or bring something totally rad to the table , such as a celebrity ) , you better be prepared to pony up some cash . Of course , adding in some equity as a bonus is never a bad idea , so you ' ll probably want to dish out some shares too .
