" John Elway was probably as gifted a big athlete at quarterback as I ' ve seen otherwise , " Gettleman said . " John had the speed , the size , the power . I can still in my head remember that Super Bowl against Green Bay when he took off and he did the whirley bird . I was sitting with my wife and two boys and said , ' We just won the game . ' Cam , because of his size and speed , is just like that . "
