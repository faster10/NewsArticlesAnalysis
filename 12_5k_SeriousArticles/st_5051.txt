MR : Not necessarily my friends because I talk to them all the time . Just different people . It could be as random as the coffee shop conversation while you ' re waiting in line , those were the bits and pieces that would get under my skin . At least with my friends i could say , " Guys , come on ! Let me show you pictures . You could visit me . " And it was just this other . . . you sit in a classroom and there is a limit to the amount of times you can correct people or even just if you are meeting someone for the first time , you ' re not going to go into this tirade of why you believe that their perceptions were wrong .
