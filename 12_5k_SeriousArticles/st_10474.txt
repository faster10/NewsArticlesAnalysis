These values people always like to remember in times of tragedy , when Charlie Hebdo ? happened , or the attacks on Paris , or the attacks on Beirut , when we talk about the values of liberalism , equality , democracy , fraternity , all of these things if these values themselves are threatened because of what a bunch of murderers did , then that means that we did not really believe in these values in the first place . . . . If you really believe in the values that you profess to believe in , then the first thing you should do , and I know it ' s not easy , is to say that refugees are welcome after this . Because they are the ones that are going to be punished the hardest even though they have nothing to do with it . ?
