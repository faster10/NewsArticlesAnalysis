This competition has always meant a lot to Wenger . He is not a manager who leans too heavily on records or history , but spoke with some pride yesterday about his own achievements in the cup . " I ' ve won the FA Cup six times , that means I take it seriously , " he said . " In the whole history , nobody won it more . I show that I care about this competition , and if nobody wins it more often than I did , that is some way I can justify what I have said . "
