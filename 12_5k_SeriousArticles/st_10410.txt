He was introduced to folks from West Point by his ROTC Supervisors . They told him they could help him get an appointment based on his grades and performance in ROTC . He considered it but in the end did not seek admission . There are Service Connected nominations for stellar High School ROTC appointments . Again he was the top ROTC student in Detroit . I would argue strongly that an Appointment is indeed an amazing full scholarship . Having ran several Congressional Offices I am very familiar with the Nomination process .
