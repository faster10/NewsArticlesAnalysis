Trump is a TV candidate in a digital era . The Media Research Center calculates that during one month of evening news broadcasts on NBC , CBS and ABC , Trump got 60 per cent of coverage , Cruz got 30 per cent and the Florida senator Marco Rubio just 4 per cent . That , very simply , is why he has seemed irrepressible . He was never off the telly . But , partly because of that , he wasn t on the ground meeting the people of Iowa .
