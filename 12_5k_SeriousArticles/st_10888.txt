Zyla : If you think about it like this , you are the subject of a great painting and what you chose to fill in around you illuminates you , or it can make you recede . I feel there has been a lot of mystery around what looks good on people . My goal with all of this is I really believe that everyone has the right to look and feel fantastic . Everyone loves compliments , especially the compliment " You look great , " as opposed to " Great fill in the brand name skirt here . "
