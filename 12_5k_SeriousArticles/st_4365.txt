That ' s where " The Force Awakens " really is all about the next generation . New heroes Rey , Finn and Poe , villains like Kylo Ren and droids like BB 8 are capturing the imaginations of kids today just as Leia , Luke , Han , Darth Vader and R2 D2 did for me and my friends nearly 40 years ago . Watching the wonderment on the 7 year old ' s face as ( thing that happened in the movie that I won ' t spoil for you ) , and the stunned amazement when ( another thing that happened in the movie that I also won ' t spoil for you ) brought back all the same memories from my own childhood . Even our daughter had questions about what happened in the film , showing what could be a little growing interest of her own .
