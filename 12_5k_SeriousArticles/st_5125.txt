Winners and losers are beginning to emerge in Syria , though not all of those involved can see this . Isis is looking increasingly battered by a medley of enemies backed by the US and Russian air forces , though it is nowhere near defeat .

The Syrian army is short of men and , while its morale may be higher thanks to the Russians , it is still exhausted by five years of war . The Syrian Kurds are successful , but averse to being used as cannon fodder by the US and they are nervous of Turkish intervention .
