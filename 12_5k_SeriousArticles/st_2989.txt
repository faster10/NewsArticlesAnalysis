Will . i . am : Really I want to say my phone . I like my phone because that ' s the thing , but really it ' s my laptop . I can Tweet with my phone and I have all my addresses in it , but now it ' s backed up to my computer . So if I lose my phone , I lose it . It has a code ( password ) on it . Nobody ' s going to get into it . I just get a new phone and download . It ' s really my laptop that I can ' t live without .
