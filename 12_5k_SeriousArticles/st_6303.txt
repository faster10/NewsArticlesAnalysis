Believe me , this guy is one of the best ticket sellers in the business . He reminds me of a young Ricky Hatton in that respect . When it comes to sales , you tend to have box office sales and sales done by the fighter . This guy sells more than 2 , 000 himself to his fights . That ' s an incredible amount . The best thing is , he delivers most of them in person ! He ' s a top fighter and a good guy .
