HIGH POINT : As Cubs fans will tell you , simply being competitive was a major step up after several years of rebuilding . Though the Cubs were never really in position to win the NL Central , they were playoff contenders right away thanks to a 12 8 April . With their full compliment of players locked in by August , the Cubs really took off , finishing the season on a 42 18 run . Over that span , the Cubs enjoyed six winning streaks of at least four games . That ' s quite remarkable . If we ' re talking high points though , eliminating both the Pittsburgh Pirates and St . Louis Cardinals in the postseason would be difficult to top .
