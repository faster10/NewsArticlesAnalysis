The Raiders trailed 16 13 when they forced a Lions punt and nothing went right . Neiko Thorpe was flagged for a block in the back on the punt to force the Raiders to start from their own 8 yard line . On first down , Clive Walford was called for holding , with it just barely being ruled to have occurred in the field of play and not in the end zone . On the next stop , Amari Cooper dropped his second pass of the game and finally on third down , the Raiders were flagged for another holding . This time it was on Donald Penn and was certainly in the end zone . It resulted in a safety and the 18 13 Lions lead with 5 : 30 to play . The Raiders never got the ball back .
