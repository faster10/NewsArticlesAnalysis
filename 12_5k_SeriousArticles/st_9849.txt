Such experiences are normally a huge wake up call but , if flipped around , can also be massive motivators . When you get picked for England you can start ' living the dream ' and think it will last forever 30 years on from my England playing career I remember that feeling only too well but the reality is that your time at the top goes in a flash and you have to make every minute of every game count . To be left out for any reason other than ability is something that will haunt you forever .
