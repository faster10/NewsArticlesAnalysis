It seemed hopeful at the time . Sadly , today it is laughable . We are days away from severe forced spending cuts that will do nothing but hurt the very people the GOP is trying to win over . Gov . Bobby Jindal of Louisiana recently declared that Republicans had to stop being " the stupid party " if they were ever going to put together the long term winning coalition they needs to reach the White House in 2016 . Sorry , governor : your party didn ' t listen .
