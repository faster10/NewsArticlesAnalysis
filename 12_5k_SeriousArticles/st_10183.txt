If someone could point me to the experienced Republican candidate who has thoughtful , serious ideas about how to combat ISIS , that would be great . Because I can ' t say I ' ve noticed him or her among the competitors . And there ' s no reason to think the Republican electorate would be interested in that person . When Donald Trump says he ' d " strongly consider " closing down mosques , don ' t wait for the voters to rise up in disgust . A recent PPP poll found that 30 percent of Republicans in Iowa believe Islam should be outlawed another 21 percent weren ' t sure . In North Carolina , the GOP electorate split 40 40 on whether Islam should be legal .
