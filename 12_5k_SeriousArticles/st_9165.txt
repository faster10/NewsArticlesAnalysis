Nutter has taken a 10 percent pay cut since the days of the Great Recession , circa 2009 , and sources in the Mayor ' s Office say that he also has never taken a cost of living adjustment increase . This means that , although the mayor could collect as much as 213 , 968 , he takes home 177 , 679 for 2015 . He told me yesterday that he ' s looking forward to upping his income when his time as mayor is up , but wouldn ' t say whether that ' ll be achieved in the public or private sector .
