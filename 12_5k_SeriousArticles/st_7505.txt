The missed opportunities were all over the place , and made the Chiefs performance here a significant separation from their 11 straight wins . They did not force a turnover , something they did in each of those wins , and in particular missed a few chances for interceptions . Dee Ford had an opportunity to sack Tom Brady on the Pats first drive , but Brady sidestepped him and the Patriots ended up with a touchdown . It was that kind of game , is what I m saying .
