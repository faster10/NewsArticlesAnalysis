People tend to think language can be acquired just by receiving enough inputs to " crack the code " that hearing mom and dad speaking Spanish is enough . But language is much more than the sum of its rules . Language is also the identity you make in it the experiences , the relationships , and the memories that come from using the language across many contexts . In many U . S . Latino communities , receptive bilingualism a pattern in which parents speak to children in Spanish , who respond in English is common . While comprehension is an important language skill , speech production and literacy skills are equally necessary for jobs in the growing bilingual labor market .
