Cage : I ' m comfortable with the mole , yeah . I mean , yeah , he ' s different , he ' s got issues , you know ? I don ' t want a perfect character , I want a character who has , as strange as it sounds , some humanity , some flaws , some needs . But to be fair , I ' m not in a lot of this movie . This is Darwin ' s movie , um Sam Rockwell and Penelope Cruz ' s movie they ' re the stars . I ' m only in it at the beginning and the end .
