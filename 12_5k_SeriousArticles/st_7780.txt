The win raises the question of whether Saban s dominance in the modern era , complete with a deeper SEC , a conference title game and two College Football Playoff games , is more impressive than Bryant s was several decades ago .

Bryant won three in five years from 1961 to 65 , and back to back titles in 78 and 79 . His 14 overall SEC titles ? he won one at Kentucky ? may never be topped .
