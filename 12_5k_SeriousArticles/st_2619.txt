RB Adrian Peterson : Coach Mike Zimmer told his team after the game that the Vikings finally " ran the ball the way I expected us to run it , " and Peterson ' s decisiveness was a big reason why . He finished with 103 yards on 20 carries , despite getting just six rushing attempts in the second half and not breaking a run longer than 12 yards . The Vikings opened holes for Peterson with a power run game and the running back wasn ' t dancing before hitting his holes like he did last week .
