The Academy is not trying to be politically correct , never has been , Hudson said . We are the best of the best in the film industry . We don t feel that we have looked far and wide enough for the best of the best . It s not about political correctness , it s about building the best team , the best institution , the best artists . Because unless you have the best artists as members , unless you have the best artists voting on the Academy Awards , you don t have a real reflection of the best of our film culture .
