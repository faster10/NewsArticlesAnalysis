The other big change ? This accident was sobering for cruise travelers , many of whom in the past might have tried to skip the muster drill or chat away during the safety instructions . Cruise Critic readers understand , better than before , that while the cruise lines are responsible for safety , they too have a role to play in cruising safely . Post Concordia , I ' ve been to 14 muster drills on a variety of ships and cruise lines and have noticed that people take them much , much more seriously now . They listen . And on one ship passengers even asked questions . I have never seen that before !
