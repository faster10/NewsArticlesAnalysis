The views of Ms Lu and Ms Chen contrasted with many others . In the sprawling port city of Guangzhou , Su Wihua , 36 , said she now planned to have another child . I have looked forward to this for so many years ? even had dreams about it , Ms Su told the Associated Press . I cried every time when I woke up and realised it wasn t yet true . I thought it was so unfair . I do not care if the second child is a boy or a girl , at my age , as long as he or she is healthy . ?
