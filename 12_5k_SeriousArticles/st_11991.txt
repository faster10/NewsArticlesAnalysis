In third place is President Barack Obama , who steps down following November 2016 elections , and who has become the first ever sitting US leader not to be in the top two . His ouster by Merkel , and his trailing of Putin , reflects partially his policy of avoiding getting America entangled in further foreign wars , and partially his own status as a president coming to the end of his term . Bill Clinton is the only former US president to make the list , at 64th place . Presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are 58th and 72nd , respectively .
