On February 1 , Republican caucus voting will take place in rooms across all of Iowa ' s 99 counties . But despite the diversity of geographic locations , the people in the rooms will be remarkably similar to each other . And the outcome will be predictable as well . A few candidates will divide up two thirds of the caucus votes but represent only a small fraction of Iowa ' s total population . They will not even represent the largest political party in Iowa , which is neither Republican nor Democrat the plurality of Iowans register as No Party . And of course they will not even remotely represent the diversity of voters nationally .
