having a hazard like that doesn t mesh with the league s focus on player health and safety . So basically what you re saying here is that Reggie is in the clear to go ahead and file a lawsuit against the Rams organization as a whole ( including the structure of their stadium of course ) . If he is not the only player to have had an issue with this supposed concrete , then again he contains all of the leverage in this particular situation . Case closed folks .
