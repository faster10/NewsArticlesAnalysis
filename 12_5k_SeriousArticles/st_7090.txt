The eclectic shop is housed in a converted garage and outboard motor repair shop and is where you ' re sure to see loads of locals crowded around tables or sitting along a beautifully recovered church pew . This is the place to be when the weather turns gloomy and the gas stove is roaring in one corner . Rain never sounds as good as when it ' s thumping heavy on the coffee shop ' s tin roof , and when the storm passes , check out the view of the river and bridge from the back deck .
