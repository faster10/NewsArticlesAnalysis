Cast in the 1972 classic film The Godfather , Abe Vigoda played the role of Salvatore Tessio , described by the Washington Post as an underworld figure who betrays Marlon Brando s Don Corleone and pays the price . Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola selected Vigoda for the role as part of a larger plan to cast lesser known stage actors in his epic movie . Indeed , Abe Vigoda worked in a number of Broadway productions in the decade prior to his role in The Godfather , including a spot in The Man in the Glass Booth , as noted in Vigoda s online biography .
