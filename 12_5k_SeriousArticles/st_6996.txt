So while we might be able to help Syrian Kurds expel ISIS from parts of its dominion with a lot of air power , guided by Special Forces troops , and a lot of luck , what then ?

Will the Turks watch calmly as a group that they believe sponsors terrorist attacks in their homeland expands its military power and strategic depth ?
