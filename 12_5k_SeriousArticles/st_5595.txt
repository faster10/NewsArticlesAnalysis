For me , nobody knows what I do on a daily basis , Drummond said . Nobody knows how long I sit in the gym and shoot every night shooting free throws , so they just see the outcome , and I m not shooting well right now so they feel like I don t take the time to do that . But I probably take more time than they do their jobs shooting free throws . So for somebody to say that , it s a little bit disrespectful to me . . . .
