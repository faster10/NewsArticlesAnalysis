For years after that , we always celebrated St . Patrick ' s Day with a big traditional feast . My sister Laura Plimpton always makes it for her family , adding parsnips . My friend Torie Hallock , in Somesville , Maine , and her husband , Compton , actually turned me on to corning my own beef . The soda bread is a delicious , crumbly version I created one morning when I had few ingredients in my larder and needed to make several loaves for the Irish in my life .
