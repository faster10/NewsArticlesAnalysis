Stanchfield ' s character is also facing a relationship in flux with on and off lover David Rosen ( Joshua Malina ) , the newly appointed U . S . Attorney for the District of Columbia . The pair had only a brief encounter in the premiere , with David telling Abby to " return his calls , " but Stanchfield promises , " It ' s not over between Abby and David . . . . They try . The best way to describe it is , Abby and David have never done normal they ' ve never actually been on a proper , normal date . There ' s definitely an attempt at normal in coming episodes that will be interesting for fans . It ' s been interesting to play . They really are two people who fit . They ' re a good match together because they ' re both sort of misfits in a way . "
