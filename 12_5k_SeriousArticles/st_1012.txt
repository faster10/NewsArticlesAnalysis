' In that role it ' s important you have to understand that if you lose the ball , the opposition are in a dangerous position to counter attack . Whereas if I was playing a little bit higher , on the edge of the box , you can lose it and you have players around who can get the ball back . You learn how they use the ball and you learn when it ' s a good time to dribble or sometimes pass . I enjoy playing that role . I enjoy getting on the ball and starting attacks . '
