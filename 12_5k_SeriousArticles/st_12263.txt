The Mets will give Murphy the 15 . 8 million qualifying offer . ? He is almost certain to reject it , and it is conceivable he could test the market , not find it much to his liking and circle back to the Mets . Cespedes market would have to fall precipitously from expectations , perhaps down to the 90 million to 100 million range for the Mets to be interested , and even then my gut says they have seen the best and worst of the player , don t really think he is an everyday center fielder and will let him leave .
