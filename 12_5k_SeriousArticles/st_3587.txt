On Red Bull , it is always a surprise if they don ' t waltz away with the victory because we have become so used to that from previous years . It is too early to say that is not going to happen here because they have surprised everybody before so we have to be very careful . Red Bull is Red Bull , and they are the benchmark and the best team , so we assume that they are going to be the benchmark again , but if not , then great . However , we are focused on ourselves and making sure we get the best out of what we have . What others do is not really in our control .
