The world No 2 said : I believe in myself . I believe in me and Jamie as a doubles team , as well . But it ' s obviously going to be tough . Goffin ' s a top quality player when he plays well . He ' s ranked 16 in the world and plays well on the clay . I ' m aware that will be a very tough match to win . I believe we can win the tie , but it ' s going to be tough , for sure .
