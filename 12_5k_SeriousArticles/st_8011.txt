If our nation is truly conducting a ' ' war on terror ' ' and not a " war on Islam , " it is our duty as Americans of all colors , political persuasions and nationalities to condemn and distance ourselves from all acts of terrorism , regardless of the race or religion of those who commit violent acts in the name of extreme ideology . Simply put , terrorism is terrorism , whether it is committed by a white , black or brown person anywhere in the world .
