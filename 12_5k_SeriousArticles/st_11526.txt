I called Kanye West and as it turned out , he was already in Denver . He picked me up from the airport and we spent the ride listening to rough demos of a new song he was working on . From the second I heard it , I knew this was the big , closing performance we wanted for the show . I shared our team ' s vision of that year ' s event and some sketches of the set and we talked through what his performance could look like . A few days later we were both in L . A . in advance of the big night . Our team went to work finalizing the details , and he went to the studio and finished " Love Lock Down , " knowing that he ' d be sharing it with the world for the first time just a few days later at the VMAs .
