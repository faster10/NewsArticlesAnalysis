He caught , I think it was an out , or something like that , Beckham said of the play that helped the Giants win the last Battle for New York Football Supremacy and also launched a run to the Super Bowl . He made a guy miss and split two guys , I think , and just took off . I think we always clowned him and we tried to tell him he didn t have as much speed . And you just see that play and any time you can take a play 99 yards , you have to have some speed with you . So I definitely do remember that .
