As for the QB himself , I ' ll go in tomorrow with the intent to see what I can do , he said . I honestly don ' t know . I haven ' t tried to throw a football since the game , and maybe that ' s not even the right thing to do right away . I ' ll see the doctors and trainers tomorrow , we ' ll evaluate kind of how I feel . If anything , maybe I can practice and hand off and still get some mental reps that way . So we ' ll really just kind of see how it goes tomorrow .
