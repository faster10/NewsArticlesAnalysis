One member of the band remains a mystery . None of the band s members could recall the name of the bass player standing on the far right . Mrs Gall thought he was called John while Mr Ferris thought he was Richard . The band had regular bass players but the one in this photo was possibly a temporary stand in just for the phto shoot . The mystery figure has his place in history as a member of the band that set a 15 year old schoolboy David Jones on the road to success , his death on Sunday mourned by millions of people around the world .
