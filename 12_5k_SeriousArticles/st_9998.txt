Foreign policy nous is not one of those issues . As far as one can tell , Sanders has not even appointed a foreign policy advisor . A January NBC poll may explain why . When asked to list what issues mattered the most to them , only 11 of Democrats listed terrorism ( the foreign policy issue that tends to rouse US voters the most ) as number one , well after the economy , environment and education . On the latter three , Sanders is a match for Clinton .
