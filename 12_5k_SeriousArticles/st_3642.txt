There ' s no " right " line , but there ' s a right way to say it . If I had four men approach me using the same , tried and tested pickup line , do you think I would be attracted to all four of them ? Maybe , but highly unlikely . I can tell you that if the right man with the right character came up to me and said " banana , banana , banana , " I would giggle like a little schoolgirl and instantly feel attraction for him .
