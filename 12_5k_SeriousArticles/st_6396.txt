Kristian Berg Harpviken , a Nobel watcher and head of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo , said that others on the list were Pope Francis , NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden , Colombian peace negotiators , US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Ali Akbar Salehi , head of Iran s Atomic Energy Organisation . Incidentally , thousands of people are eligible to submit nominations for the Peace Prize and , according to AP , the committee receives over 200 nominations . The Telegraph reports that Harpviken has a shortlist of eleven nominees most likely to win the honour this year , with the highest likelihood being for whistleblower Edward Snowden . Trump , however , does not feature on this list .
