So how do those 150 , 000 CES attendees get from McCarran airport to the packed Las Vegas strip ? We queue . We queue to catch a cab in improbably long lines that snake around and around the airport ' s cavernous concourse . And queuing or waiting in line , as my American friends like to say is the dominant mode of being at CES . We patiently queue for cabs , we queue to get our show badges , we queue for food and beverages , we queue for buses to and from the packed conventional centers , we queue to check in and out of our hotels , we queue to squeeze onto the city ' s packed monorail system , and , of course , we dutifully queue on our return to McCarran so that we can be x rayed by the airport ' s absurdly low tech anti terrorist machines .
