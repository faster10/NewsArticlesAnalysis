If one of those plays goes differently , Clemson might be hoisting the national championship trophy today . The Tigers had this game in their sights , up 24 21 early in the fourth quarter with the ball at midfield ? aiming for a kill shot . But they went three and out . After that drive , Alabama took over the game , outscoring the Tigers 17 3 until Clemson got a touchdown with 4 : 40 left . That spurt , which included a recovered onside kick , Howard s 51 yard touchdown reception and a kickoff return for a score , made the difference .
