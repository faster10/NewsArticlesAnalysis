According to recordings from the ship ' s bridge from the vessel ' s black box , Schettino had directed Rusli Bin to turn " hard to starboard " in English , but Rusli Bin can be heard asking " hard to port ? " He then turned the ship right instead of left just 13 seconds before it hit the rocks . Dragone told the court that those 13 seconds made no difference , since it takes a lot longer than that to change a ship ' s course . " The impact would have been the same , " he said .
