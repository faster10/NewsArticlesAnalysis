The big challenge is going to be settling in , I ' ve lived in Liverpool all my life . I ' m a Scouser through and through . I love my City . I love my roots . But , you only get one life , it ' s important to try different things and experiences and it ' s also a big thing for my children too to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well .
