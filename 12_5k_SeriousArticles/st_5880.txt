Nils Lofgren : Previously , the rehearsal shows were kind of a last minute thing . I think probably what happened is that we were putting our own show together , which inevitably heads towards rehearsal shows . But because of the new record , we made commitments . We did the Grammys , two nights on " Jimmy Fallon " and the Apollo Show . Next on the horizon was the SXSW show . All of a sudden it was like , " Gosh , we have five different shows to prepare . " Bruce always takes the time to slant the shows to the occasion , and we had to get our own show up and we just ran out of time .
