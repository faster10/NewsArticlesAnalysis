( click ) I ' m back and I am so sorry for that . It ' s the only radio station we get here . But it could be worse , I once dropped five dollars in a jukebox , played Cher ' s " Believe " on repeat with all my credits , and walked out . It ' s probably the meanest thing I ' ve ever done in my entire life . So , overall , I don ' t think I ' m such a bad guy .
