The sign is part of a tradition we have . When I moved into the supposedly cursed restaurant space on Broadway in Tucson , Arizona , 15 years ago , I found a box of letters the kind you put on a marquee sign out front . By the end of the day , I had a message on the sign . We ' ve been changing it every day since . I am often told people plan their routes to see what we have to say each day even if just for a chuckle .
