Interestingly enough , even just a few years ago , environmental issues did not register with Latinos as top concerns for their families . That has changed . Majorities of Latinos support strong environmental protections , especially since many communities happen to be in historically unsafe and polluted environs . So the president ' s statement " We don ' t have to choose between our environment and our economy " which is reflected in his budget , really hits home for Latinos . And that ' s not what we ' ve been hearing in the news these days . We hear an unrepentant tirade from GOP pundits that regulations are nothing but " job killers . " But Obama is telling us they save lives and create jobs ?
