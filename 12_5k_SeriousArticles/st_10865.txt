Abu Omar says he was beaten so badly in custody he still doesn ' t know how he managed to survive . By the time he was released early last summer , most of the young men we ' d met at the demonstration had begun to pick up arms . " A lot of people joined the free Syrian army to protect the demonstration " he says , but that also changed , as more joined to protect their neighbourhood and their families . The messages I would receive over Skype grew grimmer ( " We had another martyr today . " )
