Having said that , certainly the main impetus is that his caucus is not with him at this point . I would also suggest it ' s not just the 35 or 40 in the tea party caucus . They have been pretty good at holding together . This is more than 40 congressmen at this point . Now we ' re beginning to see some fractures and maybe a dozen House Republicans looking for a way out , but they ' ve held force with not just the tea party , although it does seem tea party driven , obviously .
