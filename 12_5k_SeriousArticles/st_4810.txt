Lue wants his team to play at a faster pace than it did under Blatt , but the Cavs aren t physically ready to up the tempo . I don t think we re in good enough shape , Lue said . Early , we wanted to push it , we wanted to open the floor and we came out and did that and then we just dropped off the map . We got tired . I just don t think we re in good enough shape right now to play in the style that we want to play .
