Jackson : He ' s going to live on . He has left a legacy and it ' s going to be forever , and I really feel that in my heart . I want people to concentrate on those things that he did for people . He did a lot of positive things . He ' s going to live forever . I ' m going to miss him . The memories , all the great things he has done , and my family is going to miss him . It ' s hard . It ' s really hard for us right now .
