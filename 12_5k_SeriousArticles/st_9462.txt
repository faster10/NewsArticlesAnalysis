8 . Raiders at Broncos , Sunday , 4 : 05 , O U 43 . 5 : Denver s defense makes it non optimal to play Raiders . Denver s D is not quite elite but certainly very good . I guess you can argue it s a 10 percent swing from facing a weaker D to a very good one . I want to move these matchup numbers up because it shocks me that the effect is so low . Denver was scoring an estimated 19 points per game on offense with decrepit Peyton Manning and are all the way up to 19 . 3 with savior Brock Osweiler ( 30 ) , who is in his fourth season . ?
