Clinton , too , speaks in code . But in this election , her coded phrases ? some people think we re shouting , some who say that this is an urban problem ? aren t designed to veil racism . They re designed to veil her meritless insinuations that her Democratic opponent is sexist and racist . You can argue , based on power or privilege , that playing the race card or sex card from the left isn t as bad as playing it from the right . But even if you believe that , Clinton s smears bring discredit on the whole idea of bigotry . If accusations of misogyny and racism are casually thrown at Sanders , voters will conclude that these terms are just rhetoric .
