Shakespeare wrote a great play but even he must have been aware that he was twisting the facts in order to make it more dramatic . After all , he called it a " tragedy " not a " history . " His Richard III is a villain and a superb villain at that , but Shakespeare was not writing history , no matter what the Duke of Marlborough might have thought . There are many instances where the portrayal just does not fit the historical record . For instance , in one of his three plays about Henry VI , Shakespeare has Richard of Gloucester , later Richard III , killing the Duke of Somerset at the first battle of St Albans . At the time of that fight , Richard Plantagenet wasn ' t Duke of Gloucester and , more cogently , he wasn ' t yet three years old !
