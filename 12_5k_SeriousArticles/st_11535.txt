As far as I can tell , the Byrds ' recording of " Mr Tambourine Man " was the first time anyone put really good poetry on the radio . The Beatles hadn ' t gotten to " Eleanor Rigby " or " A Day in the Life " they were still writing " Ooh , baby . " But Bob ' s lyrics were exquisite . " To dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free " that was the line that got me . At the time of " Mr Tambourine Man , " I think he was finding himself as a poet . He was learning to be beautiful .
