Keep in mind : Even in the Steelers ' 33 20 win at Cincinnati last month , the game in which Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton broke his thumb in the first quarter , Pittsburgh was outgained 385 354 in yardage and was helped tremendously by a pick six from cornerback William Gay off McCarron . The game script changed when the Steelers took an early lead , leading to some meaningless yards from the Bengals , but even in tough circumstances the Bengals were far from dominated in that game . ?
