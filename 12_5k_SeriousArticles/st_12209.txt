That might not seem like much ? ? just ask Tim Raines , the second best leadoff hitter of his generation , who fell just short , at 69 . 8 percent of the 75 percent needed , on his ninth try . Jeff Bagwell , another no brainer , was even closer at 71 . 6 percent . It often takes time to build a consensus in this process , and for some , like Barry Bonds ( 44 . 3 percent ) and Roger Clemens ( 45 . 2 ) , that is day is unlikely to come . ?
