" Red " : " They once shot me four times at point blank range . I heard them laughing as they walked away and one came back and kicked me in the head for good measure . When I got better he was the first one I killed . I ' ve been shot 17 times . Well let ' s call it 19 if you count the ones that just graze you . They say some bodies have divine protection . Let ' s hope mine is one of them . "
