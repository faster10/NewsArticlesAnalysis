Sia dubbed this album This Is Acting because she feels that s what she does when she writes a song for someone else . These songs are less quirky and more pop oriented than her previous albums . While the soaring Bird Set Free is what we have come to expect from Sia , the clever pop trifle House on Fire , which she co wrote with fun . s Jack Antonoff , is a nice change of pace . Only on Reaper , co written with Kanye West , does Sia s delivery seem out of step .
