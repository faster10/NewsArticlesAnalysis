When my husband and I turn off Main Road ( Route 25 ) and arrive in Greenport on Friday afternoon , we wander down a quiet side street to Vine . We ' ve been told it ' s a good spot to start sampling North Fork wines : The restaurant serves a dozen local varieties by the taste , the glass or the bottle . The carefully considered restaurant and wine bar occupies an old fashioned house on a corner lot and has plenty of outdoor seating on a front porch and a terrace .
