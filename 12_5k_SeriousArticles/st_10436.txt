The unintentional irony of all this queuing is twofold . Firstly , the whole message of CES this year was mobility . All the most seductive electronic products on show at CES promised to untether us from the world . Smaller notebook computers , now euphemistically called " ultrabooks " , were thinner and smaller than ever . New smartphones were even smarter and easier to slip into our pockets . Apps were more mobile , of course . While absurdly light tablet devices could be found on almost every table in every booth . So that ' s the irony . The whole point of CES is to stand in long , frustratingly slow moving lines to fondle devices that promise unlimited freedom . CES , thus , achieved the impossible : it makes mobility immobile .
