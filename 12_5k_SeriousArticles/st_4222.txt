This confuses two issues : whether government should help the poor , and how government should help the poor . If society wants everyone to have health insurance , the obvious approach is to give the poor enough money so that individuals can purchase on their own . Just because people want government to help the poor doesn ' t require it to pay for specific kinds of goods . If some people do not purchase insurance and then become ill , they would have to rely on private charity .
