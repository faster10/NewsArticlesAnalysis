Van Dyke : He was in his late 70s at the time , and not very well . He did all that " I Love to Laugh " stuff hanging from the ceiling , and it was just so hard on him , but he was a trouper . He was a sweet old guy . He had a palsy his head would move from side to side , kind of involuntarily . But the minute they would say " Action , " it would stop . And he ' d do the scene , and the minute they said " Cut , " it would start in again .
