Ben Carson took a softball question on media scrutiny of his biography and handled it just fine . I have no problem with being vetted , what I do have a problem is being lied about , Carson said . But once again he seemed lost on policy issues ? he wandered around a question on whether he d break up big banks ( he wouldn t ) and a meandering answer on special forces in Syria , which he said he supported in part to make ISIS look like losers .
