Not sure if you saw Mike Zimmer ' s press conference after Sunday ' s win over the Rams , but the Minnesota head coach looked to put it mildly pissed about Teddy Bridgewater ' s concussion . In slow motion , the hit by Rams corner Lamarcus Joyner appeared to be a cheap shot . In real time ? Bridgewater ' s slide was a bit tardy , with barely enough time for Joyner to adjust . Close call . The Adrian Peterson Todd Gurley competition was not as close , at least not statistically . Peterson basically said , " Tap the brakes , young fella I ' m still pretty good , " outrushing the rookie , 125 yards to 89 , despite facing the best defensive line in pro football . Are Vikings fans thinking wild card or NFC North title right now ?
