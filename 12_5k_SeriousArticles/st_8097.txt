Bryant had a message for the Philly fans ahead of his final NBA game in the city : " Thank you for everything . It ' s such a beautiful thing . I was just driving around last night , going to all the parks I used to play in , just driving by them . You see so many familiar faces , and you just kind of think about how fast time went . I ' m very appreciative and very thankful for everyone those who supported , those who didn ' t . It was all just part of the entire journey . "
