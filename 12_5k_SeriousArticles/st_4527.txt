For Clinton , the reverse is true . With Bill , she went from being a reformist Democrat in a conservative , Southern state to trying to bridge the huge gaps in the national Democratic Party ? from the racial divide between white and black Democrats to the rural and regional divides between North and South , to the divide between liberal Democratic leadership in Washington and the largely moderate party electorate . Whereas Sanders chose a path that allowed a measure of purity ? in part , because he really is a socialist ? Clinton chose one that forced ( and often rewarded ) close ties to the party consensus , something tied to her gender as well as her mainstream political beliefs .
