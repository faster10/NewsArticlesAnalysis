Conceived by Yngve Bergqvist , a river rafting guide who wanted to lure visitors to the Arctic north during the winter , the Icehotel started out in 1990 as nothing more than a crude igloo . Now , it ' s a fanciful ice castle that ' s rebuilt every November with an unparalleled level of artistry which explains why each winter 16 , 000 guests pay hundreds of dollars a night to sleep on a slab of ice and thousands more make the trek just to tour the rooms for the day .
