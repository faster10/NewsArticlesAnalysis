The Chiefs have also had trouble finishing recent games against inferior opponents . They had double digit leads against the Chargers , Browns and Raiders but had to sweat the finish each time . How will they fare against better competition ? The Chiefs beat only two playoff teams , the Broncos and the Steelers , during their winning streak , so the competition takes a definite step up in the playoffs . Quarterback Alex Smith had been playing well and at one point this season had a streak of 312 passes without an interception . But he threw back to back picks against Oakland , the second one being returned for a 24 yard touchdown by David Amerson .
