Mr Lewandowski continued without Mr Trump s participation , I just don t see in any way where Fox is going to have a successful debate now , when you got the clear G . O . P . front runner who has decided to walk away from this debate because he can t be treated fairly at the debate stage . Maybe Fox was going to have a 20 or 25 million person debate . But without Mr Trump s participation , I think they may have a one or two million person debate .
