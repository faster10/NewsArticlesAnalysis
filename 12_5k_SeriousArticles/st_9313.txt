For the uninitiated , Ender ' s Game is the story of 12 year old Ender Wiggin ( Hugo ' s Asa Butterfield ) , a shy loner with a beautiful mind . His gift , if it can be called that , considering what happens in the last third of the film , is that he ' s a bit of savant when it comes to strategy and analyzing thorny no win situations . He ' d give Captain Kirk a serious run at Star Trek ' s Kobayashi Maru scenario . This is a particularly valuable skill set in the wake of a devastating attack on Earth years earlier by an alien insect race called the Formics . There are reports that these intergalactic praying mantises are about to launch a second assault and the military powers that be are scouring our planet , looking for the best and the brightest to outwit these blood thirsty beasties .
