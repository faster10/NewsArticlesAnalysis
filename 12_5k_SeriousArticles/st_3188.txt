With a Democrat in the White House , you might assume that the op ed pages of The Washington Post would be bursting with pride over the state of the nation , given the paper ' s center left leanings . But you would be wrong . Over the course of 1997 , in the middle of the greatest peacetime economic boom in U . S . history ( and before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke ) , 71 of all editorials published in the Post that expressed an opinion on some aspect of the country ' s current state focused on a negative trend . Less than 5 of the total number of editorials concentrated on a positive development . Even the boom years are a bummer .
