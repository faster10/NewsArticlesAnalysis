Overall , the Trump campaign has challenged our thinking about the nature of political campaigns but mainly by highlighting and recasting lessons we have already learned . The most important of these may be that campaigns are about emotional attachments rather than set ideological views , even in an increasingly conservative Republican Party . If Donald Trump wins the nomination , he will have succeeded in redefining what it means to be a conservative and a Republican , and he will have done so by tapping into anger at the Republican establishment .
