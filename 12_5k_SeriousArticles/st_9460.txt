6 . Chargers at Chiefs , Sunday , 1 : 00 , O U 45 : Alex Smith ( 31 ) has not thrown an interception in a long time ( 305 passes ) but he s actually everything that s wrong with football . His average pass length is a league low 6 . 32 . Philip Rivers ( 33 ) is next at 6 . 72 . This is the Long Handoff Bowl . Snore . The air yards per throw is at an all time low . The league throws just 12 percent of passes over 20 yards . These QBs are about 8 percent . So if they throw 80 passes , expect to see six downfield attempts . What a joke . Teams live in such fear of interceptions and they are not that big a deal , especially on third down on longer passes . Teams average 12 yards per attempt on these passes , so they are worth the risk .
