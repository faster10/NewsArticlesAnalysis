Game of Thrones is the sole survivor from last year s best drama list , and this year s includes Narcos ( Netflix ) and Outlander ( Starz ) , along with the less surprising Empire and Mr Robot . I think it is safe to say no one was talking about Narcos as an awards contender , and though Outlander debuted with strong buzz and continues to have a captive audience , it seemed to fall off the top picks radar , for no better reason than there are far too many top picks .
