I was stuck with wanting you to feel pain , remorse , regret . What a huge additional burden to carry because how could I possibly achieve that goal ? I cannot . I also cannot feel defeated by succumbing to silence . No , that would be a shame for everyone who has been helped , everyone who found their voice and made changes in their community because Rehtaeh ' s voice came forward . Her voice was not heard while she struggled to be heard , but it sure is now .
