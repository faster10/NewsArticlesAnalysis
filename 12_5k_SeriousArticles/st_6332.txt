Don ' t sit back , be part of the solution . " The concept behind Twaweza very much is this , from the ground up , that the citizens are part of the solution . They are part of the solution in terms of solving things themselves , every day it ' s not every problem that you need to wait for the president or the minister to solve . . . It ' s not just about complaining , it ' s not just about pointing fingers , it ' s about fixing things , it ' s about coming up with solutions . "
