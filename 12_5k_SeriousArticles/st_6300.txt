Paul had an answer : You meet key demographic groups where they were with policies that directly touch their lives . And in particular , Paul argued , Republicans had to repair their long and complicated relationship with black Americans . Several generations of black voters have never voted Republican and are not very open to even considering the option , he confessed in a 2013 speech to students at Howard University . Paul s pitch , emphasized in that speech , was criminal justice reform . We should stand and loudly proclaim enough is enough . We should not have laws that ruin the lives of young men and women who have committed no violence , he said . That s why I have introduced a bill to repeal federal mandatory minimum sentences . We should not have drug laws or a court system that disproportionately punishes the black community .
