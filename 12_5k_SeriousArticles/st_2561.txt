In 1992 , while upholding the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v . Wade , the Supreme Court observed in Planned Parenthood v . Casey that " the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives " . If I had been forced to raise a child 35 years ago , I could not have put myself through college and Columbia Law School .
