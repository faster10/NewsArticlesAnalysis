But the Democrats do have a good reason why they think it s a mistake to feed into the idea that this is a religious war . They argue that in order to stop terrorism , we need the help of the world s Muslim populations , and the last thing we want to do is drive them away by implying that they re all our enemies . The terrorists want Muslims everywhere to believe the West is at war with Islam . Should we really be helping them make that case ?
