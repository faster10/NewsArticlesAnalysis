Trump said his event raised 6 million for 22 veterans groups thanks in part to a laundry list of wealthy friends . He spent 15 to 20 minutes listing donors . The real estate mogul frequently interrupted himself to go on tangents about how good his friends were to him and how he didn ' t accept millions of dollars for his own campaign ' s use because he was self funding his road to the White House . Trump said Treasure Island casino owner Phil Ruffin , who Trump suggested could negotiate with China in his administration , and his wife Oleksandra Nikolayenko donated 1 million . Both joined the real estate mogul onstage . Trump said Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter and his wife , Laura , also gave 1 million . A " very , very rich man in New York " who wanted to remain anonymous gave 1 million , and Trump said he himself , " a really great builder in New York and now a politician , " gave another 1 million : TPM
