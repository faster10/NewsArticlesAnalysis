Were it not for the phenomenon of Jordan Spieth ' s first 54 holes , he would have been in contention here starting the final day . Woods , like McIlroy , began six under par but with Spieth ten shots ahead , it was idealistic to even contemplate a charge . Woods would have needed a score approaching the course record , and Spieth a collapse and he is not well placed for miracles yet . Another major ? Well , you wouldn ' t bet against that one .
