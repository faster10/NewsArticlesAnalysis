In the 2016 cycle , however , voters have lumped the governors in with the " establishment , " and none of them have fared well . Scott Walker and Rick Perry have already dropped out . Of the governors still in the fight , only Jeb Bush scores as high as 6 percent in the RCP average ? and that is down from 8 percent three weeks ago . No other veteran politician polls at better than 3 percent . Chris Christie ' s star has descended low enough ( 2 . 2 percent ) to get pushed from the main state to the undercard debate , as has Mike Huckabee ' s ( 2 . 4 percent ) . Bobby Jindal ( 0 . 8 percent ) is but a blip on the radar .
