At the end of the meal we went to the coat check window they had taken Jeff ' s suitcase down a long flight of stairs to store it on a basement level . Jeff didn ' t want the young woman to have to carry it up the stairs , so he went down to get it . I stood there and watched as he came up the steep flight of stairs , visibly weary , huffing , sweating , lugging the heavy bag we looked at each other and both of us burst out laughing .
