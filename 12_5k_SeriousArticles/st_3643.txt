There is never a bad time to approach a woman . Women want to be approached , as long as it ' s by the right person . If you see a girl you like , stop , breathe and think to yourself , " She ' s adorable . I want to talk to her and see if I like her . " Notice the " I want " and the spirit of figuring out what you like . Until you get to know this girl , it ' s about you , not her .
