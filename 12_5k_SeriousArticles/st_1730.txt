Former world number one Azarenka proved too strong for Czech Barbora Strycova on Rod Laver Arena , storming through 6 2 , 6 4 to set up a last eight clash with Angelique Kerber , who beat fellow German Annika Beck 6 4 , 6 0 . Azarenka , the 14th seed who won at Melbourne Park in 2012 and 2013 , has a 6 0 record over Kerber , including in the Brisbane International final this month , making her a hot favourite to keep her title run going .
