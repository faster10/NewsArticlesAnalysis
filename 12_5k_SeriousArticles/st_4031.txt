If present , elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems , especially for pregnant women and young children . Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing . The city of Ann Arbor is responsible for providing high quality drinking water , but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components . When your water has been sitting for several hours , you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking . If you are concerned about lead in your water , you may wish to have your water tested . Information on lead in drinking water , testing methods , and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at ( 800 ) 426 4791 or at http : water . epa . gov drink info index . cfm .
