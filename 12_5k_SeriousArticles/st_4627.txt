Zakaria : No . Gov . Palin has been given a set of talking points by campaign advisers , simple ideological mantras that she repeats and repeats as long as she can . But if forced off those rehearsed lines , what she has to say is often , quite frankly nonsense . Just listen to her response to Katie Couric ' s question about the bailout . It ' s gibberish an emptying out of catchphrases about economics that have nothing to do with the question or the topic . It ' s scary to think that this person could be running the country .
