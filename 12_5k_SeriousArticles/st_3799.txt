For the balance of the season , Palmer dealt with that pressure extremely well . Per PFF ' s tracking , he was 129 of 222 for 2 , 039 yards , 11 touchdowns , and 8 interceptions when under pressure from the opposing rush during the regular season . That works out to a 92 . 2 passer rating , which is basically the exact equivalent of Joe Montana ' s career passer rating ( 92 . 3 ) . Last week against the Packers , though , Palmer let the pressure get to him . He completed 7 of 12 passes for 144 yards in those situations , but he was also picked off twice and should have been at least once more .
