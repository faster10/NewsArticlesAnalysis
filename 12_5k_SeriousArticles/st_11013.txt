When Broncos coaches roll film of the Carolina Panthers stomping the Arizona Cardinals , they ' ll see a defense that can pressure from all angles . One that comes off the edges like cannon fire , or employs brute force to pierce the belly of an offensive line . They ' ll note linebackers and cornerbacks who flip turnovers into instant points , and wide receivers whose middling reputations contradict their ability to wreck secondaries . They ' ll see a cornerback who wants to be challenged , but rarely is . And at the center of it all , they ' ll find a quarterback with mobility , an arm , and a sense of manifest destiny .
