It s incredible , really , says Jamie . When we walked out for the doubles on the Saturday in the semi final against Australia in Glasgow it was the three of us ? Andy , me and Leon ? and mum was up in the stands watching . Leon worked with Andy for longer but he was with me for almost two years . He d first worked with us when we were 10 and 11 and Leon was only 21 . We ve all come a long way since then .
