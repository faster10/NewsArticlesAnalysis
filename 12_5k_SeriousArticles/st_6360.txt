Manager Terry Collins named Juan Uribe to the official World Series roster on Tuesday . He sees Uribe as having a better chance than most against the hard throwing Royals pitchers . Uribe will be shooting for his third ring with three different teams , a rare trifecta indeed . The Mets are going without a true backup SS ( Kelly Johnson and Uribe could fill in if necessary for part of a game ) . If Wilmer Flores should get hurt , the Mets could activate Matt Reynolds . . .
