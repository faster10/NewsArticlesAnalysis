THE LOCATIONS : One thing the Bourne and " Mission : Impossible " franchises learned from Bond is the importance of moving to a new exotic location every 12 minutes or so . It fills the screen , keeps the action fresh , and takes the audience on a vicarious ride . " Spectre " goes like this : Mexico City , London , Rome , Austria , Tangier , Moroccan desert , back to London . A car chase along the Tiber is the best stunt work a shot of the Tangier skyline at twilight is sublime . Grade : B .
