Iman : Yes , then we started a non profit and we ' d do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing , working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson . We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center , as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva . We felt like this platform of singing the bigger it gets , the more we can do .
