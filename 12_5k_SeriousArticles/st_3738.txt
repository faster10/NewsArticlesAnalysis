SERENA IN SIGHT : Fifth seeded Maria Sharapova plays Lauren Davis , and a win would keep her in with a chance of facing Serena Williams in a quarterfinal featuring last year ' s finalists . Sharapova hasn ' t played Davis but goes into the match fully recovered from a left forearm injury that forced her to withdraw from the Brisbane International , where she was defending champion . " I feel pretty good , I felt I was more confident with my left hand today , " Sharapova said after her second round win . " That ' s always something that especially when it ' s like in the hand wrist area , it ' s in the back of your mind even though you ' re feeling it . " Davis advanced on Wednesday when Magdalena Rybarikova retired after losing the first set .
