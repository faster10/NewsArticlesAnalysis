O Brien and GM Rick Smith should use the 30 0 loss as a significant data point and an indication about where this roster is . They can t pretend that winning 4 games a year against the Jaguars and Titans and compiling 9 7 records are a springboard to Super Bowl contention . They aren t . The Texans have a very good defense that should improve moving forward , with some caveats on the injury front . This team has one of the bright stars offensively in the NFL , and Hopkins is only 23 years old . O Brien has made some significant mistakes , both in game and with the roster , but I believe he has a chance to be a very good head coach . However , the Texans weren t a Super Bowl contender on Friday , and the events on Saturday demonstrate that they have a long way to go .
