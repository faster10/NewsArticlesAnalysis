The ideal tax rate is the rate at which government collects enough revenue to perform its essential functions and not a dime more . Another critically important principle when considering the ideal tax rate is something called " Hauser ' s Law , " named after investment economist Kurt Hauser , which shows that over the last six decades tax revenue as a percent of GDP has been about 19 , regardless of fluctuations in tax rates . In other words , government has an extremely difficult time collecting more than 19 or 19 . 5 of revenue even if it increases tax rates considerably .
