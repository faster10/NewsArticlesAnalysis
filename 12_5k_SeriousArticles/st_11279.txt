On the morning of July 7 , 2005 , I was just another anonymous commuter on my way to work during rush hour in London ' s crowded metropolis . I was short and spritely , weaving through what seemed like a never ending sea of people to ensure I had a chance of getting on a Tube train . What I didn ' t know then was that a 19 year old named Jermaine Lindsay , determined to detonate a bomb he was carrying in his backpack , was boarding the train carriage at the same time as me .
