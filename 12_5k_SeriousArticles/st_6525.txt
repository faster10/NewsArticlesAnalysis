" Sometimes people get the misconception that Coach Saban is miserable , but he ' s really not , " said former Outland Trophy winner Barrett Jones , who was a part of three national championship teams at Alabama under Saban and now plays in the NFL . " He just loves the grind . That ' s what he loves . Once you understand that about him , it ' s different . He enjoys getting in his office and watching film . He loves practice . He loves preparing his teams . But he ' s not always like that . He jokes around and loves to give guys a hard time . He definitely has a fun side to him that maybe everybody doesn ' t see . "
