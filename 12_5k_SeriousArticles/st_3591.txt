It s not only about my ethnicity it made me feel a certain way about my beauty , she told Glam Belleza Latina . Not seeing a woman like me as a lead made me feel like I d never be skinny enough , I d never be pretty enough . I want to give young girls , like my niece , the tools to see a billboard and think , ' That non Latina girl is beautiful , but that s not the only form of beauty . ' Jane s story is about a beautiful , normal girl . We don t talk about her weight or her looks .
