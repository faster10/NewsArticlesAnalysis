Take this simple example . Let ' s say you have a 6 year old who hates vegetables and won ' t eat them . So , you tell him if he doesn ' t eat his vegetables that he won ' t be able to play with his favorite toy . As long as you are there to enforce that rule , your 6 year old may very well eat his vegetables . But what happens when he is at a friend ' s house and that rule doesn ' t apply ? This method does not solve the problem .
