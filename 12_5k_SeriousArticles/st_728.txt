Mitt Romney didn ' t in 2012 , yet was able to earn a tie in Iowa with 25 percent of the vote . An even lower total could win the caucuses this time if Cruz , Carson , Huckabee and Santorum split their vote more or less evenly , and if Trump either fades a bit ( he ' s at about 26 percent in current polling there ) or , as seems reasonably likely , many of those who support him in public opinion polls fail to turn out .
