Many prognosticators ( this one included ) thought " Catching Fire " might surpass " Iron Man 3 ' s " opening earlier this year , but the superhero sequel had the notable advantage of 3 D ticket sales , and " Catching Fire " fell short . Still , if estimates hold up when final grosses are released tomorrow , " Catching Fire " will have bested " The Dark Knight Rises " as the highest 2 D opener of all time . ( " Rises " pulled in 160 . 9 million during its opening weekend in 2012 . )
