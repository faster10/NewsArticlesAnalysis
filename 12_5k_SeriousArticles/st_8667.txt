Miami Dolphins : After falling to 4 6 Sunday , Dolphins linebacker Kelvin Sheppard said , " We ' re going to finish 10 6 and somehow claw and fight to get into these playoffs . " There is still a surprising amount of optimism within Miami ' s locker room , but the reality is the team must win six in a row to have a good shot at the postseason . The team has to quickly turn the page and focus on winning the next game against the Jets . The Dolphins are 0 4 against AFC East foes this season . James Walker
