My son , like so many others , they come back a bit different , they come back hardened , they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country , Palin said . That starts from the top . It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder , if they have to question , if they re respected anymore . It starts from the top .
