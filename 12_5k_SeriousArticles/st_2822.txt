James Bond has worn an Omega Seamaster for over 20 years and Spectre s 007 is no exception to the tradition . The Spectre Seamaster 300 is the first time that a watch worn by Bond has also been officially released to the general public as a limited edition purchase . The black dialed timepiece sports a rare lollipop second hand in addition to a black ceramic bi directional bezel ring , which looks suitably dark and spy like . If you opt for the NATO strap , you can have 007 engraved on the bracelet strap holder ( not a particularly James Bond thing to do ) . The watch costs more than 6 , 000 .
