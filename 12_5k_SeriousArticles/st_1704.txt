Simon Walker , Director General of the Institute of Directors , said : ' The coalition Government has made encouraging progress in reducing the burden of regulation on business , and in particular on small and medium sized businesses . We welcome the ambition shown in the commitment to finding a further 10billion worth of regulatory savings , and urge all political parties to consider how they can make it easier , smoother and more efficient to do business in the UK . The target announced by the Conservatives is admirable , and we ' ll work with all parties to make sure deregulation stays at the top of political agenda .
