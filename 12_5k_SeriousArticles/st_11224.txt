That Tame Impala cover of New Person , Same Old Mistakes , shortened on Anti to Same Ol Mistakes is a very straightforward one . She s barely changed the sound , adding a couple of hand claps here and there but keeping the same layered shimmering psychedelic effects . She even kept the synth pop chorus that crashes around you like breaking waves . It s such a simple cover it could have flopped but Rhi s version is incredibly bewitching , if anything it s an improvement on the original . ?
