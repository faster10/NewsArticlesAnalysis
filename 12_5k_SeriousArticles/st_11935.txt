I guess it ' s easier to be outspoken against the death penalty when you ' re not defending an alleged terrorist , but instead pointing out the alarming number of death row prisoners who have been wrongly convicted . Or that according to some , it costs 10 times more to try to execute someone than put them in jail for life . Or that it doesn ' t actually appear to deter crime . Or that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and the Supreme Court has already ruled against the death penalty in cases against the mentally ill or minors .
