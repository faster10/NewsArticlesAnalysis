Thompson s status will be the wild card , because if he can go that could force Brad Stevens to put Bradley on Thompson and Isaiah Thomas on Curry . That would assure a 40 60 point night from Golden State s scoring assassin , and probably mean the Celtics will find themselves in double digit hole early on . ? But if Thompson is out , along with the already sidelined ? Harrison Barnes , the Warriors could be ripe for the picking . The Celtics force more turnovers than any other team in the NBA at 17 . 9 per game , and they ll need every one of those extra possessions if they want to have any shot at doing what no other NBA team has done this season .
