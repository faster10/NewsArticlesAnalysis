The idea of 3 , 000 or more members of Congress , constituting a Washington based power elite , would scare people if we continue to apply the 1780s approach to governing . But our government needs to evolve to reflect the world we live in . What if members of Congress went to Washington quarterly for two week conventions ? The rest of the time they could live in their districts , using widely adopted technologies to collaborate and vote online . It is ridiculous that a member must be " present " to cast a vote in Congress in 2012 .
