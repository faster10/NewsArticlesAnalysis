" I met Robert on the plane on the way from Zurich to New York . We made a stop in London where he had just started his job as CEO of Saatchi Saatchi and I was going on vacation to Switzerland from New York . We met shortly on the plane , a short conversation , and after this when I came back from vacation we met again . He was coming to Switzerland every weekend because his dog was here . The plane was empty and the computer put us together and I was wondering why . . . but it was kind of fate . "
