Christopher : " Doctor Who " is where my love of science fiction and fantasy started . I was introduced to it when I was 8 , and I ' m still an avid viewer . It still influences me in a way , as the original series ( my true love ) emphasized the importance of story and character over flashy special effects , which they had to , given the limitations of TV production in the 1960s and 1970s . But I think it taught me some good lessons about storytelling .
