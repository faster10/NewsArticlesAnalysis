JAWS , developed by SI . com s Jay Jaffe , helps track a player s peak years and compare that against a Hall of Fame standard , and as you can see Mussina and Schilling are a virtual tie . Smoltz s totals are dragged down by his time as a closer . Heck , Mussina s WAR compares well with Martinez ? and , to me , longevity matters for something . I came to believe how Schilling had October , Smoltz had awards , and Mussina had body of work .
