My income for 2014 , as I reported in the PFD statement , was 362 million dollars not including dividends , interest , capital gains , rents , and royalties . Income for 2015 will exceed 600 million . I also did well in the stock market . While that isn t something that I ve focused on in the past , and is only a small part of my net worth , 40 of the 45 stocks I bought rose substantially in a short period of time , resulting in a 27 , 021 , 471 gain on sale the stocks remaining in the portfolio have an unrealized gain of more than 22 million .
