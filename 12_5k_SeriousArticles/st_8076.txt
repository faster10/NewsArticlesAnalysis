Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips deserves a ton of credit for not only devising a great gameplan for the Patriots ? it was arguably the best defensive game ever played against Brady with all of his weapons healthy ? but deviating from his usual schemes to do so . He recognized that the Patriots offensive line was weak enough to succumb to pressure from just three or four rushers and did not have to blitz as much as he usually does , if at all . He flooded the rest of the field with tight coverage and mixed up the assignments against all of the receivers .
