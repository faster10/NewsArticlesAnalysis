This is not a new concept per se , as you could always add a keyboard to your tablets . But that ' s not the only change . The Surface Pro , for example , comes with a ' tablet mode ' button to make the interface more touch friendly , and Windows 10 allows you to run tablet apps and legacy programs side by side with ease . The iPad Pro also includes tweaks to iOS to make it more suited to multitasking , and makes it much more useful . These changes make tablets effective for more than just consuming media .
