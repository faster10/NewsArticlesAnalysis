But Facebook actually has a memorialization feature , and there ' s good reason to take advantage of it : It freezes the account so no one else can log in as the user , and it allows only already confirmed friends to write on the wall in remembrance . That person will no longer show up as a suggested photo tag or in " people you may know . " In short , it allows the Facebook page to become an homage , an interactive equivalent of a memory book .
