Vanessa : I also think , had I not been talented in the arts and I still wanted to be in it , they would have said " Why don ' t you do something else ? " Luckily they saw my talent and my interest in it and they gave me all the gifts to allow me to take dance class , piano and French horn and be in theater and major in musical theater in college , rather than saying , " Why don ' t you do something normal ? " or " Get a real job . " I never heard that .
