The two major groups in the team were the Crusaders and the Blues . Obviously I was very comfortable with all the Canterbury guys by that point . But the Blues were a different story . Mehrts Andrew Mehrtens hadn ' t been selected , controversially , so this was definitively Carlos Spencer ' s team . He had been in incredible form that year , and the Blues were champions , so it was well earned . But going from playing alongside someone as supportive and welcoming as Mehrts to Spencer was quite a shock . He ' s like me a naturally shy guy , and we were a little wary of each other back then . It wasn ' t open animosity I was so obviously the junior but it was quite different to the way Mehrts and I had clicked .
