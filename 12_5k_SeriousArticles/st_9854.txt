Coates new book , David s Sling : A History of Democracy in Ten Works of Art ( published this week by Encounter Books ) , seeks to prove just that . It blends politics with art history by examining democratic societies from ancient Athens to 20th century Spain through the lens of select works of art and architecture . Highlights include the Parthenon , Claude Monet s Nymph as , Pablo Picasso s Guernica ? and , of course , Michelangelo s David , from which the book gets its title ( not from the Israeli air and missile defense Weapon System , also known as David s sling . According to Coates , It was a total coincidence ) .
