But how about in December ? Why ? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji , and that will also include . . . Santa Claus . That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News ' Megyn Kelly , who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely , definitely and without a doubt a white guy . In fact , thanks to Apple , we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December . ( Could that mean he ' s a Muslim Santa ? ! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News . )
