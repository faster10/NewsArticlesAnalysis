" It ' s a very interesting balance of zeitgeist and letting go and coming back and figuring out if you ' re done or you ' re not done . I listen to people a lot , actually , " says King . " What I do know is that there ' s interest , but with interest comes non interest . It ' s all really about the stories , and if you actually think you have something left to say that would make it exciting and worthwhile for the fans ' time , that ' s really the question . Not whether you can get away with it , not whether anybody will buy it , not whether you can make money on it . It ' s really like , is there enough or more to say that would justify people risking seeing their favorite characters again ? And I think there ' s one chapter left . "
