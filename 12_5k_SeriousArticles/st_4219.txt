If you have a little more time , head to the Ledges Overlook and Beaver Marsh , said Adams . At the Ledges , perhaps the most popular overlook at the park , you can see the entire Cuyahoga Valley . Sunsets are particularly spectacular . It ' s an easy walk from the parking lot or you can enjoy the 2 . 2 mile loop trail . " I love sitting there and looking at the vastness , " she said . " It ' s open space and very serene . "
