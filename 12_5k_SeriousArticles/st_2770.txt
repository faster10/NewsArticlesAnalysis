Sanders left out an important piece of context when he reminded voters that Clinton once called President Obama naive on foreign policy . Sanders claimed Clinton said Obama was naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies . Clinton responded that she wanted to correct the record to reflect that her comment in 2007 was not simply that Obama said he would meet with enemy leaders , but that he would do so without preconditions . The record is in Clinton s favor on this one .
