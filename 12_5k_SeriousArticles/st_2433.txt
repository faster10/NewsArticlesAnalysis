Mr Gellatly found evidence that men carry a gene that determines the percentage of X and Y chromosomes in their sperm . One version of this gene produces mostly X chromosomes , another mostly Y , and a third yields equal numbers of both . But even carrying a gene that predisposes men to more sons or daughters is no guarantee of the sex of a baby in the same way that rolling a rigged die with a six on four of its faces is no guarantee of landing a six .
