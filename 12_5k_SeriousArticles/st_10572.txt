" Andre has been awesome , " Walton said . " But I know this and I agree with Steve that we need to watch his minutes . We even talked today about monitoring those minutes even closer now that we ' re having these back to backs as we get deeper into the season . I do need to a better job of that , but it ' s hard from my seat when you ' re trying to win a game to take Andre off the floor . It ' s something I ' ll do more of , but it ' s definitely part of our game plan . "
