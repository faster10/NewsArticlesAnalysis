CB Delvin Breaux : Breaux had a rough time trying to stop two other guys from his shared hometown of New Orleans Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr . Breaux gave up three touchdowns to Beckham , two on pick plays close to the end zone and one on a 50 yard bomb where he gave up his tight coverage late while turning to locate the ball in the air . Breaux was also flagged for a crucial defensive holding penalty that nullified a sack fumble in the fourth quarter , but Payton made it clear he disagreed with the officials ' call repeatedly in his postgame press conference .
