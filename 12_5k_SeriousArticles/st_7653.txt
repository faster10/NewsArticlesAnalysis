Rubio ' s current position on how to deal with immigration is rather nuanced , triangulating between the pro immigration wishes of Republican donors and the anti immigration leanings of the voter base . He remains open to creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and boosting merit based legal immigration , but no longer supports a comprehensive effort and wants to first toughen border security , a top conservative demand . Though he hasn ' t precisely defined what a secure border would entail , the stance , discussed in his 2014 book American Dreams , is what he emphasizes on the campaign trail . Perhaps that ' s not surprising , given that polls show that ? majorities of Republicans want to decrease immigration flows and deport people in the country illegally . ?
