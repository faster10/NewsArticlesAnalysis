I can t imagine that many folks filled out the AFC side of their bracket and felt confident about their picks . But with Denver s concerns at quarterback no matter who plays , and with New England s injury situation , I like Pittsburgh , one of the hottest teams in football , to advance ? mainly because the Steelers have an offense that can score on anybody and a defense that is good enough to keep games close . I like the Cardinals to win not only the NFC but also the Super Bowl because they re the most balanced team in football , and they can beat opponents in a million different ways . They re also well positioned , because they wouldn t have to face their rival Seahawks until the conference championship , and that game would be at home , and only after Seattle would have beaten Minnesota and Carolina on the road .
