THE ROAD AHEAD ? From founder and publisher Robert Allbritton s memo : These transitions make perfect sense for the publication , coming a decade ( almost to the day ) after I recruited them to join this cause . We are about to experience the most exciting , and I expect most enjoyable , period of expansion in ten years . With our revenue rapidly expanding , I am eager to make robust new investments in editorial quality , in technology , in business talent , and in new markets that we have not yet conquered . http : politi . co 1RQ4tSz
