As an adult , and a journalist , I could see the same post Vietnam superpower set sail to Somalia at the request of public opinion and pack its bag at the first casualties , abandon the Rwandan Tutsis ( much like every western power ) before making good on its promises against the Serbs . All this to say that American Exceptionalism was only rarely exceptional . The myth even took a fatal beating in Iraq under George W . Bush , and worse , was shamed by the nonsense of Guantanamo and the sordid exactions of the Baghram prison in Afghanistan .
