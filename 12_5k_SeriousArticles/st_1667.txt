Amber and Kanye used to date , Kanye is now married to Kim , Chyna and Amber are now besties . Kanye and Amber broke up in 2010 but somehow we ' re still hearing about their beef as they continue to publicly bash each other . Let ' s not forget when he said he had to shower 30 times before getting together with Kim . However , the most jaw dropping interaction happened Wednesday when West launched an epic Twitter rant against Rose ' s ex Wiz Khalifia . " You let a stripper trap you , " he tweeted , referring to Rose ' s former profession . Rose jumped in the mix and shared some explicit glimpse of some back door action Kanye apparently likes in the bedroom . West deleted his series of tweets and has yet to fire back at his ex . She went on a podcast shortly after and called him " a f ing clown " and claimed she has no idea why he ' s still talking about her .
