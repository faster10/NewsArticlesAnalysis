The project uses a mix of technologies such as infrared thermography , muon radiography , and 3 D reconstruction to look inside four pyramids , which are more than 4 , 500 years old . The speed of the heating and cooling phases was used to uncover hypotheses such as empty areas in the pyramids , internal air currents , or different building materials used . I don t know yet what could lay behind such blocks or what these anomalies could be , but it will surely lead to major discoveries . Though new information could arrive soon . In addition to exploring new monuments , Tayoubi and his research partners will continue to probe the Great Pyramid for explanations of the anomalies .
