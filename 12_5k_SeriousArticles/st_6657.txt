I like to just go in there and say , " This is all happening in your neighborhood , these two , three hundred crew members black , white , every other color . " You know , a crew is like a United Nations . It ' s an immediate opportunity to meet and greet people other than the ones you see every day in your community . We ' re there at four or five in the morning . We leave whenever we finish , which is normally in the middle of the night sometimes .
