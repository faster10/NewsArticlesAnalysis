In 1995 I joined the Queen for an event in St . James Palace , London , commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Queen ' s Colleges which had been established in Belfast , Cork and Galway ( although only Belfast retains that name and original structure ) . In June 1996 I was honored to be invited on an official visit to Britain by Prime Minister John Major , which included a lunch with Queen and Prince Edward , preceded by an inspection of the guard of honor at Buckingham Palace . That was the most emotional moment for me , standing beside the Queen and hearing the Irish national anthem played .
