Kupchak wants to buy the Kobe as mentor story line , but he knows better than to count on it . He does want to teach , ? Kupchak says . He is aware of the legacy issues . And he s so much more patient than he used to be . But he s still such an instinctive competitor , at some point that patience runs out and those instincts kick in : I gave them their chance , and it ' s time to take over because I can do it better than anybody else . It was only 10 months ago that Bryant stormed out of a practice , sniping at Kupchak , These motherf ain t doing s for me . As tough as Russell may be , a repeat performance would shake any teenager s confidence .
