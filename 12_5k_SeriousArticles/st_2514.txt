Greg Popovich created his own version of it with the Spurs , and found great success with it . Pop was able to back up this offense with the defense that is needed to play it . It helps having defensive greats like Kawhi Leonard and Tim Duncan , even if he is 900 years old . Ian Clark will get the start at shooting guard against the Celtics . As the Warriors showed yesterday vs the Pacers , you can t be a pace and space team and beat the Warriors , they are better at that than you .
