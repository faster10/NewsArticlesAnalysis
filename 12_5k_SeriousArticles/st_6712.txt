Eddie Van Halen : It kind of started when I went to a Radio Shack type of store in Pasadena . They had a 12 string guitar hanging there , and I didn ' t want 12 I wanted six . And so I asked the guy , " Could I take six strings off and try it ? " And the guy said , " No , not unless you buy it . " So I borrowed the money from my parents , bought it , took six strings off and voila did what I wanted . The guitar it ' s on the first album cover . It ' s called Frankenstein .
