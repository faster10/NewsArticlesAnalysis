Maps are without question a critical feature for smartphones and tablets , and it makes sense for Apple to build its own . But it doesn ' t make sense to switch away from Google before Apple ' s own product is ready , and it ' s doubtful iPhone 5 sales would have been even slightly affected because the Google Maps app on Android is slightly better . Now it ' s fair to wonder if potential upgraders and switchers aren ' t holding back because they don ' t want to be forced into using inferior maps .
