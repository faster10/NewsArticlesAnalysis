The past year has been a great one for Jeremy Renner , who nabbed roles in back to back blockbusters " Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol " and " The Avengers , " and while the opening of " Legacy " is another solid notch on his belt , it still doesn ' t prove definitively that he is a real box office draw . The original " Bourne " trilogy earned the franchise a tremendous amount of goodwill from audiences , and it ' s that franchise trust that likely benefited " Legacy " ( and " Mission , " and " Avengers " ) more than Renner ' s presence . Whether the formidable actor can pull in audiences on his own remains to be seen .
