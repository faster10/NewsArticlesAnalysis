It is only slightly less far fetched to hope that countries won t just live up to their Paris promises in 2030 , but will extend these cuts throughout the twenty first century . After all , that is certainly not what governments are offering . The US , for example , clearly says that its target is for a single year : 2025 . We could even assume that countries trying to cut their emissions won t just move energy intensive production to other countries . ( Under the Kyoto Protocol , about 40 per cent of emissions leaked this way , with the EU s entire reduction circumvented through higher imports just from China . ) And we could believe that every single country will fulfill every single promise .
