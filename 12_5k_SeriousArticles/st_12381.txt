Whatever the case , if you know what to look for , the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus . For example , the next time a friend has a sudden " flu " what folks sometimes misdescribe as " the stomach flu " ask a few questions . Was your friend ' s illness one of those " 24 hour flus " that come and go quickly : retch or crap , then relief ? The diagnosis isn ' t quite so simple , but if the answer to this question is yes , your friend probably didn ' t have the flu at all .
