Davis actually took a 4 2 lead in the second when Sharapova seemed to lose concentration , but she couldn ' t hold serve in the seventh game with a flurry of errors . When they arrived at the tiebreaker , it seemed experience would win out . Sure enough , when Sharapova won a brutal , 27 stroke rally to level the tiebreaker at 5 all , she was two points from victory . But Davis prevailed , winning the second set when a tight Sharapova forehand fell wide .
