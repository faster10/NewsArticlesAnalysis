I am incredibly grateful to The Academy for embracing our film with so much love today . ? ? I was so happy to see my long time editor Tom McArdle honored and two members of our incredible ensemble , Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo , singled out for their masterful performances . ? ? I share today s nominations with so many others including every actor and crew member who came to set each day and gave their all . ? ? I want to also thank my co writer and friend Josh Singer , our producers who supported this film from the beginning , Tom Ortenberg and the team at Open Road and , most importantly , the true heroes of this film , the real life Spotlight team at The Boston Globe who let us tell their story .
