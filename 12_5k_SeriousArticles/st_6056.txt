Kimberly Mercier of Santa Rosa , California The " Peanuts " characters were more like friends , when I was growing up . Woodstock and Snoopy were always my favorites , even today . I spent many years ice skating in Santa Rosa as a child and would often see Charles Schulz there at his favorite table in the Warm Puppy Cafe in front of the fireplace . Sometimes , we got to watch him and his " senior " team play broomball on the ice . They enjoyed themselves so much .
