The difference is far greater than simply having one fewer guy blocking . In max protection , with the entire O line sliding one way , those linemen are zone blocking . But in a six man protection , some linemen will have to go one on one as man blockers . You can t slide all five linemen against a straight four man rush because the extra blocker ? either a tight end or running back ? is left one on one against the defensive end ( the ultimate mismatch ) .
