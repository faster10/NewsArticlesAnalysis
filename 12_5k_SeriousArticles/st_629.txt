The embassy in Tehran is now an Islamic cultural center and a museum , preserved from the days when it was a prison in 1979 . It stands as a symbol of the Iranian revolution , and is known in Iran as the " den of spies . " Old typewriters , communication equipment , even old visa photos , are on display . Every year on the anniversary of the hostage taking , Iranians hold rallies where " Death to America " is chanted , just as it was in 1979 .
