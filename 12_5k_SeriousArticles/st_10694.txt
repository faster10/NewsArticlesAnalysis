" The boys ( Donovan and Sonny ) don ' t like me going away but I can ' t wait until they ' re old enough so I can explain to them : ' You see all this all this multi colored stuff ( in our house ) , where do you think it comes from ? Well , it doesn ' t come form Father Christmas , somebody ' s got to work for it and that somebody is me . So you jog on and go to bed and I ' ll see you in a month . ' "
