Skinny : This has been an issue most of the year . It s only been magnified since Brady lost most of his trusted quick release targets in Dion Lewis , Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola . The line hasn t been able to hold up while Brady has had to hold the ball longer for lesser receivers to get open . Maybe it gets better when Edelman returns , and Brady will be able to go back to the patented quick drop release , but there s no guarantee Edelman can step in and automatically provide the fix . Amendola has returned , but he s still not close to 100 percent . Vollmer will be back , but he has a bum ankle . There doesn t appear a magic cure for Brady to be comfortable safe in the pocket unless everyone s fully healthy .
