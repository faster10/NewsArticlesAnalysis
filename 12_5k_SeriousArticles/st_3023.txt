HTC ' s 5 inch A9 looks like HTC simply 3D printed out an iPhone and made a few cosmetic changes to it . Oddly , this tactic works beautifully . Only the most harrumphish of intellectual property guardians would not concede that the all metal A9 is a gorgeous handset to touch , hold and operate . HTC has always had the prettiest Android handsets and this one is no exception , regardless of how they arrived at its form factor . So if design is important to you , this is worth looking at .
