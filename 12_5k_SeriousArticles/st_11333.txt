The 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club in Ireland was most memorable for the contribution made by Darren Clarke , pictured above , just weeks after the death of his wife , Heather . Clarke , a popular figure with golf fans , was given a rapturous reception throughout the event , but particularly on the final day when he claimed a singles win over Zach Johnson . Europe were comfortable winners by 18 and a half points to nine and a half , and in the below picture home captain Ian Woosnam has just celebrated by drinking a pint of Guinness . Pictured alongside him are Sam Torrance , Clarke and Lee Westwood
