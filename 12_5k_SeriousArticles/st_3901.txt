There is a little bit of relief on the horizon from the federal government , but it ' s really minor at best . Regulation soon goes into effect that will require airlines to refund bag fees but only if the bag is lost permanently . In other words , if your bag is simply delayed for a day or two or 10 , then this regulation doesn ' t apply . It ' s only if that bag is lost and gone forever . Not much teeth to this rule .
