Within the memory of many of our own citizens ( and many of your own Greatest Generation ) , there have arisen demigods whose sole purpose was to lead their chosen people into the darkness of civilization . We should not have to name specifics , but there was a man in the early 20th century who sought to deprive vast numbers of people basic human rights , who burned books ( like shutting down the Internet today , perhaps ) , who demonized certain faiths , and who publicly bullied people of different colors and cultures . There were some like him in Russia , and in the Far East and Southeast Asia , some in the Middle East , some in South America . We ' ve seen them , we have been stained by them , we have died under their hands , and we do not wish to see them again .
