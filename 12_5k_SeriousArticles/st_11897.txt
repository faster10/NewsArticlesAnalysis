Logistically it is a massive project the complexity of getting kit and people all over the world to match up with my various stages , and often in remote countries has been challenging , to say the least . My team and I are learning all the time and I for one am looking forward to the ocean and the simplicity of it . If something breaks I have to deal with it , whereas on land life can get quite complicated at times , because of borders , needing to find food and shelter , people etc .
