Last night s Democratic debate was supposed to center on domestic policy , but after the attacks in Paris , it was altered to focus in large part on terrorism and foreign policy . On one hand , that was necessary ? when sudden and important events happen in the world , the people who want to lead our country have the chance to show why they ought to be in charge and give some sense of how they d handle crises . On the other hand , without a lot of time for reflection , chances were high that the discussion would produce more heat than light .
