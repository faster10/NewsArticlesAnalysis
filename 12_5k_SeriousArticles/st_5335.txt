( On how close Lynch was to playing today ) He tried . We rested him all week , and we re habbed him all week long , and really the first time we took a real look at it was out here in pregame , and he just couldn t get going . ? We re going to try to take care of him , and he s going to make a trip on Monday to go see Dr Meyers in Philadelphia and see if we can figure out what his going on . It s an abdominal issue , and there s a lot going on there , so we have to see what that all means .
