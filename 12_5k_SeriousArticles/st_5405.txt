It s difficult to do this without hand gestures , but try to follow along : All the way up here is Ben Carson s number . Then waaaaaay down there is your number . What you will want to do is make his number go down , to where yours is . If you check out the calendar , you ll see that there is a televised presidential debate Wednesday night . What a splendiferous opportunity to point out to voters , many of whom watch television , that Ben Carson obviously should not be president .
