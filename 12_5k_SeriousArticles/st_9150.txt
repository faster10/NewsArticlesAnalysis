When asked about dealing with Congress as president , Christie again used the question to take several shots at Obama . While characterizing Congress as a den of vipers , " Christie pointed out that dealing with the New Jersey legislature wasn t an Easter egg hunt . He cited three keys to working with an opposition legislature . First , he stressed the need to speak clearly in emphasizing priorities . You can t be everything to everyone . Second , he cited the importance of developing a good personal working relationship with legislative leaders . Here he chided Obama for waiting almost seven years to invite House Republican leader and later Speaker John Boehner on Air Force One : If I was president and Nancy Pelosi was speaker , I d have her on the plane whenever she wanted . Finally , he noted the importance of acting decisively when tackling problems , again contrasting his position with Obama s actions : I wouldn t have taken seven years to make a decision on the Keystone pipeline .
