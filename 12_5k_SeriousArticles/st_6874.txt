We ' re now on our way to Timbuktu , which was just retaken by French and Malian troops . Timbuktu is one of the three northern regions controlled by Islamist rebel groups since an April 2012 coup that effectively split Mali into two . Thousands of displaced families are expected to be returning home in the coming days , likely overwhelming critical services that have been weakened since being cut off from the world 10 months ago . We ' ve heard reports that the rebels looted health clinics , damaging and even destroying some . Many doctors and nurses have fled south or across the border to Mauritania , leaving limited support for the local population .
