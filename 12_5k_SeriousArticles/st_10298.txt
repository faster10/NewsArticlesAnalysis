Latiker : I tell kids when they walk through the doors , " This is a peace place , this is a safe place . " We ' ve had six gangs in my living room at one time . . . . But that was the safe place . And you know what ? They respected that . They could sit down together , they could eat together and they could talk about their problems together because ( the rule ) was set when they came in the door .
