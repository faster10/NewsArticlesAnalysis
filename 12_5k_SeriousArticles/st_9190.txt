The term , " feral hogs , " refer to either domesticated hogs that are now wild or Russian boars , or the hybrid of the two . Hogs have roamed the U . S . since the 1530s and were an important source of food for the early pioneers . It wasn ' t until the 1930s when the Eurasian wild boar was released into the Texas landscape that things began brewing for the perfect pig storm . Given their ability to adapt well to most environments and their breeding capabilities , a pair of hogs can quickly become hundreds . Sows can become pregnant at 6 to 8 months old and are capable of birthing four to six piglets per litter .
