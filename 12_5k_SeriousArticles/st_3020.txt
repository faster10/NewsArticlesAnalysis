For anyone in business , it ' s hard to argue against the 6S Plus being the best overall phone out there right now . The 5 . 5 inch model is top of the line in what has effectively become the default work phone system ( iOS ) for most companies that choose to standardise on a platform . The 6S Plus ' s other additions are nice , too . It has upgraded cameras ( 12 megapixels and 5 megapixel ' selfie ' ) with better low light photography . It has added 4K video recording ( twice the resolution of ' full HD ' ) , too , and boosted its slow motion mode to 1080p ( ' full HD ' ) . A new feature , ' 3D Touch ' , lets you press harder on a screen to see a shortcut menu pop up for certain apps such as Instagram , Photos , Camera or Mail .
