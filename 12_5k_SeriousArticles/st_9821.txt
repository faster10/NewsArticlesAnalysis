Another sign of change ? In the " Newsroom , " the HBO series from 2012 by Aaron Sorkin , the main character , Will McAvoy , a disillusioned star anchorman , is asked " why is America the greatest country in the world ? " His totally nostalgic and enraged answer paints the failed , or imaginary , good old times of American Exceptionalism : " We stood up for what was right . We fought for moral reasons , we passed laws , struck down laws for moral reasons . We waged wars on poverty , not poor people . We sacrificed , we cared about our neighbors , we put our money where our mouths were , and we never beat our chest . The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one . America is not the greatest country in the world anymore . "
