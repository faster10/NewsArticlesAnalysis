I have never been a numbers guy , said Green , who still had some nice numbers ? 20 points , 10 rebounds and 10 assists ? while shooting a perfect 9 of 9 from the floor . That s how you do it . It comes within the flow of the game , the flow of the offense . When you start to do what I did yesterday , it doesn t work out . I was kind of happy I didn t get it yesterday because I didn t deserve it .
