OK , like the beer consumption figures , this one probably stretches the truth a bit . But according to the National Chicken Council , Americans will eat 1 . 3 billion chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday . That s up 3 from the group s estimate during the 2015 Super Bowl . If the figure is true , then every man , woman , child , and baby in America would eat an average of four wings on Feb . 7 . Good thing each of us also has that gallon of beer to wash it down !
