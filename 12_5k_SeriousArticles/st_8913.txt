Cultural groups that found effective ways to bind non kin together out competed groups that were less cohesive . This is a view put forward originally by Charles Darwin , but revived in modern times by the biologists David Sloan Wilson , at Bimghamton University , and Edward O . Wilson , at Harvard . This is a view called " group selection , " because it argues that our genes came down to us today not just because some individuals were more fit than their neighbors , but because some groups were more fit ( more cohesive and cooperative ) than their neighboring groups .
