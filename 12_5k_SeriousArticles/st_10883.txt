With Derrick Rose out with a sprained left ankle and Aaron Brooks out with a left hamstring injury , the Bulls might not have much choice other than to put Butler on Curry for much of the game . Kirk Hinrich , who scored a season high 14 points against the Suns on Wednesday , is expected to get the start at the point for Rose but is still on a minutes limit of around 20 as he recovers from a toe injury . E ' Twaun Moore will be backing him up .
