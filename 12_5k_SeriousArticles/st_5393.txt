" We are 15 days from the finish line and we cannot falter , we cannot stop , we cannot take a single vote for granted , " Clinton said Monday . " I am asking you to work as hard for Barack as you worked for me . If you made phone calls for me , make them for Barack . If you walked streets for me , make them for Barack . If you talked to your friends and neighbors for me , do it again for Barack . We cannot risk four more years of the same failed Republican policies . "
