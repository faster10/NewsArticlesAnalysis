One thing to avoid when comparing running backs is equating production to skill . Offensive line play and number of carries can be just as important as the running back himself when it comes to stats .

However , he had more carries than anyone else and , in the opinion of B R draft guru Matt Miller , isn ' t the top back available in this year ' s draft .
