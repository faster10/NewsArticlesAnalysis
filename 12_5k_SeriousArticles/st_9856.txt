This worldview ? which Cruz has described as neither full neocon nor libertarian isolationist , but Coates would label ( if she had to ) neo Reaganism ? presents a major distinction between himself and fellow White House hopeful Marco Rubio , where arguably few exist . The two senators are close in age , both young , sons of Cuban immigrants , and closely aligned on social and economic policy . Cruz likes to point out that the two differ wildly on immigration based on Rubio s support for a 2013 reform package that would have created a pathway to citizenship . But Rubio has since disavowed that measure , advocating instead for a piecemeal approach to immigration reform that critics say would ensure a pathway to citizenship never actually begins .
