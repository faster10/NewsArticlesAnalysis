Chairman Sir Robert Owen referred to suggestions the billionaire oligarch , a fellow dissident , could have killed Litvinenko because he was being blackmailed over illegal activities in the UK . Litvinenko did occasionally make comments suggesting taking some form of action against his long standing friend after he reduced the amount of money he was giving him . But Sir Robert said he was quite satisfied these were never put into effect . Litvinenko and Berezovsky remained friends until the end of Litvinenko s life , he wrote . There was no blackmail and therefore no motive for Berezovsky to have Litvinenko killed . Berezovsky died in 2013 .
