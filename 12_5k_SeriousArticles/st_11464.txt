The Hanson family Sue , Peter , and their 2 year old daughter Christine , the youngest victim on September 11 died together on Flight 175 and will be listed together . Their names might have been adjacent even in an alphabetical listing . But then there is a family that died on Flight 77 Charles Falkenberg and Leslie Whittington , married for 17 years , and their children Zoe and Dana whose names would have been separated by a simple alphabetical order . And then there are adjacencies that express connections that are more hidden , and yet profound . Abigail Ross Goodman lost both her father , Richard Ross , on Flight 11 , which crashed into the North Tower , and her best friend , Stacey Leigh Sanders , who was working that morning in the North Tower on the 96th floor . For Abigail Ross Goodman , the names of these two loved ones will forever be linked in her memory and now also at the memorial .
