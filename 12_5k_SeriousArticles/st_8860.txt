In another , far more chilling , case made public after Clinton s acquittal , a nursing home administrator named Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton raped her . According to Broaddrick , after meeting Clinton at a gubernatorial campaign visit in 1978 , she expressed interest in volunteering for the campaign . Broaddrick claims that , while attending a business conference in a hotel , Clinton suggested the two chat over coffee in her room to avoid some reporters . There , she claims that Clinton held her down , bit her lip , and forced himself upon her despite physical and verbal protest . Three weeks later , at a small Clinton fundraiser , Broaddrick claims that Hillary Clinton approached her to express appreciation for everything you do , which Broaddrick interpreted as a reference to her silence about the assault .
