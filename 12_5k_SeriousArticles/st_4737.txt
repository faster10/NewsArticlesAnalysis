Crockett runs like a taller version of Atlanta upstart Devonta Freeman , who is 5 8 and 206 pounds and ran the 40 yard dash in 4 . 58 seconds . Crockett ran it in 4 . 62 . He had a much better vertical leap ( 40 inches to 311 2 ) and broad jump ( 10 feet 5 inches to 9 foot 10 ) than Freeman . The biggest knocks on Crockett were his upright ball carrying style and lack of power , not to mention playing against FCS competition .
