Romita : I couldn ' t tell you why anything lasts that long , other than that it ' s a great representation of a hero . The way the character has been done all these years had its ups and downs like any series . Recently , the past 20 years , it ' s been done how it should be done : he does fail , he does get the snot beat out of him . I think that ' s the key to the character because none of us are infallible . His weak point over the past 76 years is when he was infallible . The realization that this is a superhero to the nth degree that has to struggle with real life is what comics are all about .
