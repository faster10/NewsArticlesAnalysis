" Sen . Byrd combined a devotion to the U . S . Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate . We will remember him for his fighter ' s spirit , his abiding faith , and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes . . . . We are glad to know that Senator Byrd and his beloved Erma are reunited . We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire Byrd family . "
