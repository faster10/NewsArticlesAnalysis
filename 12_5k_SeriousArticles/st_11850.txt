Sorry Richie , but we can ' t get you any higher than No 5 . One hundred Tests as captain and a World Cup triumph speak for themselves , but that choke against France in the 2007 quarter final when the All Blacks looked destined for glory is the one blot in his copybook as captain . McCaw will have the chance of redemption next year at the World Cup on these shores and should he lift the Webb Ellis trophy again , he may just find himself at No 1 .
