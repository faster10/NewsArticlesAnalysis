We finished up our camp at Mt Maunganui , and within days England had arrived , as part of their Australasian tour . They were a very strong team , led by the guy who was probably the best first five in the world at that point , Jonny Wilkinson . I was selected on the bench for the first test in Wellington on June 14 , which was an honour but also a reflection of my ability to cover two positions . I didn ' t get on , and we lost . My first game with an All Blacks jersey on my back , and it was a loss to a team to which you really , really don ' t want to lose . Wilkinson was incredible that night . He was in his prime and tactically out of this world . He kicked us out of the game , scoring all England ' s 15 points , for a 15 13 result .
