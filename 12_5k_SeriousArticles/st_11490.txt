This isn ' t the first time Delta has retired the DC 9 . The Atlanta based airline got rid of their first fleet of DC 9s in 1993 . But 15 years later , it acquired 72 DC 9s as part of a merger with Northwest . It ' s been taking those planes out of service little by little until last week , when Delta retired its final six . ( Delta said two of those DC 9s will remain on standby for a few weeks as backup planes . )
