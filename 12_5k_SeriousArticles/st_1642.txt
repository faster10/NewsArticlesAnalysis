We can in fact create jobs and provide job security . We can create a situation where wages begin to rise . We can create a situation for our children to be able to get a decent job to pay down their college debt . We can re assume our role in the world . But all of this has to come together when we have a positive attitude , an optimistic approach , an ability for us to set the tune as conservatives , to invite other people in to be part of that orchestra .
