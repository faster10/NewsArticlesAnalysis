Because of the 2009 cutoff , the lawyers will have to use creative tactics to hold New GM liable . For example , if New GM continued with an ongoing fraud after 2009 to conceal defects , or if it knowingly deceived the bankruptcy judge about its wrongdoing , that could potentially neutralize GM ' s supposed immunity . If this is troubling , blame the bankruptcy court and the others who agreed to this cutoff . You can blame New GM , too , but it was just acting as any company does , whether new or old : It exists to maximize profit . Any company ' s management is legally obligated to do just that .
