This week , the full video of Ray Rice slugging his fianc e ( now wife ) in an elevator , and then dragging her unconscious body out and leaving it on the floor , became public . Suddenly I feel duped , dirty by association . I want that helmet exorcised from my house . But I can ' t just do that . I helped build Ray Rice into the good guy role model to my kids and now I have to explain to them why I am not proud of him .
