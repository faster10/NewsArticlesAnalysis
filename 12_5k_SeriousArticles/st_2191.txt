Charlie Halford : I totally understand that . I like to think that we ' re stepping up to the plate , at least with this show . The greatest compliment we can hope to receive is the blessing of die hard " Hellblazer " fans . Everyone involved with the show have become relatively big fans of the comic book . You keep wanting to read one story then the next and the next . I asked the writers , what ' s the " bible " for this show ? They said , " It ' s the ' Hellblazer ' comic . " I took great confidence in that .
