It wasn ' t all terrible : In fairness to Bieber , he did some things right . He made it clear when he did not understand a question . That ' s critical , because if he answers a question without fully understanding it , the court will later on assume he understood it when he answered it . Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers . If he could carve out his other behavior , in some respects , he ' s not half bad as a deponent .
