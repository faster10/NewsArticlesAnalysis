It s a utopian idea to think that Wikipedia is written , edited and maintained by all who use it . But in reality , it s a dedicated group of volunteers who act as the site s caretakers , protecting it from vandals and making sure its entries are as accurate as possible . Thus , they needed a place to convene , discuss and share ideas about all things Wiki . The international meetup , which began in Frankfurt , Germany , in 2005 , took what was an unorganized group of volunteers and brought them together in one place each year . The conference now includes hundreds of participants from close to 70 countries around the world and includes speakers , workshops and of course , Jimmy Wales .
