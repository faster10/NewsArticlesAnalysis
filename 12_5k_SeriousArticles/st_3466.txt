Naureen Haider of Jensen Beach , Florida It ' s a great loss to the country . Ms . Bhutto went to the same elementary school as mine , Convent of Jesus and Mary School in Karachi , and she was always an example to us , to motivate , thus that it is proud to be a female . Benazir , not only earned the best of qualifications on merit , but also proved to the world , that this is what patriotism is . My family having met Benazir personally several times , sends our deepest condolences to the family and prayers go out to the children . May Allah be with them . Ameen ! !
