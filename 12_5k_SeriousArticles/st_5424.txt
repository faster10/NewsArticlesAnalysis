Even if you are not hosting this year , call whoever is and offer to bring something . This guarantees there is a dish that is prepared healthily and fits into your diet . If the host tells you a dish is not neccesary , a simple " I ' d love to participate . What are you planning on serving ? " will help . Knowing in advance what will be offered gives you the opportunity to think about the food choices you will make so that you are better prepared to stick to your healthy diet .
