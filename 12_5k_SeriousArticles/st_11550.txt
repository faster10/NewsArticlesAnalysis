At the end of our time with the DB9 GT , we came to the conclusion that while it looks almost identical to the DB9 that s been sold for the last decade ( and of which there are many cheaper examples on the pre owned car market ) , its performance and ergonomics makes a strong case for the new model among folks with 200 large to blow on a sports car . Thinking longer term , those chaps may also consider that the GT is likely to be considered among the best and most collectible models of the entire DB9 line . For such an old car , it sure can perform many neat tricks .
