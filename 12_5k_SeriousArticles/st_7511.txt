Sally said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer . She said being in love is the greatest happiness in life : ' Being in love is like being in a different world . You can take anything that ' s dished out because there ' s someone who cares for you . Happiness to me is when you feel good and you make somebody else feel good . You don ' t even know what you ' re doing and you ' re making someone happy '
