Even if the protesters melt away , however , it appears they have already achieved an important goal : They have put income inequality on the national agenda . Yawning gaps between the top 1 versus the other 99 have been simmering as a political issue for a long time , stretching back before the Great Recession . But most middle class Americans haven ' t seriously objected , whether because their sense of their current income was skewed , or because they expected they ' d strike it rich one day themselves . ( One poll from 2000 showed that no less than 19 considered themselves in the top 1 and another 20 on top of that expected they would be soon . )
