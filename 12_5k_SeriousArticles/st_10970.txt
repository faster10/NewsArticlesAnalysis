Islam is not a monolith and the fact that ISIS exploits superficial religious teachings of Islam does not make their motivation Islamic in any way . There is little policy substance to be found in propagating this narrative on their behalf it does more harm to the innocent civilians caught in the middle . The intention to excuse imperialist policy that created , aided , and abetted terrorism in the Middle East and Africa cannot morph into a selective labeling without affecting innocent adherents of Islam . At any rate , the oversimplifying of Muslims into the terrorist label will push Muslim youth into the hands of terror organizations because labels tend to come to life in extreme situations this is how Al Shabaab recruits under the nose of Kenyan intelligence agencies and this is how Boko Haram exploits ethnic divisions in Nigeria . What will stop ISIL from taking the same advantages when their enemy keeps offering ?
