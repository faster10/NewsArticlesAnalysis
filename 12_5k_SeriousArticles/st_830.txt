When Suu Kyi was released from house arrest , she spoke about holding another Panglong Conference in order to address the needs of Burma s ethnic groups . But such a meeting never happened . Although the junta and its quasi military successor government signed ceasefires with many ethnic militias , including a much touted agreement last month , fighting still flares in Shan and Kachin states . The UNHCR estimates that around half a million refugees , mostly from ethnic groups , are still outside the country , many in neighboring Thailand . In addition , Burma s population of internally displaced and stateless people is nearly 1 . 2 million strong , according to the UNHCR . Among them are the Rohingya , a Muslim ethnic group from far western Burma that has been disenfranchised in this election .
