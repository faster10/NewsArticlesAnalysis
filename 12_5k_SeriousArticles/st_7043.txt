Losers : Bonds and Clemens . Alas , it wasn ' t enough to help these two , or Mark McGwire , who was in his final year on the ballot . Bonds ' total went from 36 percent to just 44 percent and Clemens from 37 to 45 . Both still have six years left on the ballot but The Purge was for now a one time thing , so this would have been the year they needed to get a big increase . They didn ' t get it and it appears their likelihood of ever getting elected by the BBWAA is slim .
