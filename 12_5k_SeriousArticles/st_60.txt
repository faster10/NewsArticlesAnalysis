It remains to be seen , however , whether the pledges from Trump ' s friends will actually be paid and if so , how . Trump , for one , has a well documented habit of donating things to charity that don ' t actually cost him any money , like " Lunch with Donald Trump " and golf trips to the resorts he owns . Nonprofits then auction off what Trump himself has donated , and are sometimes even expected to share the auction proceeds with Trump ' s foundation .
