The politicians who supported the financial rescue in 2008 get no applause . Sen . Bob Bennett of Utah lost his Republican primary in 2008 in large part due to his emphatic support of TARP , the Troubled Asset Relief Program . Voters see politicians rushing money to rescue high flying bankers from the bankers ' own irresponsibility and , naturally , the voters do not like it . The politicians insist that they acted to save the country from an even greater disaster . But who believes them ? For that matter , who even knows what such a " greater disaster " would possibly look like ?
