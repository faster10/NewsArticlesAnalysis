I am a social worker . I knew that I could run an organization , but wasn ' t sure about developing curriculum . When I created Team 2 , my first pick was the best teacher I could find . Rich Beganski is the perfect complement , or opposite , of who I am . He ' s meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum . He is an operations genius . He was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach . I ' ve never been an assistant and don ' t want to be one .
