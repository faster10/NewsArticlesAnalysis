Our team certainly showed guts when it took it to the other team early in Sunday ' s singles matches . We were indeed tied with them as the scoreboard turned wonderfully " red " . Our players started fast as I had asked them to in my comments the night before . I asked them to really concentrate on holes 2 5 , as the Europeans had won too many early battles on these particular holes . But in the end , the facts are that the other team played better . My hat ' s off and congratulations to them .
