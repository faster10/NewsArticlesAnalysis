Trump , blessed with more raw political cunning than any 2016 contender ( including Clinton ) hasn t yet won a single contest , but he s got good reason to pretend it s already down to just the Democrat and him . That strategy allows him to talk past his Republican opponents , legitimizes him as his party s frontrunner , gives him pushback against the argument he d get creamed in a general election , and lets him dry erase the fact that he flirted with not so conservative politics and the Clinton Clan .
