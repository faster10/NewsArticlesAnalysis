Lamar Odom reportedly moved in with Khloe Karadashian after he was released from the hospital earlier this week . Odom was famously admitted to a Las Vegas area hospital on Oct . 13 after he was found unconscious in a nearby brothel . According to reports , Odom was said to have overdosed on cocaine and a sexual performance enhancing drug , though the district attorney where Odom was found has opted not to press charges because evidence in the case did not prove that Odom used the drug during his three days while he was in Nevada .
