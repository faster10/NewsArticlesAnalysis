I think it will be strange , Gentry said . It s going to be a little bit different , in that these are people we did something really special with and together , so you have a closeness there . But after that whole ( ring ceremony ) is over , we have to find a way to compete and beat those guys , which is not going to be easy . But I think it s great . You spend your whole life trying to get to where we got last year , and that s to win a championship in this league . It took me 27 years to do that . It s something really , really special and something you ll never forget .
