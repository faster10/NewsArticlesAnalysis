" Columbian Mammoths grew to 12 feet at the shoulder , taller than woolly mammoths ( Mammuthus primigenius ) and about the size of the modern Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus ) , " the museum website said . " Their very long tusks curved down from the face , then upward at the ends . Columbian mammoths were herbivores , with a diet that included grasses and conifers . They chewed grass with large , flat , washboard like teeth that are very similar to the teeth of modern elephants . "
