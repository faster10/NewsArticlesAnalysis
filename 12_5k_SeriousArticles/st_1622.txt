Hagupit , which means " smash " or " lash " in Filipino , is a fitting name for the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year ( it is actually known as Ruby by locals ) . When it was first spotted by satellites several days ago , it was immediately likened to Haiyan , the super typhoon that killed more than 6 , 000 people last year . And while Hagupit didn ' t create a more than 20 foot storm surge like Haiyan did , it has still left a trail of destruction in a region that was still recovering from the latest of what seems like an unending series of calamities .
