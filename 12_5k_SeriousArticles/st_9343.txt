The money issue I had to adjust to , but pretty soon the idea of only watching money go out instead of in became normal . I had a certain threshold and I knew when my balance got down to a certain amount it meant I had to go home . As far as lodging , that turned out to be pretty simple too . I had no problem finding places to sleep nor did it bother me after I was on the road . It loved the benefit of meeting new people every night !
