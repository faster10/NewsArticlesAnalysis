I did not grow up working on cars . I did not have a father that wrenched on cars . It was not part of my life growing up . I taught myself a few things ( like ) changing oil . But for the most part , I had no skills around car maintenance . I cried all the way to school the first day ' cause I was like , " What have I done ? " So it was terrifying and overwhelming . And at least three solid times in that first quarter , I was like , " I ' m quitting . I cannot do this . "
