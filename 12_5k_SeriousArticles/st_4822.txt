AM : We know that in 2007 only seven percent of directors in the UK were women . This spiked up slightly in 2008 to 12 percent , but since the recession hit , we ' ve had reports that it ' s gone down as much as 20 percent . Screenwriters aren ' t much better off either . In 2007 , it was 12 percent , and it went up to 18 percent in 2008 . But again , that ' s dipped as we ' ve gone into the recession .
