It ' s pretty crazy . . . . It ' s like watching a child grow up , to a certain degree . I think in the very beginning of the series she was extremely , extremely vulnerable . At first she was mess , then she was sober and a raw nerve . Now she comes back with her confidence in tact and not wanting to stir any s " up except to be a responsible party . And it seems the whole entire world has imploded , and she ' s gonna have a hard time maneuvering within it because nobody ' s stable over there . She ' s now become the face of stability ( Laughs ) , which is kind of funny . "
