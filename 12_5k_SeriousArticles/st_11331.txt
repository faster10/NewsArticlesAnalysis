This must surely rank as the single most dramatic moment in Ryder Cup history , with Bernhard Langer missing a six foot putt in 1991 that would have clinched a singles win over Hale Irwin , a 14 14 draw and retention of the trophy for Europe . Agonisingly for Bernard Gallacher ' s team , the ball slipped past the hole and the hosts could celebrate victory at Kiawah Island . It was an event that was at times so bitter , it was given the name ' War on the Shore '
