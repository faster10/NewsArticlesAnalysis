As Zuckerberg does so , he will presumably lean on the example of Bill Gates : the language in the letter to Max mirrors some of the terms that the Gates Foundation set out . But Gates isn t the only model for Zuckerberg ( who is , of course , not new to philanthropy himself , either ) . In recent years , a growing number of young Silicon Valley executives have made vast donations to charity as they ve done so , they ve refined a model that Sean Parker , founder of Napster and Zuckerberg s one time mentor , christened hacker philanthropy in a Wall Street Journal article earlier this year . Three of the six most generous philanthropists in the US last year were in their 30s , and in tech : as Zuckerberg grows up , building a family and finding a bigger purpose , Silicon Valley seems to be growing up with him . And , perhaps , it s finding grander status symbols , too : when you re so rich that a private jet seems a bit downmarket , it may be that the only way to project your triumph is to wear scruffy clothes and give it all away .
