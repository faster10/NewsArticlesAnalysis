Reprise , reversed : This match was a reprise from the 2009 classic that Nadal and Verdasco played , a five hour , 14 minute five setter that Nadal came through in his lone title run in Melbourne . That 6 7 ( 4 7 ) , 6 4 , 7 6 ( 7 2 ) , 6 7 ( 1 7 ) , 6 4 win for Nadal was eerily similar to this match in terms of feel and quality , but the final result was quite the opposite . It was the best Grand Slam result of Verdasco s career to date , which helped him break into the top 10 because of it .
