Florida ' s Stand Your Ground law changed the previous understanding of self defense in a simple way . Traditionally , one could only claim self defense if there was no reasonable chance to retreat from a situation where one felt threatened . The revised law says if you feel threatened with imminent great bodily harm , you may use force , including guns , against the person you find threatening , even if there is a reasonable opportunity to retreat . What this invites is the settling of personal disputes with guns , as evidenced by a 300 increase in the number of killings by private citizens justified by " self defense " in Florida since the law passed .
