In California , a judge reduced a sentence of a convicted rapist because the woman didn ' t fight hard enough . The judge said , " If someone doesn ' t want to have sexual intercourse , the body shuts down . The body will not permit that to happen unless a lot of damage is inflicted , and we heard nothing about that in this case . That tells me that the victim in this case , although she wasn ' t necessarily willing , she didn ' t put up a fight . "
