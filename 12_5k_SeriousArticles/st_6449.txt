Now , the nice thing about baseball is that we ve got a hell of a lot of hard data . However much I might have thought Mike Moustakas was a mirage last October , it s impossible to deny the hard fact that he posted a . 353 wOBA this season , and has probably become a fundamentally different and better hitter . It s very difficult to deny the notion that Kendrys Morales wasn t healthy last year but is healthy this year , and is a fine hitter when healthy .
