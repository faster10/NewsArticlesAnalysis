FLINTOFF : Yes , we expect to hear some angry reaction from Russian officials today . You know , they ' ve already said that this is another move by NATO into a former communist country , and they see it as part of a plot to surround and isolate Russia . And this also comes at a time when Russia ' s been trying to cultivate individual NATO countries , such as France , and get them to cooperate in Syria . So it ' s going to be interesting to see whether Russia maintains a high level of confrontational rhetoric about this or whether it ' s going to be more conciliatory .
