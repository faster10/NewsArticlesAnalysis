" I do not have political experience , I have a life journey , " Carson wrote . " . . . My candidacy is different , that I grant you . I have neither Donald Trump ' s money or Jeb Bush ' s political network . However , I wouldn ' t trade a single child I treated for all of Trump ' s money . While I admire the Bush family ' s dedication to service , I too served nights , weekends , holidays , birthdays and anniversaries with severely injured patients were my public service . ?
