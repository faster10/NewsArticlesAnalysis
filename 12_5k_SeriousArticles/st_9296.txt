After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize , the congressman swallowed his pride . In a statement , Young wrote : " I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan , Alaska . There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend it was a poor choice of words . That word , and the negative attitudes that come with it , should be left in the 20th century , and I ' m sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform . "
