I have written about this before . On the 10th anniversary of 9 11 , I reflected on how the U . S . militaristic response to the attacks did more to erode our core democratic principles than it did to keep us safe . The most painful political truth , I observed , about the decade ( now decade and a half ) following 9 11 is that it represents a severe undoing of our democracy such that the values which defined us before that date may never be regained .
