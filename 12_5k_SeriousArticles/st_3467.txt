Humnaa Umar of Great Falls , Virginia The death of Benazir Bhutto not only marked the end of a revolutionary political leader , but also the demise of a pioneer in terms of women ' s rights . In a country with a strict gender hierarchy , Bhutto inspired countless women with her ceaseless supply of fortitude . Mwilu Mwanachilenga of Lusaka , Zambia A Martyr . A pity though that a life that I looked up to , for the whole 25 years of my existence , could ever end like this . Condolences to the family and may her soul rest in peace
