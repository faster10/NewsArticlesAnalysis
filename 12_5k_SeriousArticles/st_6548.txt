Innocent spectators were targeted by a scary cadre of online vigilantes and two blameless men saw their images plastered over the New York Post s front page with the news that the feds were looking for them ( not true ) . When the FBI released photos of the actual suspects , the Tsarnaev brothers , an unchastened Reddit promptly seized on the resemblance between one suspect ( Dzhokhar ) and a Brown University student , Sunil Tripathi , who had been missing for several weeks . Someone on Twitter claimed he d heard Tripathi s name on the Boston police scanner , and the story , apparently verified , spread , causing Tripathi s family great pain . ( The student s body was later found in the Providence River . ) ?
