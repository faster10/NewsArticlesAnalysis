" Domestic violence is a real tragedy in our lives , " says Jenner . " Nicole ' s death could have been prevented . I have five daughters so of course I want women everywhere , especially women of this new generation , to know the story . They need to realize that they have a voice and they need to tell somebody if someone has hurt them . And if Nicole ' s legacy can be protecting other women , then that would be a really positive thing . "
