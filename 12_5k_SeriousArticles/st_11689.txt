Almost from the very start , slaves were a common sight in the executive mansion . A list of construction workers building the White House in 1795 includes five slaves named Tom , Peter , Ben , Harry and Daniel all put to work as carpenters . Other slaves worked as masons in the government quarries , cutting the stone for early government buildings , including the White House and U . S . Capitol .
