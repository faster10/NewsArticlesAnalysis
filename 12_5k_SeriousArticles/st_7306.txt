Yes , Donald Trump s campaign against illegal immigration has pandered to terrible xenophobia . But there s more involved . Illegal immigration has been cynically used by many wealthy Americans to bring in low wage scab labor and drive down the wages of lower skilled American workers . You think Mitt Romney had Guatemalans mowing his lawn in Massachusetts as a cultural outreach program ? They worked cheap . ( As people probably say in the country clubs : If you can t send the job to the Third World , bring the Third World to the job ! ) I am a huge supporter of immigration ? my parents were immigrants ? but our current policies are insane and upside down . We have allowed the unregulated and unsafe importation of low wage labor ? while blocking safe , regulated and skilled immigration . And anyone who s said peep has been called a racist . Trump has put this issue on the map . Quite right too .
