Radicals argue that the masses get co opted by elections . This just doesn t line up with lived experience . They point to the enthusiasm around Obama s 2008 victory as proof that politicians simply manipulate voters . That may be true , but it is untenable to say that social movements were co opted by Obama . Since Obama s election this country has witnessed a steep rise in social movements . Disappointment after Obama raised expectations may have partly fueled such a movement to the streets . Occupy Wall Street was unprecedented . The growth of Black Lives Matter and the DREAMers movement developed principally in the years since Obama came to office . The idea of electoral co option sounds theoretically plausible , but it is simply a theory without standing in our reality . One socialist website even makes it seem that Bernie will undermine the revolutionary working class s aspirations for syndicalist control of the economy . This kind of thinking is the result of a mind body split . These radicals are clearly not experiencing the embodied world around them . Instead they seem to be using deductive logic based on theory , not sound history . It is worth noting that 1936 and 1946 , in the midst of the New Deal ? which much of Bernie s platform alludes to ? had some of the largest mobilizations of strikes in American history . People were not co opted by the New Deal they were emboldened by it .
