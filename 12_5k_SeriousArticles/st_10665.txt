It ' s a lot of pressure on me , and four years is a long time when you ' re 34 . So I ' m going to take each year as it comes really , and make my decision near the time I think , but if you asked me six , seven months ago , I would have said no way London was my last big target . We ' ll see how it goes if I can still win races and perform at a high level , I can ' t see why not . We ' ll see . Come and ask me in six months ' time I ' ll probably give you a totally different answer then .
