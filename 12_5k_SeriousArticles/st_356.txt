In 2007 , Aden Hashi Ayrow , a Al Shabaab leader , contacted Basaaly Saeed Moalin , a cabdriver in San Diego , asking him to fund his group . In January 2008 , Ayrow told Moalin that he needed to know how much money was being sent monthly to his group , even if it was only 100 , because even relatively small amounts of money could make a big difference in Somalia , which is one of the poorest countries in the world . To keep an Al Shabaab foot soldier in the field only cost a dollar a day .
