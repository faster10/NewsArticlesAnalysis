The two prizewinners represent a different approach in an interesting way and show how journalism generally evolves with multimedia possibilities , " explains the jury . In the first contribution , Christian Salewski und Felix Rohrbeck track the disposal of electronic scrap in Germany and find out that it isn ' t always legal and fair .
