The current kefuffle began when Trump made one of his signature sexist gestures by claiming Hillary Clinton got " schlonged " by Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries . When Clinton noted to the Des Moines Register , " It ' s not the first time he ' s demonstrated a penchant for sexism , " Trump responded by claiming she was a hypocrite for charging sexism because her husband was guilty of " abuse of women , " and because Hillary herself also " abused " women involved with her husband . ( There ' s certainly no evidence of that . )
