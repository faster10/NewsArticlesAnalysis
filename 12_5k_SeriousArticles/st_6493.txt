England striker Keegan blamed Bremner for " taking him out " in an off the ball . Bremner was not one for holding back and Wembley stadium , home of some famous boxing matches over the years , played host to another as these two diminutive players slugged it out like two featherweights challenging for the WBC world title . Unsurprisingly both were sent off and added to their charge list by hurling their tops to the ground and walking off the pitch bare chested . Each player was fined 500 ( 810 ) and banned for 11 games , although shirt throwing accounted for eight of the matches !
