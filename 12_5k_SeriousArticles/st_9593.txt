President Erdogan had put much hope on the June election , anticipating a comfortable parliamentary majority for the ruling AKP to change the Constitution to become the country s executive president . With new elections , held under his party s interim prime minister , Ahmet Davutoglu , that might still not happen . Therefore , to ensure desired parliamentary victory , the moderate and predominantly Kurdish party , HDP , would need to be tarred with the same brush as the PKK is painted with as militant . To this end , the government has repeatedly accused the HDP of links to the PKK . In other words , the entire Kurdish community is under suspicion of actual or potential subversion of the Turkish state and society , making the Erdogan government the country s ultimate saviour . It is hoped that this will rally much of the country behind them .
