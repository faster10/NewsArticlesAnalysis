As Jan Langbein , who runs the Genesis Women ' s Center , told me , the whole episode is a form of victim blaming . " I ' m horrified , " Langbein said . " I mean ' take the stairs , ' please ! I am constantly surrounded by messages that it ' s somehow her fault of or that if she had taken the stairs or done something else or not worn that outfit the abuse wouldn ' t have happened . It ' s not about her actions at all . "
