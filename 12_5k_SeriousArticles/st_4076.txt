APPARATUS APPRAISAL : The New York Times : Trying to build up her arsenal for a general election , Hillary Clinton s campaign is asking donors to write big money checks to the Democratic National Committee while taking a greater interest in how it is performing its duties . In recent weeks , Mrs Clinton s campaign aides have started to scrutinize what have historically been core functions of the party committee , some of which atrophied under President Obama . The reviews have been undertaken at the request of Mrs Clinton s campaign manager , Robby Mook , who has taken a particular interest in how the research and communications operations are functioning , according to the people briefed , who asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations . Among the questions her team is looking at , gingerly , are staffing and dexterity in combating an increasingly unpredictable Republican field . http : nyti . ms 1IGNb1R
