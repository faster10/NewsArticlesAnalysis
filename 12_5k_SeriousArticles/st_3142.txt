Patterson : Books are on the way overseas this week , which is the big subject for me . It started in part because a friend of mine , a partner in my entertainment company , was a captain in Vietnam , and his son did a couple of tours in Iraq . He ' s a bright guy he used to send letters home every week and also letters from his friends . I read a lot of them , and they were really kind of mind blowing in terms of just putting you in touch with what it ' s like to be a soldier overseas right now .
