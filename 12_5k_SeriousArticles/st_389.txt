Ukraine is and will remain too weak to be a threat . And on its own , no country in Russia ' s " near abroad " can pose a threat . Even taken together , the non Russians will be weaker than Russia . But Putin ' s land grab will make all of them inclined to regard Russia as a potentially land grabbing foe and to promote their own security independently of Russia and outside of any Russian led blocs or unions . Expect the Central Asians and Azerbaijanis to turn increasingly to China and Turkey , and the Georgians , Moldovans , Ukrainians , and even the Belarusians to head for the West . Also expect the Russian Federation ' s non Russian autonomous republics and regions to press for greater autonomy from Moscow .
