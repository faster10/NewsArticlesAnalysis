Mr Jack Wang , a partner at Raffles Investment , noted : " For Singapore , we are already one of the largest yuan hubs in Asia , outside China . So I guess the momentum of the growth will continue . And we have ( seen ) a 29 per cent increase in yuan deposits for the last one year and the trading volume in terms of clearing has doubled for the last one year , so I think the growth will continue to be strong and we expect more offshore yuan denominated products to be coming up " .
