What happened in Pathankot was an act of war against India , but almost nobody has said this so far . I listened carefully to prime time debates in which security experts held forth in ponderous sentences , and I read all the editorials on the attack in search of someone who would say clearly that Pakistan was at war with India . But nobody did . We defile the memory of the men who died defending the Air Force base when we continue to use the word terrorism to describe the attack . And India will continue to be attacked in this way if all that our experts can do is talk about strengthening counter terrorism . Jihadi terrorism is the biggest threat to civilization as we know it , but what we saw in Pathankot last week cannot be dismissed as just another act of jihadi terrorism .
