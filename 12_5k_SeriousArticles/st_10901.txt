' It is for the Court to decide whether Versace has copied Kesh ' s design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the Court may readily infer that copying has taken place . If so , Versace would infringe Kesh ' s copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to Kesh ' s . If they are found to infringe then they may be liable for damages to Kesh or have to hand over their profits from sales of the offending t shirts . '
