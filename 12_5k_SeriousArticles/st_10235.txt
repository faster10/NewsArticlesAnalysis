ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : Jeb Bush ' s campaign theme is and has always been about that " it , " that it takes a Bush more specifically , Jeb ! to fix the mess voters believe the country has found itself in . But the fix it list has grown for Bush since the long ago time of his campaign announcement . He ' ll have to fix his debate performances , his campaign structure , and calculations about his path to the nomination before he can hope to recapture enthusiasm about his candidacy . There ' s something bigger Bush hopes to fix that is inherently problematic for him . He needs to fix what the 2016 campaign has become , and make it into what he has always hoped it would be . " This election is not about a set of personalities , " Bush said , somewhat hopefully . " It ' s about a set of principles . " This campaign has been about Donald Trump and Ben Carson and what the massive television events called the presidential debates should look like . It has also been about , in part , the master apprentice relationship between Bush and Marco Rubio , whom his campaign team sees as his biggest ultimate obstacle to the GOP nomination . When it has been about Bush , it ' s been about his last name far more than his first . The campaign to date has not been about the principles of leadership that Bush wants it to be about , at least not yet . http : abcn . ws 1GIk82v
