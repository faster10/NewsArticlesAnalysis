In a further escalation of a ? very tense week of diplomatic sparring between ? Iran and Saudi Arabia , the Iranian government on Thursday announced that it was banning imports of products from Saudi Arabia . Iran stopped short of a ban on the annual Hajj pilgrimage , which some have speculated may be coming , but reaffirmed an existing ban on the umrah , or lesser pilgrimage , which can be made at any time throughout the year . ( The last time the Iranian government suspended its citizens from making the Hajj was in 1987 after 400 pilgrims , mostly Iranians , were killed by Saudi security forces during a demonstration against the United States . )
