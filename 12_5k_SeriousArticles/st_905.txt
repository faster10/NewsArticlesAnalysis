In 2010 , the U . S . Supreme Court ruled that life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than homicide violated the Constitution ' s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment , a ruling that extended the court ' s logic in its 2005 decision to abolish the juvenile death penalty . In both of these cases , the court held that because adolescents are not as responsible for their actions as adults , they should not be punished as harshly , even for the same crimes .
