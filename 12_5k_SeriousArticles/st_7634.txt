The " anything goes " album he ended up with is full of big stories , big endings and transfixing effect . The disc was recorded in Jackson Browne ' s studio in L . A . with Dylan ' s touring band bassist Tony Garnier , drummer George G . Receli , steel guitarist Donnie Herron , and guitarists Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball as well as David Hidalgo on guitar , violin and accordion . " Tin Angel " is a devastating tale of a man in search of his lost love the doleful " Soon After Midnight " seems to be about love ( but maybe it ' s revenge ) the vengeful " Pay in Blood " has Dylan darkly repeating , " I pay in blood , but not my own . " Tenderness finally seals Tempest , in " Roll On , John , " Dylan ' s heartfelt tribute to his friend John Lennon .
