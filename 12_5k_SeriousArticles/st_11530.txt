It ' s a black eye of a pop song . The verbal pugilism on display here cracks open songwriting for a generation and leaves the listener on the canvas . " Like a Rolling Stone " is the birth of an iconoclast that will give the rock era its greatest voice and vandal . This is Bob Dylan as the Jeremiah of the heart , torching romantic verse and " the girl " with a firestorm of unforgiving words . Having railed against the hypocrisies of the body politic , he now starts to pick on enemies that are a little more familiar : the scene , high society , the " pretty people " who think they ' ve " got it made . " He hasn ' t made it to his own hypocrisies that would come later . But the " us " and " them " are not so clearly defined as earlier albums . Here he bares his teeth at the hipsters , the vanity of that time , the idea that you had a better value system if you were wearing the right pair of boots .
