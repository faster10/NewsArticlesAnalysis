I ' m not anxious to find direct psychological connections between fandom run amok and cold blooded murder . Nor do I feel an urgent need to prosecute popular culture for capital crimes , though I ' m also not na ve enough to believe that people ' s feelings can ' t be adversely affected by what they see and hear . There ' s a lot I simply don ' t know for sure , about the shootings , about the suspect , about the victims for that matter .
