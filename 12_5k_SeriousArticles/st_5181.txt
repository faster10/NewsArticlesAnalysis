? Stop us if you ve heard this one before : The Giants have no idea how to spark their running game . Once again , they split the workload among four running backs : Shane Vereen ( 20 snaps ) , Rashad Jennings ( 17 ) , Orleans Darkwa ( 15 ) and Andre Williams ( 13 ) . Once again , none of them was allowed to get into a rhythm and none of them averaged more than 3 . 7 yards a carry as the ground game produced 74 yards . None of this really makes any sense , but offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo continues to force feed all four of his backs into the game . Hey , at least they re all fresh for the stretch run and will no doubt feel great heading into a playoff less offseason .
