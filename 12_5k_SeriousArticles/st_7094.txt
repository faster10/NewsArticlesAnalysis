Hield scored a career high 46 points ( 13 field goals on just 23 shots ) , and added eight rebounds and seven assists for good measure . He played 54 out of 55 minutes . Hield has scored at least 22 points in each of his last seven games , and he s already scored 30 or more in five games on the season . You have to go back to Feb . 21 at Texas Tech to find the last game in which Hield didn t score in double figures . He s hitting 49 . 5 of his field goals , 49 . 4 of his threes and 90 . 5 of his free throws . He s never been a 40 three point shooter in his career , so it s possible that he will regress back to his average , but it s also possible that with Oklahoma boasting more offensive threats this season , he is simply benefiting from better looks and will continue to shoot opponents out of the gym .
