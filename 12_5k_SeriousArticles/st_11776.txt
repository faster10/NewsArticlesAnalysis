Fenene posted an Instagram message about the collision : " ' Everything happens for a reason ' Not sure why the very intoxicated woman decided to drive her car , head first , into our car . . . but I do know that we are extremely lucky to be alive and that everything we have is fixable . It ' s a bump in the road , but we will get past it and be stronger than before ! I ' m grateful for all the wonderful LOVE I have received from everyone . My family friends are AMAZING ! Life is wonderful ! "
