The question is whether there will be enough progress before hackers get better at using what they steal . Right now , cybercriminals can steal millions of records but only be able to " monetize " a few thousand of them . If cybercriminals get better at monetizing the personal data they steal , there will be a spike in losses . And if countries like China continues to hack U . S . businesses to steal trade secrets and make competing products , American companies will lose sales and jobs .
