I ' ve been teaching English in college for 40 years , and I ' ve never met a single professor who likes grading . " Hate " is too strong a word for what they feel . But nobody likes it . The fun stuff is talking to students , holding classroom discussions , thinking about your subject in complex ways and trying to convey your enthusiasm for the subject . Education is about leading students in useful directions , helping them to discover their own critical intelligence , their own voices .
