I think that the truth is in 2007 and 2008 , sometimes my supporters and my staff , I think , got too huffy about what were legitimate questions she was raising , Obama said , referring to Hillary Clinton , whom he faced for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination . And , you know , there were times where I think the media probably was a little unfair to her and tilted a little my way in calling her out when she was tough and not calling some of our folks out as much when we were tough in ads .
