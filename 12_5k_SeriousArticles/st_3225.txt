I feel like time will tell if I ' ll ever want to hear Anti again , so I guess it ' s not that masterpiece . But it ' s damn good throughout , with a powerful quartet of ballads closing the album . Remember " Thank You " by the Brit singer Dido , famously sampled all up in Eminem ' s " Stan ? " Rihanna ' s melodious vocals on " Never Ending " will bring that to mind ( Dido gets a writing credit ) , crooning " it doesn ' t have to feel so strange to be in love again " over plaintive guitar .
