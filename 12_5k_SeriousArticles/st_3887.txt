No matter what happens after the physical remains of the liner are gone , the islanders will never forget how their lives changed the night of Friday , the 13th of January , 2012 , when 4 , 200 people spilled into their quiet port . Father Pasquotti estimates that more than a thousand of the Concordia ' s passengers have come back to Giglio since the accident . Many came to bring back the blankets and dry clothing that the islanders gave them the night of the disaster . Merchants along the port ' s main street usually know what belongs to whom by asking around . Giglio still has the feel of a small town .
