I think Coach McAdoo is a great coach , a great teacher , and will be a great leader of this team , said quarterback Eli Manning . I m excited to continue to work with him and grow within this offense , and get this organization back where it needs to be . I think the Giants ownership made this decision on what s best for the organization and best for the team . I think Coach McAdoo has great leadership skills , and will do a great job being a head coach and leading us in the right direction .
