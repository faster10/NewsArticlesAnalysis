She really only knew the Bronx and Puerto Rico , while her classmates spoke of European vacations and skiing . She said in 1990 that she felt she was a " product of affirmative action " and questioned whether she would have been accepted into the Ivy League using " traditional numbers " from test scores alone . See how many of the Supreme Court justices went to Ivy League schools
