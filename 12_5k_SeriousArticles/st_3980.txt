Still , Coughlin s imprints are there and that s a blessing and a curse . It s good that McAdoo learned from a future Hall of Famer , but his reign can t be a continuation of Coughlin s tenure . That has nothing to do with the record ? either the two Super Bowls or the two 6 10 seasons at the end of Coughlin s tenure . It s about McAdoo s vision and approach . It s about making it clear the Coughlin Era is over .
