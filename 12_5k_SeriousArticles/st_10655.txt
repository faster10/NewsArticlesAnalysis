The Celtics are looking to halt the Warriors 27 game winning streak and they have what it takes to do it even though they have no clear superstar in their roster . The Warriors are seventh worst in the league in turnovers committed ( 15 . 9 ) . " But the truth be told , I thought Toronto would get them as well " . Though their point differential pales in comparison to Golden State ' s , they rank fourth in that category as well at a respectable plus 5 . 4 . Who ' s first , you might ask ?
