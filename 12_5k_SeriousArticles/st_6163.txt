I would never tell a woman who has been raped she s got to carry the child of the rapist , Graham said on MSNBC s Morning Joe on Monday . Eighty three percent of the American people feel like that goes too far , so if you would veto a bill that had an exception for rape or incest ? you know , I appreciate your passion for the pro life issue , but you re outside of the mainstream and you cannot get elected . Anybody with that position will get creamed .
