Moore : There is a lot of music in the house , whether someone is playing it , or there ' s a record on or something . I ' ve been introduced to a lot of metal in my relationship , which is pretty cool , because my guy is a big metal fan , and it isn ' t something I would necessarily investigate on my own but I do like it . It ' s just nice to have that truly built in support system that someone is unbelievably understanding of what you do .
