City on Fire is perhaps the best example of the allure of the grimy , recessionary ' 70s , a period that isn ' t studied and romanticized as much as the tumultuous decade before it , but that produced a bountiful amount of great popular art , in both music and movies . ( Current multiplex hits Star Wars and Creed , remember , are reboots of ' 70s classics , and I ' d like to make you an offer you can ' t refuse : Francis Ford Coppola ' s seven hour The Godfather Epic , which puts the pieces of his two ' 70s mob movies The Godfather and The Godfather : Part II in chronological order , runs at 5 p . m . today on HBO . )
