Bisaccia stayed in line with the Cowboys awkward excusing away of Hardy s actions , saying Hardy wanted to get in there and kind of get after some of the guys a little bit , maybe get them fired up , Bisaccia said , via the Dallas Morning News . It was just not the right time . It s really not an issue . I just had to communicate what we were going to do next on the return , so I just really wanted him to move on so we could get going .
