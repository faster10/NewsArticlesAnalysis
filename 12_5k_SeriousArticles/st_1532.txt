Trump is a big , orangey object that s fun to look at , but the real story is why there is an actual proto fascist movement ? forming in this country . ? Trump isn t the beginning of anything . He s the end result of years of conservatives growing angrier and angrier ? and taking pre Trump steps like forming the Tea Party and pushing ever more radical Republicans into Congress ? about the diversification of America . And if he went away tomorrow , that anger would still be there and someone , likely Cruz , would be the next guy in line to start trying to channel it into political victory .
