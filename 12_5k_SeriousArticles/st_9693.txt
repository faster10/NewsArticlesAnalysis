Jonathan Greenblatt , the ADL s chief executive , said : Mr Trump s plan to bar people from entry to the United States based on their religion is unacceptable and antithetical to American values . The US was founded as a place of refuge for those fleeing religious persecution , and religious pluralism is core to our national identity . A plan that singles out Muslims and denies them entry to the US based on their religion is deeply offensive and runs contrary to our nation s deepest values .
