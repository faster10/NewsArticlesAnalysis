Ultimately , the reason New England fans may still get queasy about this game ? especially if it s close late in the fourth quarter ? is the coach and quarterback on the other side of the field . The Giants have some great skill players and could put some points on the board , but their defense is not up to the task this time to stop Brady . If and when Brady plays as well as he has all season in New York , and the Giants still can t get consistent pressure , they are in for a long day .
