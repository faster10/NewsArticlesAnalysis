USB ports are all located on the left hand side of the deck so if you want to add a mouse for serious gaming , you ' ll need a long cord or a wireless one mouse . There is also an HDMI output and a headset jack along the left side . A 500 GB hard drive is smaller than some other gaming laptops , but shouldn ' t be a significant loss . The battery life isn ' t as long as I ' d like , but the battery pack is slim and sleek , which is good for mobile gaming and finding those outlets on the road .
