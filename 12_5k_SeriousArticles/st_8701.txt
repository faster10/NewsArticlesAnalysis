" There are no words that can possibly express how we feel . We wish that there were , so we could make you feel better . We don ' t understand why this happened , " the family said in its statement . " It may not make any difference , but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday . We care very deeply about the victims and their families . We are so very sorry for their loss . Thank you . The Loughner Family "
