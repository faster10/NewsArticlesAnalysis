Like any good twenty something , I love the movie , but the " no sequel " news is totally for the best . There ' s no way people wouldn ' t be disappointed by whatever they came up with , and now , fans can just continue to watch and love the original as the perfect high school satire that it is . For those that would like a little more , all hope isn ' t lost : Fey is directing her energy towards a possible Mean Girls musical ( which she told EW about last year in her EW Interview ) .
