" We must see that the struggle today is much more difficult , " King said . " It ' s more difficult today because we are struggling now for genuine equality . It ' s much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee a livable income and a good , solid job . It ' s much easier to guarantee the right to vote than it is to guarantee the right to live in sanitary , decent housing conditions . It is much easier to integrate a public park than it is to make genuine quality integrated education a reality . "
