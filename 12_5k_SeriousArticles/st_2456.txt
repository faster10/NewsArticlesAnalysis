Five days after being hospitalized , my father passed away . After his death the medical staff realized he had presented Ebola symptoms and as I had close contact with him , it meant that I was at risk . So they told me that I needed to be followed up for 21 days and if ever I felt a small fever I had to come to the health center . The countdown then started for me : after nine days I got fever and this persisted until the 11th day . Finally I went to the treatment center where I did an Ebola test which was positive .
