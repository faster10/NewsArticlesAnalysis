" My father walked in the room and God knows I am telling the truth I have fainted in his presence many times . I have fainted once to be honest . I have thrown up in his presence because when he comes in the room and this aura comes and my stomach starts hurting and I know I am in trouble . He is so different now . Time and age has changed him and he sees his grandchildren and he wants to be a better father . It is almost like the ship has sailed its course , and it is so hard for me to accept this other guy that is not the guy I was raised with . I just wished he had learned that earlier . "
