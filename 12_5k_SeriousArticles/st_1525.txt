This development shows several positive things about the criminal justice system . First , it makes clear that even under Florida ' s liberal self defense laws , an implausible or unsubstantiated claim of self defense does not constitute a " get out of jail free " card . Florida ' s " stand your ground " law protects , some say over protects , the right of self defense . But judges and juries still have the power to evaluate the truth of self defense claims , and defendants will be convicted of homicide if the prosecution can prove that killings were outside the law .
