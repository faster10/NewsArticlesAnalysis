The reaction after week 1 labeling him a bust was ridiculous . Just as some of the hype that will follow this performance will be over the top . The fact is we don t know for sure how Winston or Mariota will turn out . All we can say for sure right now is that both teams look to have their long term solutions on the roster . Both of these guys are playing like studs on teams lacking talent . That s all you can ask for at this stage .
