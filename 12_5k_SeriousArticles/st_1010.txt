Trammell in his 15th and final year on the ballot ( he was grandfathered in when the ballot time limit was reduced to 10 years ) mustered 40 . 9 percent support and thus dropped off the ballot . Meantime , McGwire and his 583 home runs earned just 12 . 3 percent support in his 10th year on the ballot . So away he goes . Also leaving the ballot are those who failed to earn the minimum five percent : Jim Edmonds ( 2 . 5 percent ) , Nomar Garciaparra ( 1 . 8 percent ) , Mike Sweeney ( 0 . 7 percent ) , David Eckstein ( 0 . 5 percent ) , Jason Kendall ( 0 . 5 percent ) , Garret Anderson ( 0 . 1 percent ) , Brad Ausmus ( 0 votes ) , Luis Castillo ( 0 votes ) , Troy Glaus ( 0 votes ) , Mark Grudzielanek ( 0 votes ) , Mike Hampton ( 0 votes ) , Mike Lowell ( 0 votes ) , and Randy Winn ( 0 votes ) .
