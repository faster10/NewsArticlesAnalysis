Enya : Well , with the anniversary , yes , I ' ve been listening to " Watermark . " It ' s kind of like a journal for me . It takes you back to that time in your life . Each song has its own little story and I can hear the life of that song . You know how it was written , what inspired me , what worked , what didn ' t work . But the nice thing about spending two to three years on an album is I can say there ' s nothing I would change on any of the albums .
