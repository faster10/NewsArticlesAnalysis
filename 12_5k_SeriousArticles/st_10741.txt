The Biden Knope summit , a surprise " engagement present " from Ben , lasts less than a minute and was written in a manner that would work regardless of the election ' s outcome . " We did not in any way want the moment to be a political issue we treated it in the writing and the execution like our main character was meeting her hero , " says Schur . ( He notes that the writers did pen an addendum to the scene in the event of an Obama Biden loss or a " weird Florida disaster tie . " ) The meeting takes place in the Vice President ' s Ceremonial Office in the White House adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building , with Biden flanked by his real life staff . " They have a conversation where she does what you would imagine Leslie Knope would do when meeting Joe Biden , which is she loses control of herself a little bit , " hints Schur . " She gets really giggly and goofy around him . "
