Amanda Taub has argued that Syria is the sum of many of Putin ' s fears ( anarchy , uprisings , Western meddling ) . Charles Lister tweeted he couldn ' t comprehend why Russia has to play a part in the opposition talks . Other analysts argue that Putin claims to target ISIS but that is not who he ' s really after . Michael Horowitz from the Levantine Group for example illogically stated that Russia bombed rebel groups ( I would call them terrorist ) in Ltamenah who were not ISIS , thereby implying that the Russians had committed some kind of sin or mistake . Yet I ask : is it a sin or a mistake to bomb the Army of Conquest in Ltamenah ? Did Jabhat al Nusra , al Qaeda ' s affiliate in Syria not form part of that coalition ? And did al Qaeda not perform the 9 11 attacks ?
