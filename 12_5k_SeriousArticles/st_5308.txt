MAYER : I WOULD SAY I THINK OUR STRATEGY OF FOCUSING ON SEARCH COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITAL CONTENT IS THE RIGHT ONE FOR YAHOO ! GIVEN OUR CORE COMPETENCIES AND STRENGTHS . WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR MAVENS MOBILE , VIDEO , NATIVE AND SOCIAL , THOSE ARE THE GROWING AREAS OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING . SO WE ARE PROUD OF OUR DECISION TO FOCUS ON THAT WE ' RE PROUD OF WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED THERE , TOO . TODAY I LEAD A VERY DIFFERENT COMPANY THAN THE COMPANY I JOINED IN JULY OF 2012 . AT THAT TIME OUR MAVENS BUSINESSES WERE NOT A MEANINGFUL PART OF THE STRATEGY . THEY WERE NOT A MEANINGFUL PART OF REVENUE . TODAY THEY GENERATE 1 . 5 BILLION OF G . A . P . REVENUE IN 2015 . MOBILE VOLUMES HAVE TRIPLED WE ARE NOW PROBABLY THE THIRD LARGEST PLAYER IN MOBILE ADVERTISING GLOBALLY . WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN DEFINING THE SPACE OF NATIVE ADVERTISING WITH OUR YAHOO ! GEMINI PLATFORM , WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF BRIGHTROLL IN VIDEO , AND THE ENGAGEMENT ON OUR SOCIAL PLATFORM TUMBLR IS SOMETHING WE ' RE VERY VERY PROUD OF . SO WE ' RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRESS WE ' VE MADE IN THOSE AREAS . WE INTEND TO KEEP FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS . AND WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT I MENTIONED THIS IN THE OCTOBER CALL WE ' LL BE BACK WITH SHAREHOLDERS AROUND A NEW AND IMPROVED TIGHTENED PLAN ON THAT FOCUS AND OUR NEXT EARNINGS CALL IN JANUARY .
