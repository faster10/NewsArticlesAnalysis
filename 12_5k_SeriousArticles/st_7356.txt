San Francisco is 0 5 on the road this year , having played only one close game this season away from Levi s Stadium ( Week 5 against the New York Giants ) . The other four road losses have come by an average of 25 points , against Pittsburgh , Arizona , St . Louis and Seattle . The Bears aren t similar to any of those teams , and they share more in common with the Giants in terms of a comparable opponent . The 49ers might have a chance to score some points against Chicago s defense , but the Bears offense should be able to score on the S . F . defense , readily .
