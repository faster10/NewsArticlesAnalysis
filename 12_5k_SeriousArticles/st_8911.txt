What ' s an atheist scientist like me doing writing good things about religion ? I didn ' t start out this way . As a teenager , I had contempt for religion . I was raised Jewish , but when I read the Bible , I was shocked . It hardly seemed to me like a good guide for ethical behavior in modern times , what with all the smiting and stoning and genocide , some of it ordered by God . In college , I read other holy books , and they didn ' t make me any more positive toward religion .
