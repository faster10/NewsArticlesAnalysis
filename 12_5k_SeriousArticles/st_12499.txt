Rogers adds , " The American stock market has been worse than the Chinese stock market up until the last day or say . The Chinese stock market in 2015 was one of the best in the world . The American stock market was down last year . All this started in America and Europe . China is catching up in a big big way . We had a lot of excesses for the last seven years . We have not had a major decline in stock market in America . We have had staggering amount of money put in , staggering amounts of debt build up . We are going to pay the price . Do not blame it on China . If you are going to blame it on somebody , blame it on the American Federal Reserve . But , it does not matter who you blame it on . The problems are now hitting us and it is going to get worse . "
