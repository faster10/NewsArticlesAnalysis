I think it sort of tells you that he s getting closer and closer . He recognizes that his time is coming , Blatt said . . . . He feels more a part of it . When you re sitting on the side and you re not able to participate in drills or even part of a shootaround , you get a little bit removed from it . Ky is becoming immersed again in the team and you see that in his activity level during the games . It bodes well for us and him . We miss him .
