Anyway to return to my list . France does not have a good record in the treatment of Muslims from its former colonies . As just one example , more than half of the French liberation army of 1943 44 , which fought in Italy and France comprised soldiers from North and sub Saharan Africa , with 134 , 000 Algerians , 73 , 000 Moroccans , 26 , 000 Tunisians ? and 92 , 000 men from other colonies . When their countries achieved independence from France , their French pensions were frozen . It was not until 2011 , some 50 years later , that France agreed to pay those still living at the same rate as French veterans .
