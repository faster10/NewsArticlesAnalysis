Russia , the US , the UK and France are four of the Permanent Five ( P5 ) member of the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) , which ordinarily has responsibility for dealing with issues such as Syria and Iraq . The other P5 member is China . The UNSC has often failed to find resolutions in the past because of veto provision by any of the five . However , there is now scope for agreement among the four , with China unlikely to veto such an agreement .
