Early on Tuesday morning , two Palestinian men from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber entered a synagogue in the sleepy West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof and went on a killing spree . Armed with guns and knives , the two men killed four rabbis three Israeli American and one Israeli British before they were struck down by Israeli police . The attack , which also claimed the life of a police officer , was the deadliest in a series of recent " lone wolf " attacks against Israelis across Jerusalem .
