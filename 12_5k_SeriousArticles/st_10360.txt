All this fear mongering probably won t help Christie s poll numbers ? really , coming out for Social Security reform will never ingratiate you with the elderly white people that make up the backbone of the Republican Party , making his a lost cause ? but that doesn t mean that his behavior isn t a big deal . Stoking baseless , racially loaded fear of crime will likely have ramifications that extend past this election cycle . Putting the face of a ostensibly mainstream figure like Christie on the racist fears that Black Lives Matter activists are out to get you will help justify those fears . It s beyond irresponsible of him to pander like this to gain some points in a race he s never going to win . For shame , Christie .
