I am delighted for Derry Mathews to be getting a shot in Ant ' s place against Richar Abril for the WBA world lightweight title . Derry is a good guy . Our options thereafter might be a shot at Derry , if he wins , but we are also keeping an eye on the WBO belt . Terence Crawford , the WBO champion , is likely to move up a weight , and we ' d be tempted by a fight against Juan Diaz for the title in the summer . I think that can be made .
