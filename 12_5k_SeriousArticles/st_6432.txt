I have traveled twice to Omaha Beach with a veteran of that assault . Most of you who read this have seen the movie " Saving Private Ryan , " the opening scene when Ryan , now an old man , walks into the cemetery and stops at the grave of his comrade and all but collapses . I have been there , I have seen that for real . I personally call the pathway from the parking lot , to where the walkway turns and suddenly you behold the thousands upon thousands of graves , the " place of tears . "
