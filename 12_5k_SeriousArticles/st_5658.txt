I ve yet to hear any conservative give a substantive reason why it would be preferable to have the president say We re at war with radical Islam , other than that doing so would prove that he or she is tough and strong . And as Clinton pointed out , George W . Bush was careful to emphasize that we re not at war with Islam I don t think there are many conservatives who think Bush s problem when it came to terrorism was that he was weak .
