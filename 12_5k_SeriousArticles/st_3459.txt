It s so extraordinary for the organization that they were able to extricate themselves from St . Louis to the NFL s shangra la . The shift in their chi is going to be powerful . No longer stuck in mud market dullsville , they ll for the first time in their history be a big time free agent destination . For all us real Rams fans who remember the glory and glamour of the Rams in the coliseum ( Anaheim was just St . Louis west ) we remember the roar of 95000 Angelenos responding to one of the NFL s more storied franchises . Happy days are here again . Fisher now has his dream job , and he s on the hot seat . The Rams head coaching position now becomes the most coveted in sports . Gruden ? Cowher ? McDaniels ? Patricia ? Everybody wants to live in the Golden Canyons , or by the gorgeous pacific here in LA .
