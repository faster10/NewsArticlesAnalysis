Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a fast racetrack that is high banked , and IndyCars reach speeds of 225 mph . Danger is part of our sport . We all know it is ever present , and we face it every time we step in the race car . We push it to the back of our minds because as drivers we have a job to do and you cannot let fear get in the way . One would be crazy to think nothing could ever go wrong , but we must not allow such thoughts to distract us from the job at hand .
