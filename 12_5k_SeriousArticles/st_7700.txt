I ve spent a lot of my life writing about the United States and Iran , and I never imagined ? and never wanted ? to become a part of the story , particularly at such an extraordinary moment , Rezaian said . I want to get back to writing the US ? Iran story at some point in the future . But I won t be saying anything further for awhile . I hope everyone will respect my need for privacy as I take some time for myself and for my family .
