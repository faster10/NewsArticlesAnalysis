It ' s hidden : The outside of this attraction is a hodgepodge of building facades built to scale , including the Wyndham Theater , Leicester Square ' s tube station and Grimmauld Place , which mask the entrance to Diagon Alley . Here , guests will be able to meander along the London waterfront , sit under the shade of trees and gaze at a replica of London ' s Eros fountain . Guests will enter under the arches of the Leicester Square facade . However , Universal has not said how exactly . In the series , Harry enters Diagon through a magical wall of bricks .
