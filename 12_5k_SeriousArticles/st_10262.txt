Biskupic : She early on was quite a figure for young people of color and not to rally around . They were impressed by her story of coming from the Bronx , coming from the projects , from being someone who really set her mind on achievement after having not much as a kid . So she was always out there with this inspiring story that people were learning from the moment President Obama nominated her in May 2009 . What happened on the bench , I think , is that she did find her voice . Last term was really a breakout term when she dissented in the Michigan affirmative action case and spoke not just of why it was important for minorities to be represented in the political process , but what it ' s like in a day to day way to be slighted just because of the color of your skin . One thing I found through my talking to her and talking to others is that she still really does identify herself as being different and being the other . And she ' s defensive about people who still question her qualifications for being on the bench . She talked about being scrutinized during the confirmation process and people suggesting she wasn ' t up to the task . She said , " Why would that be ? Is there any reason for them to question me , other than the fact that I was Hispanic ? " And she still feels that , even though she ' s now been on the bench five years , that people question how she got there and whether she ' s up to the task , which she ' s certainly proved that she is .
