Producer Wyck Godfrey ( who knows a little something about adapting popular YA novels to the big screen as he worked on all the Twilight movies ) says , " When choosing the writers , director and now our first actor for Fault we ' ve gone with the people that have had the strongest , most emotional and insightful connection to the material . Shailene ' s love of the book and dedication to the character was evident in not only her pursuit of the role but her delivery of the essence of Hazel in her audition . I have no doubt that she will deliver a Hazel that will floor both fans of the book and those who have yet to be introduced to the transcendent story of The Fault in Our Stars . "
