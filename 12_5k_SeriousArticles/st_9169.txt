Attempts to shield students from words , ideas , and people that might cause them emotional discomfort are bad for the students . They are bad for the workplace , which will be mired in unending litigation if student expectations of safety are carried forward . And they are bad for American democracy , which is already paralyzed by worsening partisanship . When the ideas , values , and speech of the other side are seen not just as wrong but as willfully aggressive toward innocent victims , it is hard to imagine the kind of mutual respect , negotiation , and compromise that are needed to make politics a positive sum game .
