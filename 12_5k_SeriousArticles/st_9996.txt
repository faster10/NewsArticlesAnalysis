" I think we have an easier time looking at these girls when they are in India or Thailand and being thoughtful or supportive of those girls , " Sadaa Saar said . " But when those girls come from Southeast D . C . , or Toledo , Ohio , or Atlanta , Georgia , we are challenged at being able to see them as victims . It ' s much easier to call them bad girls or girls acting out , as opposed to recognizing these are girls who are vulnerable , who are being raped and exploited . "
