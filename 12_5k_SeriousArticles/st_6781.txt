But this isn ' t only a problem in countries half a world away it ' s happening in our own backyards . In fact , 83 of the victims in the United States are U . S . citizens . I ' ve introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen . John Cornyn , R Texas , to fight sex trafficking in America by making sure minors sold for sex aren ' t prosecuted as criminals but are instead treated as victims . The bill also allows victims of sex trafficking to participate in the Job Corps program to help them get back on their feet , and would create a National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking to encourage cooperation among all the federal , state , and local agencies that work on this problem .
