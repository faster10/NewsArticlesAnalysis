On our return trip to " The Force Awakens , " we chose 3D IMAX for an altogether different viewing experience , which was enough to entice Sporto to tag along and see the film for a second time . There we were , my two sons watching a " Star Wars " movie with their dad just as I ' d done with my dad when I was 5 , an experience I still remember as the first movie I ' d seen in a theater . Or at least the first one I can remember .
