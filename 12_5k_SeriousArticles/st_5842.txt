North Korea is unambiguously a totalitarian state . An estimated 200 , 000 North Koreans are held under brutal conditions in remote forced labor camps called kwan li so . Citizens are deprived of the freedom to speak , to dissent , to assemble , to seek remedies for grievances . Perhaps worst of all , there is no freedom from fear knowing that one can be imprisoned and tortured for minor trifles , sent to a kwan li so for being related to someone who displeased the state , or face a kangaroo court trial and possible public execution for a long list of political or economic " crimes .
