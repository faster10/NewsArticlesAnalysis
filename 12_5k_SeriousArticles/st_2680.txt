The essence of social business is to create a business that is focused on solving human problems rather than making a personal profit . It is a nondividend company designed to address a social objective within the framework of existing marketplace . It is different from a nonprofit because the business should seek to generate a modest profit , which would be used to expand the company ' s reach and improve the product or service . Social business has to be sustainable and is able to return the amount invested . But investors do not receive any further dividend after that point .
