The tricky element here is that much of the reason Carson is soaring , especially in Iowa , is that Republican voters there like much of that kookiness . It s not going to play well in a Republican debate if you go after him for saying that a Muslim shouldn t be president , that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery , that he would never raise the debt ceiling , or that gun control caused the Holocaust . Those are what we call winners to a certain subset of the American population : specifically , the one that decides which of you gets the Republican presidential nomination . It also may not be worth the risk to point out that Carson is a Seventh day Adventist . At the end of the day , aren t we all members of some nutty sect or another ? Leave that for the fingerprint free super PAC ads is what we re getting at .
