We get attacked about five times a day , Sanders said . But it really ? reminds me very much of what happened here in Iowa eight years ago . Remember that ? ? Eight years ago , Obama was attacked for everything . ? He was unrealistic . His ideas were pie in the sky . He did not have the experience that was needed . ? But you know what , people of Iowa saw through those attacks then and they re going to see through those attacks again . "
