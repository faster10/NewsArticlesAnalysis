The good news is , CPR is easy to learn ( local classes can be found here ) and the automated external defibrillator is remarkably simple to use , even without significant training . According to several device manufacturers , you simply place the pads on a victim ' s chest , and turn the unit on . Complex algorithms inside the unit ' s computer determine whether a shock from the machine will help restart a victim ' s heart . Once the machine determines that a shock should in fact be delivered , it tells the user to clear their hands from the patient ' s body , and press the " shock " button .
