Composer Richard Wagner was an anti Semite whose music was used , after his death , as Nazi propaganda . He was also , as some say , " one of the most gifted , historically important composers to ever grace the planet . " So fans of his music , including those in Israel , are willing to overlook his hideous views and embrace his art . This is what is generally considered separating the art from the artist . As writer Jay Parini put it , " Hideous people can make great art . "
