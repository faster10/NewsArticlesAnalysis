When you ' re one of the world ' s most feared forwards and you ' ve just been signed for an eye watering 45m , the expectation is you ' ll score goals . Shevchenko , though , turned 30 shortly after arriving at Chelsea but played as if he ' d just turned 40 . Mourinho never wanted the Ukrainian in the first place ( he ' d been bought by club owner and Shevchenko ' s friend Roman Abramovich ) , but after months of heavy legged displays , the goal shy striker saw fewer and fewer first team minutes . Mourinho lost the power struggle with Abramovich when he was sacked in September 2007 , and Shevchenko didn ' t last much longer at Stamford Bridge .
