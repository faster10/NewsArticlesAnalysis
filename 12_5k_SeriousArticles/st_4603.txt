So the question to me is not if we should do something about outlandish executive pay , but what , exactly . The 1 : 12 ratio would be unlikely to gain any traction in the Untied States , said Mark Borges , principal at Compensia , a company that does consulting on executive pay issues . He called the measure , which , according to Wermuth , includes stock options and other non salary forms of pay , " potentially draconian " and said most ratios between CEO and worker pay he hears discussed deal with three digit numbers . Twelve is a shock , I ' ll agree , and it ' s probably too extreme for the United States .
