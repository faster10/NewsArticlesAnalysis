If you really want to understand traditional Chinese architecture you should really know the craftsman ' s work because in China for a long time we did not have architecture theory or history , we did not have architects we only had craftsmen so the secret was just in the craftsman ' s hands . Throughout the 1990s , I didn ' t have any formal jobs . I just worked with craftsmen together for 10 years . I wanted to forget everything I had learned in the architecture school .
