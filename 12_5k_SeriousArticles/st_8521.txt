There are , of course , Republican presidential hopefuls who have vigorously opposed each of these proposals , arguments and stereotypes . But Donald Trump has , so far , set the terms of the primary debate and dragged other candidates in the direction of ethnic and religious exclusion . One effect has been the legitimization of even more extreme views ? signaling that it is OK to give voice to sentiments and attitudes that , in previous times , people would have been too embarrassed to share in public . So in Tennessee , the chairman of the state Legislature s GOP caucus has called for the mobilization of the National Guard to round up Syrian refugees and put them in camps . Many Republicans are now on record saying that Islam is inherently violent and inconsistent with constitutional values ( while often displaying an ironic and disturbing ignorance of those values ) .
