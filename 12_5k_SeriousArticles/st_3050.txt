" You see it with Rafa . If you don ' t get enough on the ball , then Novak is going to run everything down and eventually he ' s going to make you move and outplay you , " Krajicek said . " If Novak has the feeling that you ' re coming in and if you mix it up with some slice Roger has the nice backhand slice , ( you have more chance of success ) . And you have to serve well . That ' s very important . "
