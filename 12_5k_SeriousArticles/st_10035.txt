Coughlin is by far the oldest head coach prospect making the rounds . The 49ers were thought to be close to hiring Hue Jackson , the Bengals offensive coordinator , but if they are set on Jackson , why have they reached out to Coughlin ? The 49ers have also interviewed Buccaneers offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter , Browns offensive coordinator John DeFilippo and Bills assistant head coach Anthony Lynn . The 49ers were also rumored to have interest in Chip Kelly , who was fired by the Eagles with one game remaining in the regular season .
