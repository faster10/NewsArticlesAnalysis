James Brolin would go home to his wife , Barbra Streisand , at night , and I would say , " James , is she OK with all this ? " Because he has one of the most twisted roles you ' ve ever seen , as you know and I don ' t want to give it away . He was like , " Well , the wife is on the fence about this whole thing , " and she came to a screening and I swear to God , Babs laughed the loudest .
