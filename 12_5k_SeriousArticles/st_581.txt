If the mother doesn ' t actually abandon the child , the child is kept in a backroom in a shack and literally does not see the light of day . And the child is not even counted . When I asked a mother how many children she had , she told me she had three , but there were four . I was sitting in their living room and her three year old had been born with his head enlarged and the rest of his body wasn ' t developing at the same rate .
