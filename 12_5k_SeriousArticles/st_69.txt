Those who come to the U . S . on a fiance visa must marry a U . S . citizen within 90 days or leave the country . Following the marriage , the immigrant becomes a conditional resident for two years and must ask the U . S . government to remove those conditions at the end of that waiting period and undergo another background check . If the request is approved , the immigrant receives a green card . Immigrants can apply to become U . S . citizens five years after winning a green card .
