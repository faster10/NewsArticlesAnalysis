Roller coaster , man , Jackson said , taking a deep breath as he tried to describe his emotions . It s a rivalry game . You do any and everything to pull out a victory and we fell on the short end of the stick this time . It s very frustrating . A lot rode on this game and we had mistakes , so personally , I m very frustrated . I take that one to my chin . I m a veteran in this league and I need to protect the ball and it just got away from me .
