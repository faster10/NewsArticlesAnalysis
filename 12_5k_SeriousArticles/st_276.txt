See what he did ? He took a line of attack against him ? that he s a hypocrite for railing against Chinese companies stealing American jobs ? and twisted it to make himself seem smart , cunning and responsible . You can scoff at the warped logic and internal inconsistencies ( he says he s outsmarting the competition by working with China but also says he doesn t have a choice ) , but Trump has a knack for selling this stuff . Just a couple of weeks ago , South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley made headlines by unsubtly suggesting that Trump was one of the angriest voices in her party . What did Trump do when attacked like this ? He accepted the designation with pride and used it to reinforce his own message .
