GHC has a partnership model where one fellow is always paired with an international fellow . We see our 90 current fellows , who come from 12 countries , sharing challenges and ideas daily , via social media , impromptu gatherings and in person retreats . The exchange of best practices in this globally connected social movement is not just from the U . S . outward . It is a collaboration that has no boundaries . For example , our fellows at Partners In Health ' s PACT program in Boston improved care for low income HIV patients by adopting best practices from community health worker programs implemented in rural Haiti and Rwanda .
