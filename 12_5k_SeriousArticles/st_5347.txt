Brock and Jesse : After Jesse escaped the Nazis , he drove straight to the police station . He reported everything , gave the DEA his full cooperation and walked away without ever seeing the inside of a prison cell ( blame his puppy eyes ) . And while he was at the police station , he got Badger and Skinny Pete to move his money to a safe location . After that was all tied up , he went to see Brock . Turns out , Andrea ' s mom had recently died of a heart attack , so Jesse formally adopted Brock . The duo now lives in Phoenix , where Jesse has his own carpentry business . He spends his days making perfect boxes and so much more . He also sells his drawings on the side . Brock , meanwhile , is big into soccer and a straight A student who only ever gets in trouble at school for his over use of the word " bitch . " His favorite breakfast meal is a Grand Slam .
