The 2012 and 2013 Australian Open champion , Azarenka was the last woman to hold the No . 1 ranking before Serena took full possession of it three years ago . Then physical injuries piled up , along with some mental depression , and that took a toll on the 26 year old Belarusian . She dropped from No . 1 at the start of 2013 to No . 32 by the end of 2014 . She improved last year , moving up to No . 22 , but was unable to win a tournament .
