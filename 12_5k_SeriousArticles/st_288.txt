It ' s not true , but the error here is that climate change is a national security emergency for China ( and India , Bangladesh , etc ) . They have a huge interest in averting large scale warming ? not just in avoiding damage to the country , but also in tackling their unimaginable pollution problem , and keeping a hand in the growth industries of the future . Hence , the climate talks are a lot more like coordinating a response to a military threat than they are about agreeing to protect coral reefs or endangered species . The environment is in danger , of course , and protecting it must involve climate policy , but the point is that if we cannot even avoid impaling ourselves , then there is little chance for anything else .
