Consider this : A vacation is different from traveling . On average , a vacation that includes a flight , hotel stays , and eating out for every meal can cost anywhere from 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 per person per week . Plus when you go on vacation , all of your other monthly expenses don ' t go away . You still have to pay for your mortgage or rent , car , electricity , water , magazine subscriptions this all continues while you are on vacation .
