And so it is with " Avengers : Age of Ultron , " which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different . Picking up where last year ' s " Captain America : Winter Soldier " left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the Avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty HYDRA organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves Clint Barton Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins Pietro and Wanda ( Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen ) .
