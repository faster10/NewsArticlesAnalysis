Chicago Bears : Both teams are coming off heartbreaking losses , but Chicago had the extra day to prepare . The Bears were humbled by the 49ers last weekend . They will not be overconfident .

Head coach John Fox has been harping all week on the importance of Chicago winning out . I think the players will get the message . Bears 20 , Redskins 18 . Jeff Dickerson
