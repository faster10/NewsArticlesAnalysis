Last month , the Hawaii Tourism Authority voted to allow the NFL ' s Pro Bowl game to return to Hawaii in 2011 and 2012 . The game has been held the week after the Super Bowl at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu since 1980 , and has sold out every time . Next year , it will take place in Miami , Florida , before the Super Bowl raising concerns that it will not be as much of a draw because no Super Bowl players will participate in the game .
