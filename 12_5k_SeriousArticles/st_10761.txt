Rep . Edward Markey , D Massachusetts , said the situation could get dramatically worse . " One of the questions which I asked was what would happen if a worst case scenario did unfold ? " he told reporters after the hearing . " I was told that the amount of oil per day could actually rise from 5 , 000 to 60 , 000 barrels of oil a day , although in a worst case scenario , the most likely number was in the 40 , 000 barrel range , which only reinforces the necessity of us acting as quickly as possible , for BP and all responsible , for shutting off this catastrophic leak of oil .
