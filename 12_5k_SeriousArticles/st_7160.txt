The movie doesn ' t try to modernize the story ? there are no cellphones or worrying about WiFi passwords ? opting instead to try to bring out matters that are more constants of childhood development . The movie is pleasant and charming , but when making a big screen adaptation of a beloved classic and genuine touchstone for generations , adequate doesn ' t feel like quite enough . The movie isn ' t some kind of disservice to the legacy of Charles Schulz , but it also feels unnecessary .
