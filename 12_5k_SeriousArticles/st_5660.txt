Consider that the kind of attacks we saw in Paris would be simple to pull off in the United States , where acquiring all the guns and ammunition you want is easier than getting your hands on a box of Sudafed . Why have there been so few terrorist attacks in the U . S . by home grown Muslim radicals ? It s not that someone who wants to kill a bunch of people faces some kind of practical impediment to doing so . It s because American Muslims are much more integrated into the broader American community than their counterparts in Europe . American Muslims are less alienated and more patriotic , even despite the kind of harassment and surveillance so many of them have been subjected to in the last 14 years .
