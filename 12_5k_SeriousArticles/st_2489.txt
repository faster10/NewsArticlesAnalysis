While the critics are quite right to note that the process of negotiating TPP did not engender trust , the US and its negotiating partners have not figured out how to update trade negotiations ( which require trust among negotiating partners ) and the transparency necessary for good governance in the Internet age ( which requires greater openness and dialogue with the public ) . ? I am not excusing them , but rather explaining why it is so hard for trade negotiators to catch up to good governance expectations . ?
