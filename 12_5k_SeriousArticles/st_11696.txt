I find the mental side of Test cricket to be unparalleled . To be Jonathan Trott , for instance , getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months . Then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair . You can ' t replicate that in any other form of the game . Someone like Alastair Cook has to tackle a technical issue , having been found out by opponents , and has the mental battle to overcome it .
