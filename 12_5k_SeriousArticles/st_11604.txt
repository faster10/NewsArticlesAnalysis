China has had a change in mindset since being accused of obstructing climate talks in Copenhagen six years ago . It has invested in solar , wind and hydro power and promised to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by 65 percent . Xi also has pledged 3 . 1 billion to help developing countries combat climate change . But the Chinese president stressed Monday that the eventual climate deal must include aid for poor countries and respect differences between developing and established nations . He said the deal should accommodate national interests . " Addressing climate change should not deny the legitimate needs of developing countries to reduce poverty and improve living standards , " he said .
