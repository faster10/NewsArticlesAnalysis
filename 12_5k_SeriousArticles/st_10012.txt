Newton ' s targets in Ted Ginn ' s last six games played : Greg Olsen 45 Ginn 31 Jerricho Cotchery 26 Corey Brown 23 Devin Funchess 20 Mike Tolbert 10 Ed Dickson 8 . . . . The Cardinals allowed the sixth most receptions in the league to tight ends this regular season and gave up big games to the position down the stretch , ceding 8 71 1 to Seahawks TEs in Week 17 , 10 109 1 to Eagles TEs in Week 15 , and 9 144 to Vikings TEs the week before . Mathieu ' s loss has weakened Arizona ' s coverage in the middle of the field . This is a plus matchup for Olsen , who should be leaned on especially heavily if Patrick Peterson shadows Ginn . . . . Peterson followed James Jones ( 0 0 ) wherever he went in last week ' s win over Green Bay and figures to apply similar treatment to Ginn , whose receiving lines in his last two games are 1 9 0 and 0 0 . Against struggling RCB Justin Bethel , Carolina will need more contributions from its complementary wideouts than usual this week . . . . Brown led that group in playing time ( 75 ) in the Divisional Round , with slot man Cotchery logging 54 of the downs and Funchess a 34 snap rate . Brown has theoretical big play ability , but hasn ' t cleared 60 receiving yards in a game all season . Funchess ' playing time shortage has rendered him an inconsistent , largely pedestrian producer with 30 or fewer yards in six of his last seven games . 33 year old Cotchery should have opportunities to move the chains against inconsistent slot CB Jerraud Powers , who is playing in place of Mathieu .
