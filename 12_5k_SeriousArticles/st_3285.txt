Hey , cool kids . Yeah , you with the white earbuds . Listen up . The iPhone is ditching its headphone jack . WHAT ? ! Well , that ' s the latest rumor , anyway . According to Japanese blog Macotakara , Apple , with the iPhone 7 , ? will be getting rid of its standard 3 . 5 mm headphone jack . But , the site reports , those signature buds aren ' t going away , just yet ? they ' re just going into a different port . The Lightning port . Supposedly so the iPhone 7 can be thinner . What ' s Apple saying ? Nothing , of course ? about this , and those other iPhone 7 theories . Excuse us while we feverishly add " Bluetooth headphones " to our Christmas list .
