Ironically , Trump was not the one best suited to play the role that Americans now want . The original who most closely fit that bill was New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , or more specifically the Chris Christie that preceded Bridgegate , the one that Central Casting was looking for : boorish , decisive , loud , brash and always speaking his mind . Although he wasn ' t conservative enough for some on the right , they were willing to overlook those deficiencies because of that attitude . Sound familiar ? It should . For Christie was Trump before Trump was Trump .
