So when he makes one handed catches like Odell Beckham during warmups , or when he posits that he should be on the hands team in a postgame media session , he ' s just serious enough that it ' s clear he wants to contribute in a real smash mouth football sense . He has some fullback in him , and that keeps defenses honest and gives every receiver a little more room to make a play . Sunday ' s wide receivers were Ted Ginn Jr . , Devin Funchess , Brown and Jerricho Cotchery . It seems preposterous that this group is part of a team that has scored 30 or more points in every game save one since Nov . 15 . This offense is a steamroller with those wide receivers , and it ' s because Newton is in charge . Those receivers are in the entourage too .
