The IRGC generally and its Quds Force specifically have been implicated in several terrorist attacks on Americans , Israelis , and others . The July 1994 bombing that killed 85 persons at a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires was traced back by the government of Argentina ( and even noted in the U . S . Congressional Record ) to the IRGC . The June 1996 truck bomb that killed 19 U . S . servicemen in Khobar , Saudi Arabia , was believed by the 9 11 Commission to have been assembled at an IRGC facility and then provided to its partner in crime Hezbollah , which carried out the attack .
