The great Brady , arguably the best quarterback in NFL history , didn ' t play well most of the game . He hit some plays late to keep his team in the game , and battled despite a Broncos pass rush that hit him on way too many of his 56 attempts . But this was far from a vintage Brady performance . His two interceptions loomed large all game . He couldn ' t make a play on the final two point conversion attempt . He finished with a 56 . 4 rating .
