For all the great moments , sometimes things go wrong . I ' ll never forget the moment in 1991 when the lights went out during one of Kurt Loder ' s live interviews , keeping the entire audience in the dark . Janet Jackson was in the middle of giving a heartfelt tribute to Aaliyah when the prompter went out in 2001 . The same year , we left U2 hanging , literally . The band was 20 feet above the stage and ready to descend . Just as we announced their performance live on television , the band ' s power source went out . The band couldn ' t play , so all we heard was Bono joking that MTV didn ' t pay the electric bill .
