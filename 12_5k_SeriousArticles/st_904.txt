Of course , differences do exist in the Middle East in the form of ideological , ethnic , cultural and linguist identities but the major unifying factor is the awareness of one another for being near . They have been living close to each other for centuries . The binding forces of their faith , intermarriages , mutual trade , life style , their common experience replete with moments of joy and sorrow invite them to solve their major problems through negotiations and not through conflict . Fratricide or for that matter killing due to megalomaniac or egocentric stances is self defeating to the principle of peaceful co existence . Do they Iran and Saudi Arabia want to re enact the drama of Cain and Able or the Ottoman Caliph attack on the Muslim city of Constantinople ( the present day Istanbul ) in 1453 , forcing Muslim scholars to run away and settle in Greece , Italy , Bosnia , Hungary , Belgium , Holland , France , Germany , in short all throughout Europe which brought the light of Renaissance for Europe but was detrimental to the interest of Muslims till today ? A conflict between Muslims has always been harmful , a painful lesson not only from the East Pakistan experience , but from Iran Iraq eight year war .
