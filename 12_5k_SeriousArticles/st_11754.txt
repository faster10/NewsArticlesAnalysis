Only one Republican , George W . Bush , won the Iowa caucuses and then went on to win the White House , the latter in a disputed result that took the Supreme Court to decide . That year , 2000 , was the only the second time that both major party nominees won Iowa caucuses . Al Gore , who won the national popular vote but lost the Electoral College in 2000 , won his party ' s Iowa caucuses . It happened in 1976 , too , although what Republicans did that year was merely a straw poll sample from caucusing precincts and different from the caucuses of today .
