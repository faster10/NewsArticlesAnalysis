TV writer director Martin Boudot did the latter , and has had to live with it ever since . Often I ask myself : why didn t I call Charlie before calling the cops ? he says . Why didn t I go and warn them when I saw the gunmen outside ? If it happened again , I wouldn t wait . I d act straight away . Sometimes I just wish I could save someone . In my dreams , I save lives , but that day I saved no one .
