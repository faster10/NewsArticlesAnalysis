Contain WR Calvin Ridley : Unlike the Michigan State semifinal game , Alabama will likely return to the pounding , punishing skills of Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry . Nevertheless , Ridley presents the Tide s top perimeter threat , and his ability to get open ? and get open deep ? from the outset presented a host of problems for the Spartans . That means Clemson will rely on CB Mackensie Alexander . The Tigers did that throughout 2015 and Alexander has yet to let them down . Oklahoma came into its semifinal game insisting it would look for All American receiver Sterling Shepard in the Orange Bowl . Shepard wound up catching seven passes , but was held under 100 yards and out of the end zone . If Ridley is under 100 yards and has no ? touchdowns , that s great news for the Tigers .
