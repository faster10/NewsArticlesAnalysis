The difference between Brady and the top two is that the needle won ' t move that much even with another Super Bowl . There ' s a great argument right now that Brady is the best quarterback ever ( I believe he is ) . A fifth Super Bowl would make Brady ' s argument stronger , but he ' ll get a lot of GOAT love either way . Brady could lose Sunday , retire , and he ' ll have a heck of a football legacy either way . But one more title would put him in a class by himself .
