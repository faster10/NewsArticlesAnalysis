To determine the Best Picture nominees , members select five films in order of preference . That voting is weighted , meaning that first place votes matter more than third place ones . Some believe Compton received votes , just not enough in first or second place . Others speculate that voters never watched the N . W . A biopic . I think the older members didn t think it was a movie for them , says one member . Adds another : I haven t seen every movie . Who has that kind of time ? Especially when you ve got to watch Making a Murderer . The Academy might want to determine Best Picture the way it does Best Foreign Language Film : A diverse committee would choose the nominees and then members could only vote if they had seen all the films .
