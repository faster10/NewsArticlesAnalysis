I changed the orientation of my life , took control of my life . I think that if you do that , and you stay true to it , and you stay true to a set of principles of being fair , honest , positive , and creative in what you do of pledging not to harm others , and to minimize any amount of harm that you do to other people or to the world around you you don ' t take drugs , you don ' t poison your mind , you don ' t take alcohol you focus on what you ' re doing , keep your discipline then I think it ' s natural that positive outcomes will occur .
