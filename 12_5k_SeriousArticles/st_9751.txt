If you own a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy Tab 10 . 1 , no one ' s going to show up at your doorstep and ask for it back . Your device will continue to work , but there ' s always a chance that Google or Samsung may tweak their software in future updates to work around claims of patent infringement . My Galaxy S II , for instance , lost its " overscroll bounce " effect in an update late last year , and I suspect this was done to avoid a patent claim that Apple has wielded against other companies .
