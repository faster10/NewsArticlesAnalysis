The longer answer , however , is different . And it requires we focus on wages ? specifically , wage growth ? rather than the unemployment rate . Because while jobs are more readily available than they ve been in quite some time , it s also the case that many of these jobs , to use the technical phrase , basically suck . A lot of them don t pay much , even to those lucky enough to get full time . So overall wage growth is , as the New York Times euphemistically put it , rather subdued .
