Politics is a breeding ground for martial metaphors . Politicians " under fire " " take flak " as their consultants sit in " war rooms " and launch " ad blitzes " and " air campaigns " in " targeted districts " and " battleground states " to put their clients " over the top " ? with the help of their " troops " on the ground . When that doesn ' t work , the generals sometimes resort to some dreaded " nuclear option . " Even when it succeeds , the pundits often declare it a " Pyrrhic victory . "
