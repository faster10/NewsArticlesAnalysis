Manziel is a total head case . Jackson and the Browns don t need him . There isn t one decent QB on the entire Browns roster , so they d better get busy and draft one or two this spring . Also , they should burn up the free agent wires looking for somebody who could be a backup and mentor a rookie QB . You can t win in the NFL without a decent QB , so the Browns have to find one ? and quick . Otherwise , Hue Jackson will end up like Mike Pettine .
