It ' s important to note that the memorial also launched a Memorial Guide , a digital tool to help family members and visitors locate any name . Not only does the guide show the exact place where a person ' s name will be , but it also provides background information on all of the victims and lists any adjacencies . People will be able to locate a name in advance via the 9 11 Memorial ' s website or use an on site kiosk to find a loved one or learn more about any of the victims .
