" It has been my greatest privilege to serve with Robert C . Byrd in the United States Senate . I looked up to him , I fought next to him , and I am deeply saddened that he is gone . He leaves a void that simply can never be filled . But I am lifted by the knowledge of his deep and abiding faith in God , I have joy in the thought of him reunited with his dear ( late wife ) Erma , and I am proud knowing that his moving life story and legacy of service and love for West Virginia will live on .
