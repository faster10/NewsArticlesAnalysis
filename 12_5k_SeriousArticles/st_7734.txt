Middlebury , Vermont I ' ve spent most of my adult life over three decades in Vermont . To some degree , it has been like Eden itself , a shelter from the American storm : leafy mountains , red barns and white clapboard houses , quiet dirt roads with covered bridges , village greens , lots of fresh organic food , ex hippies galore and the open waters of Lake Champlain , which treads a narrow path over 100 miles between the Green Mountains to the east and the Adirondacks to the west .
