As President I will challenge the real impediments to peace in the Middle East , and stand up for Israel , Rubio said . Instead of pressuring Israel to make unreciprocated concessions , I will work with its prime minister on areas of mutual interest . I will finally move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . I will help ensure that Jerusalem remains the Jewish state s undivided and eternal capital . I will revive the common sense understandings reached in the 2004 Bush Sharon letter and build on them to help ensure Israel has defensible borders , including through its continued control of the Golan Heights .
