? ? James Kratch , Giants beat reporter ( 4 7 against the spread ) : ? If the Giants ' offensive line can keep quarterback Eli Manning upright ( which is no easy task against the Jets ' defensive front ) , then Manning is going to be able to go to Beckham early and often against a vulnerable Jets secondary . This is a coin flip game , but the Jets have playoff hopes riding on it . The Giants have that , too , but they also potentially have jobs and legacies at stake , as well . With their backs against the wall , the Giants will find a way to win . And then probably lose in Miami a week later , because it has been that kind of season . But on Sunday , they will get the win they desperately need . ? Giants 28 , Jets 27
