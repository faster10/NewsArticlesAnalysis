This is the most difficult task ever . How do you address Clarence and Danny ? How do you address that ? You talk to ten different people and they ' re going to have ten different ideas . But it ' s really not easy . You ' re trying to do something that ' s very , very emotional , and at the same time , you don ' t want to make the show a funeral . You want to make sure the show is a celebration of life . It ' s a very delicate , very fine line to walk . And ( Bruce ) comes up with this rap it ' s so f great , and so perfect . I ' m awestruck . This guy still inspires me after 45 f years of doing this . I ' m like , " Jesus Christ , that ' s so f good , so important . " It ' s such an important moment in the show . . . It ' s probably the best start of a tour , I think ever , honestly .
