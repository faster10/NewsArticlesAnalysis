There is only one cure for this delusion : Republicans need to scratch that itch and nominate a person they believe to be a strong conservative . Walker will do nicely . And when they nominate him , and lose anyway , they can put this argument to rest . Republicans will have run out of excuses . Only then , can they achieve the epiphany that could save them from going the way of the Whigs : Voters aren ' t just rejecting the GOP ' s messenger but its message .
