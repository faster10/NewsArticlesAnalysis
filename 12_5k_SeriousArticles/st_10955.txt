I ' m not going to go on about all the struggles I now have to endure just to make it through the day . I will say that I always believed Rehtaeh would make an imprint on this world . I just never imagined it would be at such a young age and it would cost her her life . Our family lost a huge part of us but so did society in general , and in our loss we gained insight , wisdom and direction . A spotlight has been cast on the distribution of photos without consent and my only hope is that others will continue to learn from our tragedy .
