" What we ' re trying to achieve in Kandahar is to do the political groundwork so when it ' s time to do the military operation , the significant part of the population is pulling us in and supportive so we ' re not only doing what they want but we ' re operating in a way that they ' re comfortable with . That ' s the key to success here . "
