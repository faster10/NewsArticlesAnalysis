The Leveson Inquiry is critical of the News of the World and says there was a failure of governance at News International . But it also says there is no evidence Rupert Murdoch knew phone hacking was rife , or that he orchestrated a cover up . Leveson is less equivocal about James Murdoch , saying there are aspects of his evidence " that cause me some concern " . It stops short of criticizing the younger Murdoch further , citing ongoing police investigations into criminality at News International , but the verdict is not a favorable one for James , and it may harm his chance of succeeding his father .
