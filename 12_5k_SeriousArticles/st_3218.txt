Our guide was a self proclaimed African bushman named Elson , who seemed to have an amazing one ness with both the land and the animals . We ' d be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace , only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep , slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away . It would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance .
