Trump : I would not blame the SEC . This guy was a total crook . The people in his own organization supposedly didn ' t know about it . Now , that ' s another thing I find that hard to believe . He ' s got two sons , and they didn ' t know about it ? And they worked there for years ? I think the whole thing is a swindle . I think even that ' s a swindle : The father said , " Look , you guys turn me in and pretend you don ' t know anything and I ' ll save my two sons . " But it ' s impossible for me to believe that his sons didn ' t know about this .
