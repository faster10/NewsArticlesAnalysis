Tim MacMahon , ESPN . com : I ' ll pick at Oklahoma City on Feb . 27 , but I sure wouldn ' t put my money on it . I would bet on the Warriors breaking the Bulls ' record for wins in a season , though . Durant and Westbrook , the only duo of top five players in the league , give the Thunder a decent chance to beat anyone . This collection of talent makes for one of the NBA ' s most entertaining matchups , too .
