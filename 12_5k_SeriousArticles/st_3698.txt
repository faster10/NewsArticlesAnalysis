All of which is true . But here ' s where leadership comes in and has been lacking . The public distrusts government because its leaders haven ' t been able to work together to produce much of anything . Sure , we want it all and that ' s our fault . But if we had some honest politicians out there , on both sides of the aisle , saying we can ' t have it all , we just might listen to them . Instead , we hear each side yammering about how the other guys solutions will kill the country or jobs or your bank account , so we figure we can ' t trust any of them .
