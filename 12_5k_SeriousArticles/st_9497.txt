I had been surprised to learn , in the spring of 1991 , that as the seventh President of Ireland I would become the first to visit Britain as president . It is difficult to believe now but no previous Irish president in the history of the state had traveled to " mainland " Britain for official business . There was a problem , for example , with how to describe me . Because of Northern Ireland , the British would not agree to call me " president of Ireland " !
