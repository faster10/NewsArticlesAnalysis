Paul is still dealing with injuries and has not produced to his value . His slow start to the season has him averaging 33 . 8 fantasy points per game , which is not bad . But when players who are more than 1 , 000 cheaper and are producing more ( Chris Bosh , 7 , 300 36 . 3 fantasy points per game Draymond Green , 7 , 400 37 . 6 ) , spend the extra cash and get either Rondo , who has four triple doubles this season alone , or Curry .
