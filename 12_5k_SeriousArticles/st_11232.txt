If the pattern holds , Manning s arm strength will deteriorate during the game . He struggled with accuracy in the second half against the Steelers last week , and should ve been intercepted by William Gay when he threw a wobbly ball to open Denver s fourth quarter touchdown drive . Three of Manning s four highest passer ratings this season came after more than a week of rest ? in a Thursday night game with 10 days rest following Denver s bye week and coming on in relief after a seven week injury absence . His fifth highest rating was in Sunday s win vs . the Steelers , which came after a playoff bye . No such respite for the 39 year old this week . Manning is sure to have some success , but when his arm weakens and accuracy falters , the Pats must be fortuitous with his hanging ducks .
