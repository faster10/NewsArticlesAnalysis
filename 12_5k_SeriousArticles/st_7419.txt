Arnold : Sometimes I can control it , but a lot of times , it ' s just kind of like a rocket ship . You know how it fills up with fire and the gas and then finally it ' s just like , " Whoosh ! " So if I have to hold them back , it usually comes out a lot more than it would ' ve if I didn ' t hold it in . It feels good to finally release it and just get it out .
