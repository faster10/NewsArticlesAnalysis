Ramsey Nouah : I ' m not very certain I ' ve come to learn about life that never say never . I was thinking maybe in the next 10 years I ' ll probably be behind the camera , directing and working on my own flicks but at the same time , of course , if in the next 10 years I am still good enough to tell a story and get into characters then I will still be there acting . Besides that , of course , humanitarian stuff mostly .
