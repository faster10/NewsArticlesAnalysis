Pats Broncos has a 44 . 5 point game total with visiting New England favored by three . The Patriots ' team total is just below 24 in Denver . . . . The limitations on and or ineffectiveness of slot CB Chris Harris ( shoulder ) are a major concern for the Broncos ' defense against the Patriots ' inside the numbers passing game . Playing " with one arm " as described by coach Gary Kubiak , Pro Football Focus charged Harris with 122 yards allowed against Antonio Brown less Pittsburgh in the Divisional Round . With Harris shuttling on and off the field , the Broncos experienced miscommunications that left Darrius Heyward Bey , Sammie Coates , and Martavis Bryant wide open for huge gains . His pass catcher corps back near full strength , Tom Brady is arguably the top quarterback play on this two game DFS slate . A high volume of pass attempts is likely for Brady as the Patriots continue their quick out passing attack . Brady topped 40 attempts in last Saturday ' s win over the Chiefs and dialed up 45 dropbacks when New England visited Denver in Week 12 . I think the Pats will beat the Broncos by imposing their will with the pass and playing solid defense . . . . New England ' s game plan figures to mirror last week ' s versus Kansas City , wherein James White led Patriots backs in snap rate ( 72 ) but logged only three touches . Steven Jackson played 29 of the downs and has a pitiful 27 56 1 ( 2 . 07 YPC ) rushing line through three games as a Patriot . Brandon Bolden ' s snaps have dipped in four straight weeks and he focused on special teams versus the Chiefs . Although White is the best DFS option in the group , he is at best the No . 4 running back option in the Conference Championship Round .
