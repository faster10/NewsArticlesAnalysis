Day Two . 2 p . m . Hotel Lobby Near the front desk ' s complimentary jellybean bar , I see the greatest Red Sox pitcher of all time , the retired Pedro Martinez , blankly staring in my direction . I give him a friendly nod , the kind guys silently exchange in the halls at work or at the gym . He doesn ' t pick up on the signal , so I don ' t bother to tell him that the jellybeans are free . Free ! Then , just like a regular person , Pedro checks into his room .
