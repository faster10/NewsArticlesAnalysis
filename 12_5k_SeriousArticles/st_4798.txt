Mr Tusk s proposals try to offer safeguards for the U . K . and other EU countries outside the eurozone to ensure their concerns are heard when the currency bloc , which represents 19 of 28 member states , seeks to push through a proposal . There would be a mechanism for the U . K . to flag its concerns with EU leaders and the EU sets out a number of principles to ensure respect for countries outside the bloc . But there is no veto for the U . K . over eurozone issues , the scope of what it could raise is limited , and if there is an emergency such as a financial crisis , the U . K wouldn t be able to hold up a proposal .
