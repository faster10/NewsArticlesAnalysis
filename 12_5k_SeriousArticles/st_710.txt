Clinton was unexpectedly aggressive during the previous debate , hitting Bernie Sanders hard early on his voting history on gun control ( a specific attack she cleverly laid the foundation for a few weeks earlier ) . She s a stronger debater than she often gets credit for , and she could look to press her advantage again in Des Moines , Iowa . Still , she has good reasons to play it safe this time around . For one , she s lost the element of surprise . As my colleague Jim Newell noted last week , Sanders has finally found a way to frame his gun record in a slightly more favorable light , and he s not going to be caught flat footed a second time . The bigger reason for caution , though , is Clinton doesn t need to steady the ship as she did in Las Vegas , she simply needs to sail straight ahead .
