The conventional wisdom on this snowstorm is that lower turnout may hurt Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders ( though as my colleague Josh Voorhees told me , that s tough to say for certain , especially given how little we understand the mind of a Trump supporter ) . On the other hand , if the storm s impact remains confined to the relatively more rural and conservative northwestern corner of the state , as is currently forecast , it may actually help Trump and Sanders : The more conservative candidates in their respective parties , Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton have more support in that part of the state .
