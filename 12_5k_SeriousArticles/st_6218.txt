Obama and Hillary Clinton now have the same relationship . She evidently does not inspire the liberal coalition , as the Democratic primary polls suggest . Her political career began in a pre Obama era , when Democrats were more nervous about offending conservative sensibilities than they are today . But Obama ' s legacy rides on her , just as Reagan ' s did on George H . W . Bush . If she wins , his policy victories are much more likely to be locked in and the Republican Party much more likely to make peace with them .
