Isis has carried out revenge attacks against any state or group which fights against it . When the US started bombing its forces in Iraq and Syria last year , it decapitated American journalists and aid workers . When beheadings became the norm and lost their shock value , it burned to death a Jordanian pilot in a cage . And when it was defeated and driven from the city of Kobani by the Syrian Kurds , it sent suicide raiders to butcher over 200 Kurdish men , women and children . ?
