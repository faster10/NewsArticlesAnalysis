Miller , who was and still is a senior editor at a tech news site called The Verge , plans to stay offline for a full year . When he needs to post something to the website that employs him , he will hand his editors a thumb drive with his stories saved in offline files . If he needs to look up a phone number , he ' ll get on the phone and start calling people who hopefully know people who know the person that he ' s trying to reach for an interview . There ' s no other way without access to professional websites and directories , he said .
