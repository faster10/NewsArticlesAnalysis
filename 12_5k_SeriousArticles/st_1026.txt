McCreery : I think that was the only one . I was the guy on ' Idol ' that walked six miles to get some tea . There was a time that I was going to go to McDonald ' s because that was the only place in California you could find sweet tea . I took a right instead of a left , and I ended up walking six miles to get some sweet tea . I kept thinking as I was walking " Man this is a long mile . "
