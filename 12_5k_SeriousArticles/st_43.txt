It is February 11 , 2014 . Three years ago today , I walked to Tahrir Square to celebrate the fall of a dictator . In that square , we felt everything was possible , after Mubarak ' s 30 year rule . It ' s that feeling a recent film , " The Square " tried to capture . I resisted watching this Oscar nominated film for weeks . I was in Egypt for many of the events it portrayed , and I knew I ' d be emotionally riven if the film were even partially accurate . Indeed , it was painful to watch a film that captured so many of the core emotions of the past three years , and did it so well .
