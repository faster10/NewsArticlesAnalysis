Willems : I ' m very lucky to write for children , because I don ' t have to deal with popular culture . I can just deal with core fundamental issues : jealousy , love , hatred , sadness , joy , wanting to drive a bus . The fundamental core emotional things . And just asking questions like , ' How do you know when you ' re in control ? What is a friend ? What are relationships between people ? ' These are all things that I haven ' t figured out yet . I ' m very lucky in that I don ' t understand the world yet . If I understood the world , it would be harder for me to write these books .
