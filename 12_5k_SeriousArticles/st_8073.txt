Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis . Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3 4 3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now : ' I ' ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn ' t matter how much support you have in the boardroom . You have to win . '
