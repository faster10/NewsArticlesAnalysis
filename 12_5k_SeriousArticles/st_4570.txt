It felt like it counts for 20 , as bad as the game was , but really , it counts for one game , Gruden said . We re 4 6 . This is a very good football team . They ve won nine games before they played us . It s not the end of the world that we lost to the Panthers . We re disappointed , but we re not devastated . We re going to bounce back from this and we re going to move on and get ready to play the New York Giants . We re sick about it . We felt good coming into the game . We were riding a very emotional win against the New Orleans Saints .
