" What ' s important is that the community be told the truth about what happened , about how he was shot , " said Michael Robbins , an attorney for the McDonald family . " There was a narrative put out there by the Chicago police , by the union initially , that a police officer had to shoot him in self defense . . . that he lunged at a police officer with a knife . It ' s not true . He was shot while he was walking away . "
