Bonds and Clemens authored some of the greatest numbers in baseball history , but alleged use of performance enhancing drugs has hurt them significantly with voters . The good news for Bonds and Clemens is that they lurched forward to 44 . 3 percent and 45 . 2 percent support , respectively . The bad news for this duo is that each has just six years left on the ballot . In 2016 , they likely benefitted from the voter purge mentioned above . That raises a concern that they may have topped out with the current voting body . Maybe a less crowded ballot in 2017 helps them , and maybe there ' s another purge on the way . In either case , Bonds and Clemens would be well served to nudge their way past 50 percent in 2017 .
