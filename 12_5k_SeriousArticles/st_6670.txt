To kick off its more philosophical , broader approach to faith and the meaning of life , the new ? Late Show ? brought us Big Questions With Even Bigger Stars , in which Colbert reclines on a blanket on the grass looking up at the night sky with people like Tom Hanks , Scarlett Johansson , or Bryan Cranston . Then , they just talk about stuff . The topics , and some of the answers ( Why do bad things happen to good people ? Because God has poor eyesight ) , are more than a bit reminiscent of Jack Handey s Deep Thoughts and the segment overall can feel tediously scripted , but the dialogue in place of one liners ? and the relatively innovative use of famous people ? helps give the segment its own identity .
