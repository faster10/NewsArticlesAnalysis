PB : It is much more a political concern than it is strategic or military . Iran is one of a number of countries with missile technology that frankly for those of us who would prefer that there will be a weapon of mass destruction free zone across the Middle East , a missile free zone across the Middle East I would prefer that no one could have . But as long as Israel has nuclear weapons , other countries are going to seek out other kinds of military technology . It is unfortunate . I think this is not something that is a direct threat to the US , but of course there is always the argument that Iran is supporting opponents of the US in the region .
