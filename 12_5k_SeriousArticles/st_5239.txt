DeMarco Murray vs . Bills : I was a big beater of the drum for Murray before the season and even after the first month plus of his struggles with his new team . But coming off a game against the Patriots where he played just 14 snaps and carried the ball eight times for 24 yards ( 3 . 0 YPC ) , it s impossible to trust him in the most important fantasy week to date . Ryan Mathews is also expected back from his concussion on Sunday , throwing another wrench into this backfield . The Bills have quietly been bad against the run this season , yielding over 4 . 40 YPC and the 11th most fantasy points to running backs , but the Eagles divvy up the snaps and touches too much to have any confidence in any one particular running back . Mathews might be the best bet for a touchdown .
