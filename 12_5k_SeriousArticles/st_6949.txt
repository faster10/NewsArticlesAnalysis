Brettne Bloom , a 34 year old literary agent in New York City , is grateful to have had a Caesarean . When her doctor found that her baby had stopped growing three weeks before her due date , she delivered via C section . " I just feel so lucky to live at a time when C sections are relatively simple procedures , " says Bloom , whose daughter Eloisa is now a healthy 2 year old . " I didn ' t care how she arrived in the world as long as she was safe . "
