BOSTON A hearty and familiar " Let ' s Go Celtics " chant reverberated off the walls at TD Garden on Friday night when Isaiah Thomas pulled up from a couple of steps behind the 3 point arc late in the fourth quarter , forcing the chant ' s demise as fans audibly inhaled as he rose . And when his 3 pointer splashed through , putting the Celtics up five over the Golden State Warriors with under four minutes to play , it felt as if the Garden might implode in delirium .
