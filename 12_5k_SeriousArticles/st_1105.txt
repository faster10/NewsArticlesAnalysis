For Federer , though , the task will not just be to make it through those tricky matches , but to do so with plenty left in the tank for what would likely lie in store in the semifinals . That s when he is seeded to meet the world No . 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic . On current form the Serbian looks almost unbeatable , but Federer had his chances against him in the final of both Wimbledon and the U . S . Open last year . And , while being on the same side of the draw as Djokovic may not be ideal , Federer could benefit from having fewer matches under his belt when he faces the greatest challenge in all of tennis .
