Several eastern European countries have sealed their borders , and Hungary ' s hardline Prime Minister Victor Orban reiterated Friday that " migration is a security issue " , linking it to " the threat of terrorism and crime " . Bulgarian Prime Minister Bokyo Borisov has demanded the closure of the external borders of the passport free Schengen area , arguing that rather than spend money on migrants , Europe should stop them from coming . In Germany , the inflow has fallen from thousands to hundreds a day in recent weeks as winter sets in , and the government is desperate to keep it that way . " Perhaps the weather was particularly bad this year , the meteorologists will tell us one day , " said Merkel ' s migrant policy coordinator Peter Altmaier . " But above all , we must seize the window of opportunity that has opened . . . Our goal must be for refugees numbers not to rise again after the end of the winter storms but for them to keep going down . "
