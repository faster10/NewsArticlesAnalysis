I was emotional the whole morning about it , said Azarenka of the Broncos game against the Patriots , which she didn t watch . I turned on TV while I was having breakfast and I just couldn ' t look over there because , you know , I ' m a huge sports fan , so when I ' m a fan of somebody , I ' m a diehard . I ' ll get nervous , emotional and have absolutely no control , I go loco . I will scream . I will scream at the TV .
