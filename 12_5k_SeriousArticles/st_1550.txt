Technical note : The estimates for probability of the poll s leader being ahead were generated using an R function that calculates the standard error for the difference between the proportions . This standard error is used as the standard deviation for 1 , 000 , 000 simulations on a normal distribution , with the difference between candidates as the mean of the distribution . The proportion of times the leading candidate is ahead in those simulations is the probability that the candidate actually leads after accounting for the margin of error . The R code can be seen ? on GitHub .
