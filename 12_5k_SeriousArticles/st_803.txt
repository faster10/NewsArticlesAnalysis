It is important to note that on Tuesday the Cypriot parliament rejected a 10 billion eurozone bailout package due to investor alarm over the proposed tax on existing bank deposits . However we don ' t know what will come next . Maybe the tax on the insured deposits will yield 2 billion euros . Agreed said the euro group : we ' d prefer not to tax deposits under 100 , 000 euros but if you cannot afford to raise the 5 . 8 billion in any other way , then you have no choice but to tax the small depositors .
