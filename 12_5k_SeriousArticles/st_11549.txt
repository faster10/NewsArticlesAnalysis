Just a word of caution : the Sport suspension setting is very hard ? you ll be shaken , not stirred ? so we suggest only using that on the track . The Sport transmission setting , on the other hand , is the best way to keep the engine ready to jump . Figuring that Bond wouldn t have it any other way , we used that setting all the time . Fuel economy be damned , driving the DB9 GT like Bond himself stole the thing was an absolute riot . Sorry , Earth .
