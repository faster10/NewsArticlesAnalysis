I was one of those people who wanted to be associated with the more " American " kids , so I always went along with it as I entered high school . I tried to be like my friends as much as possible . They were second or third generation Mexicans who spoke English at school and hung out with the white kids . I dressed like the Americans who wore skater shoes , baggy pants and Billabong T shirts . And even though I loved soccer , I thought it was too Mexican , so I played football instead .
