Offensively , the Bengals have been anchored by possibly the strongest offensive line of any team in the NFL this season . With left tackle Andrew Whitworth and left guard Clint Bolin giving quarterback Andy Dalton blind side protection , it has been right tackle Andre Smith who kept Justin Houston and Tamba Hali away from him . That level of confidence up front has allowed Dalton to move up to second in the league in passer rating ( 116 . 1 ) with 1761 yards and 14 touchdown passes .
