All this adds up to what would be the costliest search in history , more even than the estimated 160 million in recovery costs for Air France Flight 447 off the coast of Brazil in 2009 . The search area for that plane was narrowed to only five square miles within weeks , and yet it took nearly two years to find and recover the remnants of the Airbus A330 aircraft . The search and recovery area for MH370 is exponentially greater , at some 23 , 000 square miles , and may therefore be exponentially more expensive .
