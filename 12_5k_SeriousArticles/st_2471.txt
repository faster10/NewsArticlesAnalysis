" When people go to work , let ' s say they have an 8 to 5 job , they have to leave early to get to the job , then they are late coming home . That ' s nine to 10 hours before the dog can go out , " Brooks says . " If you have a way for dog to go out , potty and come back in , there ' s generally no problem with the new home . The people are happy the dogs are happy . "
