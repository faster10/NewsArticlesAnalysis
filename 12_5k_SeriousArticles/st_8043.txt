Perot was someone who could not be managed and had a disdain for the news media and most other elements of modern campaigning . The bizarre stories he told and complete inability to deal with the rough and tumble of modern campaigns forced him out of the race shortly after he got started . He revived his campaign in October mainly to repair his image as a quitter , participated in the three national debates , and ended up winning 19 of the vote nationally . But he didn t carry a single state , so his electoral vote total was zero .
