What were they thinking ? Last I checked , Demaryius Thomas is just the third receiver in NFL history with three consecutive seasons of 1 , 400 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns . It might be prudent to cover him . The Bears unfortunately took a different approach . They left Thomas wide open on his first quarter , 48 yard touchdown . Chicago pulled the same stunt in St . Louis when they failed to account for Todd Gurley out of the backfield . To add insult to injury , safety Chris Prosinski ? pressed into duty because of Antrel Rolle s knee injury ? whiffed badly trying to tackle Thomas in the open field . Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is experienced and talented enough to adjust on the fly , but the opening drives lately have been disastrous .
