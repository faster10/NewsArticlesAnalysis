Clinton was in Charleston , South Carolina , addressing the local NAACP . She spoke against a tragic background : the massacre of nine black people in a Charleston church by a white racist . Naturally , she talked about guns . But she added a new line : There are some who say that this gun violence is an urban problem . Sometimes what they mean by that is : It s a black problem . But it s not . It s not black , it s not urban . It s a deep , profound challenge to who we are .
