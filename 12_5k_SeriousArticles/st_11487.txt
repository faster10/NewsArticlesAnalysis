" There can be no separate black path to power and fulfillment that does not intersect white roots , " King said . " There can be no separate white path to power and fulfillment , short of social disaster , that does recognize the need of sharing that power with black aspirations for freedom and justice . We must come to see now that integration is not really a romantic or aesthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure . Integration needs to be seen in political terms where there is shared power , where black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation . In a real sense we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality . "
