Green : The show is about two lifelong friends who started a successful video game company . One of them is married with kids and their father lives with them . The other best friend , me , is sort of this serial dater , perpetually breaking up with people . His father left when he was very young and now through circumstance , his father moves in with him , too . You have these two lifelong best friends , living with their dads , who one way or another , have failed to take care of themselves . Peter Riegert is my dad and Martin Mull is Tommy Dewey ' s dad . My character is a miserable guy who hasn ' t figured out how to make himself happy . He wakes up every day hating himself . It ' s going to be a really funny thing to play . Especially with a character like that , trying to humanize him or even ( make him ) sympathetic that ' s going to be a fun challenge .
