From Fox ' s point of view , though , extending Jackman for additional films is a no brainer . As The Wolverine producer Hutch Parker said , the idea of eventually replacing Jackman , or perhaps rebooting the franchise with a new actor " feels somewhat blasphemous . " Wolverine existed in the pages of Marvel comics and the imaginations of fans everywhere , but Jackman is Wolverine . It ' s a cinematic character he created , and like Robert Downey Jr . and Iron Man , it ' s now impossible to imagine one without the other .
