" The Court does not downplay the risks that terrorism , as a general matter , may pose . It must , however , assess the risk , if any , posed by these particular refugees , " Godbey wrote in his three page ruling ( posted here ) . " The Court also acknowledges that the kind of concrete information that would help in assessing that risk is the very sort of information the Commission complains the Federal Defendants should have ? but did not ? share with the Commission . Nonetheless , on the record before the Court , the Court finds that the Commission has failed to establish by a preponderance of the admissible evidence that there is a substantial threat of irreparable injury , and therefore denies the application for TRO a temporary restraining order .
