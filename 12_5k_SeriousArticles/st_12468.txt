Wambach played 253 matches and scored 184 goals , while winning 210 of the matches she played for the US . She lost just 12 matches with the USWNT . How wild is that ? From her first goal in 2001 in her first cap to her brace in September against Haiti , no player in the history of soccer has scored as much as her on the international stage . Not Pele , not Diego Maradona , not Mia Hamm , not Lionel Messi , not Cristiano Ronaldo . To put it in perspective , at the moment , Messi , Ronaldo and Pele combined have 181 goals , three less than she has .
