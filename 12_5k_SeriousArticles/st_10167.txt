The media will now need to invent new stories about Clinton to keep up an interest in the Democratic primary and guaranteeing TV ratings and newspaper sales . First it was Benghazi and emails , then Sanders surging , then hyping Joe Biden hoping he would run . Since all that has failed to keep people from supporting Hillary , we must assume they will try to find something to fill the void . My prediction is neither the media nor the Sanders ' campaign will be able to find a way to stop Hillary because the majority of people really want her to succeed .
