QB Eli Manning . He ' s just playing at a very high level right now . Without a running game , without much protection , Manning is throwing the ball with extreme precision and giving the Giants a chance to win any game they play . He was 24 for 44 for 361 yards , two touchdowns and no interceptions Sunday . He came agonizingly close to a third touchdown that would have put the game away . As he always seems to , he outperformed Tom Brady in a game in which that was the Giants ' only chance to win , and he couldn ' t have done any more than he did .
