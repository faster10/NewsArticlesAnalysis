Guzman ? whose nickname translates as Shorty , a reference to his 5 6 stature ? is the feared boss of the powerful Sinaloa cartel . He has been imprisoned twice since his first arrest in 1993 , and escaped twice : first in 2001 , when he broke out of the maximum security Puente Grande prison in Jalisco state . It was reported that he escaped with the help of guards who hid him in a laundry cart , though that version of events is disputed . He was finally re arrested in 2014 .
