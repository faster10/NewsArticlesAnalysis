Cousins had the best story , as he became the first quarterback to post a perfect passing rating this season ( minimum 20 passes ) and he did so with his dad in attendance for the first time since his dad was diagnosed with cancer . Cousins is also the first Redskins quarterback since the 1970 merger to notch a perfect passer rating in a single game . As for Cutler , he nearly compiled a perfect passing rating in the Bears win over the Rams , finishing with a rating of 151 .
