Koryta : Courage is one word for it . Foolishness might be another . I ' ve been shamelessly stealing from Michael for years . It ' s his ability to say so much with one simple sentence that has what I call layers of depth . It ' s the words beneath the words . He does that every book , time after time after time . He ' ll lay out a beautiful line , Bosch thinking on the surface what is a very simple thought or observation but it has ripples to the past , the present and goes deeper to the core of the character . He has the ability and the confidence to let it ride on top and know that the reader will get it and feel that impact . That ' s an incredible gift and that ' s just great writing .
