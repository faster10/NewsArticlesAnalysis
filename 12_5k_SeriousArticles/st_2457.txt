Joy , for my family because everyone thought that I would not survive this disease as many others people had died . However before the medical staff released me to go back to my family they tested me three times to make sure that I really had recovered . Afterwards they gave me a certificate of discharge . They also visited my family , the leaders and elders of my community to inform them that I had recovered and I was no longer contagious . Despite this , I was stigmatized . Some people avoided me in the beginning but now , over time , they have learned to accept me . Now they call me " anti Ebola . "
