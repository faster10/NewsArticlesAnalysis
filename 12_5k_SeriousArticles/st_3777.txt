Let ' s be practical . We ' ve all seen something that , at first glance , looked a little sketchy . Maybe a lady leaves her bag on the train . You could immediately yell " Bomb ! " but that would be hasty and irresponsible . You could get the woman ' s attention , or tell other people , or notify the conductor , or call in a suspicious package . What you cannot do is call 911 and say she ' s strapping on bombs to kill little kids .
