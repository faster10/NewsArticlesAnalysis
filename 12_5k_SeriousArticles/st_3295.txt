With the Iowa caucus less than a week away , Donald Trump received a virtual benediction Tuesday when Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr . endorsed his bid for the White House . Given that the ? brash New York billionaire can barely recite a Bible verse , a glowing validation from the son of a famous televangelist may seem puzzling on its face . But Falwell is by no means the only evangelical Christian to throw his weight behind the disruptive real ? estate mogul : An NBC News Survey Monkey poll released Tuesday shows the thrice married ? Presbyterian ? has earned the support of more than a third ? of white evangelical Republican voters nationwide . Meanwhile , Texas Sen . Ted Cruz , whose father was a pastor and who can boast a list of religious bona fides , currently claims just 20 percent of the nationwide evangelical vote .
