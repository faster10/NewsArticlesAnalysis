I think he is probably one of the best guys at the line of scrimmage who has been around it a long time , Kuechly said . He can switch stuff and get them into plays that allow them to be successful . He sees defenses and knows where he is going to run the ball and where he is going to throw it . We have to be on top of our game because we know he is going to be on top of his . We will have a good plan .
