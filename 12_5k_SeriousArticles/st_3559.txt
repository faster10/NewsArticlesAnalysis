But in a speech in Oklahoma on Wednesday , Sarah Palin said , I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room because my own family going through what we re going through today with my son , a combat vet like so many others , they come back a bit different , they come back hardened . They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to the country . Then she zoomed in the real problem , saying , When my own son is going through what he goes though coming back , I can certainly relate to other families who feel these ramifications of PTSD our soldiers do return with . And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we have a commander in chief who will respect them . They have to question if they re respected anymore . It starts from the top . The question , though , that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder , Do you know what we go through ? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America ?
