After a tight first half ? where Arizona State ( 18 4 , 9 1 Pac 12 ) consistently made the extra pass offensively and sank some difficult attempts as the shot clock wound down ? the Beavers held the Sun Devils to 15 points on just 5 of 28 shooting ( 17 . 9 percent ) . As an encore to the third quarter outburst , OSU squashed any chance of a late Arizona State rally with another 11 1 run to push its lead 23 points with about five minutes to play .
