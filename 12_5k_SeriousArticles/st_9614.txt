CARSON : This is a bunch of lies ( 1 ) . This is what it is , a bunch of lies , attempting , you know , to say I m lying about my history . I think it s pathetic and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted with all of this stuff so that you don t talk about the things that are important ( 2 ) . Because we have so many important things . You know , I m not proud of the fact that I had these rage episodes . But I am proud of the fact that I was able to get over them .
