Cruz , like Clinton on the Democratic side , had the best organization in Iowa and it paid off . He focused his message on very conservative voters and evangelicals , who made up a significant portion of the electorate , and he won big with them . Trump did well with moderates , but given that they only made up 14 of the Iowa electorate , that wasn ' t good enough . He also either underperformed with , or didn ' t turn out enough of , the white male , infrequent voter demographic that makes up the bulk of his support .
