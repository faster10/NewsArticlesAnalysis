Slott : He ' s the underdog and when he gives his all , he comes through . And with Peter Parker , he has all the problems we ' ve had . And for 50 years , he ' s whined about it . Now he ' s the guy who has a new lease on life . This is his second chance , and he knows it . The mopey Peter Parker , that ' s what ' s dead . This Peter Parker will try to rise above it to grow up . This Peter Parker is very much a Rip Van Winkle .
