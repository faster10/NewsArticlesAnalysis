It was during this period that the moat and walls that surround Mdina were first constructed . With few vehicles permitted today inside its gates , a walk through the narrow stone alleys of Mdina makes it clear why it is known locally as " the silent city . " For one of the best views anywhere on Malta , make your way to the upper terrace of the Fontanella Tea Garden restaurant . On a clear day over a cup of coffee you can see practically the entire island .
