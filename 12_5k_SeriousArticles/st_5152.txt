China has prepared a similar trap for itself by asserting territorial claims with the building of a base at Fiery Cross Reef ? 600 miles from the Chinese mainland . Consider : An aircraft flying from Manila to Singapore would transit over Fiery Cross . Were China to shoot down an aircraft on such a path , it could prove the single most expensive aircraft downing ever . Sanctions comparable to those on Russia would cost China 2 trillion per year in foregone GDP . Just how much is Fiery Cross ? indeed , the whole South China Sea ? worth to the Chinese ? For purposes of comparison , the U . S . Gulf of Mexico produces 25 billion of oil and gas revenues per year and is thought superior to the potential of the South China Sea . Put another way , Russian scale sanctions could equal 100 times the potential gain from the South China Sea . Has Beijing considered this possibility ?
