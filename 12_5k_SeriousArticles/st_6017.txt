As I understand the new agreement and subsequent comments , which are about as cryptic as a copy protected DVD , ISP ' s have agreed to implement a standardized " graduated response plan " through which offending users are warned , restricted and eventually cut off from the Internet for successive violations . The companies are supposed to be developing systems that keep track of all this , so that the letters and usage restrictions happen automatically . The fact that they are all agreeing to participate makes it harder for any one company to win the disgruntled customers of those who have been disciplined by another .
