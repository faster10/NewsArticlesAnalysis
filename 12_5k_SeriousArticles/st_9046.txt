Clear across the political spectrum , our politicians whimper and moan about the threat of Islamic terrorism ? which kills fewer people in the United States than bathtub falls or malfunctioning appliances ? even as they insist that the world s principal supporter and exporter of the most extreme and fanatical varieties of Islam is our BFF and bedrock ally in the Middle East . Wahhabism , the most puritanical and fundamentalist strain of Sunni Islam , is the official state doctrine of Saudi Arabia . How much Wahhabi theology directly fed into the rise of anti Western Islamist radicalism and associated terrorist groups is a hotly contested question . You certainly can t say that all or most Wahhabists support al Qaida or ISIS . A central premise of the Saudi state is that extremist views can be confined to the mosque , while all attempts to act them out in the political zone will be crushed without mercy .
