He s a No . 1 guy , Cromartie said . Obviously , if you look at the targets he gets a game , he s a No . 1 guy . He makes some great plays and he s an explosive player . He s a guy that can take the ball and turn a 5 yard play into an 80 yard play . It s just a point where we as a secondary have to do what we have to do on the back end and eliminate the explosive plays .
