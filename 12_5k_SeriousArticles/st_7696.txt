The idea was this : The government sets a limit on the amount of sulfur dioxide that can be released in a year . Power companies are told how much they can emit . It s up to them to decide how to get to those lower levels ? maybe install scrubbers or switch to a a different kind of coal . If they cut more than their allowance , they could sell the excess to a power company struggling to meet its limit . It became known as : cap and trade .
