The president has begun a much needed , difficult conversation . Congress should come up with its own common sense solutions to curb gun violence if it doesn ' t like what ' s on the table . To do nothing would be a national disgrace . Do we really want to live in fear of one another , praying our gun is bigger than the next person ' s , or that we are quick enough to shoot first ? There is no common sense in those gun happy solutions .
