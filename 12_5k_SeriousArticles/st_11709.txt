" People always ask me , ' What is the most important thing for you ? Is it the music , the journalism , what ' s most important for you ? ' I need all of it . If I just do music , I get so tired of myself after a while that I have to do something else , and when I ' m just a journalist I really need to sing and write music or express myself in a more subjective way , so I need it all .
