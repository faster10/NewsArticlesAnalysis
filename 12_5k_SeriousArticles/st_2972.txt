" I have so many favorite images , but I really love the image of Killian running on the summit , " says Mont Blanc Street View project lead Sandy Russell . " The fact that he is able to run in general in those conditions is crazy , and the image is an homage to what he has done and the records he ' s set . And I love that it was taken on the summit , which is a place that encapsulates what people are trying to do at Mont Blanc . "
