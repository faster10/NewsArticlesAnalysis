As three point dogs in Carolina , the Cardinals ' team total is 22 . 5 points in Week 20 . . . . Carson Palmer should have ample passing game opportunities against Carolina , which has given up 300 plus yards passing in three straight games while showing vulnerability minus slot corner Bene Benwikere ( broken leg ) and RCB Charles Tillman ( ACL ) . Fill in RCB Robert McClain was torched by Jermaine Kearse ( 11 110 2 ) last week . Fill in slot CB Cortland Finnegan had trouble staying with Doug Baldwin ( 8 82 ) and Luke Willson ( 4 54 ) . Although I do believe Carolina will win this game , I think Michael Floyd and Larry Fitzgerald could have big box scores on the other side . Palmer would stand to benefit . . . . Despite a healthier Andre Ellington , David Johnson remained the Cardinals ' every down back in last Saturday ' s win over Green Bay , logging 88 of the snaps and 21 touches compared to Ellington ' s three touches on 11 of the downs . The Panthers have played mediocre run defense over their last six games , ceding 438 yards and three touchdowns on 105 carries ( 4 . 17 YPC ) to opposing running backs . Although he flopped as a DFS play last week , Johnson maintains the highest usage projection among running backs on the Conference Championship slate , and his matchup isn ' t quite as daunting as it may seem . Johnson offers particularly big PPR upside against a Panthers defense that allowed the NFL ' s second most receptions ( 110 ) to running backs this season .
