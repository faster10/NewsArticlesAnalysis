" Hopefully from a grit standpoint of never giving up , I don t think you can become a complete team until you have one of those types of games , " Bowles said . " The previous six games that we won , we were basically winning pretty good and we didn t have any pressure packed type games where we had to come from behind . So to come back and finally have success and win one of those games really says a lot hopefully about the growth of our team . "
