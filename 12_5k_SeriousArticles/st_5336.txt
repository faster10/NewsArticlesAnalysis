( On Lockett s second touchdown , he carried defenders into the end zone ) He bowled over defenders . In his college film , he s a very aggressive kid , that s why he s such a good returner . That was a really exciting run , to see him take advantage of the opportunity . He s so quick , that he can catch guys when they re not quite ready for the hit . He got physical on him at the goal line , and it was pretty cool .
