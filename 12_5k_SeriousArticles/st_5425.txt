Be mindful of both what you choose to eat and the amount you consume . Visualize your plate as having three sections : fan out lean protein in one third ( we recommend 6 oz . of protein for males and 4 oz . for females ) , fill one third with non starchy vegetables and the remaining one third with starchy foods like casserole and stuffing . Eat slowly and do not go for seconds or thirds . After your meal , redirect your attention to great conversation and spending time with loved ones .
