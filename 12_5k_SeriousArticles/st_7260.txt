In November , Amazon changed that . You can now buy a Kindle book as a gift . Recently I tested this by purchasing a holiday gift for a friend . She reported that obtaining my gift was easy she got an e mail notification of the gift , clicked a link in the e mail , clicked a link on the Amazon site to accept the gift , and then was able to download the book to her Kindle . This process also works for people who use the free Kindle smartphone or tablet apps , rather than the Kindle device .
