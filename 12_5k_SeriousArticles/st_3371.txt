Clattenburg does not play it safe . He runs wide when it would be easier to run down the middle of the pitch and so stay closer to the action and he does so for one simple reason . Because by running wide he gives himself a better angle of vision to see what is actually going on in the penalty area when a referee running just behind the players is more likely to have his view obscured something we saw this weekend in the case of Oliver and Phil Dowd on Monday night .
