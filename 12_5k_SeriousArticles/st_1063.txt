In the first meeting , Kansas City built a 27 6 lead in the second quarter at Houston before coasting to an easy victory . The Chiefs later lost running back Jamaal Charles for the season due to a torn ACL and have successfully replaced him with second year player Charcandrick West , who finished with 634 yards and four touchdowns . West may be a step down from Charles , but he has still been fulfilling a much needed role to help Alex Smith and the offense during their successful run .
