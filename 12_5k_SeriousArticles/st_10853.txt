The city was having some obvious financial issues , so they hired an emergency city manager , and they made a decision to switch the city water supply , Brockovich said . Everybody s water quallity is different , so you can t just willy nilly switch water systems . So they switched from the Detroit water , which is from Lake Huron , to the Flint River water , which is very corrosive . What happened was , when it hit the system , it caused all the lead , the iron , the maganese , and the copper to leach out from the pipes and all that lead was delivered to residents in their tap .
