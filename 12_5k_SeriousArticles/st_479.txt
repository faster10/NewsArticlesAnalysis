Brits have greater longevity than Americans , and the British health care system , while far from perfect , is indescribably better than ours . In my visits to the United Kingdom , I ' ve noticed that just about anyone who can afford private health insurance buys it , which allows Brits to supplement their free , government provided health care . That means there ' s a baseline of care that every person receives , and if you want something faster or better , you pay for it yourself .
