Supporting turns are all solid , with special notice to the always lovely Rashida Jones as Ellie , the female bird nerd who captures Brad ' s interest , and Anjelica Huston as the comically and aptly named Annie Auklet . Dianne Weist and Brian Dennehy are perfectly cast as Brad ' s parents . If there ' s ever been a non related trio that looks more like a real family , I ' ll eat my special birding hat . Kidding . I don ' t have one . . . yet .
