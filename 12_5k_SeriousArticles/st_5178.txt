This decision was not about being aggressive . This decision was about Coughlin s absolute distrust of his defense . He looked at the two options and decided he would rather trust Eli Manning with the ball in his hands , fourth and 2 from the Jets 4 yard line , to provide a 17 point lead rather than entrust his defense to protect a 13 point lead in the final 8 : 50 . Coughlin wanted to end the game right there , though he s made a living of adding onto leads and not being obsessed with ending something before it can be ended .
