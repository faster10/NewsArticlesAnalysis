Here , Colbert plays on his Catholicism again ? by confessing not quite sins to his faithful audience . For instance : the way he gets angry when people don t care about the difference between sci fi and fantasy , the fact that sometimes he doesn t write his own jokes , and his deep and abiding love of ? The Notebook . On one level , it s a clever repackaging of the host s monologue , replacing the news of the day with Colbert s thoughts and feelings , but it still suffers from the same visual inertness . Hopefully the content of Colbert s Midnight Confessions will improve as much as his ? Late Show ? already has .
