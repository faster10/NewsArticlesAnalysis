Returning to Globes stage after a three year absence , Gervais was semi recondite , not all that cruel about any particular actors , but thankfully still pointed . He opened with a good Sean Penn crack and an avowal to be nice , before dissing NBC for having no nominees at all . He then launched into a joke about Caitlyn Jenner and an incoherent bit about Jeffrey Tambor s balls , part of a bad trifecta of cracks about trans issues . Gervais righted himself by noting the corrupt power structures at play at the Globes , observing that film stars will show up if they have a chance to win a Globe , particularly if the film company has already paid for the victory . He ended his opening on a strong note : If you win tonight , please remember , no one cares as much about the award as you do . This was an injunction that was promptly forgotten , though to be fair , many of the people who won Globes were so unexpected , you can forgive them for a little excitement .
