Republicans are confused : Do they nominate a moderate with wider appeal or a " true conservative " loyal to the party ' s principles ? The way that those on the far right see it , they ' ve failed twice with a moderate nominee ( Sen . John McCain of Arizona in 2008 , former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney in 2012 ) . If the party nominates another moderate in 2016 ( former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , Ohio Gov . John Kasich , former New York Gov . George Pataki , etc . ) , and loses again , that faction will continue to delude itself into thinking that the GOP must nominate a rigid conservative to win .
