" The marriage part is the most interesting to me , " Russell said . " I love the idea of this arranged marriage , how they are a couple . I love the idea that ( Elizabeth ) is stunted emotionally , and after all these years , only now , she may be ready to open up and be in a real relationship with him . You get to see her so dominant and adventurous sexually outside of her marriage , but at home she ' s so reserved and pulled in . I like the complicated aspect of her in that way . "
