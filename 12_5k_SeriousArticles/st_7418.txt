Arnold : Yes ! It helps when I ' m not stressed or when you accept it . When you accept my Tourette ' s , I don ' t tic as much . But when you stare or ask lots of questions , I get really stressed and the Tourette ' s gets worse and I go all over the place . A lot of the time , it really stinks , because I can ' t do anything . I like to go to a room and go off by myself . But if that ' s not an option , I try to be really quiet and concentrate on something that keeps me focused . I play a game in my head or think about something . I have to distract my mind from things that set it off , like stress or bullying .
