Well , we ' ll recall he won a Heisman and was the first overall pick . He tore his knee in a playoff game with the Cincinnati Bengals and was never really the same guy after that , until a few good years with the Cardinals . With a loss on Sunday , he ' d be a part of one playoff win in his 13 NFL seasons . Not a terrible career by any means , but he ' d probably be remembered somewhere between Drew Bledsoe and Vinny Testaverde .
