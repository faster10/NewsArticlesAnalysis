I think they re very funny . I wake up every day and laugh at the latest thing Donald has tweeted because he s losing it . We need a commander in chief , not a Twitterer in chief , Cruz said . We need someone with judgment and the temperament to keep this country safe . I don t know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way having his finger on the button . We re liable to wake up one morning and Donald , if he were president , would ve nuked Denmark .
