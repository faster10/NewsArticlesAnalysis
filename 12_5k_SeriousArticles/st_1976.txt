It ' s true that I am a girl , and girls face some challenges in our society . For example , I can ' t stay a late hour at work . But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim putting the scarf on my head is something that I love . To many foreigners , it might seem to be against women ' s freedom , but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it , it becomes part of her self esteem , her self confidence and her protection each day . I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy , enjoying their choices and freedom .
