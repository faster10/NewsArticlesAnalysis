Neither of these are likely . The first would require that Roger Ailes allow himself to be humiliated as part of the scheme and that s something which people who know him believe would be very uncharacteristic . The second is not Trump s style at all . His campaign is clearly not playing by normal political rules . Indeed , it seems to be determined to explode every norm it encounters . The most likely reason for this is exactly what it seems : Trump doesn t like debating . He s ? complained about the length of them and threatened to boycott before ? so his beef with Megyn Kelly gave him a good excuse to get out of this one and dominate the news cycle in the process . And there s nothing Ailes can do about it .
