Now , you can argue this is a good thing or a bad thing , which is certainly a debatable point ( pun intended ) . How large a field is the optimum for any party ' s primary race is an interesting political science question , but this year it certainly appears the Democrats have hit the low end of the scale while the Republicans still are at all time highs . In fact , the biggest shakeup in the Democratic field happened when one man decided not to run , since all the polls had been including Joe Biden ' s name for months . Biden turning down a bid , coupled with the exits of Lincoln Chafee , Jim Webb and Lawrence Lessig , have left us with only three candidates and only two who realistically look viable . Martin O ' Malley will indeed be on the stage this Saturday night , but all eyes will really be on Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . If the Democrats were using the same rules as the Republican hosts , Clinton and Sanders would debate each other and O ' Malley would debate himself , a few hours earlier . Since that ' s pretty ridiculous to even suggest , O ' Malley will likely be invited to all the debates right up until he ends his run , no matter how dismal his poll numbers remain .
