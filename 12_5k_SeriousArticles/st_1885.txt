A : We want to hold on to the Senate . We want to win seats in the House and we want to win governorships . That ' s the goal . And I think there are a lot of places where we can do that . I think there are going to be a lot of competitive races . There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats , we think . Just looking at governors ' races , I think Virginia is a huge opportunity for a Democratic pickup . I think Florida and Ohio are huge opportunities for Democratic pickups . Those are just governors ' seats . In the Senate we feel very comfortable that can hold the Senate . And based on what I ' m seeing I think we feel comfortable that we can pick up seats in the House . So we ' re going to do what we can to support , we have some great Democratic campaign committees out there , at the DGA , the DCCC , the DSCC . They are doing the heavy lifting and at the DNC we are going to be helping them out however we can , while really helping to do what we can to help the president ' s agenda . It ' s all tied together . "
