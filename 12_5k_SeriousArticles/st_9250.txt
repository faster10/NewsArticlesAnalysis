The slogan , TRUSTED , is emblazoned on red , white and blue signs at every appearance and across the back of his campaign bus . And his closing message at debates , campaign rallies and speeches is almost always the same : It is now up to the men and women of this great state to make the determination , who do they trust ? Cruz this week in Fenton , Iowa . As voters , we ve been lied to over and over and over again . The stakes are too high for us to be burned again .
