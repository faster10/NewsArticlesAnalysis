So that ' s good for some new youngsters to be coming through and for us all to know each other and get on well . We have a GB training camp coming up in the next few weeks and that will be a good chance for us all to meet up . We ' re off to Italy , somewhere near Milan , and we ' re lucky that National Lottery funding helps us with those kind of camps . They ' re always so vital for us to train and practise together .
