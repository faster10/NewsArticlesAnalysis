Colbert , a practicing , dedicated Catholic , has long been interested in the role of religion in American life , particularly as one way of answering his Big Questions . Doctrinaire Christianity , after all , was one of the stronger parts of his ? Colbert Report ? character . And , in keeping with the generally enthusiastic , inquisitive spirit of his ? Late Show , All Up in Your Faith allows Colbert to dig into various religions , explaining their rituals and idiosyncrasies for a mass audience . Segments so far have featured Buddhism ( and the apparently tenuous succession of the Dalai Lama ) and Indianapolis Church of Cannabis , which somehow does not feature anyone smoking weed at their services .
