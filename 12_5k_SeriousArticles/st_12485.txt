" If the person wants to chat and talk , then just ask a question or two and let the person talk . If the person ' s not physically well enough to do a lot of talking , ask if they ' d like to hear a story about something that happened at work , or saying , ' Would you like me to read a story to you ? ' It ' s all about figuring out where the person is at and meeting them where they are . "
