If my choices are between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , I seriously would consider Bloomberg because otherwise I d have to move from this country , Karen Janssen said , adding that she knew very little about the former New York mayor but didn t trust Clinton and said she thought Trump was a bully . Isn t that the saddest thing that I would prefer to investigate a candidate ? I would be more inclined at this point in time to vote for Bloomberg than those other two candidates , without knowing anything about him ?
