The first quarter was loaded with oddities for the Thunder . Durant picked up two fouls in the first 4 : 30 , the first time that ' s happened in a regular season game since March 29 , 2009 ( or in any game since May 13 , 2011 ) . Westbrook scored 15 points , the most anyone has scored against Miami in any quarter all season . And the Thunder went a full quarter without trying a 3 pointer , the first time that ' s happened this season .
