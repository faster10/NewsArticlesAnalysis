Weir : Each month as it gets closer , I seem to change my mind if I ' m going to Rio . I want to do small targets first , really . I ' ll be 34 this year . I need to have an offish year so I can do what races I really want to do . But I ' m going to have a two year target , I think , because I think if I say yes , I ' m definitely in for Rio .
