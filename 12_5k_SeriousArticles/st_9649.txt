I ve written before about what it s like to be a female science fiction fan . My family supported my nerdiness , and in high school , I had a co ed group of like minded friends . But as a child , I was often the only girl interested in playing games of make believe that involved spaceships and aliens . I was tolerated . . . ? to a point . Once , a little boy yanked a stick from my hand and scolded me for trying to use it as a lightsaber . It would be better , he said , if instead I hid somewhere so I could be rescued . I agreed . We were in grade school ? but already conforming to the gender roles displayed for us in the movies we loved .
