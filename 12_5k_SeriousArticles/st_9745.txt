' It ' s about justification , what you stand for . When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go : " Yeah , but I ' m giving it back to you " . I didn ' t feel that way with this TV work . It ' s an easy gig . I don ' t like easy gigs . When I heard : " I liked your commentary last night " . I knew I was only talking bulls like the rest of them . Hopefully my bulls was a bit better . I wanted to do something that excited me . TV work didn ' t excite me .
