Implementing this plan would be straightforward . Instead of spreading conservation efforts thinly across large landscapes , the focus would shift to source sites . These are where 70 percent of the world ' s tigers live in just 6 percent of their current range . For example , there are 18 source sites in India , eight in Indonesia , six in Russia , three in both Malaysia and Nepal , two in Thailand and one in both Laos and Bangladesh . Protecting these sites would halt the decline in tigers and allow populations to recover .
