About the Texans : Houston looked dead and buried after a 44 26 loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 7 left them at 2 5 . That game also saw RB Arian Foster go down with a season ending Achilles injury . But the defense caught fire afterward with DE J . J . Watt ( league high 17 . 5 sacks ) playing especially well and possibly earning league defensive MVP honors for the third time . The offense was steady even though QBs Brian Hoyer , T . J . Yates and Brandon Weeden all rotated through the lineup down the stretch . However Sunday ' s injury to LT Duane Brown is a significant setback .
