Tragedy 2 : ? A family in New Jersey ? was trying to dig its way out when the chill became too much to handle . The mother and her children ? ages 1 and 3 ? huddled in the car with the engine running to keep warm . The kids father tried to clear the snow outside . But the tailpipe was clogged with snow , pushing deadly carbon monoxide gas into the car . When the father went to check on them , he could not wake them up . ( Lindsey Bever )
