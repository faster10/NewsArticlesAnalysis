I wouldn ' t call Trump stupid . He is an astute businessman and seems to be a facile grifter ( if his Trump University scam is any indication ) who has managed to go very far in a presidential campaign without benefit of any rhetorical elan . The linguistic flair we are accustomed to seeing in " snake oil " peddlers is missing entirely . Does Trump believe his fan base too slow witted to understand anything beyond " make this country great ? " If " yes , " is Trump correct in that assessment ? If " no , " why does he speak to his supporters as if they are children ?
