I can t think of anything to say negatively about Bernie Sanders but he surprised the hell out of me when he thought he could be president of the United States , and quite frankly he still surprises me , like nobody in politics ever has , Rangel said . I could say the same thing about my friend Donald Trump . I know his ego , and I know how much he loves himself . And it doesn t surprise me when he said he wanted to be president . Or Pope , for that matter . "
