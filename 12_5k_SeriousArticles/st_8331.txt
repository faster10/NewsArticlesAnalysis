Another Blazer people seem to worry about is Al Farouq Aminu and justifiably so . In his last five , he averaged just 8 . 4 points , 4 . 0 boards , 1 . 6 assists , 1 . 4 steals and 1 . 4 treys on 48 . 3 percent from the field . That s probably the expectation going forward , which is still 10th round value . His usage rate is back down to 13 . 4 in that span , which is much more like the Aminu of previous years . He still can do the little things , but his usage rate and efficiency off dribbles will make him the fifth option while he s on the court . He s kind of a cut candidate for a hot free agent , and I wouldn t touch in DFS right now .
