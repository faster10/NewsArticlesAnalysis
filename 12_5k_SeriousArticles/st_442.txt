Listening to the apocalyptic predictions of scientists , I fear for humanity s future . Yet then I read Christopher Booker or Nigel Lawson on the subject and say : Hang on a minute . Is the ice melting or not ? Is the temperature rising or not ? And even more fundamentally : Does CO2 cause warming or not ? Those of a sceptical bent look at the predictions made a few years ago and ask why they haven t materialised . For instance , we were told that there would be more hurricanes in the Caribbean ? but in recent years there have been fewer . Pacific islands that should have been under water by now have not seen the forecast rise in sea levels .
