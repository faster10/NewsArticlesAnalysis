From that point on , my life changed . I realized that I would not be getting my driver ' s license at 16 . I would not be getting a summer job to make money . Throughout high school , I was always careful about what I said in my circle of friends . When my friends would talk about going on vacations to other countries , I would feel so left out . I hated hearing them because it would bring me down . I wished that I had been born here . I wish I had been a U . S . citizen .
