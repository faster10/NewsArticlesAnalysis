Harrington is a different kind of thinker . This is an Irishman who chose to wear glasses even though he had 20 20 vision . He became an ambassador for the R A and then chose to try a belly putter when it decided to ban the anchored stroke . Most peculiar are his golf balls . He prefers to keep his eye trained on a black dot , and because he can ' t pick up and place his ball , he has his caddie place eight black dots so at least one of them is pointing toward him .
