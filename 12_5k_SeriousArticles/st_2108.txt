As an intelligence analyst at the CIA , I was privy to all the intelligence analysis on Iraq in the lead up to that war . My office covered the country analysis while other offices covered WMD and terrorism , but we read each other ' s work . I remember thinking at the time how paradoxical it was that we were working so hard to be thorough in our analysis for the president , but then he gave the public only a few pieces of raw intelligence reporting from a handful of sources as well as the administration ' s own judgments that did not reflect the complexity of our assessments .
