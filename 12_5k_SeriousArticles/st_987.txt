I know that a lot of you probably have stories about tenacious golfers from your own towns who made it to the U . S . Open one year . But the 17 year old from our town was pretty special . His name was Jack W . Nicklaus he didn ' t make the 36 hole cut at the Open that first year he qualified , but by three years later , in 1960 , at age 20 , he was paired in the final rounds with Ben Hogan . In 1962 he won the Open , the first of his 18 major championships . After qualifying in that first year , he would play in 44 consecutive U . S . Opens .
