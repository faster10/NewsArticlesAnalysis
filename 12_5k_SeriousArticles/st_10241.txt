HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN GETS NEW OFFICE , OLD SMELL . John Boehner left something for new House Speaker Paul Ryan to remember him by : the smell of his cigarette smoke . When the Wisconsin Republican inherited the speaker ' s office Friday , it still smelled of Boehner ' s cigarettes , which he was known to smoke frequently . " It ' s like when you get a rental car or a hotel room that ' s been smoked in you know someone has smoked in it , " Ryan , a fitness buff , joked to ABC News ' Martha Raddatz Friday . According to ABC ' s BENJAMIN SIEGEL , staffers are using a filtration machine to air out the speaker ' s office which boasts the best view of the Washington Mall in town before Ryan ' s arrival . http : abcn . ws 1N9HMBC
