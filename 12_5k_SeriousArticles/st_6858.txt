KAHN : The crowd applauded wildly then spontaneously began singing Mexico ' s national anthem . It was the news the government had been hoping to give since Joaquin Guzman , known by his nickname El Chapo or Shorty , escaped from the country ' s maximum security prison through a sophisticated nearly mile long tunnel . It was an elite group of Marines that stormed a home in the Pacific coast town of Los Mochis early Friday morning . A shootout ensued and five people were killed , but Guzman and another cartel leader managed to escape the home through a sewer tunnel , said Attorney General Arely Gomez Gonzalez at the late night press conference .
