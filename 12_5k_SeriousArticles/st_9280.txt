" Cannes likes to be seen as innovative , likes to be seen as embracing something new , " Turan observed . " But really the reason ' Up ' is opening the festival is not because it ' s animated , not because it ' s 3 D , it ' s . . . because it ' s a wonderful film . Festival organizers saw that , and I ' m sure they liked the fact that they could do something avant garde in terms of technique , but really it ' s a wonderful story , it ' s a terrific film and that ' s why it ' s opening .
