Enya : Musically it has to be something that I ' m comfortable to perform . Would we ever hear Enya with a guitar solo ? I say , " Never say never . " And there ' s a guitar solo on " My ! My ! Time Flies . " This happened because it suited the song . It ' s always got to sound like me because it ' s my voice and there ' s always this little sense of melancholy that is inherent in my melodies . I think that ' s because of my Irish culture .
