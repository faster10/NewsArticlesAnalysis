The first few months , she rarely ate out , if at all , and cut out fast food in favor of salmon or grilled chicken with vegetables . At school , she ate a protein shake or bar for breakfast , a banana , apple , pear or some clementines for a snack , more fruit and a low calorie frozen dinner for lunch . She used a calorie counter app on her phone to track her intake , sticking to about 1 , 500 to 1 , 700 calories per day based on how fast or slow she was losing weight .
