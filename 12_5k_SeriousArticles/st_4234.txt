" Django Unchained " is Tarantino ' s latest exercise in genre bending audacity , an antic ripsnorter folding in most of what its director knows and loves about spaghetti westerns , 1970s blaxploitation thrillers and his own ribald , recklessly violent body of work . Its title character , played by Jamie Foxx , is a slave bought and freed by a drolly effective German bounty hunter ( Christoph Waltz ) , who agrees to help Django emancipate his wife , Broomhilda ( Kerry Washington ) , from a decadent plantation owner ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) .
