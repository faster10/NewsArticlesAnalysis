Good question . All of these thoughts went through my head when I felt my hamstring go 15 minutes into my first game in the Olympics . In a matter of seconds , I had to weigh both options . Do I push through and maybe do more damage to my leg and maybe hurt the team in the process , ' cause I ' m not 100 ( and in the worst case scenario , be out for the rest of the tournament ) : or do I take myself out and give our team the chance with a healthy body in there ?
