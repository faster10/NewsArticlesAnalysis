As STS 7 blasted off in 1983 , I was finishing up my doctorate in physics astrophysics , to be more precise just as Ride had done a few years earlier . Most of my classmates were men , and I often felt out of place . Whether she shared that sense of being an outsider or not doesn ' t matter the important thing was that , thanks to her notoriety as a NASA astronaut , I found out about one more precious role model , someone in whose steps I could hope to follow . ( OK , not the astronaut part I am far too chicken for that . ) Ride made success seem attainable , even in the men only world of physics .
