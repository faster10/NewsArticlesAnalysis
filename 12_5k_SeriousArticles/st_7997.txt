Skinny : Justin Coleman was in the concussion protocol last week . Chances are , he ll be back by the time the Patriots play on the 16th . He seemed like he was improving in Week 16 , with Fitzpatrick completing just 2 of 5 passes for 9 yards against him . He wasn t getting torched as much as Johnson , that s for sure . So if he s back that might help the situation . Plus , of the team s likely division round opponents , only Cincy has multiple threats . And , if Chandler Jones returns , the Pats pass rush will also improve to help out the secondary .
