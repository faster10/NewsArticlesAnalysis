For more recent examples , just think about how anti segregation protests in the South in the mid 1950s widened into national protests against patriarchal capitalist heteronormative white supremacy only a decade later . There is a direct line between Rosa Parks success and the prominence of Malcolm X and Angela Davis . The historical examples are manifold . Remember a generation ago the glasnost in Russia led to mass protests and the fall of the USSR . In South Africa , the apartheid reformer de Klerk negotiated an end to that regime . Gorbachev and de Klerk had only intended to reform the system . Perhaps it s worth recalling that President Lincoln was insistent in his inaugural address that he would not free any slaves in slave states . His election accelerated a struggle that was already in existence . Lincoln s election tilted the balance of power toward emancipation when half a million slaves ran to the Union army s lines , and the war became about slavery and not just preserving the Union .
