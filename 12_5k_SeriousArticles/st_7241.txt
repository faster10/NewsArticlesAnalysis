Lynch : Oh , absolutely . It was when I was doing improv at Second City . You ' re doing these sets afterwards , and sometimes it ' s like the bigger choice you make , the bigger you fall on your face . I think my work started to seem profound when I started making huge choices . Yes , some of them were too huge , where you lose people and you lose reality , but I think you have to go that far in order to know what you can do what ' s inside of you .
