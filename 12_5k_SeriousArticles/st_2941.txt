Hamilton adds with a smile : ' This is the first time there has been so many people in the room . I am excited about moving forward . And I am excited to be here . I hope we can have a good weekend . I already said everything in the press release . Trust is a big word and that is not something I would apply to racing on the track . Me and Nico have been racing a long time and we set a foundation in karting a long time ago and that is what we work from . '
