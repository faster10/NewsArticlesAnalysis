Well , I would suggest that Secretary Clinton look at the last Quinnipiac poll , which has me leading Trump by a significantly higher margin than she does , and that s true of other polls as well I think we can do better against Trump or other Republicans than can Secretary Clinton The No . 1 reason I think is that the issues we are talking about , the disappearing middle class , massive levels of wealth and income inequality , the fact that Wall Street s greed has had a huge impact on the lives of millions of people . People want leadership now to stand up to the big money interests , protect working people . That s what I ve done my whole life .
