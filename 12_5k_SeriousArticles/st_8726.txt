" ' I mean that I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience , ' " Copeland wrote , recalling his daughter ' s words . " ' I am blessed to be able to have a challenge that not many others get to have . I am blessed to have the capacity to share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality of someone else ' s life . I ' m blessed to be different . ' "
