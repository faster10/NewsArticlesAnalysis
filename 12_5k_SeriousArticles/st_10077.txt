Being named poet laureate for the inauguration personally validates and stitches together several ideals against which I have long measured America , since the days of watching " My Three Sons " and " The Dick Van Dyke Show " reruns . For one , the essence of the American dream : how a little Cuban American kid on the margins of mainstream America could grow up with confidence , have the opportunity to become an engineer thanks to the hard work of his parents who could barely speak English , and then go on , choosing to become a poet who is now asked to speak to , for and about the entire nation .
