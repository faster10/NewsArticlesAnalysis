Oil prices fell by 47 in 2015 and are expected to decline , on an annual average , by another 27 in 2016 . However , from their current lows , a gradual recovery in oil prices is expected over the course of the year , for several reasons . First , the sharp oil price drop in early 2016 does not appear fully warranted by fundamental drivers of oil demand and supply , and is likely to partly reverse . Second , high cost oil producers are expected to sustain persistent losses and increasingly make production cuts that are likely to outweigh any additional capacity coming to the market . Third , demand is expected to strengthen somewhat with a modest pickup in global growth .
