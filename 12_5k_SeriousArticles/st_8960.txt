" It is easy to see that we become an issue in the campaign , and not in a way that serves the U . S . interests , " Markey said . " There could be a competition to show who is least willing to kowtow to the Americans . And then when they negotiate in that way , you never get a BSA . Then you have an Iraq situation , where we have to leave . But for Afghanistan , it ' s more dangerous . It ' s even more unstable and the regional consequences are of greater concern to India , Pakistan and even China . "
