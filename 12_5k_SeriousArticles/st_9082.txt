Kyrgios set a third round meeting with No . 6 seed Tomas Berdych with a three set win over Pablo Cuevas , and also ? as he often can ? won with a bit of controversy : Mid way through the match he left the court to change his shorts , which somehow had been tailored with closed pockets . It was a circus , Kyrgios said on court after , somehow arriving on court with pocket less shorts . When Kyrgios left court , Cuevas complained to chair umpire Carlos Ramos that he was gone for too long .
