Hekmati , a former Marine and dual American Iranian citizen born in Arizona , was arrested in Iran in late 2011 while on a trip to see his grandmothers . The Iranian government claimed he was a spy and used a videotaped confession to support their case ? though Hekmati s family and U . S . officials denied he was a spy and said the confession was coerced . Hekmati s father , now gravely ill , told ABC News after his arrest that the Iranian claims were a bunch of lies .
