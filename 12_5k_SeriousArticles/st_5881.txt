Steven Van Zandt : It was interesting to witness our own extremes with the Apollo Show and the SXSW show . We went from emphasizing soul music at the Apollo to flipping 180 degrees for a Woody Guthrie celebration at SXSW . It was quite interesting to have that reinforced and have it be totally integrated in the work not doing either extreme as a sort of specialty , gimmicky show , but actually having those roots so firmly planted in the material and to be reminded how wide and varied the identity of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band actually is at this point . It ' s some kind of example of Americana in all of its forms .
