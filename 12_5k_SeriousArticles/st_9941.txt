When : 1993 Who : American Hugo Vihlen Where : Across the North Atlantic , from Newfoundland to Cornwall , England The boat : The Father ' s Day , the world ' s tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in , was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep , and couldn ' t stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water . Likened to a space shuttle , the boat is made from fiberglass enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS , a water maker , VHF radio and SSB Ham radio . Legacy : Aboard the Father ' s Day , Vihlen became the world ' s first " micro yachtsman , " but it wasn ' t all smooth sailing the boat was surrounded by whales , nearly capsized , and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105 day voyage .
