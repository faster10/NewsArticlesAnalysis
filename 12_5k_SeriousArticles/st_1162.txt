From generation to generation , some Igbo have passed down various versions of a migration story framed around Jacob , a patriarch of Judaism . A popular version of the narrative holds that Gad , the seventh son of Jacob , had three sons who settled in present day southeastern Nigeria , which is predominantly inhabited by the Igbo . Those sons , Eri , Arodi and Areli ( as mentioned in the book of Genesis ) , are said to have fathered clans , established kingdoms and founded towns still in existence in southeastern Nigeria today , including Owerri , Umuleri , Arochukwu and Aguleri .
