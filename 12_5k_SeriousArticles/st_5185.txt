Hopes of being able to pass the constitutional amendment bill for the goods and services tax ( GST ) looked a bit brighter after Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former prime minister Manmohan Singh to tea to discuss the way forward . While neither side made any commitment , other than to meet again , this was the first formal meetings of leaders . Finance minister Arun Jaitley and parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu were present at the meeting . Though the BJP has said it has the support of 30 political parties , the Bill cannot be passed in the Rajya Sabha without Congress support .
