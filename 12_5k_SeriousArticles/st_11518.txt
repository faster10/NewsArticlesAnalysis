" Catching Fire , " which stars current It girl ( and Oscar winner for last year ' s " Silver Linings Playbook " ) Jennifer Lawrence , boasts a relatively slim budget compared to most mega blockbusters . Lionsgate spent 130 million on the film a major increase from the original " Hunger Games ' " 78 million budget . For context , here are the budgets for untested franchise launchpads that tried to get off the ground earlier this year : " The Lone Ranger " ( 215 million ) , " Jack the Giant Slayer " ( 195 million ) , " Pacific Rim " ( 190 million ) , " White House Down " ( 150 million ) , " Turbo " ( 135 million ) . None of those films earned , in their entire domestic runs , what " Catching Fire " earned in its first two days .
