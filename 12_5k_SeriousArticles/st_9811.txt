As for how the Cowboys have reacted to Hardy ' s incident , I think they ' re just kind of , saving face a little bit , Romanowski said . They tend to do that down there in Dallas . It looked bad to me , at the end of the day a tiger does not change its stripes . He is who he is . You want a guy who ' s mean and nasty and physical , and is going to get after people and go get the quarterback , but you want it to be out on the field . Not on the sidelines against your own people .
