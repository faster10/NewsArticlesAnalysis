HB : Ms . Merkel separated the country into those who support her on this issue and those who don t . And this gap is widening . Because those people who don t agree on this kind of policy are not being heard , their concerns are not being taken seriously . The Germans don t really see Angela Merkel as the Person of the Year . Well , from my point of view , and from the point of view of the Alternative for Germany . Merkel has been in power for 10 years 10 years is enough . I say , Merkel is not the person of the year she is the un person of the year . She should pack her things and go .
