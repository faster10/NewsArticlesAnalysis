OK , so we borrowed that last line from " The Beverly Hillbillies " theme song . Same difference . In fact , during " Andy Griffith ' s " run of 1960 68 , " Hillbillies " was twice the nation ' s top ranked show . The other years ' Nielsen titles went to " Gunsmoke , " to " Wagon Train , " and ( three times ) to " Bonanza . " Which just goes to show how much Americans wanted to be anywhere rather than Here and Now .
