He might try a more surgical attack on Trump and Ben Carson , especially on foreign policy . He showed real fire when decrying Trump s attempt to lay responsibility for 9 11 at President George W .

Catching Trump in obvious errors ( e . g . Trump thinks Russia is taking care of the Islamic State ) may knock Trump , already touchy about losing first place in Iowa polls , off balance and remind voters that Bush actually does understand the world .
