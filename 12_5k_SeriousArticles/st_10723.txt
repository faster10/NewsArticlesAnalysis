" The prison is divided into zones with about 1 , 000 people in each zone , " she said . " In each zone there are small huts , with between 150 and 250 people in each , where they are locked up at night . In each hut there are only about 100 beds , so most people sleep on the bare floor . At one point Martin told me there were so many prisoners in the hut that they had to sleep stacked next to each other on the floor . "
