After I first learned of Malala , I couldn ' t stop thinking about her . Yes , I was more serious about my education and understood its importance now , but I wanted to become an activist and do something . I became co president of my school ' s club School Girls Unite , a group that sponsors the education of 66 girls in Mali and lobbies Congress annually to increase foreign aid for education . I also became involved with the International Day of the Girl Child as the Day of the Girl U . S . youth outreach coordinator so I could speak to more girls about issues like education .
