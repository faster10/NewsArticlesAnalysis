Repasky , who now lives in Danville , Pennsylvania , and is an artist , often goes back to this album . " When I hear the music , it brings me to the point of realizing that I had experienced life and I could be alive , and it brings me great joy in knowing that . " The part of " Nights in White Satin " where the words " I love you " are repeated always moves Repasky , even 40 years later . iReport . com : Watch Repasky tell his story
