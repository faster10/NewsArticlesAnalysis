? ? Cam Newton vs . Peyton Manning : The starting quarterbacks almost own the Super Bowl stage ? it has been so since Joe Namath s guarantee ? and we love a contrast . So there could hardly be a greater quarterback matchup than Carolina s young , brash , hip , black Newton against Denver s ancient and extremely white Manning . Only one of them calls himself Superman and is dabbin after touchdowns . The other one is so old and hobbly , you half expect Broncos executive John Elway , 55 , to name himself the starter Sunday . This is a New School Old School , Future Past contrast with the added heft of it possibly or even likely being the final game of Manning s storied career . But it is the black white thing that will prove irresistible and be seized on as an overarching theme . Erudite analysts and columnists will extrapolate and see this quarterback contrast as a metaphor for race relations in America , if only to appear intellectual and not bound by the narrow constraints of mere games .
