I think , generally , most people can ' t maintain anything that ' s particularly strict for very long . I watch people trying and failing to do that a lot . Look , if you have something coming up like a vacation , and you want to look great and you ' re doing it for a specific reason , or in my case , if they take your clothes away from you at work every couple of weeks . But I don ' t know if it ' s really right for your body to jump up and down weight wise .
