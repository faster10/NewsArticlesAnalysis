Wary , perhaps , of being relegated to what might have in fact been a profitable career of snarling and firing guns every few years , Rickman stepped back into smaller features , deploying his talents instead in period pieces and romantic films , and when it suited him , riffing on his own pop culture image . He was brilliant in Galaxy Quest as a character inspired by Leonard Nimoy , a classically trained stage actor typecast as an alien in a cheesy sci fi show and reduced to spouting his tired catchphrase at department store ribbon cuttings . ( His best moment in the movie : challenging co star Tim Allen to find the motivation of a marauding rock monster and accusing him of never being serious about " the craft . " ) And perhaps no one else could have so beautifully captured the hilarious over the top melancholy of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the underappreciated Hitchhiker ' s Guide to the Galaxy either one cannot help but smile when Marvin first descends from the ceiling warning everyone in Rickman ' s voice that he ' s feeling very depressed . Our instinct to immediately love an Alan Rickman character worked against us in Love Actually when we couldn ' t believe what a heartless prat he was being to his adoring wife Emma Thompson , but our faith that there was more to him than the obvious notes was rewarded when we saw at the end that he was clearly trying to atone for his terrible mistake for the sake of their family just as we hoped we would under the same circumstances .
