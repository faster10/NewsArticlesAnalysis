Much to the chagrin of old school sexists , it s not as acceptable as it used to be to use blatantly sexist slurs against women . So instead of saying a woman must be on the rag , a man will call a woman emotional . Instead of bitchy , he ll use bossy or strident . In some ways it s great that slurs aren t tolerated in the same way they were years ago . But it also means that women have to constantly wonder if the words coming our way are specifically gendered .
