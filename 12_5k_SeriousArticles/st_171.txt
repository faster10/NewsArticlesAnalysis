Koch won t endorse in primary : It sounds like Cruz , Rubio and the other Republicans shouldn t count on an endorsement from one of the most influential figures in conservative politics in the primary season . Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch told USA Today he has no plans to support anybody in the primary . Asked what he wants to hear from GOP contenders vying for his support , Koch replied : It s not only what they say . If they start saying things we think are beneficial overall and will change the trajectory of the country , then that would be good , but we have to believe also they ll follow through on it , and by and large , candidates don t do that . Koch did say he s likely to help a Republican presidential candidate in the general election .
