" These shootings are happening in Gun Free Zones , " the commenter said . " The shooters know that the people there will have no way of defending themselves and that is why these tragedies are happening in these zones . We need to give the teacher ' s defense so it will discourage these psychopaths from shooting there . There is great evidence that greater gun control means more gun violence ( because the bad guys still get guns and they know the good guys are unarmed ) . "
