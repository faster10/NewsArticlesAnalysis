Anyway , Hillary Clinton is not the point . She happened to be standing there this week , pinned on the horns of a minor but unappetizing dilemma : She had to make disapproving noises about the Saudi regime after the execution of Sheikh Nimr , a prominent critic of the Saudi monarchy and the leader of a religious minority who had specifically disavowed violence . Then she had to look grave for a few seconds , until the media and the public lost interest and it was back to business as usual . That business is the symbiotic relationship between American policy makers and politicians of both parties and Saudi oil , money and power , which goes back many decades and is rarely discussed in public .
