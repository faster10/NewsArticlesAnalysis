What Turkey fears most is that the United States and Russia could come to an agreement over the future of Syria that would marginalize Turkey ' s role . Such an agreement would very likely include the continuation of the Assad regime , a government that Ankara is committed to overturning , as well as , to Ankara ' s horror , some sort of semi Autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria . Russia ' s Putin has already signaled that he would be in favor of such a state as part of a looser , federal structure in Syria that would grant significant autonomy to the Kurds and possibly other Syrian minority groups .
