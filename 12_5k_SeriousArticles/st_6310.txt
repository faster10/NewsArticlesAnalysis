We ll see when we get to that point , said James , who has signed three contracts with Nike . If it makes sense for both parties , then we ll do it . If not , then we won t . We ve done a great job of building my brand to this point . We want to just continue it . If it makes sense for us to have a Team LeBron , or whatever the name will be , we ll take a look at it and we ll go from there . It s a partnership between us . It s not an endorsement deal . It s a partnership where we always come together and figure out the best way possible for both brands to be successful .
