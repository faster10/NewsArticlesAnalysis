With that in mind , let s examine what I consider to be the defining drive of the day for the Patriots and Tom Brady . It started at their own 2 yard line , after Danny Amendola s 2 yard personal foul penalty ( more on that later ) . Center Bryan Stork was out of the game at the time with an ankle injury , forcing rookie David Andrews into action . With the Patriots leading 7 3 , and with the previous two New England drives ending in punts , the situation was not ideal when Brady took the shotgun snap in an empty backfield in the middle of his own end zone .
