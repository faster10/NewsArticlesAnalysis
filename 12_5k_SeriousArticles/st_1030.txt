Cemetery sites have been evolving since the 1940s where the dead were buried in graves on flat land to the 1960s where feng shui dictated that some graves should be positioned on high hillsides near villages . Towards the 1980s , columbarium became the preferred place for the dead . Traditionally housed in temples , they offer locker style compartments for people to place the ashes of their loved ones . Columbarium also took the form of buildings however , in recent years , people have objected to living in such close proximity to them and their rising prices ( private columbaria costs in Hong Kong range between US 645 to US 25 , 604 ) . As a result , illegal columbaria have mushroomed in various areas around Hong Kong .
