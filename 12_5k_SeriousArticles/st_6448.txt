The second reason I picked the Mets is , I m going to guess , purely emotional . In a couple of ways . As you know , I grew up a Royals fan . Nobody loved the Royals from 1976 through 2002 or 03 more than I did . But at some point all the losses and all the poor ( by my lights ) decisions wore me down enough where I no longer took any pleasure in the occasional victories . I did believe the worm would turn eventually , and wondered how I would feel about that . As it turned out , not much . Now my feelings feel . . . neutral , I would say . Which wouldn t necessarily lead me to picking against them , but certainly doesn t have me favoring them .
