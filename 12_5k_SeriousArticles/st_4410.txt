Gore hasn ' t been great of late , but he ' s an excellent price and should have a good opportunity this week with Paul Posluszny ( broken hand ) out . Gore had 16 . 9 FanDuel points in Week 13 at Pittsburgh thanks to a receiving touchdown , and he has at least three receptions for 46 yards in two of his past three games . I expect him to get about 20 touches in this game , and the Jacksonville Jaguars defense should be vulnerable against the run with Posluszny out .
