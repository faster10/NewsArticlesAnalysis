Ted Cruz is particularly ill equipped to play this role . He is actually more of a demagogue than an ideologue . So he has changed his views on immigration to compete with Trump ? and raised the ante by promising that none of the deported 11 million will ever be allowed back in the country . Instead of demonstrating the humane instincts of his Christian faith ? a faith that motivated abolition and the struggle for civil rights ? Cruz is presenting the crueler version of a pipe dream .
