In truth , Paris has had its share of ups and downs in the past 50 years . The city began a period of reinvention with the opening of the Pompidou Centre , followed by a vigorous period of reconstruction leading up to the 200th anniversary of the Republic in 1989 , which saw the building of the famous Louvre pyramid , the opening of the Musee d ' Orsay and the Arche de la Defense . And the city had pointed the way towards urban regeneration with the redevelopment of Les Halles .
