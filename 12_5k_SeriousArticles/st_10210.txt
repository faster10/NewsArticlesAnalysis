The former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington has called for British people to inform security services if they suspect their neighbours maybe extremists . Dame Stella , who supports the Government ' s controversial ' snoopers ' charter ' , said people need to be more alert because it is impossible for security services to spot every threat . She called for a wartime vigilance and for people to be the Government ' s ' eyes and ears ' following the killing of Lee Rigby . The 78 year old , who was MI5 ' s first female Director General , said : ' The community has the responsibility to act as the eyes and ears , as they did during the war where there were all these posters up saying the walls have ears and the enemy is everywhere . ' There have often been indications in the community , whether it ' s Muslim or anywhere else , that people are becoming extremists and spouting hate phrases . '
