" Police officers don ' t start their days expecting or wanting something like this to occur in the performance of their duties , " PBA president Patrick Lynch said in a statement . " The ME ' s report indicates that Mr Garner was a man with serious health problems so there will have to be a complete and thorough analysis of all the factors that played a part in this tragedy . We believe , however , that if he had not resisted the lawful order of the police officers placing him under arrest , this tragedy would not have occurred . "
