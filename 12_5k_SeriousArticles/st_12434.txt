Last summer while on assignment at the Aspen Ideas Festival , I interviewed Ben Waber , an MIT research scientist and CEO of Sociometric Solutions . Waber and his colleagues at MIT and Harvard have been engaged in a process called " reality mining " analyzing the constant trail of data that we leave behind about ourselves via e mail , instant messaging patterns , phone logs and meeting information to come up with insights about work productivity and satisfaction . He helps companies translate these insights into concrete ways to enhance people ' s experience at work , as well as to increase productivity .
