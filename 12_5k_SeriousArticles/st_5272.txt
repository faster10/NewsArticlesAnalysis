S . and other major states to reinforce the global taboo against nuclear testing by pressuring hold out nations to sign or ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty banning such testing . Only India Pakistan , and North Korea have not signed the treaty , he notes . And while China , Egypt , Iran , Israel and the U . S . have signed , none has yet voted to ratify the accord .
