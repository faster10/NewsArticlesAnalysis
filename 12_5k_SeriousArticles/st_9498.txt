My first meeting with Queen Elizabeth II occurred in May 1993 when she invited my husband Nick and me to take tea in Buckingham Palace . This was neither a " state visit " or an " official visit " it was a sui generis , carefully orchestrated meeting at head of state level between two countries with a troubled past seeking , in a symbolic way , to begin reconciling . We both understood the symbolism of that moment , captured in photographs of the two women heads of state smiling side by side .
