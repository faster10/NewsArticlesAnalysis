As Jack , a long haired boy oblivious to the outside world , the nine year old melts your heart . But there ' s also a precocity to his performance , a girlishness that deftly conveys the complete lack of male interaction Jack ' s had in his life . Tremblay , in short , is a revelation , and more than a match for his on screen mum ? Brie Larson , who did score an Oscar nomination , for Best Actress . ( The film also received nods for Best Picture , Best Director ? Lenny Abrahamson ? and Best Adapted Screenplay . ) ?
