What were they thinking ? In such a lopsided loss , it ' s difficult to think one play would make much of a difference , but the Cowboys wasted a coach ' s replay challenge on the final play of the first quarter . Greg Olsen made a 24 yard catch on third and 10 while being blanketed by Brandon Carr . Using the extra commercial time in between quarters , Jason Garrett chose to throw the challenge flag when it was clear the catch was clean . The Cowboys are now 2 3 in challenges this year .
