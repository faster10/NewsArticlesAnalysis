Given how consistent both players have been , it seems impossible that they ' ve faced each other only three times , and just once since 2008 . Ferrer prevailed in two of those meetings , including a four set win at the 2008 US Open . Neither man does much damage with his serve , so you can expect the obligatory long , exciting rallies . Give Ferrer a significant edge because , unlike Hewitt ( and as his seeding confirms ) , he ' s still a full timer on the ATP Tour .
