In Luke ' s Gospel , he astonishes his disciples by eating " a piece of broiled fish " as well as swallowing honey . For the most part , his appearances retain a dreamlike quality , suggesting that Jesus didn ' t want anyone to assume that whatever happened to him occurred in ordinary time and space . He did not , like Lazarus , simply get up and walk from the burial crypt and resume life on the street . This is the Resurrection , not the Great Resuscitation .
