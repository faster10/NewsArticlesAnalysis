What it means : There ' s no shame in losing to Denver the Broncos appear on their way to a fifth consecutive AFC West title . What ' s disappointing is the Bears had a legitimate chance to tie the game in the fourth quarter , but they failed to capitalize on offense . Cutler and company must bounce back if Chicago hopes to knock off Green Bay on Thanksgiving . At 4 6 , the Bears still have a slight chance at an NFC wild card . If they fall to 4 7 , forget about it .
