I made one slip up , the governor said at a televised news conference at the state capitol in Augusta , organised after the remarks became public Thursday evening . I made a one word slip up . I might have made many slip ups . I was going impromptu , and my brain didn t catch up to my mouth . Instead of saying Maine women , I said white women . I m not going to apologise to the Maine women for that , because if you go to Maine , you ll see that we re essentially 95 per cent white .
