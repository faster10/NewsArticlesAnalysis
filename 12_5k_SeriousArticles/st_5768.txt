Francis s message of religious tolerance will resonate in Kenya , where there have been three major attacks in the past two years by the Somalia based Muslim extremist organisation al Shabaab . In April more than 150 students ? most of them Christians ? at Garissa University , close to the Somali border , were killed . A month earlier 12 people died in al Shabaab attacks in Mandera county , and in September 2013 at least 67 people died in an attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi .
