I have been black a long time , and I can tell you that black folks are a persnickety lot . To get consensus , things have to be done The Right Way but there ' s no consensus on what that looks like . However , we seem to know what it is not . Lee Daniels ' " Monster ' s Ball " and " Precious " contained the wrong message ( white people saving black people ) and " For Colored Girls " was tainted by Tyler Perry , a gifted director and storyteller given to more commercial fare , whom some saw as the wrong messenger .
