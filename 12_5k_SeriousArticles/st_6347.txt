I ' ve been living in Vermont for much of my adult life , adding up to nearly four decades . And I ' ve been keenly interested in the question of religion , having written a biography of Jesus and practiced Christianity as best I can for much of my life . I ' ve also traveled in the South quite often , and understand where that 61 comes from : Not long ago I drove across Mississippi , and I couldn ' t find a secular radio station on the dial . It was all preachers , all sounding alike . Repent , repent , repent . Billboards everywhere shouted religious slogans . It seemed there was a church on every street corner in every town I passed through .
