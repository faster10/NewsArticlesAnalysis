In the case of my husband , David Berry , I requested that he and his trusted colleague and friend , Thomas Theurkauf , be listed near each other . Although we will never know for certain , Tom ' s widow and I are convinced that our husbands died together . There is no more powerful testament to the special bonds that could not be broken by the murderous attacks of that day . We are comforted to know that their names will be kept close , reflecting how they stood together on the morning of September 11 .
