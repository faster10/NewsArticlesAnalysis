Religious authorities in the world ' s largest sponsor of terrorism Saudi Arabia have denominated Russia ' s interference as an invasion of " Muslim Syria " and have encouraged jihad against Russia in the background of their airstrikes . Similarly , terrorist groups inside Syria have called Russia ' s military strikes a " flagrant occupation " , and a " war on Sunnis " . Interestingly enough when Syria gained independence , in part thanks to the actions of the Soviet Union and as diplomatic relations were established between the two nations , it was the Sunni elite who inherited the government from the French and thus began their rule over the new nation state and their friendship with the Soviets . Then when cooperation between Syria and the Soviet Union intensified , after the Baath party came to power in 1963 under Salah al Din al Bitar , again it was a Sunni who was in power .
