" My priorities were to win major championships and win World Golf Championships because I haven ' t ever won any . I ' ve been at No . 1 a couple of times . It would be a different way of thinking to me compared to Rory , who hasn ' t been No . 1 . He may be thinking about it , but my main goal is to play well or play as well as I ' ve been playing tomorrow morning and try and win that match . "
