Of course , that ' s nothing compared to " The Avengers , " which fell 45 percent for 20 . 3 million and walked away with two notable achievements . First , the Marvel superhero movie passed " The Dark Knight ' s " 533 . 3 million tally to become the third highest grossing domestic release ever , behind only " Avatar " ( 760 . 5 million ) and Titanic ( 658 . 6 million ) . While " The Avengers " should be able to reach the 600 million mark , it ' ll almost certainly fall short of those two James Cameron productions . Still , No . 3 is not a bad place to be , especially when you ' re also talking about the worldwide record board .
