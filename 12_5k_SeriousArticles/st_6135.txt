One of those games , a rivalry game , trying to do anything and everything to pull out a victory and just fell on the short end of the stick , Jackson said . I m very frustrated . A lot rode on this game and we knew what was at stake . Personally , I m frustrated . I take that one on my chin . As a veteran of this league , I know to protect the ball and it just got away from me . Regardless of me scoring , we still lost the game . It s still a bad feeling inside .
