One focal point of the al Nusra offensive was Syrian Revolutionary Front leader Jamaal Marouf , long seen as a moderate benefiting from U . S . assistance . He appeared in an online video saying that he had decided to withdraw from Jabal al Zawia , his hometown , to stop further loss of life and that al Nusra had killed more Syrians than the regime . However , there were reports the two sides were considering talks and a Sharia court may be used to arbitrate if Marouf personally appeared .
