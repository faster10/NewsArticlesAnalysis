Stephen Curry scored 27 to lead the Warriors , but it was Barnes who sealed the deal with the Warriors leading 96 92 in the final two minutes . He hit a wide open 3 pointer with 1 : 15 left and then banged home a second one with 41 seconds to go to break open a game that was tight all the way up to that point . The Bulls , who recorded the last regular season victory by an opponent at Oracle last January , gave a game effort to make it two in a row . But Chicago simply didn ' t have enough to back Jimmy Butler ' s superlative 28 point performance .
