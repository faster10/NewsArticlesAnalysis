" There ' s always freshening up , " he said . " We ' ve done rule changes , we ' ve eliminated the middle rounds , we put in the judges ' ' save . ' And there will be some changes coming to the show this year that no one knows about yet , though they ' re more modest than last year . What you try to do generally is if you have a year of big changes , you try to let those settle for at least another year . Change can help , or it can kill you if it ' s the wrong change . You never want to change the core of the show , no matter what the competition is doing , because that ' s what people come back for . "
