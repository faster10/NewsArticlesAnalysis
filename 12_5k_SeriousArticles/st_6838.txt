It is hoped that the meeting between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ashraf Ghani would help to end the bitterness between the two countries and pave the way for renewed collective efforts to fight the common challenges . Both sides need to work together with sincerity of purpose showing sensitivity to mutual concerns and making a new beginning . Before it is too late , an immediate re evaluation of the current relationship is essential in order to move forward . It must be understood that as the US troops gear up to withdraw , Afghanistan would need Pakistan more than ever . President Ghani is struggling to maintain his unity government intact and the withdrawal of US and NATO troops might precipitate his woes as the Afghan army was still not in a position to maintain security . The battles in Kunduz and Badakhshan are indeed very dangerous portents which have exposed the vulnerabilities of the new political dispensation in Afghanistan .
