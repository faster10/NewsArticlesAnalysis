Damon at least had the decency to look a little sheepish when Gervais dinged his movie , The Martian , for nominating itself in the comedy category , in a crass ( and successful ) bid to win some Golden Globes . But that exact push pull is the Globes whole gestalt : everyone involved desperately wants to win ? or host ? one , while looking like they don t care about winning ? or hosting ? at all . So they curse and blush and slur and complain , up until they win .
