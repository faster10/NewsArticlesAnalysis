" As a gay man , I say , let him not support gays . When the gay community and gay activist groups push on anti gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement , I fear it would make whatever accomplishments taste cheap like a greasy coin . Ultimately , the acceptance of the gay community and the right of gays to marry will not be achieved through violent means , physical and verbal , but through peaceful and honest negotiations . "
