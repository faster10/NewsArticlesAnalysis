Olivia Harrison : He was mischievous . He did like to tease people a lot . I just got so used to being wound up he just wound me up every single day I think I knew him . And he said , " You ' re just so easy to wind up . " He ' d make some really bad remark , and he ' d just do it so I ' d start protesting . And he was funny , and he made you funny to be around him , and if you could make him laugh , that was just great .
