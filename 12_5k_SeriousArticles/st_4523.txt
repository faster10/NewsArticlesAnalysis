Which brings us back to the dispute between Sanders and Clinton . Sanders , who is running as an agent of radical change as much as he s running to serve as chief executive , is trying to make progressive a narrow term that hews close to his brand of democratic socialism . This is not a small thing . If progressive is just a species of liberal , further to the left than most , then Clinton ? as a moderate progressive ? fits the definition , at least in her career as a senator . Clinton was the 22nd most liberal senator in the 107th Congress , the 21st most liberal senator in the 108th , the 25th most liberal in the 109th , and the 20th most liberal in the 110th . ( Barack Obama , by contrast , was the 21st most liberal senator in the 109th Congress and the 10th most liberal in the 110th . ) Yes , Clinton voted for the Iraq War resolution ? which looms large in Sanders critique ? but that s also true for John Edwards , who credibly ran from the left in the 2004 and 2008 presidential primaries , presaging today s progressive rhetoric with his Two Americas speech .
