Can you say so without sounding as if you ' re the kind of guy who would love to break in and trash Buckingham Palace , the Louvre , the Vatican , the Taj Mahal , Graceland , Disneyland and Hogwarts ? Is there anyone from New England who would go , hmmm , maybe you ' re right ? Or would everyone there like to see you sentenced to 20 years in Shawshank for insulting Boston ' s baseball park , which in that corner of America is considered a hate crime ?
