Trump has been labeled as intolerant and a bigot , but he doesn t care , said Layman . He has a willingness to say what a lot of people really think , but are afraid to talk about because they ll be labeled as racist or bigots . He makes it OK to express these things . They like him because he s trying to stick it to the mainstream liberal elite , the media and political correctness ? all of which they ve abhorred for years and years .
