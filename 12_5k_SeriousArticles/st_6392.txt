This week , an intrepid band of local mountaineers noticed that the gully was covered in more snow than anyone could remember . So they decided to ski it . The dramatic photograph of John Roberts , 30 , bombing down the sort of ' black ' run that would do credit to the Matterhorn while photographer Alex Messenger climbed up the gully with ice axes was the shot of a lifetime . ' I ' ll never take another picture like that again . Not in the Peak District , that ' s for sure , ' admits Alex , a communications manager with the British Mountaineering Council .
