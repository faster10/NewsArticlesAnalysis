' I think he ' s done really well . He ' s kept the captaincy simple which is important and I also think he ' s got the right level of having his own view and listening to others and being measured and making sure the players in the side have got a way of talking and shaping the way we go . We want the players to have a voice . It feels a calm dressing room and very committed as it should be . I think he can be well pleased .
