DEFINING ISSUE : POLITICO s Annie Karni reports on the growing centrality of HILLARY CLINTON s push for gun control . Clinton s embrace is on the verge of becoming a defining issue in the campaign , with all the political benefits and detriments associated with confronting the National Rifle Association and 2nd Amendment activists across the country . Traditionally , support for gun control rises in the wake of such shootings , but the politicians who push it sometimes end up paying a price down the line . http : politi . co 1m01b1F
