Sources in the sector say the price offering is a trial run . On signing for the service , the customer is asked to provide payment details and choose a pack . The money is deducted later but Netflix has the data on how many people have opted for which tier . Most likely , if the company gets 200 , 000 customers for the Rs 500 pack , it will continue with this pricing . If not , it might look at offering discounts or reducing the price , says an executive with another OTT platform .
