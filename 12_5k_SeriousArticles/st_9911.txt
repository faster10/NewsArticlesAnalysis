Meanwhile , millions of Republicans are so fed up with the status quo that they are willing to back candidates who have zero political experience . Those folks would probably not hire a piano tuner to fill their cavities or a truck driver to litigate a law suit , but somehow they think that managing the world s biggest economy and best equipped military is child s play . They believe that navigating our political process can be mastered overnight and that on the job training is okay for the biggest job in the world . We just tried that folks ? electing Barack Obama with absolutely no qualifications whatsoever ? ? see where it got us .
