3 ) Sorry Marco , but third means you lost : Ron Paul , the late Fred Thompson , Alan Keyes , Lamar Alexander : What do they all have in common ? They all finished third in the four most recent competitive Iowa caucuses and none of them went on to become president . The only Republican to ever finish third or worse and win the presidency was Vice President George H . W . Bush in 1988 . So I get why the Rubio folks are spinning his third place as victory , but the reality is that he entered the evening in third place and he left in third place . A participation trophy is nice for your kids , but in politics , you have to win somewhere .
