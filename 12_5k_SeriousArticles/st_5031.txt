A little known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955 , initially in secret . Until three years ago , the audio from one term was not available until the beginning of the subsequent term , a wait of up to a year . And for decades , the only way to hear the reel to reel tapes was to go a National Archives and Records Administration annex in Maryland in person and listen on site . Typically only scholars and researchers were allowed access .
