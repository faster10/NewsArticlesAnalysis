ENGLEWOOD , Colo . Gary Kubiak stuck to his word in naming Peyton Manning his starter even after declaring that Brock Osweiler had done nothing to deserve a demotion . For coach Kubiak , his team understanding the direction and plan is far more important than trying to fool a coach who will probably assume that Peyton Manning is starting anyway . He holds the record for most first game playoff exits in National Football League history ( 9 ) . He was benched during the game and didn ' t return to action until this last week . He quarterbacked the Indianapolis Colts to a Super Bowl victory to cap the 2006 season . He threw two touchdowns and two interceptions . " As long as this football team is winning games , shoot , I don ' t care whose playing quarterback " .
