In this particular matchup , there ' s no disputing that the Carolina defense holds the advantage along the lines . The Panthers this season recorded 44 sacks , the sixth highest total in the league , and that was despite Charles Johnson ( the team ' s best edge rusher ) missing seven games and notching only a single sack . Kony Ealy , Mario Addison , and Jared Allen handled the majority of the snaps at the defensive end spots in Johnson ' s absence , and the trio combined to take the quarterback down 13 times on the year .
