Speaking of bacon , if it ' s meat you ' re hungry for and you have plenty of money to spend , order the Kobe beef at Steak 954 in the W hotel . An 8 ounce Kobe fillet is 65 , but the entire menu is not that expensive . You can get a regular 8 ounce fillet for 35 . Aside from the food , a highlight here is the jellyfish tank it ' s worth , at the least , going to the bar for a drink .
