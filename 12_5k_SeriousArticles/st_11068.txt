This really is different from the past : In our book Why Iowa ? , my colleagues and I found that in 2008 , more than half of Iowa caucus voters ? had personally met a candidate , and that about a quarter had asked a question . To put that in perspective , our survey of that year s two dozen ? Super Tuesday states ? ? ? voting on the same day a month after Iowa ? ? found that only 20 of voters had even met a candidate , and that just one in 12 said they had been able to ask a question .
