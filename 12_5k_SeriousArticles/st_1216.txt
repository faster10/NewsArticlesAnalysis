" I do not know if Jefferson actually ever made such a statement or not , ( but ) I find it odd that many people attribute it to him if it wasn ' t true . It ' s ridiculous in my opinion to propose that since nowhere in his writings there is trace of such a statement , then Jefferson has never said something like that . Jefferson could have come up with those words in any occasion of his public or private life and someone else recorded and then quoted him . "
