Out of typical men , approximately two to three percent have a sexual preference for men rather than women , and out of pedophilic hebephilic men , approximately 20 to 30 percent have a sexual preference for boys rather than girls . It is an error , however , to conclude from this that the two to three percent who prefer men are more likely than the others to break out of their preferences to contact a child sexually . That is , the offenses against boys are being committed by the 20 to 30 percent of pedophiles who prefer boys , not by the two to three percent of otherwise typical men who prefer men .
