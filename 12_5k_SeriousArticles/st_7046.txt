The loss wasn ' t just a defensive failing , though . The offense couldn ' t move the ball under Sanchez , gaining just 227 net yards , and the team went more than 25 minutes through the middle of the game without a single first down . Sanchez didn ' t have much time to work he was sacked six times and wasn ' t all that accurate when he did . The running game went nowhere for DeMarco Murray , but that is no longer a surprise .
