Marco , when you signed up for this , this was a six year term , and you should be showing up to work , said Bush , who met with family in the last few days in Texas to re tool his campaign . I mean , literally , the Senate ? what is it , like a French work week ? You get , like , three days where you have to show up ? You can campaign , or just resign and let someone else take the job .
