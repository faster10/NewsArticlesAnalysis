If you watch the Western or Gulf states ' media , you would have the impression that everyone in Syria opposes and is fighting the government . This is not true . In Syria , a significant portion of the population is disaffected , but the majority still supports the regime . A series of public polls , for example , show that the al Assad government still retains a majority of the support of the population . The reason ? The basic majority , about 55 of the population , is terrified at the prospect of the other 45 forming a Sunni Islamist tyranny over the country . The 55 have held together as they have for decades to essentially hold Syria together as an independent , secular political order .
