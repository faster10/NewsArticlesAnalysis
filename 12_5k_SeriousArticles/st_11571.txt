Sandy arrived east of Florida at exactly the right time and place to get the maximum benefits from its interaction with the dip in the jet stream . As a result , Sandy became large enough to influence that system as well , and the two will wrap around each other into a single , deep cyclone , 800 miles across , extending from the ground to 40 , 000 feet in the sky . This will add to the duration of the event as the circulation takes several days to wind down over Pennsylvania and New York .
