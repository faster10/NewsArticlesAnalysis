So why do liberals work so hard to create the perception that " taxing the rich " will solve our problems even though the top 10 of taxpayers already pay 70 of all federal income taxes and many low income Americans pay no federal taxes at all ? Because it ' s all about the politicians . Liberals believe that inflaming class envy will persuade the American people to elect Democrats over Republicans , who allegedly want to protect tax cuts for the rich . It would be hard to find a more tired and intellectually dishonest argument in American politics today than the idea that we can balance the budget by soaking the rich .
