According to Peter Glover , Master Mariner and Senior Associate at international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright , " There is no international convention which places an obligation on shipping companies to report losses of containers at sea . " However , a report will likely be required if the loss of the container is considered to be a marine accident , presents a danger to navigation , or if discharge of the contents of the container is such that it breaches the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships .
