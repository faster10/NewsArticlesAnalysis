7 . As he rapidly grew in stature , Mufti Mohammad Sayeed saw himself as the next Chief Minister of the state . However , all hopes he might have harboured of occupying the hot seat were dashed when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi entered into an accord with Abdullah and facilitated his return as chief minister after a hiatus of 11 years , much against the wishes of Congress workers in general and Sayeed in particular . Not the one to give up easily , Mufti Mohammad Sayeed engineered a coup of sorts ahead of the 1977 elections as Congress withdrew support to Abdullah ' s government . The aim was to have a Congress Chief Minister , which would have been Sayeed , in place for elections to control the official machinery but Governor L K Jha brought the state under Governor ' s rule .
