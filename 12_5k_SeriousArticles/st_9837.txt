There is something muscular , tough , almost animalistic about Perry that seems to be resonating among Republicans at least for the moment . It ' s partly the way he carries himself shoulders back , chest forward , a confident stride . It ' s partly his smile as others beat up on him . But it ' s mostly the way he talks simple , straight to the point , colloquial , no qualifiers , cut the B . S . Conservatism served straight up . People are so tired of lying , pandering and political correctness that they enjoy the change : " He didn ' t say Ponzi scheme , did he ? Wow ! " He may not be book smart , but he is street smart and wily .
