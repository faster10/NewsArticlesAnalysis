I know where my brother rests in peace , innocent of any crime other than being an American on the wrong plane at the very wrong time in history . Rather than wanting to see the kind of freak show snuff film of Gadhafi that is worming its way through the internet as I write this , I would have far preferred to watch him from a front row seat in the Hague as he , in true Milosevic style , would have been made to answer for his countless hideous crimes .
