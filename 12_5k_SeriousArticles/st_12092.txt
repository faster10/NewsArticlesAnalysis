I can ' t comment on what Indra ' s position is . But , I feel if you think of it as one or the other ( family or career ) , you ' ll always pick one . If you look at it as how can I make it both work , then you figure things out . I don ' t know what having it all means . I actually don ' t understand that question because all is different for every single person . For me it was always having a family and a career .
