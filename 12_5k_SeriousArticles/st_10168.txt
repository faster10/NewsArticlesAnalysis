Nine times out of ten , you know where the ball is going when Konta steps up for a groundstroke : deep and crosscourt and into the corner . Predicting the shot is one thing , though dealing with it quite another . Since she hit her stride at Eastbourne last summer , Konta has felled no fewer than 29 opponents ? four of them top ten players ? with this simple yet beautifully executed strategy . Whether or not her Melbourne run continues , this latest victory will ensure that she breaks the top 40 for the first time .
