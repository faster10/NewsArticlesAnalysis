Yeah , I did ( hear James comment ) , Curry told USA TODAY Sports as the undefeated Warriors ( 12 0 ) prepared to face the Clippers at the Staples Center ? Thursday night . I mean he s motivating his team however he needs to . But he s not in our locker room , so he doesn t know kind of what s going on . You can look at our record and make that ( assumption about the Warriors being hungry ) . It s probably pretty self explanatory that we re hungry .
