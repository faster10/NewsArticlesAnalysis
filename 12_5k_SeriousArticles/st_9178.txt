Cruz pressed the issue during a contentious exchange in last week s debate , remarking that the legal issue at hand is quite straightforward . He also turned the tables on Trump , remarking that some of the more extreme of the legal theories he had been floating insist that you must not only be born on U . S . soil , but have two parents born on U . S . soil . Under that theory , not only would I be disqualified , Marco Rubio would be disqualified , Bobby Jindal would be disqualified and , interestingly enough , Donald J . Trump would be disqualified .
