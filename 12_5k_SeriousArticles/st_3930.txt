The sad thing about the whole thing is , just think about how many championships him and Shaq could have won as a team . That s the saddest thing about this whole thing . Kobe had an awesome career and he won five championship rings , but how many rings could him and Shaq have won ? I don t know . I think it would have been a lot , though . They could have gotten five . They could have gotten six . We won t ever no . But them two will go down as one of the top 10 best duos ever .
