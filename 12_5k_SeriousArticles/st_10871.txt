Carly Fiorina , a former corporate CEO whose biggest accomplishment was the disastrous merger between HP and Compaq , and who is worth tens of millions of dollars , railed against corporate mergers and the wealthy . " Big and powerful use big and powerful government to their advantage , " she said . " It ' s why you see Walgreens buying Rite Aid . It ' s why you see the pharmaceuticals getting together . It ' s you see the health insurance companies getting together . It ' s why you see the banks consolidating . And meanwhile , small businesses are getting crushed . . . . Big government favors the big , the powerful , the wealthy , and the well connected , and crushes the small and the powerless . "
