But , my fellow Americans , this cannot be my task ? or any President s ? alone . If we want a better politics , it s not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President we have to change the system to reflect our better selves . Changes in our political process ? in not just who gets elected but how they get elected ? that will only happen when the American people demand it . It will depend on you . That s what s meant by a government of , by , and for the people .
