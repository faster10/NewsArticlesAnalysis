Bloomberg s prospects are equally dim . Since the 2000 election , 40 of the 50 states have voted for the same party . Most political analysts would argue that Democrats have 217 electoral votes locked up and Republicans have 191 . The most extensive competition is for the 10 swing states and their 130 electoral votes . Even if Bloomberg could somehow win all 10 , it would be nearly impossible for him to gain an additional ? 140 electoral votes from the lopsided Republican or Democratic states , ? no matter who is at the top of either ticket .
