Charleta Tavares , a Columbus Democrat , " is hoping to revive legislation to abolish so called ' zero tolerance policies ' in Ohio schools , " the Columbus Dispatch ' s Shannon Gilchrist reports .

The result is that troubled kids who are forced out of classes land in more serious trouble or they drop out of school . "
