Aircell , which shares its revenue from Gogo with the airlines , charges 9 . 95 for flights under three hours , 12 . 95 for flights longer than three hours and 7 . 95 to use a Wi Fi capable handheld device for any flight length . Passengers can begin using the service once the plane reaches 10 , 000 feet . If the plane remains in flight for longer than three hours as part of a delay , passengers do not pay the higher fee , Blumenstein said .
