A lot will depend on the moderators . John Dickerson is a pretty wonky guy , which does bode well . Anderson Cooper , in the earlier debate , seemed much more interested in heightening the drama on stage , at the expense of exploring the real policy differences between the candidates . Cooper was , contrary to the myth now circulating in the right wing media echo chamber , actually pretty tough in his questions last time around , but they all had a rather snarky spin to them that ( hopefully ) won ' t be present Saturday night . Dickerson should be much better at asking intelligent and relevant follow up questions , as well which are often the key to challenging airy talking points from stump speeches with hard , cold facts .
