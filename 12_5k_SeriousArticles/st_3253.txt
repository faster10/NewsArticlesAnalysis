If Sen . Marco Rubio ( R Fla . ) becomes , as now seems likely , the Republican presidential nominee , last night s debate will be seen as the turning point . It was then , deep into the evening , that Rubio called Hillary Clinton a liar . To the Republican base , Clinton is the she devil , a modern day witch , an evil manipulator of all things good who needs not to be merely beaten but destroyed . Rubio stepped forward as the man for the job . He will light the bonfire .
