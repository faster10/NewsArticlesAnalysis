In her diary on April 10 , 2009 Mrs Moore wrote : ' Don ' t know what to do . Just want to do what is right and legal . Sick of lies and conning people . ' While in Lanzarote on May 3 that year she wrote : " Don ' t want to live here . I don ' t belong here . Glen punched my arm three times and had a knife to my throat wish never met him . ' She said of the bogus collecting : ' I didn ' t really want to do it . ' She sobbed in court when it was put to her that both children and adults had been defrauded but added : ' I did it for my own safety . '
