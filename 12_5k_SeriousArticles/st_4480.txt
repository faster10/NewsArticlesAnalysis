( As a kid ) , I would pull books out of the library , I ' d look at National Geographic and dream about those incredible places . I didn ' t necessarily read the words . You can tell his broad story page to page to page by simply having a child inferring . It ' s a magical thing . We should all be so lucky to have a book that ' s so open ended that it ' s ripe for interpretations all over the place .
