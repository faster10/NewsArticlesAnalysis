The Department of Justice has read the high court ' s fine print in Kennedy v . Louisiana : " Our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons . We do not address , for example , crimes defining and punishing treason , espionage , terrorism , and drug kingpin activity , which are offenses against the State . As it relates to crimes against individuals , though , the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim ' s life was not taken . "
