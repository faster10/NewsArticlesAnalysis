Filmmakers purveyed the human hustle in stories of those facing near death challenges and variously hanging onto life by a thread , a fraying rope , a stranded lifeboat , safety tether or not . Think of Robert Redford fighting for his life in " All is Lost , " Sandra Bullock clinging to tether in " Gravity , " Jaden Smith depending on intelligence from his wrist radio in " After Earth " and Tom Hanks facing death in a lifeboat in " Captain Phillips . " Also tested in a life and death narrative was Jennifer Lawrence in the Survivor tinged " The Hunger Games : Catching Fire . "
