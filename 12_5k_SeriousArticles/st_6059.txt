Cassey Pelkey of Birmingham , England The most touching strip was the one printed just after Charles Schulz ' s death . I have been a " Peanuts " since I was 2 years old , and absolutely love them all . I think we can all see a little bit of Lucy , Peppermint Patty , Pigpen , Snoopy , Charlie Brown , Linus . . . in ourselves if we reflect on it . That ' s what makes it endearing . . . . It ' s about Everyman .
