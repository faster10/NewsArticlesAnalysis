But tonight , I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead . Don t worry , I ve got plenty , from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients . And I ll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing . Fixing a broken immigration system . Protecting our kids from gun violence . Equal pay for equal work , paid leave , raising the minimum wage . All these things still matter to hardworking families they are still the right thing to do and I will not let up until they get done .
