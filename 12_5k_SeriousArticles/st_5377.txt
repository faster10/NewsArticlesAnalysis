Willems : I think this one is about the question of : ' What is control ? ' And also about pacing , and suspense , and being helpless . In ' Don ' t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus ! ' you yell ' No ! ' and you change the situation . The pigeon doesn ' t get to drive the bus because you yelled no . In this , you ' re yelling , ' That ' s not a good idea ! ' but it ' s still going to happen . You ' re seeing that truck wreck about to occur . It ' s about trying to change the world , and maybe not being able to . I don ' t know . I don ' t know what it ' s about . And you know what ? Frankly , it ' s not my job . My job is to make the book . You guys figure out the meaning . Come back to me , you tell me what it ' s about .
