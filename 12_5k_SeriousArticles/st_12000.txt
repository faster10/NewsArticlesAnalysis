Lennon writes : ' I know you ' re a musician at heart ! and especially I know you dig jazz . Well , Yoko ' s music ain ' t quite jazz but to help you get off on it , or understand it , please listen to a track on the ' Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band , ' called ' AOS , ' which was recorded in 1968 ( pre Lennon Beatles ! ) with Ornette Coleman at Albert Hall London , you could call it free form , anyway Yoko sits in the middle of avante garde , classic , jazz and now through me and my music rock ' n ' roll !
