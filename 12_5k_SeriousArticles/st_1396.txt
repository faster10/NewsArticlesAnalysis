Many independent toy stores across the United States have been doing what Harrods is doing for decades . Nancy Stanek was tired of toy shopping for her children and seeing the same limited offerings of Barbies and baby dolls in the girls ' aisle and cars and action figures designated for boys . So she opened a toy store in Chicago in 1974 with " open ended activities " in mind : puzzles , games , building blocks , train sets and dolls arranged by theme instead of color coded aisles of pink for girls and blue for boys .
