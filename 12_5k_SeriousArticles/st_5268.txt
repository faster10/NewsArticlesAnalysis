Adams : I don ' t know ! I don ' t know this woman ! I mean I wouldn ' t know her from an Alaskan salmon . None of us knew her . it ' s going to take six months to figure out what she does other than make mooseburgers ! I do not know this lady . I ' m sure she ' s wonderful . I ' m not bright enough to have made a vice presidential pick . But it ' s going to take us six months to know who she is . Right now , I don ' t like the fact that she mispronounces " I " raq and " I " ran . If she would say Iraq and Iran , I would be happier .
