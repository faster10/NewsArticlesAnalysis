I ' ll leave you with the rest of the list just so you can get a sense of what your peers on the Internet value . As I wrote last week , I was surprised by these numbers not the fact that 32 , 546 ballots were submitted , but because a story about the economy finished at the top of the list , and several ideas I found to be most interesting ( the country with 100 , 000 new cases of leprosy per year the place in the United States without Internet access ) received relatively few votes . About half of you picked the income inequality story , the winner , which would have been near the bottom of my ballot . Only 9 of the ballots submitted included the leprosy story , which would have been my top pick .
