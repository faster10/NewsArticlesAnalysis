Consider how much news space in Britain is devoted to marginal American figures like Oliver North , Lorena Bobbitt , and OJ . Simpson a man who played a sport that most Britons don ' t understand and then made commercials for rental cars and that was it and compare that with all the news reported in any year from Scandinavia , Austria , Switzerland , Greece , Portugal and Spain . It ' s crazy really . If there ' s a political crisis in Italy or a nuclear spill in Karlsruhe , it gets maybe eight inches on an inside page . But if some woman in S kicker , West Virginia , cuts off her husband ' s d and flings it out the window in a fit of pique , it ' s second lead on the 9 O ' clock News and The Sunday Times is mobilizing the ' Insight ' team . You figure it .
