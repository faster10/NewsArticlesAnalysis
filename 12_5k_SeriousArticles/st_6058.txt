Pedro Valle of San Juan , Puerto Rico My favorite " Peanuts " character has always been Linus Van Pelt . His view on humanity is unique , like an outsider looking in . In fact , my favorite " Peanuts " moment ever is when Charlie Brown challenges Linus ' dream to become a little country doctor . He asks Linus how he could become a doctor if he can ' t deal with humanity . The very wise Linus responds : " I love humanity it ' s people I can ' t stand . " That sums up my own feelings to the letter .
