JIM CRAMER : MS . MAYER , JIM CRAMER . IN THE TRAJECTORY AND NARRATIVE OF YAHOO THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE , INCLUDING MYSELF , VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF DOING THE HUGE WIN THAT YOU COULD ? BECAUSE YOU WERE SO SMART TO KEEP SO MUCH OF ALIBABA . AND THERE WAS SO MUCH CERTAINTY TO THE TAX SITUATION . WHY DID YOU GIVE SUCH CREDENCE TO YOUR ADVISERS , THAT THEY KNEW WHAT THE IRS WOULD DO WHEN THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO RECOGNIZE THERE ' S NO WAY YOU CAN GAME THE IRS .
