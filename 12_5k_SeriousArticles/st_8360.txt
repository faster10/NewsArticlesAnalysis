Although 12A means any child accompanied by an adult can attend , there is an expectation that a parent or guardian will exercise a degree of judgement in deciding whether a film is suitable , particularly for very young children , says Phil Clapp , chief executive of the UK Cinema Association , which represents 90 of UK cinemas . What may or may not be appropriate often depends on the child , and parents or guardians are best placed to make that judgment . The BBFC insight information , available for every film on their website , provides detailed advice to allow such a judgment to be made .
