Yes , there is a need for legislation fighting our snooping mobile devices . I ' m in favor , for example , of U . S . President Barack Obama ' s privacy bill of rights , and particularly his " Do Not Track " legislation which he unveiled last week . And I applaud the work of legislators like EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding and Minnesota Congressman Al Franken who are aggressively looking into the information collecting practices of Google , Apple and the other big data companies in the mobile ecosystem .
