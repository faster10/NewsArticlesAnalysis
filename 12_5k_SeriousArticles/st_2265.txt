The immediate lesson should be obvious : The Hollywood Foreign press needs to ? for the love of God ? stop letting Ricky Gervais host the Golden Globes . When they could have had , say , Melissa McCarthy ( nominated for her work in Spy ) or Dwayne Johnson ( on hand to remind us what a gifted showman he is ) , why did the HFPA have to root through the discarded scraps of ceremonies past ? Why not Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader , whose flawless chemistry during last year s Oscars ? during which they presented the award for Best Screenplay ? proved what a formidable hosting duo they would be ? Why not literally anyone else ?
