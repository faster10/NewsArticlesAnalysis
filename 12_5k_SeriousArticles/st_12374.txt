" When you say martyr , there ' s no questioning that title . But it got to a point where it sort of became a way to absolve the government of the duty it has to actually investigate and punish the people doing that . . . What you see today is people who are saying , no , we don ' t want to be a martyr . We are victims if we die when we ' re going to work or to school or doing daily life things . "
