VACCHIANO : I m not as down on Revis as Manish seems to be , but I don t believe a healthy Revis could stop Beckham one on one . Really , I don t think there s a cornerback in the NFL that can stop him one on one . I ve watched Beckham make a bunch of ridiculous coverage with corners draped all over him . I ve seen him catch passes with three guys surrounding him . Nothing stops him . He just has a way of getting to the ball ( and holding onto it ) . Maybe Revis in his prime could ve held him in check , but not now .
