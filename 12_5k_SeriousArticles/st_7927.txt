Lim : I ' ve learned a lot . Quite often I cry tears of joy because I feel humbled . Once in a while , a baby is born that doesn ' t breathe . Normally CPR works , but sometimes no matter what you do , that baby just wasn ' t meant to make it . That really humbles us , because we have control over reducing risks for the mothers and babies but I have learned we don ' t have control over fate . There are so many more good days than bad , though .
