If one looks carefully , there are lots of people who make lots of decisions or who were aware of one thing ? whether it was the drinking , the bulimia , or the drugs ? and nobody stopped it . That s what the film is really about . It s pretty heavy . You can t quite imagine what it s like when they re in the film . To go through it all again , it s really tough . There s certain people who just can t watch the second half .
