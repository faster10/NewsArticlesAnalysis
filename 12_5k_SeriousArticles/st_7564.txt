' I ' m sure in time Steven will talk through the things he had to consider . But , for me , there is no drama . It is about managing a player who I have always admired and admire even more after having the chance to work with him , as a player and a person . I ' ll manage that to the best of my ability and the calls I make will always be for the best of the team . I have a huge respect for Steven in terms of what he has done as a player and what he has done for me in my time here . '
