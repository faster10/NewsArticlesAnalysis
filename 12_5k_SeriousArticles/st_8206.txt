ADMIN SCALES BACK HIPAA RULES FOR GUN BACKGROUND CHECKS ? The Obama administration is out with a final rule allowing health care providers to share certain mental health information with the FBI s gun background check system which was previously limited under HIPAA s privacy rule . Federal law prohibits gun ownership to individuals who have been involuntarily committed or found incompetent to stand trial or deemed by a court to be a danger to themselves . However , HIPAA prohibits most health care providers from sharing this information without patient consent . This rule will allow some disclosure of information for background check purposes . President Obama proposed the rule three years ago , in the wake of the Newtown , Conn . , school shootings .
