The greater purpose of this nursery of babies is to make sure their species doesn ' t go extinct . It ' s a reminder of the tragic circumstances going on in the rainforst of Sumatra right now . If wildlife habitat cannot be saved , this kind of facility could be the only place where Sumatran tigers , orangutans and elephants will live . But with all the efforts of those trying to preserve this habitat , I ' m hopeful that this worst case scenario will never become a reality .
