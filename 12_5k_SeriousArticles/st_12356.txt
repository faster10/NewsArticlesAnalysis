A : " I am . My son is a huge Jets fan , so I ' ve become a secondary Jets fan . Listen , I grew up in the early 1970s and became a huge Roger Staubach fan and a Cowboys fan . Believe me , it doesn ' t get me anything political around here because the Giants fans hate me , the Eagles fans hate me , it doesn ' t matter . But you grow up rooting for a team . That ' s just the way it works . "
