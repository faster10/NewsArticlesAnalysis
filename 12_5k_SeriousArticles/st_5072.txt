Jackson recorded the title song for the 1972 film " Ben " a story about a young boy and his rat friend . " He liked that song because he liked rats , " his mother said . " I can remember a story that we went to Beverly Hills to have dinner and we were eating . Michael kept pulling his coat up and putting crumbs into his pocket . I said ' What are you doing ? ' and he held it up and he had a rat in his pocket . He was feeding it . I was really upset with him . "
