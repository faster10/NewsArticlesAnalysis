' I ' ve suffered from headaches all my life , ' says Maureen , 58 , a retired supermarket cashier from Arbroath in Scotland . ' Even as a baby my mum told me I used to cradle my head and cry uncontrollably . As soon as I was old enough , about three years old , I was able to tell her I had headaches on the left side of my head . She took me to scores of doctors but they didn ' t know what was causing the pain . '
