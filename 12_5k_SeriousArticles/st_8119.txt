Afterwards there was an incredibly dark feeling in the changing room . I wasn ' t feeling it to the same extent , because I didn ' t get on , but you could sense the hurt in everyone : from players to coaches to management . That ' s when I first realised that All Blacks teams just can ' t lose . Especially not at home . Especially not to England . It was a horrible sensation dropping our first game of the year , and doing it at home , to England , in a World Cup year .
