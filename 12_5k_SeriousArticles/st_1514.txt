A 10 year old boy , his face still innocent , abducted from his village and forced to kill alongside ruthless militia fighters . A 60 year old grandmother too ashamed of the injuries caused by a brutal rape to leave her house for five months , even though her wounds worsened . A girl who reminded me of my own daughter , bridging the years between youth and womanhood , who had been dragged into a forest near her house by a group of men and raped , over and over again .
