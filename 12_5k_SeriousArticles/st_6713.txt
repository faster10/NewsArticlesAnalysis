Van Halen : Oh , I know so . I mean , we ' re a band ! That wasn ' t just a one off thing . It ' s officially a band . And Wolfgang Van Halen is the bass player . Janie and I are getting married in June , and my son ' s going to graduate , and we ' ll pick it up after that . Obviously , I hope we record some new stuff . I ' m writing , and just doing the same thing I always do .
