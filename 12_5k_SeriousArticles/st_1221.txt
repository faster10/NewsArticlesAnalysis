I ' m not saying no one can do this . I think many smart and caring men and women do ask permission along the way and are careful and sensitive observers of what their partner wants and says . I ' m all for encouraging that kind of protection of oneself and one ' s partner . But I think most of this would be clear and careful if it weren ' t happening in an alcoholic fog , and that ' s where I ' d put my money and educational efforts .
