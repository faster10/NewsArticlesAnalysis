Forget the idea that parts of the public sector will be protected . NHS spending will rise in real terms , but it will fall as a share of GDP , as it did over the past five years . An ageing population and medical advances mean that health spending needs to rise faster than GDP , as it has done almost continuously since the Second World War . Add to this pressure from cuts to local authority care , and the idea that the NHS is being protected becomes laughable . ?
