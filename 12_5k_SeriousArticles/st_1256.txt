Anyway , I suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the Republican senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse . Conservatives saying that we can ' t have immigration reform before we secure the U . S . Mexico border is like liberals saying we can ' t have more welfare reform until we end poverty . That ' s never going to happen , and they know it . So we ' re just playing games .
