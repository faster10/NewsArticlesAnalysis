For us , we have to continue to lay down the foundation ? even though we just came off a championship run ? to lay down the foundation of another run , because this year is going to be totally different . That s what we all want , is to celebrate again in June . This time last year , we were still learning the system , but we were playing hard , playing with that effort every single night . This year , we re just a little better individually , better as a team , and I think that s showing . Everybody is pretty focused .
