CRAMER : I ' M ALSO A BIT CONFUSED . I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEIR STOCKS ARE UNDERVALUED . WHEN I AM ON YOUR CONFERENCE CALL AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE MAVENS , TALK ABOUT THE THINGS YOU ' VE DONE , YOU WERE GIVEN NEGATIVE CREDIT , AS IF YOU WERE A VALUE DESTROYER . BUT THOSE OF US WHO USE THE PRODUCTS WE ARE ALWAYS CONTINUALLY SURPRISED . AT YAHOO FINANCE , YAHOO SPORTS , YAHOO ENTERTAINMENT , YAHOO SEARCH . I MEAN , CAN THE MARKET BE THAT OBTUSE ?
