There was the impression that the OECD report was announced merely to give a fillip to the Paris COP while conducting estimates outside the legal framework of the UNFCCC . Another effort to determine the contours of the negotiation pre Paris was made at the recent meeting of the 20 major economies , the G 20 meet in Turkey . Differentiation , climate finance , and targets for Paris came up at this meeting , which is outside the bounds of the UNFCCC . The climate justice principles of the UNFCCC need to be maintained to build trust and work together as a global community addressing a shared challenge . While the Paris COP may not satisfy everyone , it should , with any luck , be a worthy step forward in building such a global community .
