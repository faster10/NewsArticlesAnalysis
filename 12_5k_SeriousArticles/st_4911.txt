We are not going to see in any of the Arab countries a neat transition to a democracy in a year or two . Countries do not make that shift from authoritarianism to democracy so rapidly . Achieving a well functioning democracy could happen in perhaps 10 to 15 years . There will be setbacks , bloodshed and disappointments along the way . But we have to stay with this for a while , develop sustainable strategies to help these countries , and not abandon them a year or two into their transitions .
