On where Earl Thomas ranks in terms of passion : Are we doing a number scale system , or are we ranking . One to 10 , between one to 10 , he d be a 97 . That guy , he comes with it . He comes to play every game , he brings it every play , regardless of if he has won or lost a match . In terms of contact , being aggressive , being physical with ball carriers , he s going to get up and he s going to tell them about it . He s been that way since I ve ever met him . He s passionate about how he plays , how he approaches the game , and every game , every play , you can depend on him .
