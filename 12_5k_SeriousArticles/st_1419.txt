This Series will be a throwback , in one way . Despite playing in an era in which there is interleague play every night , the Mets and Royals are comparative strangers as were the National and American League champions in the old days . They did not meet this year ( they will open up against each other in Kansas City in 2016 ) . Their connections are distant and historical : The Mets got fleeced in the Amos Otis Joe Foy deal , but they took the Royals to the cleaners on the Ed Hearn David Cone deal . Gregg Jefferies Kevin McReynolds for Bret Saberhagen was not as clear cut .
