No supplement , hormone , antioxidant or pill of any sort has been shown to reverse , stop or even slow aging . The problem is two fold : to do the study properly , you ' d need to follow two groups of people for life : one who takes the pill , the other that doesn ' t . Then you ' d have to control for all other factors and compare the average age of death for each group . No such study has ever been done on a " longevity " supplement .
