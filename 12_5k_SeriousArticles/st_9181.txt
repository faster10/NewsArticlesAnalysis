You re going to see conservatives , and not just in Iowa , coalesce behind Cruz following the Vander Plaats endorsement , Deace said . And as much cache as Bob has in Iowa , he has a huge amount of influence nationally and I think you will see more and more conservative leaders come out for Cruz , like you saw a couple of them do yesterday . I think it ll be a big tidal wave , and I think it will be the most united we ve ever seen the conservative movement when it s all said and done .
