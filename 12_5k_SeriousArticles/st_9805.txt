The good news is that , by the end of this year , close to 16 million people will have access to treatment . As UNAIDS Executive Director ? Michel Sidib ? said in a statement , Every five years we have more than doubled the number of people on life saving treatment . We need to do it just one more time to break the AIDS epidemic and keep it from rebounding . At the end of 2014 , new HIV infections had fallen by 35 since the peak in 2000 and AIDS related deaths by 42 since the 2004 peak . Lower diagnostic and treatment costs mean that investments in health care now stretch further . ?
