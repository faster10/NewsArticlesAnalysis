So back to the question of if there is indeed a problem , or whether the controversy amounts to one of political correctness ? Considering the evidence it is undeniably a case of the former rather than the latter . Firstly , let s take the composition of the Academy itself .

There is also a problem when it comes to gender balance within the Academy , given that not only are 94 percent of its members Caucasian but 77 percent are also male .
