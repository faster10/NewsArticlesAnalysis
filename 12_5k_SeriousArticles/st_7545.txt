Bryant , who announced his retirement ? effective at the end of this season ? last Sunday via a poem to fans on Derek Jeter s website , is a shell of the great player he once was , and is playing for a dreadful team . But that hasn t stopped him from trying to make the most of his final moments on court . Bryant has hired a film crew to document his final season , filed for a trademark application for special logos created for his hero villain retirement marketing campaign and is selling a 32 hat commemorating his final season on his personal website .
