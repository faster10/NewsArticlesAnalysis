WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY ! I ' m your host Eric Wolff , and I have to say , it was a nice try by Obama to make the " state of our Union is strong " cliche fresh by putting it at the end of his speech , but I ' m sticking with " flabbergasted " as a bolder , and yet still correct , descriptor . As always , send your tips , quips , and comments to ewolff politico . com , or follow us on Twitter ericwolff , Morning Energy , and POLITICOPro .
