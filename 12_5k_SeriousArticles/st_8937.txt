Novak and I both have pretty similar game styles and I think that makes it a bit tougher to come up with a game plan to beat him . Obviously , Novak doesn ' t have loads of weaknesses in his game , not many of the top guys do , so it ' s tough . But I ' ve also played him so many times to know some of the things that make him uncomfortable as well . We ' ve played now 30 times , this will be the 31st match , so we know each other ' s game pretty well . I ' ll try to use all those other matches to my advantage on Sunday .
