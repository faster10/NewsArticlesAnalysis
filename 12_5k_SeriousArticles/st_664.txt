YL : " El Divo " director and the 2009 Cannes Jury President Paulo Sorrentino said that " Dogtooth " completely surprised him . Because most Greek films do not find international distributors , most viewers have a limited idea of what a Greek film is . Most people think of a fisherman , a beautiful island , and ancient ruins . Most of " Dogtooth " is shot in a big house and the surrounding garden , as the children are not allowed outside the house . In this way , the film played with the expectation viewers had when going to see a Greek film .
