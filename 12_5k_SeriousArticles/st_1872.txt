" Start with a rad , well sourced 6 to 8 pound bird . If you ' re hosting lots of people , get two . Don ' t go with a massive turkey they ' re dry . I cut out the spine and butterfly the bird . Brine it overnight , then rinse and let it dry , uncovered , in the fridge for another night . Take it out early in the day and rub it all over with herb laced sea salt and olive oil . Place the turkey on a bed of large mirepoix along with the butchered spine and giblets . Dump a bottle of white wine in the pan , with an equal amount of water or homemade turkey or chicken stock . Roast at 425 until nicely browned , with crispy skin all over . Let the bird rest for 30 to 40 minutes before carving ! " Travis Lett , Gjusta ( Los Angeles , no . 2 )
