It was shattered in unthinkable ways in Colorado this week . There is an old Life magazine photo , taken to illustrate the magic of the movies , that is so glorious because it shows the one scene that moviegoers never witness . The photographer positioned his camera at the front of a movie theater and snapped the shutter as all of the people in the seats are gazing upward at the story on the screen . Their faces are bathed in the light from the movie . They are in the midst of a journey .
