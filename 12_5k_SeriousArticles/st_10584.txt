The magic number you need to remember is 2 . 1 . This is the average number of babies a country needs to remain at equilibrium . It makes sense , too . When a mother and father die , they need to be replaced by two babies , or else the population declines . A rich powerful country needs lots of babies to project geopolitical power and increase its productivity . If you won ' t multiply , who will fight your wars ? Who will pay Social Security to support grandpa ? Who do you think will start the next Facebook , Amazon or Google ?
