WHO S UP : It has been somewhat of a disappointing postseason for Royals Game 6 starter Yordano Ventura . The right hander , who was selected to lead the rotation heading into the playoffs , has yet to get on a roll , posting a 6 . 57 ERA in three starts during the division series and the ALCS . In his previous start of this ALCS in Game 2 , Ventura gave up three runs on eight hits over 5 1 3 innings of an eventual Royals victory .
