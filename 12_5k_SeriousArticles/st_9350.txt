Fiction is , true to its name , not real but as JK Rowling has said , " The stories we love best do live in us forever . " The Harry Potter series impacted so many people ' s lives in meaningful ways that it ' s as if Hogwarts really does exist . There might not be a castle where magic is taught , but there is a place in fan ' s hearts where a magical happiness resides . As Dumbledore said , " Happiness can be found in the darkest of times , if one only remembers to turn on the light . "
