Murray said : ' I have only got myself to blame that I lost the first set . Quite a lot of them were on my serve and , on this surface especially , you shouldn ' t really be losing sets like that . For me , that ' s what ' s disappointing really . I blew the first set and that was my fault . I have played well on the grass over the last few years and my best results came when I had a decent amount of preparation time .
