The next big challenge for the two countries is the ongoing effort to reach a peace settlement in the bloody and destabilizing Syrian civil war . Peace talks between the Syrian government and the Syrian rebels are due to begin in Geneva next Monday , but that meeting may not even happen , given that the outside powers involved haven t even agreed yet on which rebel groups will get to negotiate . The optimistic view is that the new climate of cooperation , particularly the relationship between Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif , will help smooth negotiations on some of the most fraught issues in Syria , mainly if and when Bashar al Assad will have to step down . But as former White House Mideast adviser Dennis Ross suggests , the Iranian government may also now be less willing to make concessions on Syria that would make it look like it was taking orders from Washington in exchange for sanctions relief .
