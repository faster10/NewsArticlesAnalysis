It ' s basically " Hey , that ' s neat , " but the Warriors aren ' t thumping over it , nor are they avoiding it . They are confident in how good they are and they should be and want to rack up as much succcess as possible . There ' s an idea that dominant teams should be a bit embarrassed of their success , that their humility should reign over everything . With the Warriors , they ' re neither boasting of how great they are because of the streak nor avoiding it . They ' re just going out and dismantling teams .
