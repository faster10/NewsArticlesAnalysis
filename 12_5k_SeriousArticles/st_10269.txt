I also understand that because it s an election season , expectations for what we ll achieve this year are low . Still , Mr Speaker , I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families . So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform , and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse . We just might surprise the cynics again .
