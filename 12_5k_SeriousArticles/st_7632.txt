Zika s strongly suspected of causing a severe birth defect called microcephaly , which causes underdevelopment of the head and brain . Babies with microcephaly often miscarry before they are born , or they die at birth . Those who survive are usually very disabled . Other viruses are known to cause microcephaly if a pregnant woman is infected ? rubella is the most notorious . But a rise in birth defects had not been noticed in countries that had Zika previously . Something s definitely causing more cases in Brazil 3 , 800 cases were seen in recent months . There are some smoking guns ? the virus has been found in some babies born with microcephaly or in their mothers . But it s hard to test for Zika and there s no quick , on the spot test , making research difficult . no one knows if certain mothers are more vulnerable and it s not clear what stage in pregnancy might be the most dangerous for an infection to occur .
