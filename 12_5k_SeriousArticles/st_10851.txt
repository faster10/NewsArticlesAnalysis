" Kansas City , they ' ve got so much confidence , " Johnson said . " They ' re going to win . They ' ve now done it two years in a row and that lineup is equally tough . They ' ve got some power , but they also don ' t ? give in . They ' re going to fight off pitches , make you work , and try to just get guys on and the next man up . Try to get the job done . In terms of the lineup , it ' s tough either way . "
