" It ' s a tax on money that banks will just pass on to their customers . Wanting higher inflation without faster wage growth is a tax on consumers . And , the BOJ just amped up the global currency battles . I call this economic kamikaze and I ll say for the millionth time , I just don t get the bear case on gold in light of this with fiat currency having such a large bulls eye target on it . Believing that generating higher inflation is a needed precursor to faster economic growth is nonsense . Inflation reads are a symptom of the activity of the underlying economy . I ll also repeat the irony that markets love it when the BoJ and ECB further debase their currencies but freak out when the Chinese also want a weaker yuan . "
