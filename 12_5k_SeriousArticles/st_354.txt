Discussions about a balanced budget left me wanting more . They always seems to start on page three . I don ' t think many Americans , at least those my age and younger , even get why a balanced budget is important . We grew up being handed credit cards and loans many have no intention of repaying . Heck . We ' re now handed credit cards in checkout lines . Paying your debts isn ' t a priority to many , and bankruptcy doesn ' t carry the weight it once did . It ' s now often seen as a strategy for getting ahead . Republicans need to make a better case that balancing the budget and living within our means is a key to America ' s economic strength , fairness , safety and leadership .
