The need to anoint Lionel Messi the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious . Yes , Messi is a genius . Every time I see him play live , it is a privilege . I try to make sure the memories are burned into my consciousness . He is the kind of player who lifts the spirit with everything he does . He is a quite prodigious goalscorer , a wizard of a dribbler and a provider for others .
