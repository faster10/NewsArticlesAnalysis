The best supporting actor nominees are Christian Bale ( The Big Short ) , Tom Hardy ( The Revenant ) , Mark Rylance ( Bridge of Spies ) , Mark Ruffalo ( Spotlight ) and Sylvester Stallone ( Creed ) . That film grabbed ten nominations overall . Straight Outta Compton appeared ideal for a Best Picture nomination , and it does seem odd that AMPAS has passed up the opportunity to recognize a generic music biopic ( a well made one , but still ) beyond a screenplay nod .
