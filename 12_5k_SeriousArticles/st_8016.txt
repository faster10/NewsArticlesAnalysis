Needless to say , we are keeping an eye on what is going on because down the line it will be of interest to our own man , Anthony Joshua , who is well ranked with the WBC . He ' s had a setback after picking up a stress fracture in his back , but he will be back out on April 4 in Newcastle and I can reveal here that he will also fight on April 25 at the O2 Arena , hopefully against Kevin Johnson , who he was meant to fight this month before he injured his back .
