On the surface , civil unions are a politically safe middle ground , an attempt to highlight the artificial divide between secular unions and the religious rite of marriage . But the fact is that marriage is a civil institution just as much as it is a religious one , and therefore religious objections to same sex marriage shouldn ' t be an obstacle . We allow atheists to marry and we do not refer to a wedding performed by a secular judge or justice of the peace as a " civil union . "
