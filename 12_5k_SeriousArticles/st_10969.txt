Nevertheless , there is another logical fallacy lurking here , the insinuation that the terrorists are devout Muslims , and therefore representative of the ideals of Islam . This draws into the idea that Islamic scripture , whether the Quran , Hadith or the Sunna are in and of themselves promoters of violence and thus Islam is inherently violent . This theory holds little water when juxtaposed to the evidence , let us use recent suspects of the Paris attacks as examples : suspects include Hasna Aitboulahcen , Abdelhamid Abaaoud , and Brahim Abdeslam . How do these people corroborate the evidence of their supposed Islamic piety ? Well , it turns out Hasna was a party girl whose friends consider more a lost soul than an Islamic radical , she drank too much , smoked and had multiple sex partners , her brother reports she never read the Quran and had little , if any interest in Islam . How then did she blow herself up for a religion she barely understood ? Abdelhamid and Brahim are no different , the former is reportedly some level of alcoholic , and the latter ' s ex wife reports that he was more a marijuana smoker than a mufti by any stretch of imagination . Worse still , those quick to point to the violence of Islam , usually have very little to say about why the whole Islamic world has not gone to war against western ideals if indeed Islamic scripture is as bloodthirsty as they would have us believe . Why don ' t we have a billion suicide bombers ?
