Djokovic will next play Wawrinka , who sent Nadal packing 7 6 ( 8 ) , 7 6 ( 7 ) , the Serb having defeated him the last time the two played , at the Cincinnati Masters this year . However , Wawrinka won their last meeting in Paris , in the French Open final in June . That defeat prevented Djokovic from accomplishing the fabled calendar year Grand Slam which only two men Rod Laver and Don Budge have ever achieved before . He won the Australian and US Opens as well as Wimbledon .
