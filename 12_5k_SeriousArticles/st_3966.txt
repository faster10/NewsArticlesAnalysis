As a longtime tech writer , the main advice I can give you in your pursuit for press is that less is more . If you think a site or publication would be into your app , don ' t e mail the entire staff or the big boss just find the writer who covers your category , briefly summarize your app in an email , and attach a download code ( Apple gives you 50 for every update ) . Smaller sites may be more responsive than the big guys , and if you build up enough buzz , you can rest assured that the majors will come knocking .
