Under the privacy settings , open up your activity log for granular control of the entire trail of content you ' ve left on Facebook , including likes , groups and events . You can quickly see all photos of you that are visible to the public and change who can see them . Any public photos can show up in Graph Searches based on their location or or the date they were taken . In the main privacy settings view , you can make some bulk privacy settings by limiting old posts so they are only viewable by certain people , or setting the default privacy settings for your future posts .
