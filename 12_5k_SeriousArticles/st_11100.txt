Guantanamo Bay , Cuba I ' ve heard that the Senate report on CIA torture is 6 , 000 pages long . My story , though , takes place elsewhere : in Guantanamo , away from the CIA program that the report covers . The 6 , 000 pages of the Senate report are just the start of what Americans have to accept happened in their name . It starts and ends in the silence of a tiny , freezing cold cell , alone . That ' s when you hold yourself in a ball , and fight to ignore the confusion of what has just happened to you , and the fear of what might be coming next . Or the fear that comes when you realize that no one is coming to help that the life , family and friends you knew are all far , far away .
