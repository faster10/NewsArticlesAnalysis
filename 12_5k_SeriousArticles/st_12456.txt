VACCHIANO : I was tempted to stick with the receiver theme , since Brandon Marshall would do for the Giants offense what they hoped Victor Cruz would do ? open things up for Beckham . But what the Giants really need is a pass rush , so I ll go with Mo Wilkerson . He s got eight sacks , while the Giants have 12 as a team . He d give them the pass rush they ve been missing . And if the Giants defense could stop anybody , they d be running away with the NFC East .
