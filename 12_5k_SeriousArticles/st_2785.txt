Erin , 18 , says she immediately identified with Cherice , because " I was her . I remember being 14 and talking to 30 year olds on the Internet . I was feeling really alone and struggling to come to terms with who I was . I wanted to have some kind of social ( and sexual ) connection with people . That ' s what led me to leer in chat rooms and talk to men who were more than twice my age . Maybe they would love me and maybe I could feel less insecure . "
