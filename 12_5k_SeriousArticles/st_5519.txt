They were down 23 to the Clippers on Thursday night and stormed all the way back to not just win , but cover the 6 . 5 point spread just for fun . They didn ' t have to do that . They were already 12 0 at that point . It would ' ve been very easy , if not entrely understandable , for them to fold the tent and call it a good run . But they didn ' t . Then they turned around the next night and beat a good Chicago Bulls team by double digits on a tough back to back . These are the games that are supposed to trip up even a great team .
