The Rams and owner Stan Kroenke were given permission to flee St . Louis in time to play the 2016 season at a still undetermined LA area site , then move into a state of the art stadium he plans to build and largely finance on a site he owns in nearby Inglewood . The Chargers were given a year long option to become a second tenant at Inglewood ? either as co owner or lessee ? and should they decide to stay put in San Diego , the Raiders would then have the same year long option to partner with the Rams .
