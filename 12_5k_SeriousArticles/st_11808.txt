At first she dismissed Harris ' argument as unnecessary and odd , but then actually came around to endorsing its sentiments , noting that it must indeed be painful to grow up in a culture surrounded by white idols . As for her assertion that Santa is white , her point was that he is universally depicted that way in popular culture . So , too , is Jesus , although it was ignorant of Kelly to imply that this is historically verifiable . Likewise , I suspect the entire segment would not have drawn such controversy if Fox had bothered to invite a single person of color to appear on the panel . There was a gross lack of sensitivity on display .
