All that time spent talking about injuries to Rob Gronkowski and Jeremy Maclin , and it was Justin Houston ( and , to a lesser extent , Tamba Hali ) slowed . Houston s virtual absence really was a game changer for the Chiefs , because it meant very little pass rush , which meant the Patriots could block differently and attack differently . Less of a threat from the outside ? Dee Ford , the replacement , was repeatedly knocked on his hind parts in pass rushes ? meant more attention to the inside , which is where the Chiefs biggest advantage might otherwise have been .
