A lawyer for Bill Cosby said on Wednesday that he never would have allowed the comedian to give a deposition in a civil lawsuit brought by a woman accusing him of rape if he knew his client ' s words could be used for a criminal prosecution . " I thought at the time , and still think , that maybe Mr Cosby paying money to Ms . Constand was the best I ' d be able to set the stage for because a criminal prosecution was not viable and never would be " , Castor said in testimony in the Montgomery County Courthouse Tuesday .
