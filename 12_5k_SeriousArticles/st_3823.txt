" What I will be saying to the new president of Mexico when he takes office is that we want to continue this cooperation and we recognize this is a threat on both sides of the border .

" If we can reduce demand , that means less cash flowing into these drug cartels . The other thing we need to do is work much more aggressively in preventing the flow of guns and cash down to Mexico . "
