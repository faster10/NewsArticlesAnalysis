Just north of Cheonggye is the slightly twee area of Insadong , an area as close as Seoul comes to its past in its present work a day guise . The area has as few tacky tourist shops , but gets enough local life to make it a good area to grab a bite to eat . The narrow winding streets off Insadonggil are crammed with traditional style buildings housing restaurants where Korean barbeques , bibimbap , kimchi and other delights of Korean cuisine can be sampled and often quite reasonably priced .
