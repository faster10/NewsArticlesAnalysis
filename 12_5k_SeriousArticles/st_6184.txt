" Sometimes , parents mistake a MRSA infection for a spider bite because it is so intense and appears so suddenly , " said Fergie , a pediatric infectious disease expert at Driscoll Children ' s Hospital in Corpus Christi , Texas . " If you haven ' t seen a spider , don ' t assume it ' s a spider bite . If you recognize a painful red spot with a little bit of pus , that ' s enough of a concern to go to a doctor , " he recommends .
