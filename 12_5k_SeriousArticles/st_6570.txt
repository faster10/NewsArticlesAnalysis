Despite this version of Blofeld supposedly being rebooted , the " Austin Powers " connections just continue from there . If Waltz didn ' t have his hair , you might think he was Dr Evil himself . This Blofeld still gets a scar like the classic Bond character from which Evil was conceived , and he still has the pet cat . The similarity to Dr Evil might be a little unnerving for Craig , because in " Austin Powers , " we know what happens when Mr Bigglesworth gets upset . People die .
