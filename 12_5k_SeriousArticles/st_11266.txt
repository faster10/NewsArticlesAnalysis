" It ' s been really good and that ' s what got us four straight wins , is playing with that type of effort , " Hoiberg said . " Again , we had it tonight , we were right there down the stretch , we just didn ' t make the necessary plays to get us over the hump and win the game . But yeah , the effort ' s been there especially the last five . If we can keep that consistent we ' re going to be a good team . "
