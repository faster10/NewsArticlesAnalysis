Wet weather and gusty winds are expected in Miami , Florida when the Baltimore Ravens play the Miami Dolphins at Sun Life Stadium on Sunday at 1 p . m . ET . For many , fantasy playoffs are underway , and rookies on both teams could be great late season pickups to help you win this week . The Dolphins DeVante Parker will have his first career start at wide receiver . He did great last week , which really boosted his confidence , with 80 receiving yards and a touchdown . He seems like he will have another solid performance this week against a lacking Ravens secondary . Owners just beware if you re playing him , that rain and wind in the forecast could have an impact on how often they throw the ball to a rookie .
