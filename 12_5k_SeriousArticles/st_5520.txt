Even Denver tried to test them Sunday , trimming the Warriors ' lead to six at halftime and pretty much bottling up Stephen Curry , who had just nine points through the first 24 minutes . But whatever hope the Nuggets had of an upset ended quickly in the third quarter , when Curry scored 10 of his 19 points ( he also tallied seven assists , four rebounds and three steals in 27 minutes ) two of which came on this pretty unfair cat and mouse step back over poor Danilo Gallinari .
