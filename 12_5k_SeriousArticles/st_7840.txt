The study , published online March 18 in the journal The Lancet , was conducted in part by the eminent epidemiologist Sir Richard Peto of the University of Oxford . Peto and his colleagues in the Prospective Studies Collaboration , a team of dozens of researchers from around the world , say they did the new study to figure out exactly how body mass index ( BMI ) relates to mortality . Researchers also investigated how smoking influenced this relationship and how excess weight affected death risk from specific causes .
