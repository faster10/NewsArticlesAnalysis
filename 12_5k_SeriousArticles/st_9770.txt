' I cannot separate my work in the film from the work of my friend Tom Hanks . Every thought , every look , every expression you are celebrating in my portrayal of Rudolph Abel , I found them all in the thoughtful generous presence of Tom Hanks beside me , or behind the camera , yet still with me 100 , every take , every moment . Of course you would witness none of it without Steven , nor are any of the choices of what you witness mine . '
