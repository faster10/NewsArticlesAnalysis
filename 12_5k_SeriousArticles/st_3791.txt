Maybe this is personal because I run for office . Sometimes you lose , sometimes you win , Sanders , a U . S . senator from Vermont , told MSNBC s Rachel Maddow at Friday night s Democratic forum from Rock Hill , S . C , when asked about Republican efforts to restrict voting . It has never occurred to me as a candidate to figure out a way to deny the vote to people because they might vote against me . People who do that are political cowards . They re afraid of a fair election .
