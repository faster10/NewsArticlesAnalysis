Within a half hour , the news took you with a violent lurch even deeper into an impossible nightmare . This was the massacre at the Bataclan . I haven t been to the place since the 1980s and remember it as a dusty , run down place . But it s still a totemic site in the imagination of French rock fans . I have somewhere a bootleg tape of a Velvet Underground reunion gig here in 1973 . How could it be that an audience of innocents was slaughtered in this way and at this place ?
