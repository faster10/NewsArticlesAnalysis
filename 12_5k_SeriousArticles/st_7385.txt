This has sort of been a gift and a curse for me . On one hand , I didn ' t want people to look at me as if I had a disability . On the other , I wanted people to know what I ' ve been able to accomplish in spite of the disease . It ' s an invisible fight for me , but now is my time to make some noise so we can find a cure . If no one is aware of my struggle , we can ' t get there .
