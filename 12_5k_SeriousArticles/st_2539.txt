Penny advocates worry that customers will be ripped off if Congress kills the penny . In a penny free world , sellers would round your bill to the nearest nickel for cash purchases . Purchases totaling 4 . 98 or 4 . 99 , for example , would be rounded up to an even 5 , while those equaling 5 . 01 or 5 . 02 would be rounded down to 5 . Since so many retail prices end in a 9 , the fear has been that this rounding will gouge consumers .
