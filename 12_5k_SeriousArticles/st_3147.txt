Well , lucky or unlucky for me , however you look at it , I was not able to put my mind on the actual jumping out part because I had to think about the interview beforehand . And then as we were jumping there were live cameras rolling so I had to think about , as I ' m falling to earth , what I would say when we landed . There would be live cameras . So , lucky for me I didn ' t actually have to go , " I ' m falling now ! "
