As for the Chiefs offense , they are primarily a run first outfit , and that s still been the case even after losing top back Jamaal Charles early in the year . They just keep plugging in backs who have been getting the job done , whether it s Spencer Ware or Charcandrick West . The Patriots run defense is much more difficult to budge when Hightower s in the lineup , operating at full capacity . If he s unable to do that because of a balky knee , that would pose a problem .
