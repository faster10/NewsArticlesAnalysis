Brady threw a season low 21 passes against Miami . Luckily , Brady isn ' t expected to miss much time as the Patriots won ' t be playing in the Wild Card thanks to a first round bye . Where the Patriots have been hit the hardest from injury is offensive line , and to many , a Brady injury was just waiting to happen after Nate Solder and Eric Wendell were placed on season ending IR , and the rest of the makeshift O line have seen time on the bench as well .
