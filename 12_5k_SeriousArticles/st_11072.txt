I sat Friday night in the dining room in front of my laptop , the TV in the next room flitting among experts and speculators about what happened in Paris , while a freshly made mincemeat pie and two loaves of pumpkin bread cooled on a nearby kitchen counter . The food is for a small , early Thanksgiving celebration later Saturday before one of our two sons leaves next week for a winter s worth of work in Montana . Our other son spent a week in Paris this summer and remarked as he watched the death count mount that it felt strange to see such terror unfold on streets he had walked , in neighborhoods he had traversed .
