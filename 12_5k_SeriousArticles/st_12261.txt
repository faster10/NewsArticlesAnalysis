" We met as a group and let a lot of frustrations go about what it takes to win in this league , what it takes to stay out of each other ' s way so we can all excel , " said the shooting guard after the Knicks fell to 3 6 at home . " And every guy in here ( Sunday night ) did a great job to contribute in the best way that they can . And it worked well for most of us . Obviously , we didn ' t get the win . But for most part , if people can stay in our roles and allow each other to do what we do best , we ' ll have more success . "
