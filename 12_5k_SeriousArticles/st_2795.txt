Set manufacturers aren ' t making it any easier on us . LG , for instance , has three levels of HDR : " HDR Pro " for its top of the line OLED sets , " HDR Plus " for high end 4K TVs with contrast limited LCD screens , and then a lower level simply called " HDR " that still promises better color display than vanilla high def sets ? for instance , by displaying less " banding " on a sky with complex shades of blue .
