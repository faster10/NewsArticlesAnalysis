Every day , I wake to a huge emotional void of love that I once called Rehtaeh . I promised Rehtaeh the first day I met her that I would protect her and nourish her life in every way possible . I did not foresee that I would have to shield her from such cruelty that she endured before she left this world . I was unable to console her as she crumbled emotionally after that photo was taken and circulated . People often say " How can someone ' s life come crumbling down due to a photo ? " I ' m here to say that is exactly what happened . I watched every moment of the tower crumble . Rehtaeh ' s tower of strength and the vibrance of a young person on the verge of embarking on her journey into adulthood .
