Nobody was too surprised to see Texas Governor Rick Perry take the fall he had been badly damaged by his terrible debate performance in 2012 . ( A cautionary tale for all those on stage tonight ? no doubt . ) But Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropping out was a shocker to virtually everyone in the political profession despite the fact that ? he was clearly overrated and a bit of a dolt . And there was the time when everyone thought Senator Rand Paul ? had a real shot , leading his army of ? libertarian millennial Republicans ? demanding an end to all government regulation and imperial ambition ? Unfortunately , his soldiers seem to have deserted . Today he is reduced to ? threatening to filibuster bills ? that really can t be filibustered in a desperate bid for attention .
