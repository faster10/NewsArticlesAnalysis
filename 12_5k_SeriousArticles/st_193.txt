Christopher : Even as I was writing " Empire State , " I knew there were more adventures for the main character , private detective Rad Bradley , to have . I also knew that the world was far larger than what I ' d presented in book one . I ' m a big New York history buff and had collected a whole lot of interesting stuff to use in a new story . As with Judge Crater in " Empire State , " I found a lot of real life characters and places to use : Atoms for Peace , Evelyn McHale , The Cloud Club , 125th Street , to name just a few . The nature of the universe also meant I could shuffle forward in time a few years , to the 1950s , which would let me write a different kind of story . If " Empire State " is from the Golden Age of comic books , then " The Age Atomic " is the Silver Age , with all the craziness that entails . Throw in some atomic robots , the Red Menace and an electric ghost , and I had my idea !
