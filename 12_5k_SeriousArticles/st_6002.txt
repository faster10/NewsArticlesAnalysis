China today is a majority urban society , and those mothers who once laboured in the fields now work long hours in factories most live hundreds or even thousands of miles from their villages , their parental support and , if they have them , their children . As migrants they are not entitled to send their children to urban schools and have nobody to take care of them while they work . There is little parental leave and less state provided care housing is barely affordable and a decent education expensive . China has gone from a nation in which survival and status was built on family and clan to one in which most children have no siblings , no cousins and no aunts or uncles .
