The Lions actually got decent pressure with the three man rush . Jones and Taylor beat the Packers ' offensive linemen and flushed Rodgers out of the pocket . Jones almost sacked Rodgers , actually touching him , before being knocked out of the play at the last second by Don Barclay . Taylor had good pursuit , but Ngata was neutralized at the start of the play . So was Ansah once it became obvious Green Bay was attempting a Hail Mary because he was too far off the ball in coverage .
