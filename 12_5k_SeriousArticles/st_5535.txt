I ' m not sure if I knew the cop . But I may have . For years , before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant , he ' d owned a little neighborhood bar and grill . He was friendly with all the cops . The cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor . I remember having my own police costume when I was very young . A badge and a little nightstick came with it . I ' d make like I was walking the beat .
