" A lot of folks didn ' t know there are places on Google Maps you can explore beyond public roads and the exterior of a restaurant you want to visit , " says Deanna Yick , Google Street View ' s program manager for special collections . " We ' ve been putting our efforts toward taking Street View to areas people are interested in , but may never have the opportunity to travel to themselves . Or for an aspiring climber , we can show them places they may one day be able to reach themselves . "
