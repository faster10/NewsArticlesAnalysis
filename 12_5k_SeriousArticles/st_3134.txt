That statement brought tears to my eyes . I thought about an applicant to our organization ' s scholarship program a straight A student whose sole dream is to become a lawyer . She was accepted to multiple Ivy League colleges but could not apply because she was not able to qualify for funding as an undocumented young person . She is thinking of going to John Jay College of Criminal Justice because it is the only place she can barely afford 6 , 000 a year . But this could still fall through without financial assistance . She would be forced to choose between housing and food , or a degree in law . Even if she does attend college , she will be jeopardizing her stay in the United States as an undocumented person once she enrolls because she has no idea if the policy will remain intact or be rescinded .
