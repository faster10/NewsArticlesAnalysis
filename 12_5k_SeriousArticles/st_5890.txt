' The exact truth was Martin didn ' t want to be rotated . He then said , " if you ' re not going to play me I ' ll find somewhere else " . I said , " Fine , here is the amount I would like to release you under contract , as this is one of the premier positions in the world " . Toulon were interested but wouldn ' t pay that fee . In the end we ended up agreeing a release fee ( 100 , 000 ) with Martin so he could go and play somewhere else . That was his choice , not mine . '
