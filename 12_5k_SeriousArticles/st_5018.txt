Yeah , injuries are definitely part of it . I de also be thinking about that HGH report cause homeboy was definitely taking HGH . As a football fan , I could care less . As a Colts Fan I could care less . As the commissioner of a league that stands to make billions upon billions of dollars under the auspices of maintaining the game s integrity upholding the shield blah blah blah . I m sure Roger Goddell would like nothing more than for five head to ride off into the sunset taking those ( for now ) allegations with him . The last thing the NFL needs is a wide ranging investigation into the use of PED s by elite level players .
