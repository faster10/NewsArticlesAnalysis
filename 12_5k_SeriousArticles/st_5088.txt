Perhaps even more surprisingly , in a party that regularly casts out more conservative candidates as RINOS ( Republicans in Name Only ) , the ideologically ambidextrous and trans partisan Trump has not only endured but has emerged as the GOP frontrunner . Forget that from 2001 to 2009 he was a registered Democrat and that as recently as 2011 he was registered as an independent . Forget too that his mishmash of policy positions makes him more populist than conservative , he is now positioned such that winning the Republican nomination seems more real than laughable .
