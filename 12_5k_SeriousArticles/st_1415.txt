Don ' t feel bad for Grigor , though . Sooner or later , Federer will ease into retirement ( to be followed shortly , no doubt , by fellow all time greats Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic ) , and Dimitrov will get his long delayed day in the sun . Then , before he knows it , it ' ll be his turn to play December to some kid ' s May . With some luck not to mention Federeresque hard work he too will be able to hold off the gales of winter longer than anyone expected .
