When Buttler went England were 92 for six and facing complete humiliation but at least James Taylor , who did himself a power of good with an innings of proper industry and innovation , and Woakes showed some fight in a stand of 92 that delayed the inevitable . The innings ended in some farce when Taylor successfully reviewed an lbw decision only for the umpires to give Jimmy Anderson run out as the pair crossed after the initial decision . Surely the ball should have been dead once the umpire ' s finger was raised ?
