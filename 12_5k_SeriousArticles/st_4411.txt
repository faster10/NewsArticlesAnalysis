This might be Amendola ' s last game without Julian Edelman ( foot ) , who returned to practice this week and could play in Week 15 . That hopefully will motivate Amendola for another big game , and he has been consistent when healthy with a touchdown or 100 receiving yards in his past two games . He has at least 11 targets and seven catches in each of his past three outings , and he ' s one of the few weapons Tom Brady can rely on these days given all the injuries in New England .
