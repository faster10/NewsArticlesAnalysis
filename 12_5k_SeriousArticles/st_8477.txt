Although Mother ' s Day is one where I can ' t help but feel her loss , the times I miss her most are during the highs and lows of parenting when one of my sons reaches a big milestone like walking or learning how to read , or at the end of a long day when I ' ve lost my temper . It ' s at those moments that I wish I could hear just how proud she would be , or be reminded that having a bad day doesn ' t make you a mom failure . I miss her take on it all .
