Brock Osweiler s solid play in Denver s 17 15 victory over the Chicago Bears not only proved he can carry a team , it showed just how limited the Denver Broncos offense has been with the aging and ailing Manning . With a season high 170 yards rushing , including a 15 yard run by Ronnie Hillman that set up Osweiler s 48 yard TD pass to Demaryius Thomas on the opening drive , the Broncos were able to open up their playbook in a way they ve rarely done this season .
