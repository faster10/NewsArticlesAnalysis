Will it have an impact on BP ' s profits ? This was not a working well , so BP will not lose any amount of oil and gas in its portfolio . But at some point it will have to " ' book " the costs of all this and that will have an impact on its bottom line . Having said that , BP earns 5 7 billion from " ongoing activities " EVERY quarter ( 27 . 7 billion in total for 2009 ) . It had a 5 . 5 billion " replacement cost " profit in Q1 2010 . It can afford this .
