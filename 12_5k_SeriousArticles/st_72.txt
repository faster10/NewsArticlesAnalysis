Aldean : Radio ' s really accepted us , and proven that they ' re really going to play my stuff as long as I give them something good to play . Fans are coming out to the show , so I mean what more could I ask for ? My original plan when I got started in this deal was just to be able to make a good living for my family and play music . I ' ve been able to do that , which is all I ' ve ever wanted .
