The band must crunch its formation and marching into the 42 foot , 10 inch space of 34th Street , space significantly narrower than a football field . There will be no margin of error when it comes to time . The Herald Square song , a custom arrangement called " Blues for Santa , " must be completed in exactly 1 minute and 15 seconds . And unlike a football field , with yard markers and lines for reference points , the only anchor for the band will be the Macy ' s star and logo painted on the asphalt .
