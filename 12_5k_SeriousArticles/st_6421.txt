He did not shout and scream he was always calm and spoke with real authority . He never wanted to make rash decisions and is such a solid , reliable character . That ' s why he will make a fantastic manager one day . From the first day I met him at Arsenal , Patrick has remained respectful and likeable . Nothing has changed . He is a model professional but he has the personality and presence to take charge in a dressing room full of big egos . That ' s exactly what City need .
