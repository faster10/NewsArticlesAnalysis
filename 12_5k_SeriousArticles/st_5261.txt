Brooklyn , New York ( VICE ) When people talk about fashion week , they are usually referring to London , Paris , New York and Milan . When I discovered that Islamabad was having its first ever fashion week , I was especially intrigued . In a country where the majority of women cover up and similar events in the past have been threatened with fundamentalist attacks , this had to be about promoting Pakistan ' s textile industry in a strangled economy . The majority of Pakistan ' s population wears traditional Shalwar Kameez or Burkha , are vehemently religious , poor and enjoy about a 50 illiteracy rate . I quickly learned that there are pockets of Pakistani society that have Western sensibilities , which warrants the fashion industry to grow and justifies the need for a fashion week .
