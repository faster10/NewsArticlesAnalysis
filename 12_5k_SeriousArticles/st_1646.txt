Intelligence officials on Wednesday concluded that Malik had never visited or stayed in India , as there exists no record of her two Pakistani passports ? passport number BF 0760081 valid from 2008 to 2013 and passport number KE 512100 issued thereafter from Riyadh ? in the immigration records . " She may have at best transited through India to a third country , but then such detail would not show up in immigration records , " said an officer . " There is no way a Pakistani citizen can escape the scanner as the checks are much stringent in their case . Malik may have either not visited at all or transited through an Indian airport on a connecting flight , " he said .
