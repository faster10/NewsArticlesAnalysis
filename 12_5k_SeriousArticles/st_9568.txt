Matt Lombardo : If any team ever needed a win to salvage not just a season but perhaps the very faith in its head coach , it would be the Eagles . However , given all of the questions and potential in fighting that have surfaced after two ugly home losses , beating Detroit on Thanksgiving might just be too tall an order . Detroit has only scored 36 points combined in their last two games and won both of them . If Sam Bradford is able to make the start , and that seems to be a long shot , perhaps the outcome is different . Lions 16 , Eagles 10 .
