Kansas City Chiefs : The Chiefs are 1 14 ( counting playoffs ) against Peyton Manning in his career and 0 7 against him since he joined the Broncos . That ' s reason enough to think Manning and the Broncos will beat the Chiefs again , but there ' s more . The Chiefs are 0 3 against teams in the top 10 in total defense and 1 3 against teams in the top 10 in scoring defense . The Broncos are No . 1 in both categories . Broncos 27 , Chiefs 17 .
