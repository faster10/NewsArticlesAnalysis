Jerry Fallwell , Jr . endorsed Donald Trump Wednesday . Anyone who watched the video footage of Trump ' s speech at Liberty University last week saw this coming . What was harrowing about the Liberty speech was how it put Trump ' s lack of spiritual development on full display . Liberty is a Christian University . Students were required to attend . Whatever one thinks of these students , one must admit that they take the Christian Bible seriously . News outlets had a great time with Trump ' s " Corinthians 2 " moment , because Trump ' s blunder , his manner of citing the pinch of biblical text he felt he needed to incorporate into his Martin Luther King Day address , revealed that Trump is not a churchgoer . Trump has called himself " an Evangelical , " identifies as Presbyterian , and has lied about being a regular worshipper at New York ' s Marble Collegiate . He claims he has received the " cracker " ( as he calls it ) and the " wine " as part and parcel of his Presbyterian worship . For those who hold Holy Communion sacred , this characterization of Christ ' s feast at the altar is ( at least ) some kind of low grade desecration .
