Since ISIS is a sworn enemy of the United States and Mr Obama s latest strategy is to contain and destroy ISIS , the question must be raised : Why hasn t Mr Obama demanded that Mr Erdogan cut not only the ISIS supply lines going through Turkey , but also terminate its purchase of black market oil ? Another question : After a 16 month U . S . air campaign to destroy ISIS , why haven t the organization s oil facilities been destroyed ? Why are we now just getting around to destroying ISIS oil trucks ?
