1 . Raising animals for meat is much less efficient than growing vegetables : Think back to those food chain diagrams from elementary school . Animals are higher on the food chain than plants , and therefore they take more land , food and water to grow for our consumption . The difference in efficiency isn ' t negligible : Raising a kilogram of beef requires 15 , 500 liters of water , according to waterfootprint . org . An equivalent amount of bread requires only 1 , 300 liters of water bananas use 860 and tomatoes consume just 180 liters , or about 1 of the water required for beef . ( Chocolate , by the way , is actually worse than all of these , requiring 24 , 000 liters but it ' s clear that a vegetarian diet is far more water and energy efficient than one that includes meat . )
