Some fans ask why focus on the Redskins in particular ? Because names like Chiefs , Indians ( minus Chief Wahoo ) and Braves ( minus the tomahawk chop ) are not demeaning . " What about the Irish of Notre Dame ? " one of my college students asked . " That ' s not offensive or demeaning , " I replied , " but what if they were named ' the Drunken Irish ' ? " " That would be even better , " he said . That answer got a laugh but no one really took him seriously .
