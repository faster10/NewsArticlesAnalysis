The limited X ray material , the absence of a full post mortem examination and CT scan , have meant that the UK Home Office pathologist , Dr Nathaniel Cary , who has been consulted in this case , is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck . However when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with Ms Bhutto ' s body , the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury . Importantly , Dr Cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death , when set against the nature and extent of her head injury .
