The Maud , 225THE LOOK : Dainty and a very sensible three and a quarter inch heel height . The toe has a classy criss cross effect and the delicate strap fastens with a gold buckle . BEST FOR : Everyday wear . So comfortable and lightweight , I barely feel like I ' m wearing anything it ' s like floating on air . WORST FOR : Rainy days but apart from that , a winner all round . SJP shows it can be done ! Comfort rating : 5 . A wardrobe must have though the price is a little steep for me .
