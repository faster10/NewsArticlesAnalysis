I am on record as saying that Friday ' s drop in the unemployment rate was a statistical fluke . So was the 0 . 1 percentage point rise reported for July . But the economy has been adding 150 , 000 jobs per month , which is consistent with a declining unemployment rate . To get a full picture of the economy , you have to study the all the data and try to put together pieces of the puzzle . That may not fit Welch ' s political agenda , but that is the world we live in .
