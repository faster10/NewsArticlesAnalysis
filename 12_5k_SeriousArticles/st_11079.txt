My suspicion is that there is no provocative video about Rubio s right wing approach to reproductive rights . I also seriously doubt this will be a line of attack in tonight s debate . Rather , I d bet this was pitched to the New York Times to spur some chatter within the GOP establishment , including the high dollar donor class , which ( a ) reads the New York Times ( b ) is concerned about electability and ( c ) probably isn t altogether comfortable with Rubio s culture war extremism .
