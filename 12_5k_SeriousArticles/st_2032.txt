The victory formation wasn t quite in order for Cincinnati due to the math of the game clock , but I ll bet the Bengals now wish they would have gone ultra conservative and taken three kneel downs and either tried a field goal or bled the clock down as much as possible . There probably wouldn t have been enough time for Pittsburgh to assemble much of a drive , especially given how ? Ben Roethlisberger s injured throwing shoulder kept him from throwing anything close to a deep pattern .
