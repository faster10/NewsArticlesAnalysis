Green : It ' s a multicamera show . Alec ( Sulkin ) and Wellesley ( Wild ) , the guys who wrote it , have been talking about " Family Ties , " Golden Girls " and " Cheers . " Shows like that , where all the characters are grounded in reality , where there ' s a lot of emotional potential , but funny because it ' s about real life . That ' s what we ' re all aiming to do : use this medium in a provocative way , the way the shows we grew up on did .
