I condemn Syed Farook and Tashfeen Mailik for their mass murder in San Bernardino , but I do not fear or condemn other Muslims or Islam because of what they did . Neither did I fear or condemn all Christians or Christianity because Eric Rudolph , a self proclaimed member of the Army of God , set off a bomb that killed one person and wounded more than a hundred at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta or all Jews or Judaism because Meir Kahane ' s Jewish Defense League conducted terrorist activities here in the 1980s . History is replete with examples of murder justified in the name of faith , but these are perversions by a few that have never been condoned by the many . We should never treat everyone in a religion as if they are suspect because of the dark deeds of someone .
