I get these guys to come in and do replay training for a couple days a year . It ' s good , Carollo said . I need year round training , just like the coaches , just like the players . This is not part time anymore . I think it ' s an important job and needs to be recognized like that . It ' s not organized that way right now . I think we can do a lot better to make it a real professional avocation .
