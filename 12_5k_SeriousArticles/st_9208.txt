Kael had a point about the endearing but exhausting childishness of Star Wars . The other films of its period were grim parables of psychological deviancy , social malaise and political paranoia , set in America s hellish , festering cities ? Scorsese s Taxi Driver , Robert Altman s Nashville , Alan J Pakula s The Parallax View , Francis Ford Coppola s The Conversation . Lucas had previously made American Graffiti , a pastoral idyll about adolescents amusing themselves in a small Californian town it ends with a fearful preview of the grown up future ? one character will be killed in a car crash , another will go missing in Vietnam , a third will suffer the fate worse than death by migrating to Canada . Star Wars dodges such outcomes by reverting to infancy and regaling immature audiences with what Kael called its comic book hedonism .
