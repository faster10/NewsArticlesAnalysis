Should we put armed guards in every school ? Probably not . More weapons do not necessarily make us safer . And the price for doing so might keep us from measures that are smarter and statistically more effective , like better mental health services and counseling for students on the edge . Proposals for " armed schools " may help the NRA sell more guns , but they don ' t address the underlying problems . They also risk leaving the rest of us in a perpetual high fear , low trust society .
