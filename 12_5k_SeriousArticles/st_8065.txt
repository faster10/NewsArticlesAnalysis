My message to Liverpool fans , I owe them a lot . It ' s been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season . And hopefully come back that ' s the message , my relationship with Liverpool doesn ' t end in the summer . In fact it will never end .
