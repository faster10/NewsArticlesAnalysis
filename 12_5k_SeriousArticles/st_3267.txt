Ali , who has been in Ben ' s care for the past six weeks while immigration authorities determine whether he will be granted permanent asylum , is anxious . His 46 year old mother and two brothers are marooned in Pakistan , themselves waiting for Ali ' s case to be determined , hoping for asylum in Pakistan or Australia . But though Pakistan does its bit to take in asylum seekers , Ali tells me this is not a preferred option for his family . Too close to Afghanistan . Too close to the feared Taliban . Too precarious , lest Pakistan tires of them and sends them home .
