Some biologists , such as Richard Dawkins ( author of " The God Delusion " ) , argue that we did not . They say that religions are cultural inventions which are costly and destructive for individual believers . They say that religions only persist and spread because they get into our minds the way that a virus gets into our bodies . Once someone believes that he ' ll be rewarded for recruiting converts and punished forever in hell for leaving the church , he tends to do things that help the church , even if they hurt him .
