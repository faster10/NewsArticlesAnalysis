The Mets were again down to their final strike as Mookie Wilson battled Bob Stanley , barely fouling off a couple of two strike pitches . Then , a miracle , as Stanley s inside pitch eluded Rich Gedman , and Mitchell scored the tying run . And then , another miracle . Wilson hit a grounder to first that bounced and skipped and went right through the legs of Bill Buckner . Knight scored the winning run and the series was tied . Two days later , the Mets were crowned champions .
