Van Zandt : It ' s emotional for me to walk onstage without Clarence , and it always will be . I still honestly once in a while get that feeling with Danny . I look over there and say , " Oh yeah , Danny ' s no longer . . . " That ' s never going to change . So I think the more people onstage , the more that helps . The more the configuration is different , the more that eases your emotional pain . In other words , you ' re not trying to replace them , you ' re doing a different thing . Through the years , since we started playing in 1965 , you do a lot of different things . I ' ve been in horn bands . I ' ve been in country bands . You go into 100 different configurations in your life . Now it feels like another one . It ' s almost like you ' re in a different band , in a sense , even though the core of the band is still there .
