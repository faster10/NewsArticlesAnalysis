I told all of our product teams , you know when they come in for reviews , really just come in with mobile , Zuckerberg said . If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product , then I m going to kick you out . You have to come in and show me a mobile product . And that , I think , was just as a crude leadership tactic , somewhat effective in helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy toward focusing on mobile .
