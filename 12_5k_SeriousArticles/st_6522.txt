England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster will head for a poolside bar with a beer or just lie in a darkened room when he goes on holiday to Tenerife this week to reflect on the agonising near miss in the Six Nations and plan for the World Cup . ' It ' s just a bit of space to get my head straight before I dive back into everything , ' he said . Lancaster always travels to the same destination on Tenerife for his private thinking time after major tournaments , which his wife Nina describes as going into his ' cave ' . Daughter Sophie reacted to Lancaster dining alone in a restaurant in Tenerife by calling him ' weirdo ' in a text message . Lancaster wouldn ' t give his exact holiday location when asked , saying : ' I ' m not going to tell you where it is in case you start following me around . ' But his chances of escaping attention from British hordes in the Canary Islands are slim .
