" People were approaching from different sides , and one guy came up to me and screamed , " ' If you are a man , shoot me ! ' The same moment , a mukhabarat guy next to me shot him in the shoulder , at close range , and tried to arrest him . His mother approached us and said , ' Let him go take me instead ! , ' and a mukhabarat guy in civilian clothes in front of me shot the guy point blank and killed him , in front of his mother . "
