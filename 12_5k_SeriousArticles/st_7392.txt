In my opinion this is the new NHL . This is what it s about . You look at professional sports , the more athletes can engage and interact with the fan base , the more you re going to get out of it , right ? The more you re going to get out of your league , the more revenues grow , in my opinion . That s the game now . Fans want to be able to interact with players and get to know them . I think the All Star Game is a great opportunity to do that , no matter what the format is .
