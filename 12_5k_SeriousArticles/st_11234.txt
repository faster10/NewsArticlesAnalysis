Former Patriots safety Rodney Harrison told the Herald last week that the Denver altitude is indeed a serious issue for visitors . Brady is 2 6 for his career in Denver , and the Pats blew second half leads in three of those losses ? including a 14 point , fourth quarter edge in the Week 12 overtime defeat this season . The Broncos outscored the Pats in the fourth quarter of four of those losses . There will be no such thing as a safe lead today because it s easy to tire down the stretch when your body is trying to function a mile above sea level and you are not as acclimated to it as the home team .
