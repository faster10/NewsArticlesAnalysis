I have been to Fenway a couple dozen times . I saw Pudge behind the plate and Dwight in right . I interviewed Dom DiMaggio once . I interviewed Ted ' s kid , the one who deep froze him . I became a Hall of Fame voter who did not vote for Jim Rice . I didn ' t care much for Bill Buckner , so I didn ' t much care when that ball went through his legs . I was in St . Louis on the 2004 night when the Red Sox took the World Series to reverse the Bambino curse .
