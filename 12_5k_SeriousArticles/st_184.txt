Murray does not believe crowd support has been a factor , more the excellence of Federer in these conditions : ' The reason why he is difficult to beat is that he is incredibly good on these courts . He is a fantastic indoor player and has been all his career . When there is no wind or sun to throw him off , when he is on his game , he is incredibly tough to beat , but hopefully I will be able to do it this week . '
