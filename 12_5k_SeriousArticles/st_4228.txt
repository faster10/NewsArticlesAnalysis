It s not that Manning isn t physically capable of throwing the ball deep . He just can t do it accurately and consistently for a 60 minute game . Manning will call a good game , minimize mistakes , and check to the run when he can , a . k . a . be a good game manager . But when the run isn t there , he is going to have no choice but to chuck the ball downfield . And that is probably what Belichick wants .
