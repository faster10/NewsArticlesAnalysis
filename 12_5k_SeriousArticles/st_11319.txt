And as the years went by and as the therapy went on I was holding together . And then at around 50 , I decided to fall apart and find the pieces and put them back where they should ' ve been . And I did . And I did what I thought was impossible , which was really drag the stuff up , look at it , go through all that and then each time I did that . . . it became a daily thing with the therapist . . . to find out something huge . Go through the terror , go through all of it and then by the end of the week something had changed a little bit . This went on for a number of years .
