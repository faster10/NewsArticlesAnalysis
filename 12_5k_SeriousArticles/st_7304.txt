I do know this : That culture , popular or otherwise , can do many things to make us feel connected . It can at its most euphoric or engaged detach us from misery , loneliness and pain . But ultimately it cannot free or save us from these ills . The movie I saw today permitted me to forget for almost three hours what happened to people who saw it two time zones away . It couldn ' t and didn ' t keep me from caring about them . And from worrying about the rest of us .
