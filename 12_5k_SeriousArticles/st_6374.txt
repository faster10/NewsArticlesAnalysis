I can remember my first Fourth of July after returning home from Iraq , when I was working as a bartender in a hotel in Ouray , Colorado . I stepped out from behind the bar for a minute and watched from the balcony above the front entrance to the hotel as the fireworks exploded in the sky above the town . I could feel them as much as I could hear them , just like in the war . And for a moment , I stood a bit straighter and was proud for having served my country .
