Making money might ' ve been easy for Jordan Belfort , the wildly successful white collar criminal played by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street . But his biopic is having a slightly tougher time . The Martin Scorsese drama , which cost just shy of 100 million to make , cashed in 18 . 5 million over the three day weekend , bringing its five day total to 34 . 3 million . Wolf predictably played to an older male audience , drawing a crowd that was 54 percent male and 90 percent over the age of 25 . The movie ' s box office future is uncertain : While its straight C CinemaScore doesn ' t imply good word of mouth , Wolf stands to get plenty of free publicity at upcoming awards events . ( The movie has already garnered Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture , Musical or Comedy and Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy ) . DiCaprio had much better luck at the holiday box office last year . Like Wolf , Django Unchained opened on Christmas Day . But the Tarantino film made 15 million on the 25th alone , and had racked up a solid 63 . 4 million tally by the end of the weekend . Earlier this year , the actor ' s The Great Gatsby made 50 . 1 million in its opening weekend in May . And Scorsese and DiCaprio ' s last pairing , Shutter Island , opened to 41 . 1 million in February of 2010 .
