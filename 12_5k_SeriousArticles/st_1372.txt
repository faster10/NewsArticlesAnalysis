He calmly threw a strike to Edelman over the middle , hitting him in stride eight yards from the line of scrimmage and allowing Edelman to turn it into a 12 yard gain to get out of trouble . But a Brandon LaFell false start sent them back to the 9 yard line , at which point Brady rolled out the rare deep ball to Keshawn Martin . Lo and behold , it worked . I m fairly certain Gronkowski thought the pass was intended for him until the last second .
