TEXAS STILL BEING ITSELF Sam Levine : " Texas Gov . Greg Abbott ( R ) on Friday proposed a series of amendments to the U . S . constitution that would permit states to override the Supreme Court and ignore federal laws . One of the proposed measures would allow a two thirds majority of the states to override federal regulations , while another sets the same threshold for overturning decisions by the Supreme Court . The governor also wants to change the Constitution to block Congress from ' regulating activity that occurs wholly within one state , ' and to require a supermajority of seven Supreme Court votes before a ' democratically enacted law ' can be overturned .
