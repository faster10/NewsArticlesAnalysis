Trump , Sept . 14 : What would President Trump do ? So I d call the head of Ford , or whatever company , but I d call the head of Ford . I d say , Congratulations , I understand you re building a massive plant in Mexico and you re taking a lot of jobs away from us in Michigan and other places . Now , I don t like that . I don t like it . I just don t like it . And he ll say , Well , Mr President . It s wonderful , wonderful for the economy . Oh , great , just great . It s wonderful for whose economy ? Not for our economy . So , what I d say is the following : I don t want you to do that . And if you do it , you re not going to have any cars coming across the border unless you pay a 35 percent tax . That s it . That s it . No , that s it ! And they re going to say ? they re going to say to me , Mr President , please , please , please . Now , I guarantee you . Let s say I make this call at 9 : 00 in the morning , by 5 : 00 in the afternoon , I think the deal is done , they move back to the United States .
