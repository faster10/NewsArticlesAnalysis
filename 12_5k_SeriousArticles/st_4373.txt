And as Greg Sargent has been diligently pointing out , there s a more satisfying explanation for why Trump is so stubbornly popular among Republican base voters : they really like his anti immigrant proposals and promises to deport all undocumented immigrants .

This lines up perfectly with what Trump proposes , which may also explain why 48 percent of those polled say Trump is the best candidate to handle immigration .
