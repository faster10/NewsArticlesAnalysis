" When I was 16 years old , I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong , " Moore said . " And now I ' m standing here , and so I would like this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she ' s weird or she ' s different or she doesn ' t fit in anywhere . Yes , you do . I promise you do . Stay weird . Stay different , and then when it ' s your turn and you are standing on this stage , please pass this same message to the next person who comes along . "
