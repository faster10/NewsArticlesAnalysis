Harrison : There were a lot of songs that I would look back on and go , " Oh yeah . " He expressed his emotions in his songs . He didn ' t really express them so much in daily life . He saved them up , I think . Sometimes , he was difficult to talk to about certain things , and then he would write a song , and I ' d say , " How can you do that ? How can you put your whole thoughts and inner being out there in a song ? " I could never do that . That was just the way he was how artists are . They ' re baring their souls to you . So nudges and winks ? I guess there are a lot of them .
