There were no long lines waiting to see " The Dark Knight Rises " at the urban multiplex closest to where I live in Washington , D . C . A mild surprise , since this wasn ' t , after all , just any movie ' s opening Friday . This was , as we kept being told , a Major Summer Event , the biggest , darkest and most eagerly anticipated of the many Hollywood blockbusters being wheeled out to the movie going public . It was also a workday . And I was willing to believe that there were too many people who didn ' t or couldn ' t play hooky , no matter how much frothing hype had been aroused on Batman ' s sorry , The Batman ' s behalf .
