As a father and history professor , I was caught off guard . Columbus actually didn ' t figure out the world was round . He didn ' t really discover America , either . And telescopes weren ' t around until about a century after Columbus died . But what do you tell a 5 year old who has bought into a myth ? And how do you do it without constructing an anti myth , pegging the explorer as one of the most evil people to walk the Earth ? What should we tell our children about Columbus ?
