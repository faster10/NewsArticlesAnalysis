A kind of meta heist movie , " Inception " evokes Philip K . Dick ' s cerebral sci fi , the exploration of alternate states of consciousness , memory and fantasy . But these are also Nolan ' s themes , familiar from the amnesiac noir of " Memento " and the many , varied mind games practiced by the warring magicians in " The Prestige " as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries ( fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here ) .
