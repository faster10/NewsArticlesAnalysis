If ? LeBron ? and Jordan are Superman ? players too unrealistically great and physically gifted to identify with , as much as fans can admire them ? then Curry is Batman . He s an everyman type , just 6 foot 3 and 185 pounds , who isn t going to bullrush or dunk on many players . He s going to shoot over them when they laze he s going to look left to go right . He ? is a player children can idolize and actually believe they can become , because his physical tools are minimized .
