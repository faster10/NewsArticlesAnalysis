The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once , twice a week from my town to Prague . I would wake up at 5 . 45 in the morning , take the bus for one hour , then a tram to school . After school I would take a five hour train to Prague . So it was quite intense at that time , but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent .
