You ' d think the Broncos would know by now that when it comes to feeling slighted , nobody gets revenge better than the Patriots . They seem to be at their best when they ' re playing with chips on their shoulders . Just look at how New England responded to the Deflategate mess . Brady put up some of his best regular season numbers in years , including the league ' s best interception percentage ( 1 . 1 percent ) and an NFL best 36 touchdowns passes . The Patriots obliterated teams out of the gate , winning their first 10 games before being slowed by injuries .
