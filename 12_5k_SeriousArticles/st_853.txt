Established in 1992 , the UNFCCC set broad objectives to drive actions to tackle climate change based on mounting scientific evidence that climate change is being caused by human induced greenhouse gas emissions . It stated that all countries are part of the solution , but that developed countries ? nations that have historically emitted the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions ? have a responsibility to take the lead on climate mitigation actions and to support developing countries affected by impacts of climate change such as increased extreme weather events , flooding and drought , but with limited resources to cope . The UNFCCC , however , did not set any emissions reduction targets or contain any enforcement mechanisms .
