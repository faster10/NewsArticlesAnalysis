KB : Absolutely . I was fortunate enough to be able to go around with him . And he worked for wonderful institutions , including the UN for many years so I met many of the Secretary Generals as a child . He worked for the Vatican , so I had a chance to meet the Pope and to attend mass at Christmas Eve . It was a very exciting , really inspiring time as I grew up serving as an interpreter in some of these countries when he was traveling .
