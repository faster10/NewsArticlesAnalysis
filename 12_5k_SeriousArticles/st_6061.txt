Common : A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent , gift , personality , quality and utilize it to help build others . And obviously a hero has done it to build themselves to a certain level . But you use the plateau you reached and you say , " Hey , I can do something for other people to help them to get to the same place I got to . " So I look at a hero as somebody who is willing to sacrifice that and go back and reach out for others .
