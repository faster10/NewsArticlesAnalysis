" On the other side of this election is the party of Reagan , the party of strong national defense and moral clarity , yet we have Republican candidates who propose that rulers like Assad and Putin should be partners of the United States , and who have voted with Barack Obama and Harry Reid rather than with our men and women in uniform . We have isolationist candidates who are apparently more passionate about weakening our military and intelligence capabilities than about destroying our enemies . They talk tough , yet they would strip us of the ability to keep our people safe . "
