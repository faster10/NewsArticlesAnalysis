Most surprising of these recommendations is that women under age 21 should not be tested . But it makes sense many sexually active women under 21 will develop a human papillomavirus infection , or HPV , which can lead to pre cancerous lesions . And when doctors see those lesions on a Pap test , they want to treat them . Yet nearly all of those lesions will disappear on their own without residual effects . And those that do not are easily treated years later . Treating them as soon as they ' re spotted can lead to cervical incompetence and miscarriage down the road .
