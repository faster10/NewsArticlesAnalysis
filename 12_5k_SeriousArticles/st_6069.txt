If you re supporting amnesty , you re supporting the Obama Clinton weakness and appeasement to radical Islamic terrorism indeed the Democratic unwillingness to utter the words , radical Islamic terrorism . If you are supporting amnesty , you re supporting the Ayatollah Khomeini having nuclear weapons in Iran . That s why the Democrats support it . I understand that . But for all the pundits who say gosh , the only way to win is nominate a candidate who s well liked in Washington , who supports amnesty . If we do that , we will lose .
