MR : I ' ve been figuring out how I can recreate the experience of going to your tailor and having something made for you and recently I partnered with a company called " Full Circle " based here in Rwanda and we ' ve been developing an app . There ' s a special collection of bow ties I ' m making right now and what will happen , the box will have a QR code and when you scan the QR code you can see your bow tie being made .
