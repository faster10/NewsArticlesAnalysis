In the case of attacking Isis , it is important to take on board that its leaders see the slaughter in Paris as a great success . At the cost of losing between eight and ten suicide bombers and gunmen and spending 100 , 000 , its name has echoed around the world . It may be execrated , but it has shown its strength as it did when it destroyed the Russian aircraft over Sinai on 30 October . This makes it all the more likely that British people will be the target of retaliation , with tourists being the easiest victims as they were in Tunisia . This is not a reason for modifying future policy , but it is worth keeping in mind that Isis is committed to retaliating against its enemies with suicide squads instructed to kill as many civilians as possible . ?
