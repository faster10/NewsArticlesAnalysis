We are trapped . Once again , we find ourselves wedged between the hammer of terrorism and the anvil of the European far right and of Republican neocons across the Atlantic . Every war has its mongers who profit from its sorrows , rubble and spilt blood . So too does terrorism . Along with its victims and perpetrators , it has its merchants who capitalize on its horrors , chaos and climates of fear and tension . To these , every terrorist bombing and shooting is a golden opportunity to revive arrogant racist notions in a new Islamophobic format , thus enabling them to penetrate further into the mainstream , gaining new territory and more votes . The target is no longer " Africans " , " Asians " , " blacks " , or " browns " , but " Muslims " , " Arabs " , " Middle Easterners " , or " Syrians " . Against these , all limits may be dispensed with , the unspeakable may be spoken , the unacceptable becomes acceptable .
