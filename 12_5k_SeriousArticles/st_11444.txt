RS : That reminds me of your collaboration with the Flaming Lips , which was so chaotic and balls to the wall . On the EP that comes with Warrior , you cover the country track " Old Flames Can ' t Hold a Candle to You , " and I kind of see you as a pop outlaw . There ' s an idea that pop is glossy and perfect , and you ' re like , " F k it , I ' m gonna do what I want . " And as a result you have this really strong connection with your fans .
