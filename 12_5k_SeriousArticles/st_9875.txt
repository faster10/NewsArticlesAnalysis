This is not a time to equivocate about allowing our police to shoot a terrorist to save the lives of innocent people . It is not a time to stand back and wish for another world where Jihadi John or Reyaad Khan could somehow be arrested , rather than stopped in their tracks . Neither is it a moment to question our support for our dedicated security and intelligence services , who risk their lives day in and day out ? often necessarily without any recognition ? in order to keep us safe .
