Gov . Sarah Palin : That ' s why I say I , like every American I ' m speaking with , we ' re ill about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out . But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy , helping the it ' s got to be all about job creation , too , shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right track . So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for Americans . And trade , we ' ve got to see trade as opportunity , not as a competitive , scary thing . But one in five jobs being created in the trade sector today , we ' ve got to look at that as more opportunity . All those things under the umbrella of job creation . This bailout is a part of that .
