As a long term Democratic foreign policy adviser to Senator Edward Kennedy , President Carter , President Clinton and Vice President Gore ' s presidential campaign it is a sad but honest admission that Obama ' s White House national security staff lives in an alternative foreign policy Pollyannaish universe . The blind are leading the blind in the West Wing . Neither Obama nor his staff have the foggiest notion where we are , where we should be , where we should not be in Syria , and what to effectively do against ISIS without falling into incoherent mission creep that serves neither Americans nor our interests in the region .
