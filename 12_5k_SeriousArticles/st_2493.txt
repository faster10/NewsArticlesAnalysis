Yahoo Sports ' Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Lue was " balancing that line " of hearing James and his agent , Rich Paul , complaining about Blatt , while " still urging them to give the coach a chance . " This seems like an awkward position to be in , but perhaps not quite as awkward as Blatt ' s . Cavs owner Dan Gilbert hired Blatt before James decided to return home , and Yahoo Sports reported that James ' camp had been undermining him from the start , even if no one had ever demanded a coaching change . It might be difficult to discipline a superstar player in that situation .
