Not surprisingly , Sanders ' campaign is touting those general election numbers . " There was fresh evidence on Sunday that confirms Bernie Sanders would be the most electable Democratic Party nominee for president because he performs much better than Hillary Clinton , " the campaign blasted out to reporters yesterday . But here is a legitimate question to ask : Outside of maybe New Hampshire ( where Sanders enjoys a geographic advantage ) , are Sanders ' general election numbers fool ' s gold ? When is the last time you ' ve seen national Republicans issue even a press release on Sanders ? Given the back and forth over Bill Clinton ' s past and given Sanders calling Bill Clinton ' s behavior " disgraceful " when is the last time anyone has brought up the candidate ' s 1972 essay about a woman fantasizing about " being raped by three men simultaneously " ? Bottom line : It ' s always instructive to take general election polling with a grain of salt , especially 300 days before the general election . And that ' s particularly true for a candidate who hasn ' t actually gone through the same wringer the other candidates have .
