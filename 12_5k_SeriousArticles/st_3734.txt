Last week , a team from Asia ' s largest English news magazine , India Today , travelled to the Greek island of Lesbos to meet global artist and activist Ai Weiwei . The excursion was part of the inaugural India Today Art Awards 2016 ' s International Spotlight . One of the pictures from our exclusive photo shoot shows Ai Weiwei lying face down on the pebbles next to the sea . This is a tribute to the tragic and everlasting image of three year old Aylan Kurdi , a Syrian refugee whose drowned body was washed up on a beach near the Turkish resort town of Bodrum last September .
