I side with Clinton on this one , said Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia . Mainly because I m just getting over two weeks of strep , laryngitis and coughing fits . That is a campaign malady that most candidates get from time to time . Clinton , ( Bernie ) Sanders and ( Donald ) Trump are all 68 to 74 ( years old ) . Of course , we should pay attention to their health . But you have to have real evidence of a serious problem , and I know of none for any of them .
