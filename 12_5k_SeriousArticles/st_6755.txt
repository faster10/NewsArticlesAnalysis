' Soldiers are trained to take action . If you are in operations you are in control . But in this situation you can ' t take any action . You just have to sit there waiting . It is madness . If the police want more than 28 days they should go to a judge to ask for it . If someone has done something wrong then they should be charged and if they are guilty then they should be punished . But to be left dangling is just wrong . '
