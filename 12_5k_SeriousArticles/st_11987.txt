C : DeAndre Jordan ( 7 , 600 ) vs . GS : ? Going after Curry and James precludes us from the biggest names at center , Cousins and Hassan Whiteside . Jordan is second in the NBA with 12 . 9 rebounds per game , trailing only the otherworldly Andre Drummond ( 18 . 9 ) . He s a near lock for a double double and his season average of 32 . 3 fantasy points per game every night , especially in one that will be as fast paced as Warriors Clippers .
