It didn ' t help that Patriots coach Bill Belichick , who has denied knowing anything about the deflated balls , has previously had to answer to accusations of unethically " spying " on another team . Belichick was fined 500 , 000 by the NFL in 2007 after it became clear that the Patriots had filmed the New York Jets ' defensive signals . It was the largest such fine in the league ' s history , and the team itself got slapped with an additional 250 , 000 penalty .
