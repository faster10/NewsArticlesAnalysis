9 . Packers ( 35 1 Previously 8 1 ) : Green Bay ' s offense has not looked right all year . The Packers ' defense will likely be down a No . 1 cornerback ( Sam Shields is doubtful with a concussion ) against a passing offense that has been incredibly tough to stop in its home stadium . But the Pack do have Aaron Rodgers . If he can outduel Kirk Cousins on Sunday , the Pack will either head to Carolina or Arizona , depending who wins the Vikings Seahawks matchup .
