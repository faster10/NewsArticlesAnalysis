His gutsy decision hog tied the momentum that had up to that point been ping ponging back and forth all night . The Crimson Tide wrestled control of the game after his call and sealed their triumph with two late touchdowns . Senior running back Kenyan Drake s 95 yard kickoff return for a score with about eight minutes left put the game out of reach , and Henry iced the title in the waning minutes with a one yard touchdown run .
