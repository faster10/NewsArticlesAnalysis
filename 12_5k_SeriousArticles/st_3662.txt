Blige : I guess what got me through when I was young was something I guess a lot of people don ' t have and that was just the will . . . . I don ' t know what was driving me . I guess it was something in me did want to die you know , I guess my spirit didn ' t want to die , but my physical body definitely was at some point was like I gotta get out of here . . . . My physical body was contemplating suicide and all this other crazy stuff , and my spirit is what saved me , I believe .
