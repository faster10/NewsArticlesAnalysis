How would it work ? Imagine that I take a picture of a new Fiat 500 through Instagram and posted it to my Facebook timeline along with my text . " Just saw the new FIAT 500 . Looks cool ! ( Like ! ) " Facebook will want to sell that post back to Fiat as something the car company can promote on my friends ' pages . Turning that image into an advertisement means that my endorsement stays on my friends ' pages long after the original post has been topped by other updates .
