But I just want to become relatable , you know what I m saying ? It s bigger than race . It s more so of opening up a door for guys that don t want to be labeled , that have bigger views and say : Well , I m in this situation , I m living in this environment right now , but I also want to be an artist , I want to be a poet . But I don t have the means , you know , to necessarily do the right things at that point .
