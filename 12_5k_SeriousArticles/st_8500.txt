While there was silliness in Skyfall ( Javier Bardem s Joker lite villain s plan becomes more nonsensical on second viewing ) , it succeeded largely because of a grounded tone that separated it from many previous instalments . At Monday s premiere , Sam Mendes referred to Spectre as more flamboyant yet still retaining the emotional core of the last film . It s definitely a lighter film , both in atmosphere and plotting , and at times , feels like a less sexist Roger Moore outing . After Skyfall , given the continuation of some of the events , it does jar somewhat . The film s lurch towards something resembling real world emotion centres around Bond s surprisingly sentimental relationship with L a Seydoux s psychologist ( more on that later ) which feels poorly developed . But , despite the camper tone , it somehow felt less fun than Skyfall .
