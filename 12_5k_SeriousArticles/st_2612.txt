" Every film is so difficult to make . But I have to tell that in my experience this has been the most difficult journey that I have embarked myself . But I was lucky to be safe , and rescued , by an incredible crew , cast , producers . . . we struggled for so many months . . . in very difficult conditions to make this film happen . But we all in this room know very well that pain is temporary . But a film is forever , right ? So who cares . "
