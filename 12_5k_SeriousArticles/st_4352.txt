Great Britain have the Murray brothers , their old coach , and their mum , Judy . I know she ll be very nervous , Jamie says . She was under a lot of strain when watching me and Andy have that five setter against the Aussies . But this is a special moment for her . She was a pretty good player herself but it was tough for her being in Scotland with the limited facilities . When we were growing up she made sure we got the things that she didn t . That gave us the best chance to be tennis players . She was very smart in that way .
