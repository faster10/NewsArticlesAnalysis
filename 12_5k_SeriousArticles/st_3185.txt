" The Big Year " is a charming , uplifting and heartwarming film , and when it ' s funny ( which is often ) , it ' s very funny indeed . It has a simple but compelling story to which everyone , birders and non , can relate , great chemistry between Martin and Black , and a heart . It ' s nice to see a film that doesn ' t have a mean streak and also doesn ' t talk to adults like they are idiots .
