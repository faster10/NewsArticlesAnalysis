Bryan Hartnell , one of only two survivors of the Zodiac Killer , was just a college kid more than 40 years ago at Pacific Union College , just north of San Francisco , when he and a then girlfriend , Cecilia Shephard , were attacked while picnicking . Their attacker was a man in an eerie costume : he wore a black hood and black shirt with a white symbol on the front that looked like crosshairs on a gun sight . That image would later become the Zodiac ' s trademark symbol .
