9 : 42 p . m . Hearing a noise , my wife and I go upstairs to check on Jack ( 6 ) . He says he was having a bad dream . We lie down with him , three of us in a twin bed . It ' s crowded , but if we brought him into our bed again , we ' d never get him out . His breath is still sweet and milky on my cheek . How could this not be okay ? This is my family .
