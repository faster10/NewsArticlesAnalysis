( On what he was not seeing from Cary Williams ) Just trying to give a guy a chance to play , and see what we have . DeShawn Shead deserves a chance . You see other guys , we ll give guys opportunities and see how they do . There ve been some plays that were made that we just wanted to see some improvement on , and see some carry over from weeks past . I thought it was time to give DeShawn a chance to see if he could do it .
