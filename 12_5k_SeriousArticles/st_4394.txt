' I ' m a very proud New Zealander and I follow closely what happens over there , particularly with the other sports , ' said Gatland . ' If the All Blacks are playing someone else then I ' m cheering for them , but there ' s no one more desperate to win on Saturday than me . My mother in law was asked who she ' s going to support at the weekend and she said " Wales of course , because family come first " . I ' m totally focussed on my role here and my dedication is 100 per cent to Wales . '
