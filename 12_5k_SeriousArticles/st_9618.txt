The Bucks had to get rid of Jackson , who was constantly clashing with Scott Skiles ( who ' s now in Orlando ) . They had to shake the team up , and Andrew Bogut could never get healthy . So they dealt Jackson and Bogut to . . . Golden State , which knew Bogut could still be the rim protector it needed . In return , Milwaukee got Monta Ellis ( who was later traded to Dallas and then signed in Indiana ) , Kwame Brown ( out of the league ) and Ekpe Udoh ( same ) .
