The Quran reveres as sacred , more than any other woman , Mary , the mother of Jesus , and values Moses as a brave and holy prophet , the Torah as a divine book that Muslims must believe in , and the Injeel ( the Christian Gospel ) as a sacred text that Muslims must accept as legitimate . Further , the Quran documents the right to multiple paths to God s redemption and salvation through many faiths . In sum , Islam as documented in the Quran , embraces plurality of religions , the right to choose to believe or not and the equal value placed on individuals of all beliefs ? precisely in line with American values .
