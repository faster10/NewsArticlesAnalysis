Being on the ground has its advantages of course , and I have enjoyed my first hot bath and sleeping in a proper bed . But there is a hard side to it too , and I miss the tree and the birds more than I could have imagined . I miss the daily visits from the curious currawongs who would hop around on my platform . I miss watching the trees sway in the wind . I miss the sound of boo book owls calling gently across the moonlit valley . I miss the constant presence of the tree by my side .
