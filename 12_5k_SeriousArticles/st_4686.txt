" I ' m absolutely convinced . . . that the Lewinsky affair really energized social conservatives and so angered a lot of people , and they had nowhere to vent that anger , " he said . " They couldn ' t vote against Clinton . . . . If they had gone to the polls they would have voted for Gore , but they were just disgusted . " Gore , who in many ways ran away from Clinton in the 2000 election would go on to lose , despite winning the popular vote .
