I ' m not looking for understanding or sympathy . It is easy for me to come to terms with my actions , basically because it has to be . I was woken up one night in Afghanistan and told to take out a Taliban fighter . I did it and I was back in my bed asleep ten minutes later as if nothing had happened . Sometimes it is that easy mentally . I couldn ' t be constantly thinking or worrying about what I was doing because I would have big problems , wouldn ' t I ?
