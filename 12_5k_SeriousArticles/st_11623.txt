The Oscars were never designed for us . There are actors who have never gotten an Oscar and have done amazing work . If you are waiting for an award of a little . . . gold statue and that s supposed to validate you , then you ' re not in this business for the right reasons . We do the work . It s about the work . It s about taking the pages of a script and bringing them to life . It ain t that deep . We get paid a lot of money to do very little work .
