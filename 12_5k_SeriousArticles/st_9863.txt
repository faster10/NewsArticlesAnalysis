I know Hamilton has a caretaker who helps him out on the road , but I think it ' s taken a lot of stick to itiveness by Josh . You know he ' s had a second chance , had a couple of hiccups , but he ' s made the most of it . Addiction is a sickness we should look at it like that . I think we should welcome what he ' s done . He ' s not only a great player , but he ' s also become a leader on that team and that ' s the most interesting part of that to me .
