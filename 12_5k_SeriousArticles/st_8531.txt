' When I was playing matches I was waking up sore and stiff so I wasn ' t necessarily match fit , whereas now I feel in good match shape . My first match of the year was long but I woke up with no issues . I feel strong and balanced . I have been doing a lot more speed work on the court . I have been working a lot on my movement in the off season three , four days a week . That isn ' t something I have done much of over the last few years .
