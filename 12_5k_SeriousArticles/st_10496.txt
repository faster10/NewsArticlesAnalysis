" We historically , if a taxpayer has lost electronic records , have said if you have other indications and evidence of what went on , we ' ll take that from you , " he said . " If you lose a document , it doesn ' t mean you lose the argument . We actually work with taxpayers to say we ' ll look at other evidence . . . and if we can find any evidence to support your case and , in fact , if the circumstances support your case , we ' ll support you and you won ' t have any problems .
