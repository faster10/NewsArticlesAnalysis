" Anytime a question is raised about a clinical program or a patient ' s care , we bring all involved parties together and review the situation and circumstances in a ' no holds barred ' manner , " wrote the University of Kentucky in a statement last Friday . " Sometimes we even choose to put a program ' on hold , ' until we are certain that we are doing everything necessary to provide the highest level of care . This is what we did with our Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery program . "
