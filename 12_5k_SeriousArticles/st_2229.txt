As someone who loved him but never felt like I knew him the way I wish I could , it ' s a big deal to recast the way you see your grandfather when he ' s 90 years old . It helps me understand why the archivist was just as cool as the colonel ( as proved by a fellow archivist geeking out over finding a marker he once used ) , and makes it that much more special when I meet someone who still calls me " the colonel ' s grandson .
