Asked whether the United States could accept a plan that allows Assad to remain in power , Rice said : We do not believe so . Our strong view is that Assad has lost all legitimacy that the fact that he has been directly responsible for the deaths of so many of his own people means that a transition ultimately will have to result in a legitimate government coming to power in the context of a transition . And it s very hard to envision how that could be accomplished with Assad still in power .
