" Wayman ' s one of the biggest reasons why I chose Oklahoma , " said Stacey King , Tisdale ' s Oklahoma teammate and a former Chicago Bulls player . " I wanted to be part of something special , and it made logical sense to go to OU , because I wanted to pattern my game after him . I wanted to be like him . People used to talk about ' Be like Mike Jordan , ' but I wanted to be like Wayman . We ' ve lost a special person . I don ' t think there will ever be another Wayman Tisdale . "
