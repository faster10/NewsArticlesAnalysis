" I would not be able to afford vegetables if it wasn ' t for my garden , " said Autaubo , 52 , who got her first seeds from The Dinner Garden and now volunteers with Hirshberg . " I can grow tomatoes , eggplant , bell pepper in just flower pots . . . . I ' ve got a trellis with cucumbers growing on it . If I want a carrot , I just go out to the garden and get a carrot . I don ' t even have to leave my apartment . "
