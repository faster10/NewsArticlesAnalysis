" My little Vivienne we call her my shadow , because there ' s nothing I can do to shake her , " Jolie tells Elle . " I can be tired , I can be grumpy , I can be in a terrible mood , and she doesn ' t care . It ' s ' Mommy , Mommy , ' and she ' ll cling to me . We knew that she would still do that thing , she ' d still smile at me and insist that I pick her up . So we couldn ' t really cast anybody else . "
