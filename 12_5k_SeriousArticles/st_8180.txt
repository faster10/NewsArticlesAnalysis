New York Jets : We re talking about two top 10 defenses , so look for a close and relatively low scoring game . The difference will be the Jets ability to exploit the Titans porous secondary . As long they make the Titans one dimensional and prevent Marcus Mariota from making highlight film runs , the Jets should be able to avoid what looms as a dangerous trap game . It would be the Jets first three game winning streak since 2011 . Jets 23 , Titans 17 . Rich Cimini
