Next head up to lively Chinatown to shop and bargain for knock off designer handbags and various tat around Canal Street . If feeling peckish , have dim sum at New Green Bo Restaurant , known for its no frills decor and delicious dumplings . Or continue on to Nolita ( via Little Italy ) to lunch at cool , low key Caf Gitane , or in SoHo at the beautiful French restaurant Balthazar ( often a hangout of celebs ) . Shoppers will want to save time for the boutiques of Nolita and the higher end designer shops in SoHo .
