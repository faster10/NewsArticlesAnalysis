realfootballfan ? You make sense , but I think it s the opposing coaches who have made better adjustments in those games . Our coaches have had games where halftime adjustments made for better second halves ? the first Seattle game , we slowed Wilson Graham down enough to make the comeback . In the first Atlanta game , we kept Atlanta from coming back after we built a good lead . It all depends on the matchups from week to week ? and for us , to keep going for all 60 minutes .
