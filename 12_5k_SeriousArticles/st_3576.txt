There was no sense on the GOP stage that the incident with the sailors or the prisoner exchanges could be viewed as examples of successful diplomacy . No one quite threatened war if something similar were to happen on their watch ( though Christie came close ) , but the bigger question is why there seems to be something approaching a desire for war with Iran among some Republicans and a near across the board rejection of the idea that diplomacy and reduced tensions might be a good thing . The simple answer , of course , is that most Republicans ( and , to be fair , quite a few Democrats ) have accepted the most pessimistic interpretation of the Iran nuclear agreement . This includes the ( basically false ) ideas that it allows Iran to obtain nuclear weapons in 15 years and in the meantime allows the Iranians to inspect themselves . It starts , however , from an even more basic fallacy : that by talking to Iran at all the Obama administration has demonstrated weakness .
