I n seven years under President Obama , the U . S . has added an average of 107 , 000 jobs a month . Under President Clinton , the economy added about 240 , 000 jobs a month . Under George W . Bush , it was only 13 , 000 a month . If you win the nomination , you ll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton . How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans ?
