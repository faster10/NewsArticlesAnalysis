In Hangzhou we have a traditional pagoda . When I go in this pagoda , suddenly I understand some things . For example , it is huge , but if you see it from a distant place , on some special day when the sun is at different angles , you will find that this pagoda just disappears it totally blends into the mountains so you can ' t see it . It is then that I suddenly understand how I can design big modern buildings using the traditional ways , how buildings can disappear in the landscape .
