Although technically we lived in the United States , the Cuban community was culturally insular in Miami during the 1970s , bonded together by the trauma of exile . What ' s more , it seemed that practically everyone was Cuban : my teachers , my classmates , the mechanic , the bus driver . I didn ' t grow up feeling different or treated as a minority . The few kids who got picked on in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny last names like Dawson and O ' Neil .
