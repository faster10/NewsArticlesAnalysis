Contract offer or not , Sam Bradford does not appear to be the most ideal long term solution for the Eagles at quarterback . The pursuit of a franchise quarterback under Chip Kelly could realistically enter year four , which is absurd on so many levels in itself . But what about San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick ? Kaepernick s benching in San Francisco has started to ignite some around Philadelphia to think he could be just the right player to run Kelly s offense if no other options are available . And hey , maybe a change of scenery is just what is needed for Kaepernick to turn his career around after a promising start and a run to the Super Bowl .
