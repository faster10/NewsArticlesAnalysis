These are good and essential first steps , but unless they can now be implemented as a basis on which the parties can move to further , bolder steps to reverse underlying trends , Ukraine could still slide into civil war . If this happened , how would it affect American national interests ? Could Ukraine become a 21st century echo of the Balkans in the 1990s , when the collapse of Yugoslavia saw a decade of war between Serbs , Croatians , Bosnians and Kosovars ? ( No one should forget that just a century ago Ukraine was sucked into a tragic , bloody civil war shortly after gaining independence in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution . )
