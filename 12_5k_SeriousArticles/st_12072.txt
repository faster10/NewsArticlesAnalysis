While Salkantay offers a glimpse at Quechuan communities , the Lares trek offers a full panorama of the Quechuan lifestyle . Against a picturesque landscape , this four day three night trek is famous for the textile villages it enters along the way . It ascends 13 , 000 feet , crosses two peaks , hot springs and lakes , and it offers a spectrum of regional animals to view , including llamas , vicu as , alpacas and chinchillas . However , since the trek gained popularity five years ago , " It has become a little more touristy . It has lost a little bit of its initial essence and purity , " said Silvia Rico , general manager of Enigma Adventure Tour Operator .
