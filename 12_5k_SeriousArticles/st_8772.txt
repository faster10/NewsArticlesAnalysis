There is a plaque on Cole Hill in Plymouth , Massachusetts : Since 1970 , Native Americans have gathered at noon on Cole s Hill in Plymouth to commemorate a National Day of Mourning on the US Thanksgiving Holiday . Perhaps we should pray for restraint so as to not ruin our God given health with too much God given food . They may have had native pumpkins , but they certainly didn t have pies , which would have required butter and wheat . The other a celebration . It is believed that friendly Indians gave the pilgrims wild turkeys and venison .
