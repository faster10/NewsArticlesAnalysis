' I wanted to start off well . I thought I did many things well . But , you know , I ' m not going into next week throwing flowers at myself or anything . I ' m starting from scratch . I ' m hungry . I ' m determined to do better . I lost in the fourth round here ( last year ) . That ' s not a result I want . I want to do much better . I ' m here to try to win the title . '
