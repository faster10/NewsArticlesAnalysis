I think he s tapped into the sense on the left that not enough was done , that Obama made too many compromises on health care reform , on Dodd Frank , they didn t break up the banks and no one went to jail , he said . It s a real sentiment ? I think he s tapped into that . Do I think that his policies enjoy support from a majority of the country ? No , I don t . And there s evidence of that , and I don t think there s any path to him getting his policies enacted .
