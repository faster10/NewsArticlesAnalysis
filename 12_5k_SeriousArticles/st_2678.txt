Keep in mind : The Bengals have two good backs in Gio Bernard and Jeremy Hill , but the running game wasn ' t that great this season . They had just five 20 yard runs ( second lowest in the NFL ) , no 40 yard runs and their 3 . 9 yard average was tied for 21st in the NFL . Keep a close eye on their running game early the Bengals getting something positive going on the ground might be the difference between them winning and losing . ?
