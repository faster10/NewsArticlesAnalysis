RZA : I ' m me and the me that ' s me is me and is going to continue to be me , and it ' s always reaching and growing . I ' m grateful for what I ' ve accomplished . I ' m grateful for anyone who thinks I accomplished something and says , " Well he did this he did that . " I ' m proud to be accepted , but I feel like I ' ve just scratched the surface for some weird reason .
