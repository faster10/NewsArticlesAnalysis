When you also consider that the professional analysis commissioned by Planned Parenthood found the CMP video footage was so altered it wouldn t hold up in court , and that David Daleiden admitted to using photographs he found on the internet in the videos as stand ins for so called Planned Parenthood partial birth abortions , and multiple experts in the field of human tissue procurement corroborating Planned Parenthood s claim that the prices discussed in the video would not yield a profit , it would seem that CMP has a whole lot of nothing on Planned Parenthood .
