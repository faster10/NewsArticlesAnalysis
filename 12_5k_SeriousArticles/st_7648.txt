Over the past several months , Detroit teachers , who are barred by Michigan law from striking , have staged more and more sickouts to protest their frozen wages and the disgusting conditions of their schools , which one teacher detailed in the Washington Post : water damage everywhere , destroyed gyms and playgrounds , exposed wires from missing ceiling tiles , a dripping ceiling covered with toxic black mold . ( One school reported that debris str uck a student in the head during testing . ) ? In some schools , there s no heating in others , indoor temperatures reach a suffocating 90 degrees . Oh , and let s not forget to add rats and roaches to the list of grotesque environmental hazards blighting schools throughout the city .
