The Bengals are a physical team . When they are allowed to play power football , there aren t many teams that can withstand the pressure . This was another poor showing for the ground game . The Bengals had 99 yards rushing , but when you erase Dalton s numbers ? as he ran for his life ? the Bengals had a mere 65 yards on the ground . When did Dalton become a scrambling quarterback ? It s great to have Dalton getting out of trouble , but he shouldn t have as many yards as the premier back ? that s not a good sign . The running game is still in limbo , and the numbers look eerily similar to the Houston statistics .
