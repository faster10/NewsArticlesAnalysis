As his campaign has progressed , Trump s position on some key issues seems to be to the left of Clinton s ? on the Iraq War , especially ? and in her general neighborhood on others : taxation of the rich , entitlements , universal health care . He is a nightmare of chainsaw massacre proportions to Establishment conservatives . Their panic may be premature , though . This election reminds me of this exact moment in the 2004 Democratic nominating process when Howard Dean was a house afire and John Kerry seemed deader than Jeb Bush does now . I d love to see Dean get the nomination , Karl Rove , who was running George W . Bush s re election campaign , told me in November 2003 . But he won t . Americans don t elect angry Presidents . It is a basic truth : Any candidacy based solely on adrenaline will inevitably crash . Trump should check with Dr Carson about the chemistry , or just ask Howard Dean , who had a far more righteous cause for anger than Trump ? the Iraq War ? but no second act .
