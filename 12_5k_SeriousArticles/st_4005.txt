' The good thing is that expectation is already at saturation point , so I don ' t think that will be an issue , ' he said . ' Every week he ' s the main man so he ' s used to it . I think the main issue for Rory is that so many other players are playing so well . Take Dustin Johnson . Rory ' s big thing was that he ' d hit a driver everywhere while most players would hit three wood . And he ' d hit it straight so that made him not just long but doubly long . But Dustin does the same thing and he ' s 20 yards longer than Rory .
