Islamophobic times should be used as an opportunity for American Muslims to unite behind peaceful , non divisive religious leaders and to positively influence American policy rather than divide as a result of wars abroad . Shias and Sunnis must agree to disagree respectfully , without denouncing each other ' s beliefs or using wars in the Middle East as an excuse to " brand " one another . Now is the time to let acts like the execution of Nimr inspire Muslims to work harder to unify , not to divide further along sectarian lines . In today ' s tumultuous times , American Muslim leaders , institutions , and citizens alike must denounce sectarian dialogue and injustice as loudly as they denounce terrorism in the name of Islam .
