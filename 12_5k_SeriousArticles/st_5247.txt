Kamar Aiken vs . Seahawks : Matt Schaub ( chest , shoulder ) is expected to be ready to make the home start against Seattle despite missing practice Wednesday and Thursday . If he isn t able to go , Jimmy Clausen will get the nod . It s been a trying season for the Ravens and one wrecked by injuries . Aiken has taken over default No . 1 receiver duties and is averaging 10 . 5 targets per game since Steve Smith Sr . went down . He s returned value as a solid , low upside WR3 . It s unclear if Richard Sherman will shadow Aiken on Sunday , but this isn t a week we re looking to take chances on pedestrian talent like Aiken . The Seahawks have allowed the third fewest fantasy points to receivers .
