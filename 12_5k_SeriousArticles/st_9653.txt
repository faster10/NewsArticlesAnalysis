Despite calls by the Egyptians , the United Nations and the U . S . secretary of state , fighting not only continues , but has escalated in the last few days . Israeli airstrikes , missile and artillery attacks , and naval gunfire have increased in tempo and lethality . The targets of the Israeli attacks have also expanded into areas normally considered to be off limits , such as the al Amin mosque in Gaza City , struck during the early morning hours of July 29 . That same night saw attacks on the Hamas run al Aqsa radio station and homes of senior Hamas officials . This expands the target set beyond pure military targets and goes to the political structure of Hamas .
