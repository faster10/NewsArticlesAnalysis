After doing my homework on several companies , I chose one that actually used a plaster mold to fit me . I was disappointed to say the least and am currently wearing an off the shelf prosthesis that fits in a special bra or can be worn with a special sock or sleeve in a regular bra . Needless to say , the custom prosthesis was not as " custom " as I thought it would be . I said to myself there has to be a better product and at least more options available for women .
