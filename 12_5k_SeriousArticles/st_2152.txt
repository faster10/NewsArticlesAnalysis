But then it was time to get down and dirty about the latest round of Donald Trump nonsense . Throughout history , you ve had demagogues trying to divert attention away from the real issues , Sanders said . And what someone like Trump is trying to do is divide us up . A few months ago , we were supposed to hate Mexicans that he thinks are all criminals and rapists . Now , we are supposed to hate Muslims . And that kind of crap is not going to work in the United States of America .
