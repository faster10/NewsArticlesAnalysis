AM : I think that bringing up children whilst being in the role of director is the biggest challenge and I think it ' s something that needs to be recognized , so ideally the industry will respond to that . I think it is a real challenge , and I think since early cinema it has become a very male dominated industry and we ' ve had , sadly , reports of sexism on set which is a real worry . Obviously , those reports aren ' t commonplace . . . Everyone needs to know that that ' s the case and we need to support the women in the industry .
