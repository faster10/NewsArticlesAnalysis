Chlumsky : Yeah but that ' s what was so great about coming to the decision as an adult because I kind of know that ' s a hazard of the job . I had to prepare myself and know that I ' m strong enough to persevere through that , and I am rational enough to realize that only one person can get any role , and it doesn ' t mean it ' s personal . It doesn ' t mean you ' re bad . I came at it from a much healthier point of view .
