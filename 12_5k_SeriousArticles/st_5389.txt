Al Maliki will surely amplify the significance of this weekend ' s purported public appearance of the notorious leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , Abu Bakr al Baghdadi , in Mosul to argue that the " Islamic caliphate " is a clear and present danger that supersedes the need to form a unity government . He will probably argue that only he can attack the caliphate threat as commander in chief and that it has to be done now , not after a protracted government formation process . He will also probably urge Iran to quiet Shiite opposition to his premiership so that he can perform the urgent work of commander in chief .
