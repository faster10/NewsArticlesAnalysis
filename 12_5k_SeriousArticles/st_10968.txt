However , those quick to blame Islam for terrorism pose an interesting question , ex Muslim Roy Abbas phrases it this way : " The issue should not be that all Muslims are terrorists , it should be why most terrorists are Muslims . " If we were to make choppy analogies , I would reply to this school of thought by pointing out that perhaps the logic holds because we do not count the funders of terrorism , and the United States . The US still allies with such counties as Saudi Arabia and Qatar for strategic reasons on the one hand , while pointing fingers at them with the other . Therefore , yes , the majority of terrorists look like Muslims because we do not include the creators and funders of terrorism in that definition . It is like posing that the issue should not be that all white supremacists are Christian , but why most of them are . The sweeping generalizations are just absurd . We know the logic falls flat on its face and so Christian affiliated terrorists such as Anders Behring and the Klan are quickly labeled lone rangers who do not represent Christianity . Heck , if we want to go back into history we can point out that slavery and abolition were both argued from biblical scripture , and yet we don ' t see a shunning Christianity because its scriptures were somehow abused to achieve means that we now know to be completely unrelated to Christianity .
