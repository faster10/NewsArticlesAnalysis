For a week I watched relatively scantily clad models on a runway in a blast proof basement of a 7 star hotel just a short drive from the Islamic militant hubs in the troubled northwest . There was a latent atmosphere of volatility : fundamentalists don ' t have to try hard to work out that these hotels are crawling with Westerners and Pakistani liberals 365 days a year . As a result , the seats at the fashion shows were often half empty . Social events such as these are few and far between in Pakistan . A young Pakistani rapper we met while out there told us how he struggles to perform live , as live events are often shut down for risk of militant attacks . More than serving as a platform for the textile industry and an attempt at improving Pakistan ' s world image , the Fashion Week was predominantly just something for people to do , a distraction from the adversity of daily life there .
