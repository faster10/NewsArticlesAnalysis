7 . Kansas City s Travis Kelce entered Saturday s game against the Patriots as the second most productive tight end in the NFL in yards after the catch and yards after contact during the regular season ( behind Gronkowski ) , which is why his final stat line was so notable ? six catches for 23 yards ( 3 . 8 avg . ) . That speaks , in part , to the work of Patriots safety Chung . I don t know many strong safeties , if any , playing better football than him right now , said McCourty . I think he doesn t get the respect and praise he deserves . He loves it when Bill stands up here and tells us how good an opposing tight end is he takes that challenge and plays with a chip on his shoulder . Chung the tight end eraser ? Don t think too many people thought that s the way it would unfold when he re signed with the Patriots in 2014 .
