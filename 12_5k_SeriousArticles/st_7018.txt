Mason is a flat out bulldog . He didn ' t shoot well , didn ' t score a lot of points , but he calmly directed the Jayhawks through this game on the offensive end and tried to stick with Buddy Hield on the defensive end . Sticking with Hield is near impossible , not to mention exhausting , but Mason didn ' t let it change his attack on offense . He dished out six assists , pulled down seven rebounds and ultimately won the game with his toughness .
