There was Terrell Owens pulling a Sharpie out of his sock after a touchdown and autographing the ball ( for which he reportedly received a 20 , 000 fine ) , Joe Horn hiding a mobile phone behind a goal post and pretending to make a call on it ( 30 , 000 fine ) , and Chad Johnson doing a Riverdance , pretending to propose to a cheerleader , donning a jacket implying he was bound for the Hall of Fame , and even holding up a sign reading " Dear NFL , PLEASE don ' t fine me AGAIN ! ! ! ! ! " ( for which he earned another 10 , 000 fine ) .
