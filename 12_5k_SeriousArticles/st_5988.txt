I don ' t need any fancy , goopy dressings compromising my vegetables . ( What does a ranch actually taste like , anyway ? ) Sometimes , I might throw some almonds or walnuts up in there . I ' ve been known to be down with blueberries and mandarin oranges . I like bacon or grilled chicken on occasion . I am not a fan of unnecessary carbs like croutons . And then there are those moments I go crazy and get a friss e freakin ' salad .
