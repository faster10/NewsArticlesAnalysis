To try and mitigate the hit , the farm bill beefs up a different kind of subsidy a subsidy for crop insurance . This is complex , but in short , the government will make crop insurance cheaper and it will pay out some benefits at lower levels than previously . That will make farming less risky for some . But it transfers that risk to the federal government , which could be even more on tap if crop prices plummet or if a disaster hits . Good for farmers , risky for the deficit .
