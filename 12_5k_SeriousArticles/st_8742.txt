On the upside : you can easily and quickly avoid any talk of international sanctions by coming to your senses . You have a tough winter coming up , and many early caucuses to get through , but we have faith that by March , May at the outside , none of us will have to repeat this conversation , and you will never see the inside of a sanction ( trust us , they don ' t look pretty ) . Just keep Mr Trump out of the picture , and we ' ll all be friends . But remember what could happen in July . Our trade and tourist doors will begin to close , and you wouldn ' t want that , would you ? We didn ' t think so .
