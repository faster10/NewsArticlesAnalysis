When her cancer was first diagnosed , doctors told Marci she had leiomyosarcoma , a particularly rare and aggressive form of cancer . A licensed practical nurse , Marci looked up the diagnosis online and called to tell me that something sounded strange she had the leiomyosarcoma only in her brain and nowhere else , and such leiomyosarcoma cases are so rare , they get written up in medical journals . Plus , people with leiomyosarcoma often have had diseases like HIV , or have had lots of radiation earlier in life . Marci had neither .
