Once BJP leader LK Advani described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an excellent event manager . Though Advani is now being ignored by the RSS BJP leadership , the country is being reminded of this . When not travelling abroad , event managing NRI gatherings , Modi is busy hosting foreign heads of state and planning travels . The promise of providing minimum government , maximum governance has been thrown to the wind . The patronage being provided to the politics of communal hate has virtually erased the distinction between the government and the mob . We keep hearing that the sharpening of communal polarisation is the handiwork of fringe elements . The distinction between the fringe and the core is a spurious one .
