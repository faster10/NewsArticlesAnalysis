It is clear from cell phone intercepts that the handlers in Pakistan were senior leaders of the Jaish e Mohammad . This organisation of violent fanatics was spawned by the Pakistani army with the specific purpose of waging an insidious , cowardly war against India . It is the sister of Lashkar e Taiba , whose Islamist foot soldiers were responsible for 26 11 , and like that time this time too there were identifiable handlers in Pakistan . So if we want to continue talking to Pakistan , and we should , then is it not time that it was General Raheel Sharif we talked to instead of poor , hapless Nawaz Sharif ? We should know by now that elected governments in Pakistan do not control foreign policy , but we continue to pretend otherwise . It is because of this pretence that Pakistan seems to be winning this ugly war .
