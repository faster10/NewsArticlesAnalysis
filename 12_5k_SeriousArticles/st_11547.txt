Alas , there are a few oversights in the form of cheap components , such as switchgear and air vents some folks might recognize from lesser brands that were Aston Martin s siblings back when owned by Ford Motor Company , as well as a navigation screen that has an awkward downward angle . The steering wheel is downright ugly , the plus two rear seats are unfit for humans ( though make for lavish shelves for brief cases , purses , and gym bags ) and the cup holders are a not too funny joke .
