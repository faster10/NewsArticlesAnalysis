PF : Not . No one consulted Britain when France decided to start bombing IS in Syria . They didn t consult us before indulging in this adventurism . We should not be dragged into the Syrian mire . We should not make our security hostage to people like the French , the Americans , the Saudis and the Turks who want to pursue an adventurous policy . Cameron said that we shouldn t subcontract security . I say we should not make ourselves hostage to the actions of others .
