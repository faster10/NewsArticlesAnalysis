The constitution debars anyone from the office of president if s he has a spouse or children who are foreign nationals . This directly affects Suu Kyi , whose late husband was British , as are her two sons . The constitution also limits the role of political parties to 75 per cent seats , the rest are reserved for the military . This makes amendments to the constitution almost impossible , which rules out a Suu Kyi presidency completely . Some feel that she may stand for the post of speaker .
