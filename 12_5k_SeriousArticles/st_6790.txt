The New York City ban , which was phased in between 2007 and 2008 , was the first of its kind to target trans fats in restaurants , bakeries and other food service establishments . The ban prohibits restaurants from serving foods or using ingredients that contain 0 . 5 grams or more of trans fats per serving . ( The 0 . 5 gram cutoff is a nod to the FDA , which allows foods containing less than that amount to claim " zero " trans fats on their labels . )
