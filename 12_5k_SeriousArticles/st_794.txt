I guess I ' m really fortunate because I ' ve been on the Internet a long time and I think I ' ve gotten a lot better at letting things people say roll off my back . I think you have to remember that people that people that put that much time and energy into hating strangers on the Internet aren ' t generally very happy in their offline lives . That helps me kind of push a lot of that stuff out . I try not to give them too much energy , but sometimes it ' s good to have a good laugh .
