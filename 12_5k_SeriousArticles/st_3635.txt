I am not going to mince words . When the House voted to cut 40 billion to the food stamp program over the next 10 years , that wasn ' t an example of government tightening its belt or making tough choices . That vote wasn ' t a philosophy or an ideology about governing . Pure and simple , it was a heartless act . It was cruel . It was kicking millions of our families , neighbors and friends when they are down . And the people who work for a living in this country are down .
