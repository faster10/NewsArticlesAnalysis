Edwards , whose only previous film was 2010 ' s low budget " Monsters , " has been given a quick call up to the majors with the reported 160 million " Godzilla . " He doesn ' t seem too interested in his actors " they ' re more plodding than their reptilian costars and you don ' t care about a single one of them " but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem . Taking a cue from " Jaws , " he wisely delays Godzilla ' s appearance , building suspense . In movies like these , it ' s all about the slow tease and the big reveal . As an appetizer , though , he gives us a pair of ' ' MUTOs ' ' ( massive unidentified terrestrial organisms ) " a male and female duo of giant , Giger esque creatures with sleek pincer jaws that resemble humongous staple removers . The MUTOs , who arrive on the scene after leveling a Japanese nuclear reactor , care about two things : feeding on the radiation that created them and mating with each other in . . . San Francisco of all places . Tony Bennett would be proud .
