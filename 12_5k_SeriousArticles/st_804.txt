The Russians make Cyprus ' s financial sector too large , it is claimed . But it is still not as large as Luxembourg ' s , and not too different from those of other small nations with a highly educated labour force .

You try to fix it , with better regulation of risk and other vulnerabilities . But then they shoot the horses , don ' t they ?
