" There is as well a coin type cell ( which ) is a backup battery , and 2 Board to board connectors . On one of these connectors is plugged a keypad that was as well removed . Another metallic component on the top left of the electronic board ( partly hidden under a screw ) seems to be a small vibration component , used on cell phones ( when vibrate mode is enabled ) . So this board is very likely to be the main electronic board of a cell phone device . "
