Kearney : I don ' t think , to be a traveler , you have to reject setting roots up . That ' s the fun of this whole journey for me . There are people I love in Nashville and would not want to go a day without talking to , but I want to see the world . The record is coming out of an experience of reconciling those two things . I played 275 shows for two years straight . You have to travel between those shows . So you ' re gone .
