" It shows we have no letdown , no breakdown , " said Brown . " San Antonio , Dallas , Indiana , Chicago and Cleveland , that ' s the last five games that ( the Warriors won ) by an average of 25 points . And scored an average of 125 . For us to be down 24 and find a way not to roll over , not be all caught up in the moment and find a way to give something back to our fans who were fantastic , is a great thing for our young team . It validates the work they have put in . It showed we have not let down and not backed down . I give us a lot of credit . "
