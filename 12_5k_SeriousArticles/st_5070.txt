Lastly , the radicals critique that Bernie won t change much as president and that it s the whole system that needs to change only echoes Bernie s own comments . He explicitly critiques Obama for demobilizing the campaign after his election . Bernie repeats in speech after speech that no president is powerful enough to take on Wall Street alone . Radicals and social movements would do better to think of Bernie as an ally . In a privileged position , indeed the most powerful position in the world , Bernie Sanders would work for the causes dear to the left . He would not be in the trenches , but he would at least create the sorely needed space activists need to create the change they yearn for . Arguing that he can t change the system alone not only repeats the candidate himself , but it also assumes ( as the co option argument does ) that the populace cannot understand the political dynamics .
