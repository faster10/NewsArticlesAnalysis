Joseph Gordon Levitt , the writer , director , and star of " Don Jon , " has done it . And he ' s pulled it off in a light , fun , unlaborious way : by crafting a high spirited yet dirty minded romantic comedy about a New Jersey bartender , Jon Martello ( Gordon Levitt ) , who goes out to clubs and gets laid every weekend , usually with the curvaceous babe of his choice . She can never be the woman of his dreams , though , because those dreams have already been lost to the hardcore photographs and videos that he masturbates to every day . It ' s not really the faces and bodies he ' s coveting , it ' s the behavior " the moaning , screaming , make me your nasty toy insatiability , which he thinks is what sex was meant to be . He doesn ' t realize that he ' s watching a bill of goods made flesh .
