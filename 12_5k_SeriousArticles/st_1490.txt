The Diana , 217THE LOOK : Very sexy black patent shoes , with a chic tapered heel . BEST FOR : Making short legs look lengthy . The slanted angle of the strap elongates the leg . WORST FOR : All day wear . The super shiny leather is a little bit stiff , and they ' re easy enough to walk in at three and a half inches but I wouldn ' t travel for miles in them . Comfort rating : 3 . Great height , but that leather gives me blisters just by looking at it .
