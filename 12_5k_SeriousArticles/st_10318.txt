" The NRA is the big issue , but I wouldn ' t say it ' s on the Republican side only , it ' s on the Democratic side also . . . . fully half of your new Senate has either an A , A or A rating from the NRA , " said John Gramlich , who covers gun control for CQ Roll Call . " The NRA has said that the answer to Newtown is to put more guns , more police officers in schools , and so if you want anything to happen on gun control , you ' re going to have at least half of the Senate upsetting the NRA and that ' s a very difficult proposition .
