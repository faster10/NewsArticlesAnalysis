I ' m reminded of the time when a friend took a family trip on a cruise ship . Her 10 year old son kept pestering the crew , begging for a chance to drive the massive ocean liner . The captain finally invited the family up to the bridge , whereupon the boy grabbed hold of the wheel and began vigorously turning it . The boy ' s mother panicked until the captain leaned over and whispered to her not to worry because the ship was on autopilot her son ' s maneuvers would have no effect .
