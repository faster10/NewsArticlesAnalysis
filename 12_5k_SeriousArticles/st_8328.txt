J . R . Smith also played just 10 minutes in the second half , but again let s not draw conclusions yet . Matthew Dellavedova was terrific and a big reason why all this small ball went down , scoring 17 points with three rebounds , three assists , one steal and three 3 pointers in 37 minutes . He only has two more weeks of value in standards . Jared Cunningham started the second half for Mozzy , but he didn t do much with seven points and one trey . Mo Williams also had 13 points off the bench in 21 minutes . He ll be losing some value once Kyrie Irving ( knee ) comes back this month .
