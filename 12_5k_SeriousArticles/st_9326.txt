As the Steffon Armitage saga rumbles on , it is understood that Dan Lydiate may soon be on his way back from Racing Metro to Wales , while there has also been speculation about Jamie Roberts ' future in Paris . Neither man has made a substantial impact across the Channel , partly due to injuries and irregular selection . Lydiate has been strongly linked with the Ospreys and that prospect should appeal to the Lions flanker . The Swansea based region are enjoying a wonderful resurgence as the only unbeaten team in Europe ' s three main leagues without the cast list of Galacticos that they had in previous years . Dan Baker is making waves at No 8 , as is Eli Walker on the wing , allied to the astute control of Wales half backs Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar . The Ospreys have the look of a side who are well coached , which is a tribute to Steve Tandy and his staff . It is also fitting encouragement for Alun Wyn Jones , the captain who turned down a pile of Euros , stayed loyal and is now leading a hungry , upwardly mobile squad . Lydiate could do worse than jump aboard the bandwagon .
