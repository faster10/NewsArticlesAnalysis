" Here is the bottom line : People do dumb things , " Chertoff said . " I get very perturbed when there is anything that is done that suggests that with respect to the enforcement of the law , we are anything other than even handed . I have zero tolerance for racism or discrimination in the area of law enforcement . We have to be tough but we have to be fair . . . . The idea that you are going to come and impersonate someone of another ethnic group , I think , is completely unacceptable . "
