? ? The drive that all but sealed the game started on the Chiefs own 6 , included a very long Alex Smith run called back on a questionable penalty , injuries to both Jeremy Maclin and J . J . Watt on the same play , and a terrific throw and catch for a touchdown to Chris Conley . The drive was , basically , everything for the Chiefs . Good blocking , good execution , the ol foot on the throat thing that they ve not always displayed this season .
