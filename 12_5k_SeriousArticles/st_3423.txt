The lead poisoning occurred because Flint failed to treat water with phosphorous , something that corroded the coating inside city pipes and home plumbing , allowing lead to leach in .

This would be difficult for even a financially healthy city , let alone one that can ' t even pay its existing bills and has unfunded pension liabilities of 1 . 1 billion .
