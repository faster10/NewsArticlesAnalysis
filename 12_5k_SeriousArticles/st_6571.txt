So , just to recap for anyone ( like us ) who is still trying to wrap their brains around it : The Bond franchise was mirrored by the " Austin Powers " franchise , which was then , in turn , mirrored back by the Bond franchise . In other words , " Spectre " seems to be imitating its own imitator . ( Uh , bartender , we could use a martini after trying to think about that . Shaken , ? stirred , ? who cares ? Just keep them coming . )
