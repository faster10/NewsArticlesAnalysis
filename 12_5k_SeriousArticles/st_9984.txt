A " dump , " the word the Tampa Bay boy used , is a tad harsh . Bright gents like the baseball expert Peter Gammons and the Chicago columnist Rick Morrissey have applied that same tag to Wrigley Field in recent times , absent of malice . It is not about dissing the Cubs or their fans . It is about reminding them that the park has crummy plumbing , hungry rats and crumbling concrete . It is about ballplayers who must shower , shave and dress in locker rooms about as roomy as a Kardashian ' s closet .
