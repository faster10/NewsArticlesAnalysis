You ' d think my memory of my All Blacks debut would be really sharp , but it ' s anything but . I remember kicking off then suddenly the match was over . I got to the end and thought , is that it ? I was so focused on the moment that I barely registered the wider game itself . Whatever happened , it didn ' t affect my performance . I scored a try , kicked most of my goals , and ended up with 20 points . A dream debut , with a 55 3 win .
