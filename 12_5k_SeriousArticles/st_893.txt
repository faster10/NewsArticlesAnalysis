I have seen destroyed buildings and war zones on TV and in the news , but returning here was the first time I had seen such destruction in real life . At first you can ' t believe your eyes , and you have to remind yourself that you are not watching an apocalyptic movie , but real life . It eventually dawns on you that this is not a film set , that there is life and there are families living in the remnants of these half destroyed buildings .
