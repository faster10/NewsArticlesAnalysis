The film is more worthy of its nomination for best costume design , led by Paco Delgado , who also worked on Hooper s 2012 Les Miserables . While the Guardian s Jonathan Romney ? claimed that t oo many scenes are distractingly dominated by a perfect frock or a ravishing art nouveau window , I feel the opposite . These immaculate frocks , windowpanes , bedspreads , tutus and velveteen footwear are the single best reason to see the film , perhaps the only reason to see it , if only because the characters are usually less interesting than the objects that surround them .
