" He ' s putting on an absolute show right now , " Hoiberg said recently . " It ' s fun to watch , but it ' s scary to watch when you know you ' ve got him coming up soon . What he ' s doing right now , he ' s throwing in shots from a step over half court when he ' s trying to draw a foul . It ' s been unbelievable . You could make the argument he ' s the best shooter of all time . He ' s certainly living up to that right now . "
