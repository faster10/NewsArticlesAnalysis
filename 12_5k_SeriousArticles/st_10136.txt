The social issues ? Really what his position was , that wasn t what I got involved with , Pinkel said . My players , they re my kids . I love those guys . I got 127 of them . When they say they need my support , I certainly knew about what was going on ( at ) the university , but it had nothing to do with that . It simply had to do with my players ( who ) deeply cared about this guy . ( They said ) , He was dying and would you support me , Coach ? That s what I did .
