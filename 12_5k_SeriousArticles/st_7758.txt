" I knew I had to be better because of Kobe Bryant , " he said . " I knew he was in the gym and I knew he was working on his game . And I knew he was great . So every day that I didn ' t want to work out or every day I felt like I couldn ' t give more , I always thought of Kobe . I knew that he was getting better and I was like , Man , if you take a day off , he ' s going to take advantage of it . You cannot take a day off . You cannot take a day off . '
