We ' ve created coastal bowling pin communities we set ' em up and the weather takes ' em down . I live in one . I ' m guilty . In my defense , I ' ll claim entrapment , because I have federal flood insurance . You made me do it . So I just want to take this opportunity to thank you . But I ' d like to also tell you , it ' s OK with me if you withdraw your generosity . In fact it would be better if you did . You help make us lazy . And by us , I mean millions of people living along the coast , whistling in the dark . And you help our politicians look away from the oncoming truth .
