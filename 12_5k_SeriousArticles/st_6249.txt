On Tuesday , 59 year old Joy Lorien had to ask her two grandchildren to eat the free breakfast offered at school because her cupboards were bare . She always makes the 9 and 10 year olds breakfast fried potatoes , a little bacon , cut up bananas and a sweet roll . She cried just thinking about it as she took them to school . Lorien also reflected on the irony of the situation her grandchildren having to take government assistance because the government forced her out of work .
