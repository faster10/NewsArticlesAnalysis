It works like this : The media and seemingly the rest of the U . S . public care most when a terrorist is successful , foreign , Islamic , and thus resonant with what has become the touchstone of our views on terror : 9 11 . For such cases , no coverage or government action is too excessive . We care when casualty tolls , as measured in American lives , are high and the villain is easy to point a camera at , easy to fit into our predetermined definition of what a villain is ( see point 1 . )
