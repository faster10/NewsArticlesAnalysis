Mourinho said : ' I took the team but he was in the stands . He was there to support . He came down at half time to the dressing room to listen to my team talk . He didn ' t want to interfere , because probably he thought that was right . He did with me what I do with my assistants , give them not just responsibility , but also give them the tools for evolution , support an evolution and make them ready for a possible next step , if one day they decide to do it . It ' s normal . '
