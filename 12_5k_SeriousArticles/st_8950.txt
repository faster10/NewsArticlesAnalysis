A true brokered convention happens when a candidate doesn ' t win a majority of delegates on the first ballot . We haven ' t had one for a while because much of this is sorted out during the primary process . But we have seen contested conventions , where two candidates are locked in a fight right up until the end . Think 1976 , when President Gerald Ford faced a challenge from Ronald Reagan on the Republican side , and 1980 , when Ted Kennedy tried and failed to topple President Jimmy Carter at the Democratic convention .
