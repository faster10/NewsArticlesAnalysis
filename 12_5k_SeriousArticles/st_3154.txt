Severin : Starting September 19 , I have an exhibit that ' s really a great way to say " Ha ! " to GQ . It ' s showcasing about 60 of the photos that I ' ve taken through the three years that I ' ve been running the blog and basically , it ' s the best of Boston and the surrounding areas : Cambridge , Jamaica Plain , Dorchester , Somerville . I feel like it ' s going to be a really good show in terms of what we have to offer . That coincides with Boston Fashion Week as well , which starts September 23 .
