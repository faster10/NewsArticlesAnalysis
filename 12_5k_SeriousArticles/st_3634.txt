It wasn ' t the guys at the local Ford or Chrysler dealership who caused our government to lose its AAA credit rating . And they aren ' t the ones who can ' t agree on a budget deal while we collectively stare into the abyss of the " fiscal cliff . " In fact , I have no doubt that a group of car salesmen could iron out a deal on the budget quicker than our recalcitrant Congress plus get us all to buy some undercoating for our cars to boot .
