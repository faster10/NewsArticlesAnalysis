Brown adds tempo to the game and England need to get him involved as much as possible so one thing I would like to see him do is follow all New Zealand kicks into touch and grab them before the ball boys , so every time he has got the option of taking a quick throw , either to himself or a supporting player . It won ' t always be on but England need to know that it is always an option and pour back in support . It ' s a great way of imposing the tempo you want to play at .
