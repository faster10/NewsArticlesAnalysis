Djokovic does things on a tennis court that sometimes make little sense : such as surviving a semi final of four hours and 50 minutes against Andy Murray here four years ago , then beating Rafael Nadal in the final 36 hours later in a match that went five hours and 53 minutes , the longest final in grand slam history . As Murray has remarked since , he remains in awe of that performance , as his own efforts had left him barely able to get out of bed the next day .
