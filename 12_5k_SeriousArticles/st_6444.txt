In my first encounter this year , I got a Good Santa . I know the difference because , over the years , I ' ve had plenty of Bad Santas . That guy who lingers at malls and department stores must work on commission . He encourages kids to rattle off a list of all the toys they want . Kids come away thinking that Christmas is all about gifts and unearned gifts at that . Bad Santa doesn ' t ask anything in return for his largess . A child gets toys just by being a child .
