Piccard : With Solar Impulse we want to demonstrate what can be achieved today with renewable energy and technologies that allow energy savings . If an aircraft is able to fly day and night without fuel , propelled only by solar energy , no one will be allowed to claim anymore that it is impossible to use the same technologies for motor vehicles , heating and cooling systems or computers , etc . This project voices our conviction that a pioneering spirit with political vision can together change society and reduce society ' s dependence on fossil energies .
