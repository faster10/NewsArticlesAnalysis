I look for the best ways to reach the right audience for whatever project it is . Most of all , I concentrate on making the content as good as it can be . That way no matter where or when or how someone is watching it , they ' re still offered the same experience . I ' m sure people felt the same way about the steam engine . " Why are we building all these railroads ? " We ' re kind of arrogant enough to believe that where we are is the pinnacle of evolution and that there aren ' t going to be massive cultural changes . My goal is to make content for the rest of my life and career . To that end , it ' s just about being smart and staying current .
