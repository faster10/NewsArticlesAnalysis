I just don ' t think of my career much , she said in the interview . I think it ' s because I had such peace of mind that I felt I gave my sport everything . I know I was obviously aware that I achieved a lot , but I think the comfort was that I felt like I gave everything to it and it gave me a lot in return . It gave me what I have now ? ? Andre , my family and the time to spend with them . I ' m extremely grateful . "
