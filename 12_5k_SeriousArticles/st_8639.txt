9 . The two year , 3 million contract extension signed by Patriots receiver Keshawn Martin , first reported by ESPN s Field Yates on Saturday , is the type of depth signing that highlights how Belichick attempts to build a strong middle class on the roster .

He reminds me of former Patriots receiver Jabar Gaffney in that regard he s smart , versatile and fills his role well .
