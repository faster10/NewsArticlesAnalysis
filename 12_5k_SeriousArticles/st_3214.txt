Think about it ? if it were held AFTER the Super Bowl , we re talking 3 weeks from now . Brady Palmer just lost tough games ? you think they re in any mood to suit up again and go all the way to Hawaii to play this game ? No . But if you come back at them after 3 weeks have already passed since their Championship Game losses , and they ve had some time to cool off and heal a few nicks and bruises , then they d probably be a lot more willing to play in the Pro Bowl .
