I have not been able to stop playing " Words with Friends . " Ever since I got it , I ' ve been playing it constantly . I can ' t even invite any more people to play because I ' m at the max amount of games you can have . I have 30 games going at once . I ' m literally on it non stop . I took the train up yesterday and that ' s all I was doing . I had my headphones on and I was playing " Words with Friends . " So it kills time . It ' s fun , and it ' s competitive .
