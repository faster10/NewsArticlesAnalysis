At this stage in this election I generally think it is too censorious to complain that a candidate s idea won t be able to get through Congress and therefore should not be raised . If that s your criterion , there s virtually nothing to talk about . Instead , candidates should do what they re doing : sending signals to potential voters as to what they re about . Absent binding political constraints , how would they go after inequality , gender and racial inequities , taxes , market regulations , climate change , and so on ?
