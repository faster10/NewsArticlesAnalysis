Sharapova struggled in her upside down 6 1 , 6 7 ( 7 5 ) , 6 0 win over the American Lauren Davies , and said later : I made it a little bit more difficult than I should have . I definitely had a let up at 2 1 , 30 love in the second set . I was hitting the ball well , doing the right things to get in that position , then let up . In a grand slam environment against anyone you can t expect to get away with it .
