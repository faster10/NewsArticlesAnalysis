" Public office is a place for public service , not personal profit , " Nelson ' s statement said . " It ' s about promoting the common good , not the agenda of the radical right or the radical left . It ' s about fairness for all , not privileges for the few . And , it ' s about protecting the rights of individuals , even if it angers the majority . I hope and believe I have fulfilled these principles to the best of my ability . "
