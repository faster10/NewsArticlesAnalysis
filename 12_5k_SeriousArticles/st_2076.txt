I don ' t really care who Mr Cain is alleged to have slept with as long as she ' s willing . This is not the first man who ran for president who has ever had an affair . In fact , it might be a good parlor game to try to find one that hasn ' t . My guess is that there isn ' t a strong relationship , historically , between being a good president and never having had an extra marital affair . Women simply haven ' t been that important the wives and the mistresses have not been their men ' s equal , but merely their mates . Perhaps that ' s changing in the 21st Century . I hope so . But I ' m not putting my money on it .
