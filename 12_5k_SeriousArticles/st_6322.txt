What they ' re doing has nothing to do with you , and it has everything to do with them . They ' re insecure . Maybe they ' re insecure because you ' re breaking new ground , because you ' re taking risks in your life and you don ' t care what people say , or at least that ' s what comes across . It frightens that person , and sometimes , when people are frightened , they react in angry , hostile ways . In order to keep your integrity , you must stay true to yourself and not let bullies get you down .
