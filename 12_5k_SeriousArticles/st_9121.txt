Etienne describes a common scenario with the men and women she deals with , saying , " There is that , that wish for a system that is more personal . Couldn ' t I just explain this to a judge ? To someone ? That I am not a criminal . That I have no background or criminal background . I am just trying to get to my family . Isn ' t there someone who is going to believe that story ? And who is going to hear me ?
