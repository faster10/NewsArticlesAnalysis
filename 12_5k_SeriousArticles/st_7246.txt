My 40s were coming to an end , and I was dreading it . Then my brother in law suggested I watch a " Saturday Night Live " skit starring Molly Shannon as Sally O ' Malley , a 50 year old trying out for the Radio City Rockettes . It made me laugh so hard and helped me get over my anxieties . Now whenever I ' m feeling down , I view it , have a belly laugh , and move on . As Sally said : " Book ' em , Danno ! I ' m 5 0 !
