Sameh Shafi , coordinator of one of the protest groups , Stop Sisi , said : We re going to make life very difficult for him . The worst thing would be for him to walk in scot free . The aim is to show the opposite of what he s showing ? that he s a legitimate president , everyone loves him . The aim of the protest is to show that he s not that person , to show the exact opposite of the message he wants to convey and make him famous for his crimes .
