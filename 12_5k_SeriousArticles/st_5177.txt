KUHN : Well , I think the fear right now is that because the U . S . has not conducted these freedom of operation ? freedom of navigation operations in the area , it has allowed Chinese to build on these islands . Other people say that s not true , and China is going to build those no matter what the U . S . does . The only way the U . S . could stop them from doing it would be through an act of war or to violate international law .
