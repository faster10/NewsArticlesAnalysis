We ' re terrific at making stuff at conjuring what the market will go for , at expertly constructing and packaging it , at promoting and selling it . We ' re so good at it that we sometimes forget that the thing to be most proud of is not the products , which are largely ephemeral , but the work the labor that goes into them . The products , those worthy and those without much worth at all , tend to disappear in time . The diligence and skill behind the labor renews itself each generation .
