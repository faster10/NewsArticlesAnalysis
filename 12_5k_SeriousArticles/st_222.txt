I make a point of stopping in to some of the midsize and larger wineries before heading back to Manhattan . At Pindar Vineyards , the biggest , a crowd of 35 people taste from more than 20 options , dozens of bottles of wine are stacked on a counter , and across the field a warehouse building bears a massive company logo . But the staff is jolly , and there ' s a large covered deck out back for drinking and relaxing . It ' s a different kind of social scene more bar than family room .
