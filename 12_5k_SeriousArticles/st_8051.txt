' It was good to play at Twickenham the other day . It is bloody impressive . It would be an honour to play there for England . When I was planning to come over here , I didn ' t even know that I would be eligible , but afterwards it was spelled out to me . At the time I thought , Right , whatever , that ' s not going to happen " . But coming here now , maybe it is going to happen and that is pretty exciting . '
