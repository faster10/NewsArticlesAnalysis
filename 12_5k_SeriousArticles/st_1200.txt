My father , President Lyndon Baines Johnson , signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act on my 17th birthday . The only handwritten note I have from my father was his birthday letter written at 12 : 10 p . m . that day . Daddy didn ' t have time to go to the pharmacy to buy a Hallmark card . At 6 p . m . , he was signing a bill into law that would liberate my generation from the shackles of legalized apartheid . It was the best birthday present anyone could ever receive .
