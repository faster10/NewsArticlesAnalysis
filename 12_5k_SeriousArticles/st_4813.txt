That seems to be part of the strategy most teams would love to unleash on the Warriors . Make Curry defend . It ' s not that Curry is a bad defender anymore . While he used to be a bit of a traffic cone on defense and just gambling for steals occasionally , Curry has become a good defender over the last couple years . The strategy behind it though is trying to get Curry to wear down over the course of a game and the course of a series so that he ' s not able to be as potent on offense in the big moments .
