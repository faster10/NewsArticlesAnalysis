A handful of US military advisors are working with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters on and near Sinjar mountain , but are positioned well back from the fighting , a US military spokesman said .

It will " discomfit ( Islamic State ) for some time , " said Kenneth Pollack , a former CIA and White House official now at the Brookings Institution think tank . " This , in and of itself , is unlikely to be a major blow to them . "
