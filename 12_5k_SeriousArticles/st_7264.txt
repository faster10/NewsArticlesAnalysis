In the brief World Series , the Royals stunned Mets fans when they turned around game 4 to get the lead in the 8th inning . Three games earlier , the Royals won the longest World Series game in history in the 14th inning . In the final game of the World Series , the Royals were down two runs in the 9th inning , and did not have a lead until the 12th inning , which began at midnight . They won 7 to 2 . The Royals are the first team in history to win three games in which they trailed in the eighth inning or later . If the games had lasted only seven innings , the Mets would have won four of the five games , instead of the other way around . Never give up .
