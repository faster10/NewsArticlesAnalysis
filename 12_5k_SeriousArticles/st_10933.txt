" We have a defendant who preyed upon the weak . He preyed upon the weak when he was looking for Mexicans to rob , because he knows lots of times they can ' t speak English . They are afraid . They might be here illegally . They may not even report to police , " said Johnson . " They don ' t see any more Mexicans that morning . They see something even better , something even more weak , something even more vulnerable , a mother and a child . "
