I believe that schools should be places not only for academic learning , but also where young people build confidence , a sense of self , and learn to become responsible citizens . It is one of the great tragedies of our day that our schools , excessively driven by data and standardized tests , have no time for activities that can ' t be tested . No time for the arts and play and the social and emotional learning that will help children handle what life has in store .
