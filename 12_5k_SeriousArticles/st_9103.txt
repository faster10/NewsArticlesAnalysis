From a Pats fan , there is a lot of blame to go around for this one poor O line play , poor coaching , poor execution . They had many chances to win this , they didn t do themselves any favors . A good Denver defense , a not so good offense . If Carolina plays like they did last night in the Super Bowl I don t see any chance for the Broncos to win , I think the Panthers have too many weapons on both sides of the ball . a very fast , physical team .
