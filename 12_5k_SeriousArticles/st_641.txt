The real issue is secrecy . Clinton isn t one of the most transparent people in politics she s one of the least transparent . It comes partly from being hectored and pursued all her political life ? but also from her bad habits and instincts . Congress may never investigate how we were tricked into invading Iraq , but we don t need an investigation to know that secrets and lies led to the betrayal of our ideals and the worst foreign policy blunder in our history . It happens all the time , if not on such a scale . We must end the cult of national security secrecy and begin a new era of honesty and openness . It is highly unlikely that Clinton would ever lead or even allow such a reform but you wouldn t know it from that hearing .
