Tampa Bay Buccaneers : If the Bucs correct their red zone issues , they should be in good shape against a struggling Cowboys squad that needs Tony Romo back as soon as possible . Tampa Bay has scored touchdowns on only 42 . 86 percent of trips inside the opponent ' s 20 yard line this season , and the Bucs were 1 for 4 in the red zone against the Giants in Week 9 . Jameis Winston has gone four consecutive games without throwing an interception , and there ' s little reason to think he ' ll regress against a Dallas defense that has been vulnerable in recent weeks . It will be close throughout , but the Bucs will do enough late to gain the victory at home . Buccaneers 21 , Cowboys 17 . Andrew Astleford
