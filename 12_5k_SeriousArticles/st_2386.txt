As a young boy , I loved watching the Atlanta Braves . I can recall countless historic moments over the course of their 47 year history in the city . It was in Atlanta that the Braves won an unprecedented 14 division championships from 1991 to 2005 . It was in Atlanta that Hall of Famer Hank Aaron hit his record breaking home run in 1974 . It was in Atlanta that the Braves won a World Series championship in 1995 . There is no doubt that the Braves belong to Atlanta .
