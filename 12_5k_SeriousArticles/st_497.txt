Portions of Trump s relationship with Felix Sater , a convicted felon and government informant , have been previously known . Trump worked with the company where Sater was an executive , Bayrock Group LLC , after it rented office space from the Trump Organization as early as 2003 . Sater s criminal history was effectively unknown to the public at the time , because a judge kept the relevant court records secret and Sater altered his name . When Sater s criminal past and mafia links came to light in 2007 , Trump distanced himself from Sater .
