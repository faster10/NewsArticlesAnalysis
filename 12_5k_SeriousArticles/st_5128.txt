The big loser here could be Turkey , which seemed to be in such a strong position to extend its influence across the Middle East in 2011 . Its image as an economically prospering , democratic yet Islamic , state was attractive to many Arab protesters looking to overthrow and replace dictatorial rule . But the Turkish President , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , soon made clear that he was supporting a Sunni Arab sectarian takeover that was anti Shia , anti Kurd and anti secular and was bound to be resisted . Having first backed the Muslim Brotherhood , Turkey then tolerated or helped Isis , al Nusra and extreme jihadi groups .
