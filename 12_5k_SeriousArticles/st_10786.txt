Still , as a pundit , I have to admit I ' m intrigued by the premise of Ted Cruz . He is the embodiment of the GOP ' s on again , off again populist rhetoric . He seems to be running his campaign on the false wisdom about 2012 , that there were millions of voters who stayed home because Mitt Romney wasn ' t conservative enough for them . This is a campaign that is aiming for glory or ignominy and won ' t settle for anything in between .
