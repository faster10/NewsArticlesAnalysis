And so , on this Mother ' s Day ( and the other 364 days this year ) , I ' m trying to be the mom my mother taught me how to be , both for my sons and for myself , even as I wish she could cheer me on . I was taught by one of the best that it ' s not about doing it all ( she couldn ' t , as a single working mom ) or being there for every minute ( again , it literally wasn ' t possible ) , but it ' s about being fully present for the stuff that matters .
