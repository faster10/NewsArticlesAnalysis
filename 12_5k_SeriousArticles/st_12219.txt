Parisians are sadly becoming all too used to this kind of violence . It was only in January this year when the attack on Charlie Hebdo left most of its staff dead or maimed . And now this , an attack so ferocious and brutal that Paris may take years to recover . Seven years ago , to this very month , gunmen also ran amok in Mumbai and unleashed terror that was to last four days and claim 164 lives . This is global war , and and it could be very well be a generational war .
