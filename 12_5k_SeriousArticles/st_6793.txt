If that happens , Ohio State s fate would be left to the committee s whim . ? Winning your conference championship is a premium as far as the committee is concerned , so would a win over Clemson allow North Carolina to leapfrog Ohio State ? The No . 10 spot is a long way to climb , but it would be a better win than any on the Buckeyes schedule . North Carolina s lone loss came in Week 1 , and it would finish the season on a 12 game winning streak .
