If your 24 hours in Ho Chi Minh City happens to turn into 36 or 48 , arrange a day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels , about 70 kilometers Northwest of the city . The Viet Cong built this maze of passageways , which served as supply lines , during the Vietnam War . The narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers . Not only can you take a stroll , or crawl , through a few parts of it , you ' ll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda .
