Mitch Pileggi ( Walter Skinner ) : Returning to the show and this character felt normal , felt right . It felt like there had been a very long weekend and it was Monday and we were back to work . I guess when you do a show like this for so many years , it becomes such a part of you and with the revival something inside of me said , Hey Walter , put your suit and specs on . It s time to go to the agency .
