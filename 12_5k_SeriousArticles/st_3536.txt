Last night he got in at midnight and slept here so he could surprise the kids in the morning , we could all have breakfast and he could take them to school . So we ' re not living together , but he ' s more than welcome to be with us whenever he wants . And vice versa : I sleep in his house in Malibu a lot with the kids . We ' ll have a weekend all together holidays , we ' re together , " Paltrow tells Glamour . " We ' re still very much a family , even though we don ' t have a romantic relationship .
