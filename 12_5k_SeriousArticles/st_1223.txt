Romita : Not necessarily . One drawback to drawing Superman is it ' s been done so many times that you can ' t really differentiate the style . I just wanted him to look 6 foot 5 and 250 pounds of solid muscle . You can ' t go light on that . You have to give him that powerful presence . You tweak the body language and the weight on the floor . There ' s a strict way the face should look , the hair is drawn a certain way . The only thing I like to do is convey the weight and the power of the figure , especially with a character like this .
