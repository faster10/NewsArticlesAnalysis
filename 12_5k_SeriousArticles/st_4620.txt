On Friday the House of Representatives is set to vote on a reconciliation bill that repeals only parts of Obamacare . This simply isn t good enough , the joint statement from Cruz , Lee and Rubio said . Each of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama s desk . If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules , we cannot support this bill . With millions of Americans now getting health premium increase notices in the mail , we owe our constituents nothing less .
