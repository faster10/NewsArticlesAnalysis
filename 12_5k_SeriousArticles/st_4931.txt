5 : 02 a . m . I get up and peek in on Jack ( 5 1 2 ) . He ' s been sleeping alone in his room for almost a month now . I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her . At least I think it ' s her it ' s been a while . She feels good against my skin , but now I miss Jack . I miss getting kicked in the throat . I miss getting the covers pulled off of me . Where ' s my little boy ? How did he grow up so fast ?
