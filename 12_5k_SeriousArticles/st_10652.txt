As for me , I ' ve never had a huge problem with the employer penalty . For better or for worse , we have an employer based insurance system in the United States . The majority of people living here get their insurance through a job . Partly that ' s historical , because of wage freezes in World War II , and partly that ' s because the tax deduction for employer sponsored insurance makes it all the more enticing to get insurance instead of wage increases . So if we want to continue this type of system , it makes sense to have employers either provide insurance to their workers or pay some sort of tax , or penalty , to help the government do it for them .
