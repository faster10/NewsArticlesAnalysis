A person in my position with experience can hope to make from 3500 6000 a month , not including tips , while inexperienced crew can hope to earn around 2000 3000 a month . On a busy and successful charter yacht you can hope to make tips of around 5 to 15 of the cost of the charter per week divided amongst the crew . In recent years tips are not as extravagant as they once were but you can hope to make approximately 1000 USD a week in tips . With a busy charter yacht completing approximately 10 weeks of charter a season .
