I sympathize with well meaning Mets fans who watched their team collapse with all too familiar horror . But I m delighted to see Murphy s star come crashing down so publicly . Now a free agent , Murphy s stock just plummeted , and his name will be whispered in disappointment rather than trumpeted with glee . Murphy s horrifying performance , his downfall on the field , likely had nothing to do with his noxious personal prejudice . And yet , in some small way , it felt like justice . ?
