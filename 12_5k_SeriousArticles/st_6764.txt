This isn t a judgment of Cespedes profile ? yes , he s better off playing a corner outfield position than center field , and yes , he displayed some alarming roller coaster tendencies ? as much as it is an assessment of what the Mets have and need . Can Michael Conforto , a healthy Juan Lagares and Curtis Granderson constitute a championship outfield ? Yes , and you hope ( perhaps without merit ) that Michael Cuddyer has something left after a poor first Mets season , and you find a backup center fielder , too .
