The campaign has exploded that myth , too . The Republican field is far more diverse , although the candidates see their ethnicity as incidental rather than essential , in bumper sticker fashion , to their personas . The candidates include the young ( 44 year old Ted Cruz , Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio ) , the ethnically diverse ( Mr Cruz , Mr Jindal , Mr Rubio and Ben Carson ) , and successful outsiders who do not have political backgrounds ( Mr Carson , Mr Trump and Carly Fiorina ) .
