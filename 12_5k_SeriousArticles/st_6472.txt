" I think it ' s been the case there is no quarterback like him in the league and it ' s been that way for years now , " tight end Greg Olsen said . " There are plays he makes no other quarterback in the league can make . We had a third and 10 in the third quarter . We were running a designed power run on third down . He ' s the only quarterback in the league picking up the first down with an 11 yard gain . On the next play , he had another designed quarterback run for a touchdown .
