During the visit , Ryan told reporters : " I would say for the sake of our national security , we want to modernize our immigration laws . We do not even know how to track people who overstay their visas . We need a modern immigration system that helps us not only protect our border but protects national security in all of its aspects . So if anything , I would say this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws . We need it for national security , we need it for our economy . "
