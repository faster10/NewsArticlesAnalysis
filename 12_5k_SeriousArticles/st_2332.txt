One of us is a pastor and the other a rabbi of congregations in and near Boston . We both had identical reactions when we first learned of the Boston Marathon bombings last year . Was this another 9 11 ? Whom did we know who might be directly affected runners , first responders , spectators on the finish line ? We worried about our colleagues at Old South Church , directly on the finish line , and Trinity Church in Copley Square , one block away . Similar to what we imagine interfaith leaders in Kansas started to do Sunday , we immediately began to call people and try to determine how to minister to our congregations and the city at large .
