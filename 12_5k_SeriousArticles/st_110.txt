Mufti Mohammad Sayeed created history when he managed to forge an alliance between the BJP as well as the PDP . Soon after he came to power in alliance with the BJP , he had referred to the coalition as a " meeting of north pole and south pole " . Even before he had tied up with the BJP , he knew the challenges since both the BJP and PDP are diametrically opposite to each other in their viewpoints on Kashmir . However , so far the coalition has had a difficult time with the PDP having to back down each time in favour of the BJP .
