So is it not time for more meaningful engagement with the Islamic Republic next door ? As happens in times of war , should we not be speaking to military men instead of civilians ? And as would happen in wartime , should we not be going more aggressively after the groups responsible for conducting acts of war on Indian soil ? Speaking as an ordinary Indian citizen , may I say that I would like very much to see more aggression in not just the manner in which we speak to Pakistan in future , but more aggression in the way we defend ourselves against a country that is increasingly becoming an existential threat to India .
