Directly attributible to their coach . Case in point was when the Panthers went up 31 , the Panthers got the ball back with a little less than 2 minutes left right after Seattle failed on the 4th and 5 . Panthers get a first down and then on the next 3rd down play , they run the ball when you have the league MVP who was carving up their secondary . That s indicative of how he s operated all year with a lead . You have to keep your foot on the gas especially when you have the better team , which Carolina clearly has this year and should be apparent to everyone by now . However , if I was a Panther fan , I would be worried that my coaches tendecies are going to get us beat . He also struggles with adjustments . How many times was he going to watch Wilson roll out of the pocket in the 2nd half with no adjustments whatsoever . He s a great player , but Rivera making no in game adjustments to that obliged him .
