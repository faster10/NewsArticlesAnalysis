Well , I think it s a tough situation . I think it s really sad . And Al Sharpton is just a guy who wants to get publicity for himself , and I understand him very well . Al would actually probably say that he was a friend of Donald Trump , maybe not on television but outside of television . I think it s a tough situation , " Trump remarked , then alluded to an earlier segment in which Fox News contributor Stacey Dash remarked upon the perceived double standard of having a network like BET . So the whites don t get any nominations , and I thought it was an amazing interview , actually . I d never even thought of it from that standpoint , " he said . But with all of that being said , it would certainly be nice if everybody could be represented properly . And hopefully that s the case , but perhaps it s not the case . It s a difficult situation .
