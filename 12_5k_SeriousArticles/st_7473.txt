' Brendan ( Rodgers ) and Roberto ( Martinez ) have been great . I don ' t just call up managers and ask what to do . I ' ll deal with it myself because I feel that is the way I ' ll learn . If I think I have done it right then great , but if I think I could have done it better I ' ll ask for advice , " This is how I dealt with it . How would you deal with it ? "
