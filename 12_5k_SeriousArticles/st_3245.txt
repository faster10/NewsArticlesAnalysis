Right now , 10 states and the District of Columbia have no statutory time limit on when abortions can be performed , while five more states allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester ( about 27 or 28 weeks ) . Yet , we know that by 28 weeks , the great majority of fetuses would survive birth . In other words , we allow the killing of viable infants in our country . This is a fact that progressives ( including me ) would rather not address .
