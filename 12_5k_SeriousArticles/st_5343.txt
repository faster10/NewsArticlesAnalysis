Steve Jobs saw around corners , over the horizon and into the future , changing forever our daily lives through technology . He taught us to download music . He made computers approachable through his simple and elegant designs . He used everyday words instead of engineering jargon . He made computing comprehensible by employing " desktop metaphors " : We opened folders , read documents and threw away our trash . It is nearly impossible to imagine ( or remember ) the world without the tools and experiences that Jobs created and popularized .
