" The paper provides no evidence to suggest a population level impact on tuna , amberjack or other pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico , " the company said in a written statement . " The oil concentrations used in these lab experiments were rarely seen in the gulf during or after the Deepwater Horizon accident . In addition , the authors themselves note that it is nearly impossible to determine the early life impact to these species . To overcome this challenge , it would take more information than what ' s presented in this paper . "
