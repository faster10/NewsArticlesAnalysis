Atlanta resident Laura Cooper , a pal from our children ' s preschool days , grew up on the beaches of Long Island and still needs to get her toes in the sand . She started going to WaterColor and Seaside on Florida ' s highway 30 A when she moved to the South nine years ago , and it ' s " hands down the best beach vacation anywhere , " she says . " The sand is soft and white , and the water is turquoise really beautiful . "
