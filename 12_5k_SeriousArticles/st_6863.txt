Dayuse hotels . com was the brainchild of David Leb e and Thibaud d ' Agr ves , both of whom worked at the Hotel L ' Amour in Paris . The hotel is particularly popular with touring artists and musicians . Often , the guests would ask about renting a room for a few hours , just for a place to relax before a performance . Leb e and d ' Agr ves recognised that there was a gap in the market , and the idea for dayuse hotels was born .
