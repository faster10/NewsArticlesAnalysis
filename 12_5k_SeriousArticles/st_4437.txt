The stings and emergency shutdowns are bad and let ' s face it , that whole slimy thing is a bit off putting but the real problem with jellyfish is in their predator prey dynamic with fish . On the face of it , fish are obviously the superior predator : They are smarter , faster and often bigger . Think of sharks and stingrays and largemouth bass : It ' s hard to imagine that jellyfish could possibly hold their own against these fighters . But jellyfish are sneaky . They eat the eggs and larvae of fish , and the plankton that the larvae would eat . And through this double whammy of predation and competition , they can cripple an ecosystem at the ankles .
