2 . Inform yourself . Yes , the media is rife with faults , but we live in a time when technology empowers us to inform ourselves as never before . So , for example , before I jumped ugly over Sarah Palin ' s recent speech in Iowa , I got on my computer and actually watched the whole thing . Perhaps before they screamed about President Obama ' s speech at the National Prayer Breakfast , my conservative friends should have actually read it . If you truly love your country , get out of your media comfort zone ( see 3 above ) , check out original sources , look up some history . Arm yourself with facts if you want to really love your country .
