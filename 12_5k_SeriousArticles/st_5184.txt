? In overtime , Beckham failed to locate a floating pass over his shoulder near the right sideline , and might have been influenced by an oncoming Jets safety . ? When the ball fell near his two outstretched hands and hit the turf , Beckham reacted by kicking it back toward the line of scrimmage . That s a delay of game penalty , pure and simple , but Beckham did not see it that way . If I would have thrown it back , I really don t see the difference , Beckham said . It s not like I m screaming F bombs and kicking the ball back . I really don t think it s a penalty . Of course it is a penalty and was correctly called as such . Frustration got the best of him , for an instant . On the next play , fourth and 6 , he reached down in traffic for a 20 yard reception . Pretty decent response .
