Are you tired of Paula Deen ? I am . I ' m tired of reading about her . I ' m tired of talking about her . I ' m tired of hearing other people talk about her . I ' m tired of people looking for excuses to talk about her . I ' m as tired of people who revel in beating her up as I am of people making excuses for her . To be brutally honest , I was tired of her even before she was called out in public for conduct and language detrimental to African Americans .
