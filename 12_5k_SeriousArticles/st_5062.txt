Clinging to their ideologies and principles , they see plenty of reasons why Sanders is insufficient : he doesn t call for workers owning the means of production he doesn t advocate national control of key industries he will centralize the state with big government . ( For radicals , Hillary Clinton is not even worth the argument ? she s so corrupt , hawkish and capitalist . ) I ve read and heard predictable refrains from radicals about why they are not excited about the political revolution that Bernie Sanders proposes : I don t want another white man in office I don t want to vote for another boss of the American Empire He s justifying the system He s sold himself to the Democratic Party , which is a bourgeois party He will co opt our social movement He won t be able to do that much inside the system Democratic socialists repressed the left after the First World War Then , of course , Ta Nehisi Coates writes about Bernie upholding white supremacy by not supporting reparations .
