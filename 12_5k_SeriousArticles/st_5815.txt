Grease : Live may not be the first TV musical event to hit the small screen in recent years , but the team behind Fox s first foray into the genre is looking to shake things up . I ve definitely thrown in what I kind of like to do and just put a little bit of me into it . So any musical that came my way I d watched over and over again . And yeah , I hope that she s watching , and John ( Travolta ) , everybody .
