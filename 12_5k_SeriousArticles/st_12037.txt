Daniel Craig has been a great James Bond , one of the best ever , but rumors have swirled that he s sick of the role . In Spectre maybe it shows a bit . Might not be the worst timing for another reboot , even though Craig is under contract for one more film . Maybe it s just the pattern of the Craig Bond films in that Casino Royale was amazing , Quantum of Solace not so much . Then 3 years ago Skyfall was one of the better films in the franchise , Spectre is just meh .
