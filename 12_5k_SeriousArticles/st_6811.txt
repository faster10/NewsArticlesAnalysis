First , what s in front of them . Entering Wednesday night against the off kilter Washington Wizards , Golden State had 34 games remaining . Of those , half will be against teams with a sub . 500 record . Give the Warriors those , and they instantly pop to 61 wins . Of the 17 others against teams with winning records , nine are at home . The Warriors have won 40 consecutive home games . They have not lost at Oracle Arena in more than a year . If they close undefeated at home , that s 70 wins . That means they would need to go just 3 5 on the road against teams with a winning record to surpass the Bulls 72 wins .
