Sixty eight years ago , in the summer of 1944 , the Republican Party nominated Ohio Gov . John Bricker to be the vice presidential candidate alongside presidential nominee Thomas Dewey . Although the GOP ticket was crushed by FDR , it is interesting to note that Ohio was one of only 12 states carried by the Republicans . It is hard not to credit Bricker with delivering his home state . After all , Roosevelt had never before lost Ohio . Four years later , Dewey , with his new running mate , California Gov . Earl Warren , would lose the Buckeye State in an election that everyone expected him to win .
