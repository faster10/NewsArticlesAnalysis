McCreery : You know , I ' m not so sure exactly on that . But country fans are really loyal and they were really supportive of me . I didn ' t do the honky tonk in the traditional way , but now , I ' m the newbie in country music . I was the " American Idol " and all that , but now I ' m making the transition and I ' m low down the ranks . Just like the senior in high school who becomes the freshman in college . I got to work hard and hopefully get my sea legs and stay around for a bit .
