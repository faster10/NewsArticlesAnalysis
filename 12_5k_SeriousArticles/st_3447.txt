If notions of justice should apply globally , the deal appears greedy . A simple growth model indicates that by 2050 the U .

This gets a little better if we assume that China peaks rather than stabilizes in 2030 , in which case , we estimate the two countries will emit about 370 billion tons , or about 40 of the 900 billion ton limit , by 2050 .
