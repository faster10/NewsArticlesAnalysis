On what he s seen out of Michael Bennett : Unfortunately , we have not seen him do the sack dance . Thanks league . He is leading the league in sacks , and he s played great football . I don t think anything has changed for him . He s always been incredibly versatile , incredibly aggressive and physical and playing in the backfield . I think this year , he s been able to get there a few more times . Sometimes with D linemen , it s just , sometimes it s the breaks . QB slips around into another guys hands , or he just slips right outside , or one of your guys runs into you , and I think this year he s given a chance to get there in the way that we always know he could . It s showing up on film .
