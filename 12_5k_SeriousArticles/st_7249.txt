A few years back , a devastating event took the wind out of my sails . Trying to find my footing again , I remembered the fun I had had as a kid blowing bubbles . So I went to the store , bought five containers , and started blowing . Lo and behold , I laughed and felt happy ! This childhood pastime has become the way that I lift my spirits and celebrate life . For example , my grandpa passed away recently , and we blew bubbles in his honor .
