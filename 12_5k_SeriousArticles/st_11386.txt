These are wars with no clean victories . There are no sailors in New York waiting to grab a passing dame to celebrate victory with a kiss . In the way that people offer their thanks , there is an echo of guilt just an echo of our country ' s mistreatment of its Vietnam veterans , and that only a select few have borne this generation ' s burden of war . That awkwardness with which the thanks is delivered , coupled with some veterans ' anxieties about what they have seen or done , can make Veterans Day seem like a show of empty patriotism or worse , a slim bandage slapped over a gaping wound of indifference , pity or guilt .
