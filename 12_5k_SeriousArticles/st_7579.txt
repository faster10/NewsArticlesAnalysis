1 . GIVE THE NOOBS A CHANCE . Did anyone know Mozart In The Jungle existed before its nomination ? For all the jibes that the HFPA gets about how it allows itself to be campaigned for votes , at the end of the day , it does give new shows a chance . And with everyone scrambling for an increasingly scarce audience share , the Golden Globes has become a major television launching pad . The group s willingness to embrace the new ? evident in the abundance of nominations for streaming networks this year ? is making its TV trophies increasingly vital in helping less established shows and platforms find an audience . Look no further than Mr Robot winning Best TV Drama Series over Game Of Thrones and Empire , and Mozart In The Jungle winning Best TV Comedy Series over Orange Is The New Black and Veep . How about also giving former heart throbs and their flagging careers a new lease of life ? It was heartening to see the HFPA give Christian Slater a deserving Best Supporting Actor shout out for Mr Robot .
