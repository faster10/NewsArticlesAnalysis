Radar can take two forms . One is primary radar , what ' s sometimes called " skinpaint , " that simply reflects off an object . Primary radar doesn ' t give any information about the object it ' s tracking . " If you work at an ATC ( Air Traffic Control ) facility on an East Coast flyway , you will pick up flocks of birds , " Griffin said . Primary radar can also pick up debris that might be raining down from an in flight explosion , and in such cases a target that appears as one object suddenly appears as several objects .
