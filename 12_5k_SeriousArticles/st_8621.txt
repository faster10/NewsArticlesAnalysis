Created in fall 2011 , it seeks to assist EMS , police and firefighters in meeting needs that the city can not currently provide due to its current financial situation . The organization estimates the total unserved needs of the three public safety branches at about 20 million . So far , the organization has helped deliver about 30 million in federal grants to Detroit firefighters and arranged for training support for the police department . The group is currently conducting a drive to raise additional money and to collect supplies like mops , soap and similar products to assist the city ' s firefighters .
