Undeterred by growing protests , the RSS has now announced a campaign to correct religious imbalance . The latest census data , they claim , show that the population growth of the Muslims is marginally higher than the rate of growth of the Hindus . Even when the Hindu population remains stagnant , it will take more than a century for the Muslims to overtake . If the Hindu population continues to grow at the current rate , there is just no way that any religious minority can ever become a majority . Yet , the RSS has announced a nationwide campaign to spread disharmony . It could well turn out to be reminiscent of the notorious nasbandi ( forcible population control ) , launched during the Emergency , when democratic rights and civil liberties were abrogated .
