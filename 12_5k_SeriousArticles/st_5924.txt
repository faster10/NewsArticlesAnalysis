Oklahoma doesn t have to play a conference title game ? unlike other playoff favorites , it can t lose next week . So Saturday s performance alone would have likely assured the Sooners a playoff spot . However , their top four spot became even more certain when No . 9 Stanford beat No . 6 Notre Dame on a 45 yard field goal as time expired . The Fighting Irish were the only other one loss team in a position to deny Oklahoma a playoff spot and could have made the selection committee s task difficult had they earned a convincing win over the Cardinal . Their loss instead removes them from the playoff hunt with no games left to make a better final impression .
