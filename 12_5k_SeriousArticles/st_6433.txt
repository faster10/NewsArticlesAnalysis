I call it that for the reaction of nearly all is the same . A slowing of pace as they turn the corner of the pathway and behold the cemetery for the first time . Nearly all stop for a moment , and so many ( myself included ) begin to weep . I will never forget my elderly friend , after checking into a small office to find the resting place of a friend amid all those thousands of graves , stoically pressed on until he found the grave he was looking for , and then the tears flowed .
