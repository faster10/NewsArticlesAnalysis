Good thing that the Bears gave Marshall away for a bag of peanuts HUGE MISTAKE . Pace has made some good decisions , but that one was the worst decision hopefully that he makes because if Marshall were still here , Bears have a shot at playoffs . If we can t negotiate a reasonable price for Jeffrey , we should tag him . he can t stay healthy , Marshall is playing every game for the Jets , he has about 800 yards and 6 TDs so far . Bad , bad bad MISTAKE Pace better make up for that blunder .
