Things are going well right now for Sen . Ted Cruz ( R Texas ) . On Tuesday , Quinnipiac ? declared that he was polling at 23 percent among likely Iowa Republican caucus participants just 2 points behind the front runner , businessman Donald Trump . A lot of people got excited about this , because the Quinnipac poll has a 4 percent margin of error , and hey , two is less than four . So maybe this means that Trump and Cruz are kinda , sorta . . . tied ?
