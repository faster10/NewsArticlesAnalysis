People who have very limited knowledge of sports always say , Passing the ball makes everyone better , says Bryant . No . That s not it . That s not making them better . That s giving them an opportunity to be successful . If you want to make them better , you don t just hand them the ball . You inspire them to be the best version of themselves , and I do that by sharing things which are very personal to me , things I ve struggled with , and letting them relate that to their own journey .
