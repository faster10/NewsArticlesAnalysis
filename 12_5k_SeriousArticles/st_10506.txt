" I don ' t know how we managed it , " Gore said , " but we ' re just outside the mainstream . We don ' t sound like the mainstream . So even in areas where we ' re extremely popular , we ' re seen as more of an underground band . Even in Germany , where we ' re one single away from having more top 10 singles than the Beatles , we ' re still seen as a cult band , and we have that mystique about us . "
