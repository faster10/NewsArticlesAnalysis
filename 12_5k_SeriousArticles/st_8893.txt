On a night when the moon is not reflecting off the water and the ocean is obscure , you need to travel only a block or two from the beach to the Intracoastal Waterway . There , you can sit at any of the restaurants or bars on the waterway and watch the boats go by . If you ' re traveling with children , the best place to go is to Benihana when you aren ' t being entertained by the chef , you can look out the window and watch boats of all sizes go by .
