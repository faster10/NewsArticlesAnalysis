STINGY DEFENSES : Going back to Detroit ' s 18 16 win at Green Bay , both the Lions and Packers have been playing well on defense . Detroit has given up an average of 14 . 3 points over the past three games while Green Bay has allowed 16 points per game during the same stretch . The Packers should have banged up defensive backs Damarious Randall ( knee ) and Micah Hyde ( hip ) healthy enough to help them cover receivers Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate . The Lions hope they ' ll have safety Glover Quin ( ankle ) in the lineup after he left last week ' s game with an ankle injury .
