Nelly said although she has suffered hardship , she has no regrets . She said : ' With my first husband I chose someone not knowing that he was a bad guy . I had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage I had been hit . . . to the point where I had to go to work with bruises all over my body , raped many , many times and everything else . The day after my second son died , I came home and my husband punched me in the forehead , there was blood all over the place . A week after that , I left with my other son and we went to California . I went on with my life , I went to school and I never asked for child support or anything . I never looked back . I am very happy , actually , and I don ' t have regrets even though I ' ve been through hell . As far as I know , I ' ve accomplished what I ' ve had to accomplish in my life '
