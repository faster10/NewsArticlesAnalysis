A darker view sees a credit bubble emanating from years of misguided over investment in China ' s infrastructure , housing and manufacturing . China has created an unsustainable credit bubble , and this will come crashing down , taking the Chinese ? and by implication , East Asian ? economy with it . This view does not deny the need to restructure the Chinese economy , but anticipates a cyclical downturn , a financial crisis along the lines of 1998 . The Chinese economy will not see a " soft landing , " but rather a full blown crash .
