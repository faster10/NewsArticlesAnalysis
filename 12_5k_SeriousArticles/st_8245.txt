I first met Mandela at a business awards gathering . The second time was at the opening of the SOS children ' s village in Cape Town where he presided as guest of honor . He was charming , talking to me about my job while holding my hand . He was still extremely energetic at 79 and very handsome . His only ailment was watery eyes , the result of 13 years spent doing hard labor at the limestone quarry on Robben Island , where he spent 18 years of his 27 years of imprisonment in a small cell .
