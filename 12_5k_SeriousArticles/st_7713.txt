Still , McCoy and his partner , Scott Waugh , ( they style themselves " The Bandito Brothers " ) might be correct when they claim this is the first time real life Navy SEALs have appeared ( incognito ) on camera in the principal roles .

There ' s no official word on how many real life terrorists were harmed in the making of this movie .
