On Sunday , Cruz said that any attempt to link Dear to conservative s mission to curtail a woman s right to choose is merely vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro life .

Cruz , you see , is very , very concerned about people who make commonsense accusations based on reports that Dear was mumbling about baby parts when he was arrested . Repeating the Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood constitutes , to his mind , very little evidence .
