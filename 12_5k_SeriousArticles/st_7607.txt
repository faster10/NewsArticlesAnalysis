I directed a 13 year old Alan Rickman at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith . He played the town mouse in a musical version of Aesop s fables . We won our section of the Hammersmith Drama Competition . I had just got into Cambridge and was working as a part time teacher . Alan was quiet but very clever and inventive . 22 years later he played the James Stewart part in The Philadelphia Story for me at Oxford . As boy and man he was a talented , funny and gentle person .
