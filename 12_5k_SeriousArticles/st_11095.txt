This was not the most beautiful goal , it was a heavily deflected free kick , but it is special for me because it was Orlando City ' s first ever goal . When I signed for the newly formed MLS side I really wanted to score their first goal . We were losing by a goal , in their MLS debut game , and the match was in stoppage time , but I hit a 25 yard free kick to the goalkeepers ' s right a it took a huge deflection and went into the left of goal . The stadium was full of 63 , 000 fans practically all from Orlando . The reaction was incredible .
