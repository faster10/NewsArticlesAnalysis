This is an absurd problem for states to wrestle with this notion of how to kill someone properly . Like I said , if anyone deserved the death penalty , it was Lockett , but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily . It seems clear that the death penalty is a 19th century relic , and our ridiculous struggle to figure out how to do it properly in the 21st century is a signal that perhaps we should join the rest of the civilized Western world in abolishing executions .
