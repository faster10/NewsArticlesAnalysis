At 42 years old , I competed in the Ultraman World Championships , a grueling three day uber endurance triathlon circumnavigating the Big Island of Hawaii that involves 6 . 2 miles of swimming , 260 miles of cycling and culminates with a 52 . 4 mile double marathon run . I placed 11th overall and was the third fastest American . To top it off , Men ' s Fitness magazine recently named me one of the " 25 Fittest Guys in the World . " ( Not that I actually believe I deserve such an honor ! )
