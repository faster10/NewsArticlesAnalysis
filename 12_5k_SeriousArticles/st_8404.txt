Since my son was very young , we ' ve worked for so many hours on his speech . Together , we ' ve worked with many therapists to carve out individual phonemes , tones , sounds and finally words . Each tiny advance takes months . I wept when I heard him say , " I love you " for the first time , even though it was in a slurred , indistinct voice of the exact type that Cenac was mocking . Moreover , speech is so fraught , because intelligibility how clearly my son can communicate with strangers determines what kind of independence will be possible for him as an adult .
