To address the terrorist threat , Europe s governments would need to do what they should do anyway to bring the Schengen system up to date . They would need to harden external borders , preferably by putting them entirely under a jointly run agency such as the EU s Frontex , using a common terrorist watch list and fingerprint database . That way , for example , agents at the free travel zone s Balkan borders ? in Slovenia and Hungary ? could check cars and trains heading north .
