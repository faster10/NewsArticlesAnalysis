Rousey planned on taking a hiatus from fighting following her matchup with Holm . Was it a good look for Mayweather to take the high road and not join the Rousey haters in bashing her right after her defeat or do you think he s saving his real thoughts for later ? She ll be okay . You know , but I m waiting for the comeback of Jon Jones and the other guy that Jon Jones faced before Daniel Cormier . Certain things you have to learn . Her one sole loss doesn t take anything away from the fantastic career she s had thus far or all she s done for women in sports .
