Iran can live for a long time with the new unilateral US sanctions . The thing that was really painful for Iran ? was the international multilateral economic sanctions targeting the entire Iranian economy , their ability to export and sell oil , their ability to participate in the international financial system . These are the things that really hurt the Iranian economy and hurt the average person in Iran . . . The average person in Iran is not going to feel pain from these sanctions , unlike the economic sanctions . Shortages of lifesaving medicines in Iran are the result of the broad sanctions . These are two totally different things in terms of their scale , their scope , who they impact . . .
