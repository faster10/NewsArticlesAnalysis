PB : I don t think so . When there are prisoner exchanges , both sides have an interest in working it out . There is of course the danger the Iranian government may feel some pressure from hardliners in their parliament ? just as the Obama administration is under pressure from the right wing in the Congress , from both parties ? to engage in some kind of a tit for tat . Hopefully that won t involve civilians . . . I think the prisoner exchange was a win win situation , both sides gained . Citizens of both sides were released ? that is very important and I don t see any reasons to undermine that .
