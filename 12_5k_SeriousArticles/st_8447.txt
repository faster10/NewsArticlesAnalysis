One source stressed that the session should be termed a meeting instead of a formal interview , saying the Eagles want to talk to Coughlin , 69 , to gauge his interest in coaching again , and in coaching against the Giants , his team of the last 12 years , in the NFC East . The Eagles needed to ask the Giants permission to interview Coughlin because he remains under contract with Big Blue for one more season . Coughlin and the Giants would need to come to a settlement if he wanted to sign with Philadelphia , or any other club .
