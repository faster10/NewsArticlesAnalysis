After this brief opening statement , Christie took about a dozen questions from what appeared to be a generally friendly crowd , albeit one that showed less dyed in the wool partisanship than , say , a Bernie Sanders crowd . The topics ranged from how to deal with the Chinese island building effort in the South China sea ? I d fly Air Force One over the islands ? to Obamacare ? ( Repeal it and turn health care over to the states ) ? to Dodd Frank ( repeal it for small community banks and allow states to regulate them ) . On the environment , in contrast to many of his Republican rivals , Christie believes that global climate change is driven in part by human activity , and he supports efforts to reduce global emissions using alternative energy sources ? but not through cap and trade policies . In this vein , he touted New Jersey s heavy reliance on nuclear power ( Fifty three percent of our electricity is produced by nuclear power ) and solar energy ( New Jersey is in the Top 3 solar states , behind California and Arizona ) while trying to phase out coal powered plants . Christie says each state must adopt the mix of energy sources that works best for them in combating climate change ( Iowa should emphasize wind turbines . ) But he acknowledged that reducing carbon emissions is a global problem and emphasized the need to work with the Chinese on this issue , although he was notably short on specifics regarding how he might do so . When asked about increasing funding for space exploration , Christie used the question as an opportunity to cite the need for reforming entitlement programs which he said consumes more than 70 of the federal budget . I m sorry , but until we tackle this issue , I m not going to be increasing money on the space program . On campaign finance , Christie says he would allow unlimited direct contributions to candidates , but make sure they were posted for full transparency online within 24 hours .
