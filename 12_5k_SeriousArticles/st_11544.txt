Sadly , no one will be able to buy the gorgeous DB10 ? that car was created and christened for Mr Bond and Mr Bond only ? so the 191 , 120 DB9 GT is as close as anyone is going to get , at least until the DB9 s long awaited replacement , the DB11 , arrives circa 2017 . The DB11 , we re told , will adopt much of the DB10 s sexy new styling ? hooray ! In the meantime , the DB9 GT isn t so bad , really .
