I ll be surprised if he doesn t ( get picked ) . I d be very much surprised . Obviously our record is not where we anticipated , ( but ) injuries have to do with that . But as far as his play , he s playing at a real high level . When you look at what he brings to our team and what he means to our team , the level he plays at , I d be very shocked if he wasn t on the All Star team .
