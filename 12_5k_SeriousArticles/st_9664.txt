Bale was 17 years old when he played the part of 17 year old Jack Kelly , who hawked copies of the New York World with tactics as dubious and gotcha ! as the era ' s yellow journalism . When media moguls Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst decided to make their newspaper boys pay more for the papers they sell , Jack rallied his fellow paperboys to strike . Complications ensued , resolution was achieved , and the " Newsies " danced . In 2011 , Disney Theatrical Productions began work on a stage version with songs by Menken and Jack Feldman and a book by Harvey Fierstein . " Newsies The Musical " opened on Broadway last March to sell outs and acclaim . It earned eight Tony nominations and won two ( best choreography , best original score ) .
