Ipsos has surveyed the motivations of the voters who showed up at the ballot boxes this Sunday : in part , unemployment , a consistent concern in the minds of the French for the past for some 40 years , with terrorism , insecurity and immigration following close behind . The tragedy of November 13 served to amplify this tendency . The coming months will not reverse it . I am not convinced that , contrary to the enthusiastic claims of Florian Philippot , the FN vote was a " vote of love . "
