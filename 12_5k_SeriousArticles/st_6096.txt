Only the cold kept it close hmmmmmm then I guess according to that assumption , the Vikings would have been shut out in normal weather ? ? Only problem with that is both teams played in that frigid weather . And , according to EVERYONE , including all your players and coaches , they re used to that kind of temperature ! ! ! So , stop trying to sell it , cause no one is buying it ! You ll have plenty of time to gloat on your one point win against the Vikings after the Panthers kick the crap out of your Seahawks on Sunday . It will be fun to watch !
