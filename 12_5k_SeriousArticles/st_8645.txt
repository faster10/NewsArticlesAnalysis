Only now , in the 11th hour of Mr Obama s presidency , is Congress discovering ways for the two parties to work together . For example , bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind , through the Every Student Succeeds Act , passed in December . It promises to lift the thumb of federal educational oversight by easing some of the testing , curriculum and accountability burdens that have placed a failed label on countless urban public schools . And there s new hope for reform of the criminal justice system because of bipartisan agreement on the need to reduce prison costs and stop the abuses that , too often , put innocent people behind bars .
