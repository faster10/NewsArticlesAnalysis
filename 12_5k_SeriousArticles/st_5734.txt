If you looked at the Republican debate , I would think it was not very personal at all . I think what I have been trying to do , and the point that I made last night , was I can t walk down the street , as you well know , without media saying , you know , criticize Hillary Clinton , say something terrible about Hillary Clinton . It s not my style of politics . What I have tried to do from day one is to run an issue oriented campaign , and the reason you run is to show the differences of opinion you know , you have different opinions . Hillary Clinton and I have differences of opinion . It s called democracy . But I m not into personal attacks and mean spirited attacks , he said .
