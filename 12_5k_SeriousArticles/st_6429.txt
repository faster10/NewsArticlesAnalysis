The Tar Heels are tied for No . 6 nationally in tackles for loss allowed ( 4 . 25 per game ) . That not only speaks to the offensive line but to the ability of backs like Hood to escape being tackled behind the line . Of the backs Clemson has faced , only Patrick Skov and Marcus Marshall at Georgia Tech have a lower percentage of rush plays that have resulted in zero or negative yards . Hood is the real deal , and so is the UNC offensive line .
