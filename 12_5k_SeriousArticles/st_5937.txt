Was I tempted to do the same ? Well , I rested a few players , but overall I feel we have less injuries than Liverpool at the moment . And don t worry , Arsene is a very good doctor ! They always heal when they play against us ! Arsenal are used to fighting on three fronts , and can put the Champions League to one side ahead of their return on February 23 , and Wenger insisted he was a past master at rotating players during busy spells .
