When rural migrants move to the cities they live in a twilight zone : They can ' t access healthcare , social security or even public education as part of the nation ' s " hukou " system , which requires household registration . Migrant workers still must be registered in their rural town of origin , not the city to which they move which keeps public services out of reach for many who have flocked to cities for work .
