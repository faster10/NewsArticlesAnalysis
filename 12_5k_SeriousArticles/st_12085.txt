' ' As I see it , when you see a player in form , he ' s walking off the golf course thinking , Gee , I played like I should have shot 70 ' and he ' s signing for a 68 , ' ' Harrington said . ' ' When you see a player out of form , he ' s walking over the golf course saying , Yeah , I should have shot 70 today , ' and he ' s signing for a 72 . When you ' re shooting 72 out here , it ' s just a grind because every day you ' re on 72 , you ' re looking over your shoulder at the cut line .
