People infected with Zika virus don t infect one another directly ? with the rare possibility that semen may carry the virus . But , just as with malaria , people are the source for spreading the virus . A female mosquito bites an infected person and then can carry the virus to the next person she bites , so when people travel , they can bring the virus with them . The virus can take hold if enough people become infected for it to become endemic ? a word meaning it s in a region permanently .
