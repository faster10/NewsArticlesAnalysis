So , this is the moment they said would never happen , Rubio told supporters in Des Moines . For months , they told us we had no chance .

For months , they told us because we didn t have the right endorsements or the right political connections we have no chance . They told me we that we have no chance because my hair wasn t gray enough , and my boots were too high .
