The following day we reviewed the game , an excruciating process , before one of the coaches quietly told me I ' d be starting the following week . I was incredibly happy . In an instant any residual disappointment from the game was gone . Even though the rest of the team nursed the loss for days afterwards , I was floating just to know I was playing the following weekend . In a horrible way the loss made it easier , too , because we could hardly do any worse than we ' d done in Wellington .
