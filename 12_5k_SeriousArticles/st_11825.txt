If that was Belichick talking to the Buffalo media , he d get a fine . Rex saying he s not obsessed with the Patriots is the funniest thing I have heard in a long time . As soon as a game is over , 31 coaches in the NFL are already thinking about the next game , Rex hardly ever gets through a press conference without talking about the Patriots , even though they re not playing them . This guy is such a joke , and thinks he s a much better coach than he is . Go have a snack you jackass !
