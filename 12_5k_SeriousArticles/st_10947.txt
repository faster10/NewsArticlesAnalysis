Mr Chapo , wouldn t it be cool that you started trafficking with love ? With cures for diseases , with food for the homeless children , with ALCOHOL for the retirement homes that don t let the elderly spend the rest of the days doing whatever the f k they want . Imagine trafficking with corrupt politicians instead of women and children who end up as slaves . Why don t you burn all those whore houses where women are worth less than a pack of cigarettes ? Without offer there s no demand . COME ON Don ! You would be the HERO of HEROES ! Let s traffic with love . YOU KNOW HOW TO . Life is a business , and the only thing that changes is the merchandise . Don t you agree ?
