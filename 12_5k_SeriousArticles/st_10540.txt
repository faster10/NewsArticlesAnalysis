Merkel has refused to set an upper limit for refugee numbers or to close German borders but she has promised a " tangible reduction " of arrivals . Key planks of her policy involve EU and international cooperation from spreading refugees more equitably across the EU via ' hotspot ' first registration centres , to better guarding the bloc ' s outside borders , to striking a deal with Turkey to limit migrant flows from Syria , Iraq and beyond . So far , there has been little progress , an issue that was set to dominate Merkel ' s working lunch with Italian prime minister Renzi . Germany has voiced impatience with Italy for so far failing to set up a hotspot . Renzi ' s government has also held up a three billion euro ( 3 . 3 billion ) EU payment to Turkey meant to help the transit country seal its borders and house even more refugees . ?
