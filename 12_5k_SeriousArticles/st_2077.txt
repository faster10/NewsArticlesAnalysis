When women make public charges , they go on public trial themselves , with their pasts mined for anything that might discredit them . Have they ever gone bankrupt or lost a job ? Intimate details of their lives are held under the microscope . Why should their past matter ? The issue is whether a man in authority misused his power to coerce sexual favors from a subordinate or take other liberties . If women make a charge , they have to live with an assault on their own character .
