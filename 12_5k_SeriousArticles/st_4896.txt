Both coaches are perfect fits for their teams . Shoot , Arians and Arizona are such a good match that their names have five letters in common . As for Rivera , his players revere him , especially after he led them through the trial by fire that was the 2014 season , when the Panthers started 3 ? 8 ? 1 and still rallied to win four in a row and claim the NFC South title . Since that winning streak started , Carolina is a ridiculous 21 ? 2 in its past 23 games .
