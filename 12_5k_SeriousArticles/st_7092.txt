Almost no one other than my eagle eyed colleague Luke Winn noticed , but this game nearly ended on a six man technical foul on Kansas in the first overtime . With 2 . 4 seconds left and the game tied at 86 , the Jayhawks Frank Mason III was on the baseline about to get the ball from an official to inbound . Kansas had six players on the court at the time , but Devonte Graham made it from about a foot outside the key to the bench before the officials noticed .
