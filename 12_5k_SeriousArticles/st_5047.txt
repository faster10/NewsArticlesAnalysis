Nazer agrees to sit for a few minutes to talk to me , with Mati translating . His words are few . I quickly learn he works ten hours a day , six days a week . The boss pays him less than a dollar a day . And his wages are the only income for his family of five . His father was blinded years ago in a Soviet rocket attack and cannot work . His mother has two other small children at home . Nazer has had three years of school . Then , last year , his uncle brought him here .
