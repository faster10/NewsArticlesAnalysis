Clinton has struck a chord with the electorate by going after the NRA , an area in which she clearly differs with Sanders . Fighting the NRA isn ' t new for Clinton , who fought them for years while Sanders voted against the Brady bill and against allowing people to sue gun manufacturers . That is fair campaigning just as it is fair for Sanders to point out the differences in their positions on the minimum wage , he being for a federal 15 minimum wage and Clinton being for a 12 one allowing states and localities to decide if they want to go higher depending on their individual economies . Or pointing out the differences in their positions on how to deal with the big banks and allowing voters to decide which they like best .
