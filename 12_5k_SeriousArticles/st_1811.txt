Dallas Cowboys : The Cowboys are in the midst of their longest losing streak since 1989 . A loss Sunday to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers probably would force the Cowboys to be perfect once Tony Romo returns to the field . They might need to be perfect even if they win Sunday . To get that elusive win , the Cowboys will have to grind it out . In the Buccaneers ' five losses , their opponent has run the ball at least 32 times on four occasions . Last week , the New York Giants ran the ball 33 times for 114 yards . They were persistent . The Cowboys ' running game finally has found its legs the past three weeks , with Darren McFadden picking up 333 yards . This game won ' t be easy . The Buccaneers will force the Cowboys to go the long way without the big play . After being so close to wins the past three games , the Cowboys will be glad to take home an ugly W . Cowboys 20 , Bucs 16 . Todd Archer
