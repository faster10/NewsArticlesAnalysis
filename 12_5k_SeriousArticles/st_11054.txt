Funny thing is that throughout the years , as many of my friends fell out of love with Obama , at times , my defense of him only grew stronger . I will openly admit that this is in part , due to the overt racism and venom spewed from conservative talk radio , FOX News pundits , and the Tea Party that in many ways , pushed me into a defense mode . What some of my progressive friends still fail to appreciate is the extent to what Obama ' s presidency has meant for my students , most of whom are nonwhite , or my biracial niece who has never known a world without a black president . Put simply , it matters .
