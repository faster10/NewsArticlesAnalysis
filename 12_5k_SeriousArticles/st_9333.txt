Later , after the dawn of the Internet , there was a website devoted to answering the much Googled question , Is Abe Vigoda dead ? . The Beastie Boys Posse In Effect included the boast : I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda . In contrast to the very fit Vigoda , a dedicated handball player and jogger , Detective Fish complained about his aches , his pains , his bladder problems and hemorrhoids , always seeming on the verge of death . Indeed , Abe Vigoda worked in a number of Broadway productions in the decade prior to his role in The Godfather , including a spot in The Man in the Glass Booth , as noted in Vigoda s online biography . He also appeared in The Story of Pretty Boy Floyd ( 1974 ) , Having Babies ( 1976 ) , The Cheap Detective ( 1978 ) and How to Pick Up Girls !
