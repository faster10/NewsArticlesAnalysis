Aldean : The music industry is so different now than it was even when I hit the scene in 2005 . If you go to Wal Mart and you want a song , you ' ve got to buy the whole album for ten bucks or you can go to iTunes , and if you want a song , you can pay a dollar to get it . So in return , the record label is going to make less money , which is us making less money to pay them back .
