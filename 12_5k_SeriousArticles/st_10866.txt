How does it work ? The traditional Chinese view is that energy or ' Qi ' flows directly through 12 main channels , called meridians , in the body and if the flow is interrupted it can cause ill health . Inserting tiny needles and manipulating them at ' trigger points ' restores the flow of energy . It is believed the needles stimulate skin and muscle nerves , releasing the body ' s natural painkillers endorphins and serotonin into the pain pathways of the spinal cord and the brain to modify the way pain signals are received . It may also have beneficial effects on the nervous system , muscle tone , hormone production and circulation , as well as breathing , digestion and fertility .
