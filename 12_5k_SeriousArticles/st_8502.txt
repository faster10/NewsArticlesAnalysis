While the tone of Spectre might have been somewhat lighter than any other Daniel Craig outing , the theme of surveillance gave it some vague roots in reality . Andrew Scott s sinister suit busied himself by spouting about a future where privacy would be a thing of the past , along with the dated use of agents such as Bond . It was clearly a post Snowden Bond film but other than some rather obvious speeches , did the film really do much with it ? It was no great surprise that Scott s character ended up being a bad guy but the connection to Spectre and Blofeld was thinly drawn . Could there have been more depth ?
