To the Labour Party ? the party I lead ? I have this message . Screw you . To the members of Parliament I lead I have this message . Screw you . To those hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members and former Labour Party members who didn t vote for me , I have the same message . Screw you . And for the millions of people who voted Labour at the last general election , and who yearn for a Labour government , I have a very special message . Screw every single one of you .
