" I don ' t know if it ' s about the name or what , but at the same time , we play football too . We work our butt off too . Don ' t single us out . At the end of the day , it ' s the name , " Hatcher said . " Don ' t worry about the name we players and we work our butt off too . I ' m just frustrated with it . We shouldn ' t have to be punished for that . It ' s been every game , calls after calls that should ' ve been made in our favor , but it goes to them . It ' s just not right .
