' I will keep trying to win football matches . We have been playing well at home and if we had beaten Swansea here when we were 1 0 up two minutes into injury time then we would be sitting higher up the table . That ' s how close it is . We are all stuck down there , one win can take you up five places and a defeat can drop you down four or five places as it did with us . We just have to keep going . '
