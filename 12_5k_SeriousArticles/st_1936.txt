Theranos said it has addressed and corrected all of the inspection issues . Theranos says its technology can run finger stick samples for tests that have typically required an entire vial of blood . While the firm lists about 200 tests on its online menu , this month it said that it is using its new technology on only one , a herpes test . The FDA reports said Theranos s blood collection device is a Class II medical device , which is considered higher risk than the Class I that Theranos had categorized it as . You are currently shipping this uncleared medical device in interstate commerce , the FDA said . Theranos said it decided to stop using its nanotainers in all except the herpes test , cleared by the FDA in July .
