Apple obviously writes its own software for the iPhone , but Samsung ' s phones all run a customized version of Google ' s open source Android , and Samsung is so dominant that it could very well split off and start building its own version of Android , just as Amazon did with the Kindle Fire . That would be a huge blow to Google . If the rest of the market can ' t make money using Android soon , it ' ll provide a big opening for Microsoft .
