Now Klitschko , on the advice of his trainer Johnathon Banks ( no , not Mike from Breaking Bad ) comes out swinging and lands a decent enough left . Fury throws a big right off the back foot but can only smack the open air . A couple of jabs from Fury , Klitschko comes forward but then rocks back out the way of a big left hook . Fury is showing a lot of swagger and confidence , although he ' s not landing a great deal of scoring punches . Better that , from the champion .
