But Cruz is walking in lockstep with nativist and proud Iowa Rep . Steve King . One of the few immigration bills that passed this Congress was sponsored by King and called for the deportation of all of these so called Dreamer kids . Not unusual for a congressman who cannot talk about immigrants without talking about criminals . Such dehumanization of immigrants as " the other " is too common on the right . ( One GOP elected official , a Kansas state legislator , once went so far as to " joke " that shooting undocumented immigrants from helicopters might be a good way to keep them in check . )
