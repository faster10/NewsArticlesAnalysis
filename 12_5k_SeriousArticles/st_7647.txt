" Glastonbury about 20 years ago , in 1991 , I think . I was 18 . It wasn ' t like I grew up in the back of a tee pee or was a hippie child taken around festivals . I was a student and it was when Glastonbury was really exploding . It really changed my life , which sounds like a clich , but it opened my eyes to a completely different kind of life . I knew I always wanted to go to festivals and it ' s a total part of our lives now . "
