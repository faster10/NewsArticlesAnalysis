Once again , the Warriors proved great finishers with their " Killer Smalls " lineup of Curry , Green , Klay Thompson , Andre Iguodala and Barnes . The Warriors went to the lineup with 5 : 58 to go and subsequently broke away from an 89 all tie and did not trail again . Curry hit a 3 pointer with 5 : 26 to go and followed up a Chicago timeout with a layup with 3 : 48 remaining to give Golden State a 94 89 advantage . That set the stage for Barnes ' heroics at the finish .
