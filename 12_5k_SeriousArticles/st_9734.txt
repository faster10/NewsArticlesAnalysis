" A lot of the people that we sponsor . . . have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog , " Manning said . " A lot of them have lost their jobs . They ' ve lost their homes . Some have even lost their significant other or their loved ones . And the dog , to them , is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time . And they don ' t want to have to make that devastating decision . "
