I was selected at 12 , and at that point was hooked on the position . After my year with Canterbury and then the Crusaders , I felt like this was my spot . There was far less pressure , and you scored more tries a win win . 12 felt like a more open position , as we had so many great 10s in New Zealand at the time , from Spencer to Mehrts to Tony Brown . What with it being a World Cup year , everyone was that much more keyed up about job security , so I was happy to stay out of the first five battle .
