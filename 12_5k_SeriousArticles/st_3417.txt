In a Trump Cruz battle , I would not bet against Trump . Much of the Republican donor class is convinced that Cruz is the political equivalent of Barry Goldwater , in part because of his very conservative social views . A Trump Clinton contest , however , is beginning to appear more winnable ( particularly as Hillary Clinton appears more awkward and inept ) . Donors , one leading Republican figure told me , are trying hard to get comfortable with Trump . And Trump , without doubt , has improved his skills as a candidate .
