One is the Murray baby due in a fortnight , or rather the timing whereby Kim , his missus , fell pregnant nine months before the season s first grand slam event . Nothing is more ruinous to the concentration than waiting for an imminent first child . If it s unnerving enough when you work an hour from the maternity hospital , imagine how unsettling it must be at 12 , 000 miles remove ? I hope this doesn t imply a perverted sense of priorities , but Kim and Andy s failure to wait another month before conceiving was grossly irresponsible .
