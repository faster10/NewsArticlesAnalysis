It ' s a great honor to be able to go and compete at the highest level with the team that represents the best . We know that we ' re going to have to have great preparation here and play very well to have a chance to win the game . But again , just proud of our team and our staff for the type of season that we ' ve had . We look forward to a great game out in Arizona and traveling out there and competing one last time and hopefully playing our best four quarters .
