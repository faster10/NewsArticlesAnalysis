Some aspects of how the case will proceed are clear . First , while the prosecution was unconvinced by Zimmerman ' s self defense claim , he is still entitled to present it to the jury at trial . If they accept it , of course , he will be acquitted . In addition , although Zimmerman is charged with second degree murder , even if the jury rejects the self defense claim and believes the killing was homicide , they may choose to convict of a " lesser included offense " such as manslaughter . Manslaughter is still a serious felony , although it carries a lower penalty than murder .
