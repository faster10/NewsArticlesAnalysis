For certain , this team is different during the second half of this season . It ' s unlikely we ' ll be seeing any future blowouts like we did when Tom Terrific tore apart the Bills during week two . Or when he took out the Dolphins in a blowout victory . Instead , what we are seeing is a team that is determined to make the most of the hand they ' ve been dealt namely in lieu of injuries that are decimating the most talented players on their starting roster .
