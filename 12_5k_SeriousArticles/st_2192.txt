Ryan : A very good friend of mine has his own comic book company , and for years , he ' s been telling me about John Constantine being his favorite comic book character and " Hellblazer " his favorite book . Ever since I got the part , he keeps sending me emails : " Why don ' t you do this storyline or that storyline ? " It ' s like I ' ve got my own personalized fan who ' s feeding me all the great things about the character . I didn ' t know that much about it until I delved about the comics , and the more I ' m reading , the more I ' m loving .
