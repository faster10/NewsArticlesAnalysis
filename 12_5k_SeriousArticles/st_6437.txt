" My uncle ran a bowling alley there in Jackson , Mississippi . And they had a storage room out back . And that was my winter job , " he said . " We ' d go deer hunting and we ' d do taxidermy in the back of the bowling alley back there . It was a lot of fun . The bowling alley is still there , but there ' s nothing in the back but old bowling balls and old pins there , I think . "
