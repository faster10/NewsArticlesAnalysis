Maybe I have a natural affinity for the " also ran " crowd . I used to win races when I was a kid , but now even though I train thousands of miles , and run marathons and 50 mile ultra races , age makes it unlikely I ' ll ever win anything again . But in the middle of the pack I still feel the great struggle of all of those around me I see people wrestling with the conflicts of their lives , the pain of effort , the clock , and the relentless miles . This is the greatness of sport .
