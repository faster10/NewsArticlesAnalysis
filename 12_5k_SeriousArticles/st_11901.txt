" If a kid came out of a game , he got a hard hit , what we used to call a ' stinger ' or a ' ding , ' we would simply ask ' Are you OK ? ' and send him back in if he said yes , " Roda said . " Now if we see a kid with a big hit , we ' re checking on them to see if they ' re OK , and we ' re asking different kinds of questions to get the answers . "
