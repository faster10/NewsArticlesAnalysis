Irvin never played for the San Francisco Giants , as he retired before the franchise moved west following the 1957 season . But the organization made sure Irvin ' s contributions to the sport were honored fully . The Giants retired Irvin ' s No . 20 on June 26 , 2010 . And when they reached the World Series later that year , Irvin joined fellow Hall of Famers Willie McCovey , Orlando Cepeda , Gaylord Perry and Juan Marichal on the mound for a ceremonial first pitch before Game 1 .
