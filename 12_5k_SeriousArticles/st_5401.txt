My life in America has been very different from my life in Palestine and is much different from the lives of Israeli and Palestinian youth today . Going to school in Tampa , my only morning worry was getting a decent grade on my homework . My cousins in the West Bank , on the other hand , are worried about grades too , but they also have to worry about checkpoints and random clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli authorities . The day the four children were killed while playing soccer on Gaza Beach , my friends and I were at St . Pete Beach playing volleyball . Unlike those children , we made it home safely to our families .
