" The season so far has been a very positive one for Force India , " added di Resta . " To date , it ' s the most points we ' ve scored . We were fifth in the Constructors ' Championship until the last race , unfortunately we lost out to McLaren but it ' s been difficult with the tire construction change recently . But we ' re hopeful we can certainly bounce back and Monza is one of the places that generally suits our car . "
