ABC is a well defined identity , where it ' s family comedy with a slight edge plus reality programming for women , " McGee said . " Fox has its reality shows and slightly edgy comedies . NBC has been struggling for something it ' s got ' Parenthood ' over here , it ' s got ' Community ' over here , it ' s got ' The Biggest Loser ' in the middle , it ' s got ' SVU ' hanging on for dear life . It ' s trying to figure out when you think of NBC , what are you going to think of ? Right now , they want you to think of Matthew Perry and a monkey . "
