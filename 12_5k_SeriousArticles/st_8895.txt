For many locals , this is our version of Cheers . But instead of a Norm , we have a Rich who can always be found at the end of the bar . The Parrot is known by locals as a " Philly bar . " It caters to Philadelphia ' s sports teams , and the place is packed when the Flyers , Phillies , Eagles or even Penn State has a televised game . The extensive menu includes foods that Philadelphia is known for such as cheesesteak and soft pretzels . Even if you can ' t find Philadelphia on a map , it ' s a fun place where tourists and locals mix .
