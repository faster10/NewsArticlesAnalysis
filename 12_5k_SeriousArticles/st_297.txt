As " meh " as Aaron Rodgers was in the first half , he was lights out in the second half in leading Green Bay to the comeback win . Rodgers completed 14 of 20 passes for 197 yards with two touchdowns in the final two quarters and also had a nice 17 yard touchdown run ( which allowed him to be Green Bay ' s leading rusher ) . As much flak as he got early on , give him credit for the way he performed later . And his bomb to Richard Rodgers could he have worked that play any more perfectly ? He scrambled to get the time to throw and then somehow unleashed a 61 yard pass right on target .
