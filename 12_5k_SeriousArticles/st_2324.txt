It s really all too much ? or it would be if it weren t for the fact that , typically , some of the songs are very good ( we ll get to these soon ) . Quite a few aren t , of course , and the reasons for this are that the strengths that make Coldplay good ( thinking very seriously about Big Topics , being unashamedly emotional ) are also weaknesses that make Coldplay very weak , indeed . It s all about the balance , isn t it ?
