As all the candidates enter the Iowa homestretch , we ' ll get to see how they act when the pressure ' s on . Any of the four frontrunners could walk away a winner , which means they ' re all going to campaign harder than anything we ' ve seen yet . When the Iowa caucus results come in one week from tonight , there may be a major rewrite of the storyline of the campaign so far . Will Trump voters actually show up to vote ? Will Bernie voters make the effort ? Have the polls been wildly wrong all along ? If either Trump or Cruz wins Iowa , how will the Republican Party react ? Will we ( hopefully ) see multiple minor Republican candidates throwing in the towel on their unwinnable campaigns , or will they fight all the way to New Hampshire ? Will Clinton begin a march to victory in Iowa , or will everyone start talking about 2016 being 2008 for her all over again ?
