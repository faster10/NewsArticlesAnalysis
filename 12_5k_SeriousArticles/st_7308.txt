We all know that we have the best political system money can buy , but it s a huge leap forward to have an oligarch actually admit it on national TV during a presidential debate . Ever since the farcical Citizens United Supreme Court ruling turned the U . S . A . into the U . . A . , we ve been subjected to endless lies , propaganda and BS about how campaign finance is just free speech . We owe Trump a vote of thanks for admitting and exposing the truth .
