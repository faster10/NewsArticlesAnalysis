Colson understood the solution to these problems wasn ' t political or economical , but cultural . On March 30 , Colson gave a speech at the Wilberforce Weekend Conference in northern Virginia . It was the last public speech he would ever give . In it he remarked , " Politics is nothing but an expression of culture . . . so if things are bad , don ' t think it ' s going to be solved by an election . It ' s going to be solved by us . "
