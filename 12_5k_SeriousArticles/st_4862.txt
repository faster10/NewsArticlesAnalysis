But for the most part we ve done it really well , Carroll added . It s a really good thing to know about yourself when you re going into these games . I may mention to the guys that we re not out of a game , there s no time we re going to be out of one . So whatever it takes . The offense , the defense , or special teams to get it going again , there s a spark just waiting to happen to get us rolling , and we re going to keep playing like that .
