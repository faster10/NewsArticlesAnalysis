With names like Bot Mobile , Jack in the Bot , and Betty Bot , each robot is given its own identity and its own assignments . Like a choreographed routine they move autonomously up and down the aisles of the warehouse at about 10 kilometers per hour never missing a step , and always hitting their mark . This is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units , which together communicate where the bot is driving to .
