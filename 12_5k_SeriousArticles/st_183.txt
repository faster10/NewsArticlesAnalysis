It was as if Bowie were in that same bedroom , benignly registering the kid s amazement at being spoken to by an actual starman : I had to phone someone so I picked on you Hey , that s far out , so you heard him too ! Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two Look out your window I can see his light If we can sparkle , he may land tonight . That was powerful stuff : sparkle enough and he might arrive in your street .
