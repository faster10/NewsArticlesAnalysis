Moore : I think the writing process for the last record , for " Wild Hope , " I found myself in a bit of a funk . I don ' t know if I would necessarily classify it as a depression , but I was definitely in a very deeply , darkly place for me , and I had never really been there before . And there was a lot of investigation and questions bouncing around in my head that I found I could answer by kind of investing myself in music and writing .
