Heying : For the most part , people are ecstatic when they get the bill . And that just makes such a huge difference in people ' s lives . We had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car . And he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he didn ' t have heat in his car . And so it ' s not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school , even though that ' s a really important piece of it . It ' s really about protecting people ' s lives .
