Whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio , each agrees on certain core propositions : against abortion , against immigration ( despite both Cruz and Rubio being the children of immigrants ) , against the Affordable Care Act , in favour of a low minimum wage . They will fundamentally change the social fabric of the United States . Perhaps most important of all , the next president could get to replace as many as three Supreme Court judges and hence shape the direction of national law ? including of course abortion and voting rights ? for a generation .
