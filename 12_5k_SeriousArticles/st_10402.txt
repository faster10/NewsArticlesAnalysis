RUBIO : TRUMP IS NOT READY TO BE PRESIDENT . Marco Rubio has largely avoided saying what he thinks of Republican front runner Donald Trump . But when he sat down at Ron Morrison s table at a diner in Manchester , New Hampshire , Morrison pressed him for a straight answer , ABC s INES DE LA CUETARA writes . I don t think he s ready to be president of the United States , Rubio conceded . In September , the Florida senator said that Trump hadn t come up with any serious policy proposals . Now , with less than two weeks until the Iowa caucuses , it would appear Rubio has changed his mind . We have a right to be angry and upset about the direction of our country , said Rubio . But that alone won t be enough . You gotta know what you re going to do about it . http : abcn . ws 1nBikQ9
