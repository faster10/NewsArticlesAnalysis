Those men turned what were admittedly Iowa or bust campaigns into a launching pad for winning eight and 11 states , respectively , before dropping out of the race .

Now imagine they had amassed more cash on hand than the Republican National Committee has in its own war chest at the moment ? which Mr Cruz has done . Imagine they had come out of Iowa with more cash on hand than most of their competitors combined , which Mr Cruz currently has .
