The weird part is that Rubio supports Flores . He and Nelson recommended her to President Barack Obama , and the president formally nominated her to the U . S . District Court for the Southern District of Florida in February . She ' s now been waiting for a hearing for 242 days , but can ' t move without Rubio ' s sign off . She would fill a seat that ' s been empty for 532 days , and that court is so overloaded with work that it ' s considered a judicial emergency .
