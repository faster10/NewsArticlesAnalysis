BUSH INVOKES LINCOLN : Jeb Bush launched his " Jeb Can Fix It " tour , invoking a U . S . president who he said would have faced the same challenges he faces today . " If Lincoln were alive today , imagine the foolishness he would have to suffer . Advisers telling him to shave his beard . Cable pundits telling him to lose the top hat , " Bush told an enthusiastic crowd gathered yesterday at the Tampa Garden Club in Florida . He added that he has gotten advice , too : to ditch his glasses , change ties , prompting laughter and applause from the crowd . The tour and the release of his e book , " Reply All today , " are all in an effort to jumpstart a campaign that many say has been flailing , after tumbling poll numbers and a widely panned debate performance , ABC ' s CANDACE SMITH notes . http : abcn . ws 1KTlXo5
