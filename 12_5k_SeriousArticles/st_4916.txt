Frustrating loss in Pittsburgh , but we got another reminder that this football team especially when it comes to quarterback Derek Carr is no fluke , given that the Raiders nearly overcame several self inflicted wounds . Carr lofted a beauty to Michael Crabtree to keep them in it with less than two minutes left . Ultimately , poor technique cost Oakland a 57 yard catch and run to Antonio Brown that led to the Steelers ' game winning kick . Of immediate concern is running back Latavius Murray , who left his best game of the season with a possible concussion .
