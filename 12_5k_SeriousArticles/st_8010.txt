Because Theodore Kaczynski , the Unabomber Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh Atlanta , Georgia , Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph the Pentagon shooter and IRS attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies , surprisingly , the term " terrorism " has never seemed to stick to any of them . To prove my point even further , the recently indicted American woman Colleen LaRose , who called herself " Jihad Jane , " can rightfully be termed a wanna be terrorist . But why does this not apply to other white extremists ?
