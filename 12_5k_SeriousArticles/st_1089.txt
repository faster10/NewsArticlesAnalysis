Educate your children in advance . Whether your child is 5 or 15 , parents need to prepare them for the rules they have to follow while at an airport or on an airplane . It ' s good for younger children to practice clearing security , buckling their seat belts , turning off their electronics and tucking their things under the seat in front of them . If they do it as soon as they board the aircraft , no flight attendant will see them as potential rule violators .
