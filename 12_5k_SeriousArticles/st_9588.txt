Adande : Wesley Matthews . It ' s still less than a year since he ruptured his Achilles tendon , and he ' s putting up numbers pretty close to his last season in Portland while learning the new surroundings in Dallas . It has been a better than expected payoff for the Mavericks this early . ( Matthews ' lone signing regret might be that he didn ' t head to the Eastern Conference so he could see the Wizards more than twice a year . He made 16 3 pointers in two games against them . )
