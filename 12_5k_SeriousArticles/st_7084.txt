' It the same for everybody , ' said Mourinho . ' When it ' s for everybody , you have to accept it . You know it ' s difficult for the players but it is not difficult for my players , it is difficult for every player . My respect to every player of every club because it ' s hard to do it . It ' s the only country where they do it ( the Christmas fixtures ) and they do it with lots of pride .
