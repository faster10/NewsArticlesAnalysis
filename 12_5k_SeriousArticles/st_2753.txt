Locked into the faddish slam cut video game look and filtered ( perhaps in deference to a string of Central American locations ) in malarial shades of green and yellow , " The Losers " wants to seem cutting edge , though it clings to a quaint Saturday morning serial black and white morality . Max isn ' t just down on kids , he plans to get his paws on " next generation " weapons , kick start a war or two , destabilize the developing world and put the U . S . back on top . Laughable !
