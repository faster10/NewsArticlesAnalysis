Life ' s a beach If you ' re in Miami , the chances are you ' ll be wanting to kick back and soak up some of that glorious Florida sunshine . South Beach is the classic Miami sunning spot , but if you want to avoid the crowds , Sunny Isles Beach , at the northern end of Miami Beach , is a better bet . Nearby , Haulover Beach is another good bet and is " clothing optional " handy if you ' re trying for an all over tan .
