A recent review of his performance in PinkNews is far more charitable , claiming , It would be easy for the film to portray Elbe as a straight up pioneering hero , but Redmayne brings nuance : Elbe ? is selfish , but because she is single minded . She has no option but to put herself before others ? and brings a mixture of guilt , terror and earnest excitement to every line . If terror and earnest excitement can be adequately conveyed via fawn in headlights reflexes and fluttering hands , then I guess I see the point , but that would certainly seem to limit Lili s spectrum of demeanors .
