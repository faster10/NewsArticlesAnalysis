Batt : My real Broadway break was in " Starlight Express . " At that time , I was toying with coming out . It ' s harder to live a lie than to try to hide your natural instincts and your natural longings just to conform to what other people think you should be . I ' ve heard of people doing it in Hollywood . It ' s a very sad and difficult choice . I think it ' s a personal journey , and I think people on their own time will figure it out . Clay Aiken is still really very , very young he has to deal with his own issues .
