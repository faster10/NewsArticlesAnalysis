In June 2014 , a 16 year old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped . She doesn ' t remember what happened , only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up . But weeks later , the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed , apparently taken at the same party . The photos went viral on the Internet , with Twitter users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position , mocking the alleged victim . When the Houston Press asked someone who posted such a picture on Twitter why he did it , he simply said he was " bored at 1 a . m . and decided to wake up " his Twitter feed .
