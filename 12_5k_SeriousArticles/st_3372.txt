I think the casting is inspired , actually . Sometimes life isn t just stranger than fiction , it s fiction s muse ! And the author of the original story about Liz , Michael , and Marlon s escape isn t surprised at all to see it taking on new life . There s something just so irresistible about simply the image of this holy trinity in the car together . It s a kind of comic misrule flight out of Egypt story , and a tale told out of the celebrity Bible that should go on forever .
