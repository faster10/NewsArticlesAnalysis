For those of you who thinks this is LA s first team you are sadly misinformed . The Rams were ORIGINALLY in LA , the Cardinals were ORIGINALLY in St . Louis . So all this hateration towards the Rams is funny . St . Louis didn t appreciate the team so , let LA welcome back the team that left them before . I am so happy that St . Louis is WITHOUT a team . Perhaps now they will cherish the next team they are awarded only IF they are blessed with another .
