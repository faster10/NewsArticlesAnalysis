Bernie Sanders is not a natural debater . He ' s best out on the stump , delivering stem winding speeches that make the crowds roar . He is not practiced or polished in his answers , but he certainly is as authentic as ever . But no matter how much the media goads him , he will also likely not play the attack dog with Clinton . The media gloss over the distinction , but Bernie ' s right he has consistently attacked Clinton ' s positions on the issues without ever stooping to attacking her personally ( or " attacking her personality " perhaps ) . They have clear differences of opinion on a number of things , which both Bernie and Hillary do a pretty good job of defining , when facing each other .
