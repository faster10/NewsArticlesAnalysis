The producing duo released their own , too : " We use a lot of prosthetic body parts on the show : heads , arms , etc . We can ' t afford to have these all made from scratch , especially in scenes where we need a lot of them , so we rent them in bulk . After the scene was already shot , someone pointed out that one of the heads looked like George W . Bush . In the DVD commentary , we mentioned this , though we should not have . We meant no disrespect to the former President and apologize if anything we said or did suggested otherwise . "
