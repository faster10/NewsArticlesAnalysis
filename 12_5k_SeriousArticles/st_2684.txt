This is despite the fact that Pe a Nieto ' s public image took a lot of hits during the campaign . In December , the candidate struggled at a literary fair to name three books that had influenced him . When he was criticized for the flub by the country ' s intelligentsia , his daughter poured gasoline on the fire by insisting , on Twitter , that the story was driven by class envy . Later , in an interview with a Spanish newspaper , Pe a Nieto admitted that he didn ' t know the price of a package of tortillas . When criticized for being out of touch , he insisted chauvinistically that he wasn ' t " the woman of the household . " He also admitted in another interview that he was unfaithful to his late wife and fathered two children with two women during his marriage .
