From what I can tell , God hunger is alive and well in Vermont . But it tends to thrive outside the walls of traditional churches ( though it can be found there as well , as apparently 22 of Vermonters will say ) . I would refer the good pollsters at Gallup back to the story of Jesus , who when asked by pesky Pharisees where the Kingdom of God could be found , said : " Don ' t say , look , it ' s here or there ! For , behold , the kingdom of God is within you . " ( Luke 17 : 21 )
