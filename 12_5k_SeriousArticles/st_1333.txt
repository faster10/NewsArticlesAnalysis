LENNON : In a perfect , pre Madoff world , where the Mets once flexed the financial muscle of a truly big market team , we ' d say go for it . Cespedes , when healthy , was exactly what the middle of the Mets ' struggling lineup needed a righthanded power bat that made those around him better . Without Cespedes , maybe the Mets don ' t hold off the Nationals to win the NL East . But this is 2015 , with Sandy Alderson at the helm , and spending 150 million on anyone doesn ' t fit his team building vision . Plus , Cespedes is 30 , and going to six years , as Cespedes has said he wants , is a contract of diminishing returns at this point . Trading for him was genius . Passing on him now is a smart move as well .
