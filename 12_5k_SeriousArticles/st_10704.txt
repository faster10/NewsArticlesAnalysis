At Rise News , the claim is , Many in the crowd told the man to calm down and told him that all lives mattered . ? While it is technically true that all lives matter was stated , if you watch the video , it s clear that it s not exactly being used to soothe anyone , but is something that some white dude is screaming over and over and over at Southall , clearly to push the notion ? that Black Lives Matter is somehow opposed to white people .
