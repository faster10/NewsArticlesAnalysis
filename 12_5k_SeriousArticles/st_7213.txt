BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTERS COULD BE LESS LIKELY TO VOTE Nate Cohn : Mr Sanders appears to be extraordinarily dependent on turnout from infrequent voters , even more than Democrats have recently been in general elections , and maybe more than Barack Obama in the 2008 Iowa caucuses ? mainly because his support is so strong among the young . Compared with the supporters of Hillary Clinton , his are far less likely to report that they intend to vote they have less history of voting and they come from demographic categories who turn out in low numbers . This all adds considerable uncertainty to the pre election polls , which always struggle to determine who is or is not likely to vote . The challenge for Mr Sanders is most evident in Iowa , a caucus state where polls generally show a fairly tight race . NYT
