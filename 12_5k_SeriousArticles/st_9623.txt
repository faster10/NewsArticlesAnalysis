Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis ' election comedy " The Campaign " took second place with 27 . 4 million . The R rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as Ferrell ' s last live action wide release " The Other Guys " ( 35 . 5 million ) , and Galifianakis ' last non " Hangover " comedy " Due Date " ( 32 . 7 million ) . While " The Campaign ' s " grosses are a bit lower than those movies ( and recent R rated hit " 21 Jump Street , " which opened with 36 . 1 million ) , the debut frame is remarkably impressive considering the subject matter .
