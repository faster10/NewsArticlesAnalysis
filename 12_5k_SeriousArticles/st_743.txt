This is your least favorite question the man asks . When he asks you this question , you feel very tired . You realize you don ' t want to do anything except sit on his couch , drink beer , and watch TV on the big screen . You don ' t have a big screen in your apartment . There is also never any alcohol in your apartment because you drink it all up , immediately . You want to watch America ' s Got Talent , but you can ' t say this . You ' ll have to flip through the channels and casually stop on it and say , is that guy double jointed ? Let ' s just watch this for just a second , and then a group of nasty dancers will come on or a water skiing squirrel and it would be impossible to change the channel then . "
