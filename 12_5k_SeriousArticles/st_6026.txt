RB Rashad Jennings . Just 39 yards on 11 carries . No run longer than six yards . And he was the Giants ' leading rusher by far . The Giants continue to rotate Jennings , Andre Williams and Orleans Darkwa , but none of them can get any consistency going , and Jennings is the one who ' s supposed to be able to help put games away in the second half . They can ' t run the ball for first downs , can ' t run it at the goal line , and it ' s forcing Manning and the passing game to be perfect .
