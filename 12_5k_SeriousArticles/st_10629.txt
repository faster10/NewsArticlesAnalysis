The Cruz campaign suffered another blow Tuesday when Iowa Governor Terry Branstad , a Republican , said he wants to see Cruz defeated . " It would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him , " Branstad said at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit . " And I know he ' s ahead in the polls but the only poll that counts is the one they take on caucus night and I think that could change between now and then . " Labeling Cruz a " big oil " candidate , he predicted , " As Iowans learn about his anti renewable fuel stand , and that it will cost us jobs , and will further reduce farm income , I think people will realize that it ' s not in our interest .
