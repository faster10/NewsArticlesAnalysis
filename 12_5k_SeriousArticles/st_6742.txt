Delavan : There should be some commonality , like a consistent color palette or size . If there isn ' t , frame all the art the same so that the look is unified . On the wall in my home office , I have reproductions of Robert Indiana ' s Love and Roy Lichtenstein ' s Ball of Twine 1963 . It ' s charming to add a postcard , a calendar , or even kid art . Some of my favorite works are by four year old friends .
