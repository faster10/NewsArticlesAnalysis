Dallas Cowboys : The Cowboys will be back on the practice field today with the Panthers visiting AT T Stadium on Thursday . While the Cowboys were pleased with Sunday ' s win against Miami , they know there is plenty of work to be done to climb out of their hole in the NFC East . If they can end the Panthers ' undefeated season , they could be right in the mix in the NFC East by the end of Week 12 . To be a factor , the Cowboys will need Tony Romo to be as timely as he was against the Dolphins and the running game ( 166 yards , 38 carries ) to be as dominant as it was . Todd Archer
