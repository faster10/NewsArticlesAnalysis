Punch ups are rare in modern football , but between teammates they are non existent . These two hot heads got into a debate over Dyer ' s refusal to pass Bowyer the ball . Both players had made news for their off field activities in the past but they took their behavior to a new low when they exchanged blows in the middle of the Newcastle half soon after Villa had gone 3 0 up . The pair later appeared alongside manager Graeme Souness to apologize for their conduct , but pointedly did not say sorry to each other .
