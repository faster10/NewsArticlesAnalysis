" REEVES : The tomb of Tutankhamun ' s was a staircase going down , then turning to the right , which identifies it , I think , as the tomb of a queen because the king ' s tomb normally turns to the left , and the queen ' s tomb turns to the right . That ' s the first indication that we ' re dealing here with the burial of a queen . The second indication is that this corridor has been enlarged . And we know why that enlargement took place in the case of Tutankhamun because they needed to introduce through it the huge panels of the gilded shrines which surrounded his sarcophagus and coffin . So that ' s the second thing . It ' s a queen who had obvious pharaonic prerogatives , in that she seems to have been buried within a nest of gilded shrines , similar to those of Tutankhamun . "
