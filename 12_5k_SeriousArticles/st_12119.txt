Will Bill Cosby ' s artistic legacy and reputation survive ? We won ' t know until the dust has settled . But " The Cosby Show " seems undoubtedly tarnished . It ' s hard to watch it now , knowing what we ' ve heard about Cosby , and not feel slimy and somehow complicit in his alleged crimes . But at the same time , turning off the show seems too easy it ' s not unlike the way we turn away from our discomfort with rape and rape victims . Maybe it ' s better if we squirm with the ugly picture for a while .
