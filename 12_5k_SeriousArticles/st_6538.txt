If the President will explain and defend his plan for countering ISIL , he likely has a congressional and public majority ready to back it . Its outlines are clear : no American boots on the ground strikes on ISIL wherever it is ( Iraq , Syria , and beyond if necessary ) sustained support for the Kurds , Syrian opposition fighters , and Iraqi troops on the front lines and a coalition of Western and Arab nations dedicated to shepherding ISIL into its grave . This seems to be the fight that President Obama already has in mind .
