The measure would suspend resettlement of Syrian and Iraqi refugees until new security checks are emplaced , and would require the heads of Homeland Security , the FBI and national intelligence to vouch for each person admitted . Under the current resettlement process , potential refugees come almost exclusively through referrals from the office of the U . N . High Commissioner for Refugees , which vets their backgrounds before deciding which country to refer them to for resettlement . Those recommended to this country are then scrubbed by U . S . security officers through interviews overseas and biometric background checks , a process that can take up to two years . The Washington Post , citing a State Department spokesman , reported that " only about a dozen " of the nearly 785 , 000 refugees admitted to the U . S . since the September 2011 attacks have been arrested or deported for preexisting links to terrorism . None was from Syria . Three refugees have been convicted of abetting terror attacks elsewhere .
