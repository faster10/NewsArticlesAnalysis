I will never forget the look on the face of a prominent Syrian official who was particularly angry at the Assad regime ' s response to the event in the Syrian city Daraa in the very early days of the revolution . He asked me why Bashar ( al Assad ) failed to make his cousin , who was the mayor of Daraa , then commit suicide ? He then made a gun gesture and pointed it at his head . He indirectly admitted that the regime did this before .
