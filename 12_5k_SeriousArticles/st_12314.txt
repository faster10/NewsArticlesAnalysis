This year ' s influx of migrants to Europe has proven to be perhaps Angela Merkel ' s toughest test yet . Germany has been the top destination for people fleeing Syria , Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere in hopes of safety and a better life . The flow picked up after Merkel decided in early September to let in people stuck in Hungary . Germany has struggled to house and process the newcomers some 965 , 000 were registered as asylum seekers between January and November . Still , Merkel has stuck to her optimistic insistence that ' ' we will manage it ' ' and refused to name a limit to the number of people Germany can take in , despite mounting criticism from conservative allies . She has pushed to little avail so far for more help from other European countries in sharing the burden , and insists that the crisis can only be solved through patient diplomacy . ( AP photo )
