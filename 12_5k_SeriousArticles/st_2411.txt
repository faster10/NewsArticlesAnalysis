While the big numbers like " Greased Lightning " , the dance off , and the grand closers , " You ' re the One That I Want " and " We Go Together " all had the requisite excitement and fun , I am very confused as to why we had to see the cast get on studio trams ( talk about fourth wall breaking ) to get to the big carnival at the end . Couldn ' t the last fifteen minutes have been done completely on that carnival set ?
