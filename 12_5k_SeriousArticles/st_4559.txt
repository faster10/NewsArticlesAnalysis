An errant Serena was hitting too many errors and Kerber held serve comfortably to apply more pressure . Down 0 30 on her serve in the next game , Serena began screaming " C ' mon ' to pump herself up . A delicate drop shot and a lightning serve allowed her to hold for 2 3 . It seemed to temporarily flip a switch in the American who broke back , smashing a powerful forehand down the line to haul herself level . But the errors kept coming from Serena , who swiped a wild backhand and then missed an easy volley to hand Kerber another break as the German dictated the baseline points .
