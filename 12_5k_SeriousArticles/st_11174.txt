MR : I ' m a pragmatist . The first record I produced was for this artist Nikka Costa . It was on MTV , there was this hype about it and everyone thought it was going to be this big thing and it came out and it really didn ' t do anything . And I thought that was a really good lesson in a way because it lets you know that no matter how many people come out telling you it ' s going to be great , it could easily come out and do nothing .
