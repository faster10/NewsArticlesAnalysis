' It ' s true that here they don ' t like you to punch , ' Adrian says , ' but sometimes when the area is crowded and you try to catch you can get a nudge from someone , the ball gets away , and if they don ' t blow for a foul it ' s a goal . Sometimes a good punch will clear the ball very effectively so you have to mix it up . With passing the ball out from the back you can ' t be taking unnecessary risks , but if you are decisive then there shouldn ' t be a problem . '
