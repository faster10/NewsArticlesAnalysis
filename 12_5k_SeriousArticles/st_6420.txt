" I don ' t think that ' s an excuse , " said Tom Brady in an interview with the USA Today . " I think we can play better , and I think some of the things that we didn ' t do well have nothing to do with missing some other guys . We ' ve just got to do things better if we want to score more points , and I always talk about just execution , us all being on the same page . And I think there were a lot of plays out there where we didn ' t necessarily do our job very well , and if you don ' t do it well then no one else can really make up for what you ' re trying to do .
