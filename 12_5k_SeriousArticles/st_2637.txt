In 2006 , Wikipedia discovered that the entries to several prominent U . S . politicians ? including Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman , California Senator Dianne Feinstein and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin ? had been altered , apparently from computers within the Capitol . Coleman s staff admitted that it had removed the statement that the Senator had voted with President Bush 98 of the time in 2003 , while Harkin s aids said that they d erased a story about the time he falsely claimed to have flown combat missions in North Vietnam . Joe Biden s representatives also edited his page to remove references to accusations of alleged plagiarism .
