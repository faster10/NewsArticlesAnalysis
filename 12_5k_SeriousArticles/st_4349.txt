Of course , for us , the doubles is the key match . Andy carries the weight of responsibility , doesn t he ? He s the guy who has to win both his matches and then we have to try and win a third rubber and our best chance is probably in the doubles . But we played the United States and if James Ward hadn t won that first day against John Isner it would ve been very different . Me and Dom Inglot l ost that very close match to the Bryan brothers and so James win was crucial . But , against France and Australia , Andy and I knew if we didn t win the doubles that was us done .
