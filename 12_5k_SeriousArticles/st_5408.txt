Look , you ve been through this already . There was a period when you all ignored Trump and expected his ludicrous candidacy to collapse under its own fraudulence . That didn t happen , and so you started hitting him . His recent slide indicates that it s finally working . But now it is Ben Carson , an equally ludicrous candidate , to whom you are all losing . You are losing to Ben Carson . You are losing to Ben Carson . Good grief : stop losing to Ben Carson .
