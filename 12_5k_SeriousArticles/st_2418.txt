Once in earshot of the " budtenders , " the conversation was fairly surreal . I asked for a strain perfect for after work , something to make me relax and help me sleep a Marijuana Merlot . I was told two Indica strains are solid sellers for this purpose : Tahoe Triangle and Ogre . Tahoe Triangle had a light pine smell Ogre was more musty and pungent like you might imagine a hairy monster would be . I went with the Ogre with thoughts of Shrek in my mind .
