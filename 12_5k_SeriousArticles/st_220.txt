On Sunday morning , we make it to the Love Lane Kitchen by 10 a . m . , when tables are still plentiful . Wise move , since by 11 there ' s a wait outside . The home style food ( a big jug of real maple syrup for the thick French toast ) , friendly staff and low key vibe ( a large self serve coffee setup . . . why doesn ' t every breakfast spot do this ? ) make me fervently wish the caf was located around the corner from my house .
