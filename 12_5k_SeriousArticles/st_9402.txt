Atletico Mineiro defender Coelho did not take kindly to the seal dribble of talented teenager Kerlon who collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area , flicked it up and performed his trademark dribble by bouncing the ball on his head as he ran towards goal . Coelho crashed into him and was given a straight red card and a four month suspension . Other Atletico players remonstrated angrily with Kerlon , leading to an angry pushing match which interrupted the game for five minutes . Atletico coach Emerson Leao warned that Kerlon could get seriously injured if he tried the trick again .
