Tony Visconti , Bowie ' s longtime producer : " David always did it his way and his way was the least obvious way " . I was not quite 17 , America was very new to me , and I was distinctly uneasy and distrustful toward everything happening in my life that was putting me in these flat voiced , narrow eyed , champagneish rooms . His death was no different from his life a work of Art . He made Blackstar for us , his parting gift . " I knew for a year this was the way it would be " .
