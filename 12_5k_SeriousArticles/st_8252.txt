I don t have a problem with the glossy sheen , light hearted violence or absurd bravado of Bond . Action films are meant to be fun . But the voice of Ian Fleming prescribing the laying on of hands to any woman who s not keen on having sex with men does ring in my ears . Pussy Galore s very name suggests that she isn t exactly supposed to be taken seriously ? but liking girls because you haven t met the right man ? That s the final nail in the shiny chrome coffin for me .
