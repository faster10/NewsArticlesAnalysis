I am often asked do I wonder why " I ' ve " been diagnosed with breast cancer and the answer is so obvious to me . Of course I know why . If it weren ' t for my diagnosis of breast cancer , I would be feeling sorry for others and fearful of what may happen to me . How selfish and non productive . Now I waste no time feeling sorry for myself or others and I make sure every moment is spent making a positive impact on all those I encounter . It ' s not about how much time you have , it ' s about what you ' re doing with that time . I choose to spend it making people with breast cancer , happy .
