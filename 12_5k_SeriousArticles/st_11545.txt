To tell the DB9 GT apart from its predecessors , look for Vanquish like headlamps , a revised side vent design , and the DB9 GT badge in back . That s about it . Our tester came with carbon fiber trim bits and a set of 20 inch diamond turned wheels , but otherwise , it looks pretty much like every DB9 that has come before it . And yes , it s still available as a convertible for the extroverts among you ( or just anyone who wants to hear the exhaust note with supreme clarity more on that in a moment ) .
