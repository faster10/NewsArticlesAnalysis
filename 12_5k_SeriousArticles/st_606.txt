No surprise that Miley Cyrus tops our list . If the former Disney star ' s goal was to be one of the most talked about women of 2013 , she arguably succeeded . Her twerking at the MTV Video Music Awards ( full disclosure I didn ' t know what twerking was until the VMAs ! ) followed by her nearly nude performance in a video for her single " Wrecking Ball " got tongues wagging all over the country . Will Miley continue to shock in 2014 ? We ' ll be watching !
