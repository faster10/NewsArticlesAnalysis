Elise Marrion of Midland , Texas My grandmother always loved " Peanuts , " and across the generations , that was one of the things we shared . When I was 7 years old , I spent a summer with her in Denver and every morning , I raced to find " Peanuts " in the comics section . A retired teacher , Grandma always made me read at least one front page news story before I was allowed to read the comics . That task turned into a great love of newspapers , and it inspired me to pursue a career in journalism . Sadly she passed away before I received my degree , but I still keep her Peppermint Patty doll to remind me of her and our times reading " Peanuts " together .
