Alex Smith completed 21 of 32 passes for 251 yards . His 6 yard touchdown throw to Chris Conley helped clinch the game . He did not turn the ball over , but was sacked twice and hit seven times . You never want to see your quarterback get hit that much , but the revamped offensive line s performance was still better than in weeks past . The Chiefs ongoing red zone struggles fall primarily on the passing game , but Smith and his young receivers ? who stepped up for him without Jeremy Maclin ? still did enough to win the game , especially in the second half .
