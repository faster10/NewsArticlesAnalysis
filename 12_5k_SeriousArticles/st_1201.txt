I grew up in Washington in an area fondly known as " Hanukkah Heights . " We lived in " Hanukkah Heights " because there were no restrictive covenants as there were in other areas that discriminated against buyers based on their color or religion . My first employer and forever friend was one of the first Jews able to buy a home in what had been a restricted neighborhood . The Fair Housing Act was not just a bill for justice to me . It was all so very personal .
