The two US PGA stars will go head to head in the final pairing but Jones vowed not to get bogged down in any Sunday shootout with the reigning Masters and US Open champion . It s not match play at all . It s me sticking to a game plan , managing the course and just giving myself opportunities , Jones said . If I go out and shoot two or three under tomorrow , I m going to be very tough to beat . So it s in my hands .
