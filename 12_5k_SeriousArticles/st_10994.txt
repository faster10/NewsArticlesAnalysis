After the attacks on Charlie Hebdo ? with which we rang in this bloody year in Paris , many deluded Westerners insisted that the assassination of these humble cartoonists was an expression , however misplaced , of righteous anger bubbling up from below . It was a sort of punching up while in their love of mockery the magazine s artists had gone where satire must not go when they began to punch down . Is anyone going to continue to push that disgusting line after Friday night s attacks ? Is there any conceivable sense in which massacring the Eagles of Death Metal s fans can be understood as a rising up of the oppressed ? ?
