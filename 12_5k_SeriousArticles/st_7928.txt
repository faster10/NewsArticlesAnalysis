When there is a long night and there is an emergency , the mothers just hang in there and the babies , too . They are so strong , and they push through literally . That ' s love . They have taught me that this world is really worth preserving . The babies come in so fresh and innocent , trusting and open to love . And if we can just give them a safe and gentle entrance into this world , then they will keep that ability to love and trust .
