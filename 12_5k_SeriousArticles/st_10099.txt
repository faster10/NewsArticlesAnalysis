The " cold weather " Super Bowl didn ' t live up to the hype it was 56 degrees in East Rutherford , N . J . and neither did the battle of No . 1 offense vs . No . 1 defense . The Seahawks ' top ranked defense completely outplayed the Broncos ' top ranked offense , and Seattle captured its first Super Bowl title . The Seahawks were in control the entire game , at one point opening a 36 0 lead . Peyton Manning , fresh off a record setting regular season , threw two interceptions with one returned 69 yards for a touchdown by Malcolm Smith and lost a fumble as the Broncos turned the ball over four times .
