If Mic s Kevin O Keefe argued that the Golden Globes is the only modern awards show , clearly no one told Ricky Gervais . The Hollywood Foreign Press clearly intended having Gervais back as hitting the reset button , but it merely undid everything we ve grown to love about the show . Gervais persona is much better served on shows like The Office , where he s allowed to serve as an antagonist . However , as a master of ceremonies , the Triumph the Insult Comic Douche shtick felt sad and desperate , like the shock jock who is constantly reminding you how naughty and inappropriate he is . He says it because it s true !
