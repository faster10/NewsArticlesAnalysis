Behind it all , I see the marks of a shift to nationalism and away from economic liberalism . " Strong " is preferred to " smart . " For a country with comparative advantage in " smart , " this looks to be a bad decision . But nationalist policies can persist for a long time . They have in Hungary and Russia , and they have done so with public approval . We ' ll see how events play out in China , but for now , investors need to consider that the China of the last thirty years may no longer correspond to the China of today ? or tomorrow . China ' s era of growth may be over .
