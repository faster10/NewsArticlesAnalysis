The European Commission last week warned Greece that unless it institutes a reliable system to check the identities of all new arrivals ( i . e . refugees ) and sets up shelter for at least 50 , 000 people by May , it could be suspended from the EU s passport free travel area , the Schengen zone . This is significant : If Greeks lost the ability to travel passport free throughout the EU , it would deepen the country s isolation from the rest of Europe and deal a further blow to the country s already devastated economy .
