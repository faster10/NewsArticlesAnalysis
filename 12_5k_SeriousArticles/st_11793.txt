Kerr : It is ridiculous . I do think the game would have gone small , because the Bulls ' bigs at the time were not offensive enough to stay on the floor . I ' m going to have to say , ' the Bulls " and " the Warriors . " I can ' t say " we " and " they " because nobody will know what they hell I ' m talking about . So , the Bulls ' bigs would have had to exit . So , you would have had an epic Dennis Rodman versus Draymond Green matchup .
