Yes , it is the biggest , most prestigious prize in the game and winning the World Cup is incredible . It is the ultimate but I cannot overstate just how much I used to love beating the big teams at Twickenham or in their own backyard none more so than Australia . History shows the best way to prepare for a World Cup is to prove you are the best team in the world . That is only achieved with the attitude of every game being a must win match . I fear this attitude has been lost .
