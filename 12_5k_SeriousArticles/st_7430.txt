Theodore , an intensely private athlete , said , " I can remember sometimes , it could be a 2 2 game , and you start thinking about your son , or you start thinking about different stuff . " After his son died , Theodore was named No . 1 goalie again , and he started a " Saves for Kids " campaign . He will donate 2 for each save , 100 for each win and 500 for each shutout during the regular season and more during playoffs to a children ' s medical center .
