It s kind of like gun rights , he said . Everybody thinks there s no way they can take their guns away . Then all of a sudden they start seeing some infringement on their gun rights . Now they re thinking , Oh wow , if they can put her in jail because she doesn t believe in this morally , then why can t they take our guns away ? ? So it engages a whole new constituency because they realize , wow , we do have to protect ourselves .
