I will point out any candidate making that pitch to you is essentially arguing Rudy Giuliani s strategy was brilliant and would lead to a win . Rudy argued he was going to wait until the fifth state in 2008 . Florida was fifth . Momentum is critical in politics . For the campaigns that are hoping , If only we can get to more liberal states , later in the calendar , they can rescue us from the conservative primary voters , I believe that is a strategy with very poor chances of success .
