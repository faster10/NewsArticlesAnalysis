The reason , he says , is that trust in the media ? in both parties but especially among conservatives who comprise Trump ' s base ? is at an all time low .

The media lies , we all know that , so why wouldn ' t they lie about this , too ? All the mainstream media cares about is serving as the political correctness police , so if this did happen then of course they would work to cover it up , right ?
