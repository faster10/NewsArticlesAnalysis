Iraq ' s leaders took an important step this week in forming a more inclusive government , but this government still lacks leaders for two key security ministries : defense and interior . And even if the government formation process is completed soon , it may be unclear for years whether the government in Baghdad will rule inclusively and accommodate the interests of the country ' s Sunni minority and the Kurds , who have increased their autonomy in recent months . U . S . policy is wisely conditioned on trying to use the leverage of U . S . assistance to Iraq as an incentive to bring Iraq ' s diverse political factions together , but there is always the possibility that this might come apart . Incidents like the massacre of Sunnis last month by Shia militias could happen at any moment , and the question for U . S . policymakers is what the fallback plan should be if Iraq ' s leaders do not bring together a cohesive government .
