Mulder and Scully meet the were monster in this week s instalment of Fox s six episode resuscitation of the X Files , titled , helpfully , Mulder and Scully Meet the Were Monster . And after a frankly terrible first instalment and a second outing that wavered between pretty fun and pretty bad , the third episode is not just a welcome improvement but among the best single hours in the entire series , thanks in large part to some very clever writing and directing from Darin Morgan ( who wrote my favorite single X Files episode , Clyde Bruckman s Final Repose ) and a hilarious turn from Rhys Darby as Guy Mann .
