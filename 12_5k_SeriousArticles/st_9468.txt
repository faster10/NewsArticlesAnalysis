Giles Martin : I was a kid attending Simon and Garfunkel at Wembley Stadium . I was standing in the urinals , kind of embarrassed , and he said , " Do you need any help ? " He ' d seen me with my parents , but I didn ' t recognize him . . . . Upon leaving , the stranger started chatting with Giles ' parents . They said , " George , have you met my son Giles ? " and he said , " Yes , we just had a piss next to each other . "
