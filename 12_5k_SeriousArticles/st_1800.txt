When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ' ' restore balance , ' ' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new . As big as a Sheraton and with a shriek that rumbles your insides , he appears beefier and meaner than you remember . But looks can be deceiving . Godzilla is humanity ' s only hope for destroying the MUTOs . Or as Watanabe ' s Dr Serizawa says , ' ' Let them fight ! ' ' And fight they do , in an epic clash that turns the Bay Area to rubble . Unlike last year ' s disappointing Pacific Rim , Godzilla actually shows us its monsters without a scrim of rain and a cloak of darkness . And the thrill of the film is getting the chance to fetishize their sheer size and physicality as they rip through power lines and demolish buildings with their lashing tails . In its handful of moments like these , " Godzilla " almost makes you feel like a kid again . Grade : B
