Dr Westley Clark , director of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ' s Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality , would agree with Abrams ' approach . " Statistics show children who start drinking at a younger age have more problems later on . We also know that , particularly for males under 21 , they are still developing what we call executive function meaning , how they make decisions and how they deal with risk . At 21 , the brain is simply more mature and the ability to control impulses is much stronger . The legal age is 21 . The message to parents is to buy time and delay the onset of any consumption . "
