Training before I came away was mostly focused on strength and conditioning so that my body was as prepared as possible for the trials of the journey . It worked to an extent but I am still undergoing recovery physio to fix some of the issues I racked up over the first phase of the journey . I also undertook some bike journeys and made my first big crossing by kayak . I am now focused on training for the ocean ahead and getting all the systems in place to make it as successful as possible .
