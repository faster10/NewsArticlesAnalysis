For some years I ' ve taught courses at Middlebury College on poetry and spirituality , and students often say to me : " I ' m spiritual but not religious . " They are , nevertheless , on a quest . They like to ask big questions about God , about human fulfillment , about spiritual practice in the widest possible terms . With them I explore major spiritual texts , including the Book of Psalms , ancient Taoist poems from China , Islamic poetry , and the work of such great Christian poets as John Donne , George Herbert , Gerard Manley Hopkins , and T . S . Eliot . My sense is that there is no end of genuine interest in spiritual matters among students in my neck of Vermont .
