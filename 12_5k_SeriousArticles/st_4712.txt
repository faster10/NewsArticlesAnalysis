In my opinion there should be more awesome gay people in fiction because there are plenty of awesome gay people in real life . I want Jesus to be a character where his sexuality is as unimportant as Rick or other heterosexual characters . So we won t focus on it constantly and it won t be the focus of any big storylines for him but he ll make it with a dude every now and then before going out and drop kicking zombies . He s one of my current favorite characters .
