Moral of these stories ? Don ' t be scary . Online dating is nerve racking enough when you ' re all squirmy scared of rejection and awkward first date conversations . Having to worry about weirdos jangling up to you at the supermarket ? Not necessary . ( Oh , and if you ' re the creep ee : Block ' em on the site , or if they ' re approaching you in person , make an excuse and hightail it out of there . Safety first ! )
