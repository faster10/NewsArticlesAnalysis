Jakarta police chief Tito Karnavian said one man entered the Starbucks cafe and blew himself up , wounding several inside . As people poured out of the cafe , two waiting gunmen opened fire on them . At the same time , two militants attacked a police traffic post nearby , using what he described as hand grenade like bombs . After the militants had been overcome , a body still lay on the street , a shoe nearby among the debris . The city centre s notoriously jammed roads were largely deserted .
