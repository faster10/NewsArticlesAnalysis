As veterans , we need each other now just as much as we did when we were fighting the war ( as so many of our brothers and sisters are still doing at this very moment ) . Just as we did in battle , we always take care of our own . So if you are struggling , please remember that the sun is still there , but it has just gone behind the clouds for a while . To make it shine again , we must take care of each other , hold on to each other and help each other through the pain .
