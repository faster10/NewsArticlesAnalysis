Just like last time , Clinton , locked in a neck and neck race in Iowa , is trying to grab the mantle of change late in the game . Last night , she had a moment that might help . A first time caucus goer who said he s leaning toward Sanders told Clinton that many of his friends find her to be dishonest and inauthentic . I ve been on the front lines of change and progress since I was your age , she replied . I ve taken on the status quo time and time again . The crowd loved it .
