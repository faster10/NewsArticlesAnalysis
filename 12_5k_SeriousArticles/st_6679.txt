In this bit , Colbert has Antonio Banderas , a man with a deeply sexy voice , read deeply boring sentences about khakis , fish specials , and the least sexy topic of all : Jeb Bush . It s pretty funny ( and it s not technically recurring , at least not yet ) , but it also feels like an affectionate callback to another familiar segment : Letterman s ? Top 10 List ? of words that sound romantic when spoken by Barry White , featuring Barry White himself . ( No . 10 : ? Jazzercise . )
