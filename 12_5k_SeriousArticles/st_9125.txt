' I ' ll have to do the same to some of my players , and tell them they ' re not in the team , and I ' m not looking forward to it . It doesn ' t matter whether you put them in an office , a room somewhere or out on the pitch , it ' s something they won ' t want to hear . If they ' ve got any professional pride about them , which these boys have , they are going to be desperately disappointed .
