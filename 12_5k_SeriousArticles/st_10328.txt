We finally got stops and stopped turning the ball over , which starts with me Curry said of the comeback , and the fourth quarter in particular . We know the recipe against the Clippers is that you can t give them easy points . Whether they shoot well or not , that s what fuels their offense ? easy buckets in transition off of turnovers . In the first quarter we let it happen , and there was one little stretch in the fourth where their lead went from three to 10 just from our turnovers .
