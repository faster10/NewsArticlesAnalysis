It was like that all week here at the Senior Bowl workouts . There are 700 NFL personnel studying 106 college players up close in advance of the April 25 27 draft . It is not only North vs . South in the game , but it is big school vs . small school , big name vs . no name . They will play the game at 4 p . m . ET on Saturday , but the skirmishes Monday through Friday at the practices are the real prize here for scouts and NFL draft wonks .
