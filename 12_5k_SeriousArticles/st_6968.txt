When the season started I was supposed to be the set up man , but then you know what happened ( with Mejia ) . God gave me this opportunity , and I tried to enjoy it . I did the best I could every day . I came every day hungry to learn , and I think that s why I had so much success this year . We came to the World Series , and it s amazing . I know we lost the World Series , but I know we came every day to enjoy it and it was great to have the opportunity to be here . It didn t work out , but that is baseball . . . I hope the next time we get back here , it will be different .
