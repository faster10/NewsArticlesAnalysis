Cruz is the guy who has the message that the Trump and Carson followers want to hear , but he can deliver it in a polished , professional manner . The establishment hates him as much as he hates them , but whatever you think of his policies and his tactics , he s a serious politician and they may have no choice but to accept him . If he does win the nomination , He s more likely to be Barry Goldwater rather than Ronald Reagan , but you just never know . Either way he s formidable .
