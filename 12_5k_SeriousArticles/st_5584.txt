Last week the European Commission mulled quarantining Greece by building a razor wire fence inside the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , which is not even a member of the EU . German sources floated the idea of cancelling Greece s debt if only Greece would agree to jail 400 , 000 migrants .

Others in Europe are proposing to criminalise the NGOs that are helping the refugees as they arrive in the islands .
