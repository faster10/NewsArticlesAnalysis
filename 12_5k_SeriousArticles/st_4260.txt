The U . S . government response was based on laws and rules that were created after the Exxon Valdez oil spill . After Valdez , the law changed to make the offending company responsible for the cleanup . A fund was created that all oil companies contributed to . If there was an emergency oil spill , a company could draw up to 75 million from this fund to fix the problem . But the fund was meant to help small wildcat operations , not huge conglomerates like BP .
