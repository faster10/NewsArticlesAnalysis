If we think dog shouldn ' t be eaten like , ever , regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat , and if and why we don ' t feel the same way about them . Is it because we spend so much time with dogs looking into their eyes , talking to them , walking them , picking up their crap that we understand that they are living , breathing , feeling beings ? Would we feel that way about other animals if we could hang out more ?
