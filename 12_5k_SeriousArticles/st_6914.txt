It seems more men who insist they have been falsely accused of rape are trying a new tactic : suing their accusers in civil court , mostly for defamation . They are seeking to repair their ruined lives , save their careers and clear their names . Make no mistake , I could never defend men who rape and believe even harsher penalties are needed for rapists . But I can understand why some men are opting to fight back . And I even agree with this strategy in some cases .
