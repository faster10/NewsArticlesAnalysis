The Oscars made big news last week , but not the way they intended . When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revealed its picks for the year s best performances on Jan . 14 , no actors of color were nominated for the second consecutive year . What s more , acclaimed films with diverse casts ? ? including Straight Outta Compton , Creed , and Beasts of No Nation ? ? were shut out of the best picture category , and the nominations those films did receive went either to white screenwriters ( for Compton ) or to a white star ( Sylvester Stallone for Creed ) .
