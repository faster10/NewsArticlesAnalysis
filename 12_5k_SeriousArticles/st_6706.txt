4 . Ed Sheeran : ? OK , so maybe Coldplay ' s " Yellow " isn ' t exactly the right kind of song to rile up a crowd but maybe that ' s just because the guys haven ' t remixed it yet ? ! Sheeran ' s famous cover of their classic single caused quite an uproar earlier this year , so we ' re wondering if maybe ( just maybe ) there ' s a way these two can come together to give a more ramped up version of the song . Only time will tell !
