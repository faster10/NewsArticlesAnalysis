If Murray entered the match with the aura of the archetypal lamb , then Djokovic is on the verge of being acclaimed as tennis s GOAT ( greatest of all time ) . He isn t as sexy or as charismatic as Rafael Nadal ( who would have dark , erotic dreams about Lembit Opik s Slavic cousin ? ) , or anything like as graceful and bedazzling as Roger Federer . All he has going for him is that he seems to be better at tennis than them , or anyone else who ever lived .
