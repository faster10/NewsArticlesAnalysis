Before leaving Palestine , I remember taking a walk with my mother in the hills of Ramallah . On the bottom of the hills was the West Bank barrier . Once we reached the top of the tallest hill , my mother grabbed my arm and pointed in the far distance . " You see that city over there ? That ' s Jerusalem . That ' s where I was born , where your father was born and where you are from . One day , we ' ll walk from here to Jerusalem . . . . And no wall or soldier will stand in our way . "
