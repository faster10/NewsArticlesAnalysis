Detroit Public Schools is a district that has been going through some very difficult financial challenges over the last number of years and we ve worked very hard over the last year to get our internal house in order , said Michelle Zdrodowski , a spokesperson for the district . We re getting resources into the classroom and school buildings . But while we do understand their frustrations , we don t agree with their method of voicing those frustrations . Students need to be school every day and to take a day of instruction away is not necessarily appropriate in our estimation .
