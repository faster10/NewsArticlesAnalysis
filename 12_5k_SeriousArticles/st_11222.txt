There s something of Lana Del Rey s blissed out beach music to it , but without such a disaffected edge . Rih Rih is more purposeful than that . There s emotional depth her as well as weird and witty asides , like Let me cover your shit in glitter I can make it gold . Yeah I Said It is a late night sexy slow jam , with the arresting line I want you to homicide it surely a double meaning , which I m still mulling over . James Joint continues the random musings on drugs and drinking , with jazz piano and befuddled , sexy vocals . It s not the hottest track on the album but it provides a good bridge between the Dance Hall bluster and the slow , slow grooves yet to come .
