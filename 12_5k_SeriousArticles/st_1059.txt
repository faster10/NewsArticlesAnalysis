Of course , Wolverine is an immortal of sorts who isn ' t supposed to age Jackman , despite all evidence to the contrary , doesn ' t have that ability . At some point , Fox could ask , " Are we running the risk of our Wolverine being the equivalent of Sean Connery ' s James Bond in Never Say Never Again ? " But times have changed look no further than Downey , who will be 50 when Avengers 2 comes out in 2015 . I can ' t imagine Jackman would get soft around the middle besides a more grizzled Jackman better suits the haunted comic book character .
