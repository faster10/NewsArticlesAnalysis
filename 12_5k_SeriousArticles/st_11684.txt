Father Augustus Tolton , the first recognized African American priest , lived a similar struggle . His mother escaped slavery with him and his siblings , settling in Quincy , Illinois . He was baptized as a child , and by the time he was 16 , he felt " called " to the Roman Catholic priesthood . No American Catholic seminaries accepted a black man , so in 1880 , he traveled to Rome , Italy . He was ordained six years later , then returned to America to begin his pastoral ministry .
