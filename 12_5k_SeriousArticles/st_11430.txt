You don ' t really find hotels right on the sand in Santa Barbara , but this bougainvillea covered boutique property is about as close as it gets : the beach is right across the street . Spread over six small buildings , the Spanish style hotel has a shabby chic vibe with rooms decorated in garden like pinks , oranges , and greens and easy open windows that let in the steady breeze . There are also lush courtyards , two outdoor pools , and complimentary beach cruiser bicycles , and it ' s an easy walk or ride to the heart of downtown and the train station . Even though the lobby has a free breakfast , dinner fans may be tempted by the original ( and last remaining ) Sambo ' s an old coffee shop chain from the 1960s right next door . Season does matter here : at the height of summer , rates start at 289 . Doubles from 139 hoteloceanasantabarbara . com .
