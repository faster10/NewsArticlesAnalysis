Let me start off with a disclaimer : I am a bit of a bird nerd . Not a serious birder by any stretch ( I have never gone on vacation specifically for the birds , for example . . . well , not a long one , anyway ) , but my iPhoto has been known to contain more than a few shots of birds , and my iPhone does have iBird Explorer Plus . Oh , and as a child , my dad and I would spend the occasional summer afternoon in the country listening to records of bird calls .
