For " 21 Jump Street " to earn 35 million over a weekend in mid March is a far more impressive achievement . Indeed , only one R rated comedy has ever debuted to higher numbers outside the summer season : " Jackass 3 D , " which started with 50 . 4 million in October 2010 . " 21 Jump Street " also opened higher than fellow TV adaptations " Starsky and Hutch " ( 28 . 1 million ) , " The Dukes of Hazzard " ( 30 . 7 million ) , and " Miami Vice " ( 25 . 7 million ) .
