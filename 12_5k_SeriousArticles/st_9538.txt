He ? ? ? s 32 years old but seems much younger , with a tendency to fiddle with his hair and squirm in his seat like an adolescent . The son of Albanian immigrants , Shkreli grew up in what he describes as a tough part of Brooklyn ? ? ? s Sheepshead Bay neighborhood . He skipped grades in school because he was so bright . Shkreli idolized scientists , but he was also a music fan . Primarily interested in rock as a teenager , he didn ? ? ? t understand rap , but that changed when ? ? he read Shakespeare in high school . ? ? ? You would get these rhyming couplets and soliloquies and stuff like that , but the couplets would really kind of jar you , ? ? ? he says . ? ? ? They would be really these big , soul crushing moments that Shakespeare intended to stir your spirit . And in many ways , music does that . ? ? ?
