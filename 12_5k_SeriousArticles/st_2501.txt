When a child is out of control , he or she needs you , the parent , to make them feel safe . So we were taught to sit behind Danny and hold him close with legs and arms wrapped around him , to become his backbone until the tantrum ran its course . When a child throws a tantrum , he throws himself on Mother Earth . I wanted Danny to throw himself on me and let me take care of him . But it was not to play out that way .
