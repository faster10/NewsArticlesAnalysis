Another networking suggestion , from IndependentTraveler . com editor Sarah Schlichter , is to use the website couchsurfing . org . Even if you ' re not interested in the site ' s primary service ( setting up free couch stays ) , it can be a handy tool for connecting with locals around the world . " The site draws social types who are obviously up for meeting and hosting travelers , " she says . " You can suggest lunch or coffee at a caf or museum . "
