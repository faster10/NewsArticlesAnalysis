I m not saying that losing is ever the most positive thing , said Murray . But if I had done very well here , played great the whole week , it s easy to get a little bit complacent . Whereas now I m quite aware that my game needs to go up a level . I can t have dips like I did against Rafa . It was very disappointing not to win the match , but I need to use it the right way for Friday and for the Davis Cup .
