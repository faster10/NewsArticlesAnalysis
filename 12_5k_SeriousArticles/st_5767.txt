" The team defense has stood out , " Hjalmarsson said . " Corey ( Crawford ) has been great all year in goal but the rest of the team has been playing better defensively as a whole unit ? in the neutral zone and in our own end . That ' s what you have to do to win games . We know we have a lot of guys who can score so as long as we do a good job of keeping the other team ' s scoring down we have a good chance . "
