His most talked about weakness , other than the not leading polls anywhere part , is his ground game , or lack thereof ? a problem that would be directly addressed if sitting Republican congressmen , senators , and governors finally started to lend a helping hand . As much as establishment is a dirty word on the campaign trail , there s no denying that elected officials are elected officials thanks in large part to the establishment machines in their states . That s exactly the type of organizational advantage that Rubio is missing , and that Washington Republicans can provide . If the GOP truly wants Rubio to save it from Trump and Cruz , then the party is going to have to save Rubio first . I honestly have no idea what they are waiting for .
