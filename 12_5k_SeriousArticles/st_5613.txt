" I would attend at least two dinner parties a week when I was there . . . and I wouldn ' t really ( know a lot about ) the guests . I wouldn ' t know what they did for a living , but yet I would know the best book they read recently or the most interesting film they saw or the art exhibit that they went to . They loved to discuss these areas of life but they don ' t overshare details about their personal lives . "
