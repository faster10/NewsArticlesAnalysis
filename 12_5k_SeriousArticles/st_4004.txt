' As a player , a bit of that creeps in as well . When you ' re playing great you think you ' re never going to miss these events . But hopefully I shall play well for a while now . That ' s been my thing over the years . It ' s always been about peaks and troughs and keeping the peaks for as long as you can . My wins tend to come together so hopefully I ' ll win a few more now . '
