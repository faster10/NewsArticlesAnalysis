' A lot of players say I want out , I want this or that , but I ' m contracted to a football club : they pay your wages and I ' ll do what ' s asked of me . And this is a club that ' s been good to me down the years so it ' s important you do the best you can , whatever the situation . They pay my wages and fans travel I don ' t know how many miles to watch us . '
