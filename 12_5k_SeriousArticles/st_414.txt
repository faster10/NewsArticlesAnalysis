" A lot of coaches just don ' t know how to communicate , so therefore they don ' t and it causes different problems , " Williams said . " The better you communicate with your players , it goes with years in the league . The younger guys , you just go out and do your job and do what the coach says . It ' s almost like a parent child relationship . The older you get , the more years you get , the more experience you have , it ' s more of a partnership . "
