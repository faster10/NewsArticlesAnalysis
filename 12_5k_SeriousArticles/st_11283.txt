But must " we " forgive our hurt in order to heal ? For me , the person whose actions took my legs is dead . He ' s gone . He is only a name to me . There is no chance for dialogue or for to say " sorry , " to even want my forgiveness . My healing is what I now understand to be a continuous journey , one where I must always find strength in love , of self and humanity and to stay focused on what really matters leading a life that honors my great gift .
