Russell is from Louisville , and his high school coach , Doug Bibby , was Rajon Rondo s high school coach . Russell yearned for Rondo s approval , perhaps too desperately . Every time he came around , I never performed like I would have if he wasn t there , Russell says . I put a lot of pressure on myself . Also , Rondo isn t that much of a people person . Kobe is . In 2015 , that may be true . I had a big transition when I started to understand that my teammates viewed me like some damn machine who didn t feel anything and was oblivious to pressure , Bryant says . They found that very unrelatable . I had to explain that I had the same fears , flaws , vulnerabilities , so they could relate to me . He is referring to former Lakers such as Lamar Odom and Luke Walton , Shannon Brown and Ronny Turiaf , who came to treasure Bryant for reasons that transcend assists .
