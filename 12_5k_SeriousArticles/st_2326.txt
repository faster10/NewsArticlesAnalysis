I got to party in Miami , chill by the pool in Tampa , and be V . I . P . at all the wedding events . I had to admit it was fun . I put on my new attitude the next day . The wedding was beautiful and I made sure to look stunning in my 1 , 500 dress with the stiff , lampshade like flair at the bottom that I will never wear again . I also made sure to drink 1 , 000 worth of champagne .
