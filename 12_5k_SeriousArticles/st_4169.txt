But since the advent of the Super Bowl 50 years ago , only four teams have lost one or fewer games in a season and also won the title . The 1972 Dolphins , of course , finished 17 0 , and so they will likely survive another year as the best of the best , since you can t do better than undefeated . The 1976 Raiders wound up 16 1 after beating the Vikings in Super Bowl IX . And since the season was expanded to 16 regular season games , only the 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears have won 15 regular season games and added three in the postseason .
