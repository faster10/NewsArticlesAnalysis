The world number one fired her first ace of the match in going 4 1 in front and , more controlled , began shooting down some damaging groundstrokes . Serena took the match into a deciding third set having made only five unforced errors , in stark contrast to her wayward first set . But it was Kerber who grabbed a decisive break in the third set as she reeled off a brilliant passing shot on her way to a 2 0 lead . It was just a temporary moment of jubilation as Serena quickly broke back .
