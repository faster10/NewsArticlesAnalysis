There was another moment when Paul was on the offensive but failed to take full advantage of his position . Paul reminds me of so many debaters I ' ve watched over the years who see an opening but don ' t quite know what to do with it . Paul correctly noticed a problem with Santorum ' s support for Title X , which funds family planning programs , coupled with Santorum ' s braggadocio solution of creating and voting for Title XX abstinence programs . To his credit , Paul mentioned that Title XX costs money too and , in his view , also overstepped the bounds of the federal government ' s rightful role . But he could have completed the argument with just a bit more thought .
