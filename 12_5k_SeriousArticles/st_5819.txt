Brandon has done a great job when he s had his chance , Brady said . James White has done it for us , and we ve had some great players at that position over the years . So I think it s dependability because there are a lot of things that you ask that player to do . Not just catch the ball , but when you hand it to him . . . and blitz pickup , and it s kind of a lot of things that happen back there . We have quite a few protections .
