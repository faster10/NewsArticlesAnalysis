Ramadi is the capital of Anbar province with a predominantly Sunni population which has been traditional stronghold of IS ideology and probably was the most significant Iraqi city under IS control , after IS capital Raqqa which falls in Syria . There they had helped to isolate the city and hold areas , freeing up the military to advance . Compared with the 4 , 000 extremists mentioned in a report we received from the USA army before the military operation , we believe this number suggests that Daesh has been dealt a major blow .
