" You think about Larry as the first guy you think about in this offense , " Palmer said . " Then with all the attention that Smoke ( Brown ) gets , having a thousand yards and all those things , he ( Floyd ) is kind of the third guy you think about , probably naturally , and I don ' t think that bothers him . I think he enjoys that because he ends up walking away last week with two touchdowns . So much focus goes to Larry , it leaves him one on one a lot . "
