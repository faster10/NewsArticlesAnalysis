The " Glee " side , at least in my book , doesn ' t exactly amount to a recommendation , but it does mean that the movie ' s musical numbers are catchy and rollicking and , in their bright sunshiny way , rather soulful . In the small town of Pacashau , Georgia , times are hard every other storefront is empty but the Divinity Church choir has lifted local spirits by rising to become a semifinalist in the National Joyful Noise Competition . Can these spunky vocalists go the distance ?
