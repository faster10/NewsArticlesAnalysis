You know you ' re hooked when , despite being bedridden with a terrible case of strep throat at 17 , you ' re craving a cigarette . Or when it ' s 2 in the morning and you ' re too tired to drive to 7 11 , so you scrounge through all your ashtrays , fishing for a butt with a modicum of tobacco left . Or you ' re with friends and they light up , so you light up because that ' s just good social courtesy , right ? It was pathetic .
