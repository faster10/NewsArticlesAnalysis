This Caribbean style design features purple and white kale , pomegranate , papaya , oranges , strawberries , cucumber , passion fruit and cherries . Later , Amber whizzed it up into a smoothie . The design was a result of a trip to a Caribbean stall at her local market . ' I found some beautiful vivid kale , as bright as the picture , ' she said . ' It was the colour of dark lavender . Then some white kale , with a green ruffle . It looked like fabric . For the design I just came back from the market with all these bright fruits and flunked down on the floor . The gorgeous smell of passion fruit filled the room '
