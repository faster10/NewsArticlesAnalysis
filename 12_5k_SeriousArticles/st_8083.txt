I ' m so tired of labels , and it seems that EVERYTHING in life and society reinforces those labels . Look around and see how many things point us into a label and divide us as people into those labels . The fashion magazines , the media , the news , our parents , our brothers and sisters , our friends , our neighbors , the church , the mosque , the guy on the corner who never met me is enforcing labels and controlling my thoughts and actions according to those labels .
