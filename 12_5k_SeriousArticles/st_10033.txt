France are another enigma they came second in the Worlds in 2010 and then bottom of the Europeans the next year and went down a division . But they ' ve worked their way back up and could be tricky . Spain are like Germany and can be the best team in the world or implode , but we always seem to play well against them so I think we ' ll be OK . As for Poland , they have got weaker over the past few years and the Czech Republic , I won ' t lie , I ' ve never seen them play ! That ' s because they ' ve not been in the top division for a while but we ' ll have to be wary of them .
