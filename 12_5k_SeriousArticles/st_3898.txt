The Broncos certainly made their feelings about the Patriots known this past week . Defensive end Antonio Smith called Brady a crybaby and fellow lineman Malik Jackson said Brady has thrown temper tantrums on the field . Defensive end Derek Wolfe added to the war of words when he told The Denver Post : I hate everything about them . They re always in my way . They re always in my way to get what I want . I ve got a ton of respect for the whole organization . They ve got great players ? Tom Brady s a great player . Bill Belichick s a great coach . I ve got a ton of respect for them . I just hate them .
