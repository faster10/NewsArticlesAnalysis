When ? Jose Chung s From Outer Space ? aired , I remember being so satisfied by Morgan s take on the alien conspiracy that I wanted to believe the show was slyly using this winky lark to clarify what was already , by the end of season 3 , a pretty muddy bit of business . Without spoiling the twists , Morgan presented a version of the conspiracy that was wholly the project of evil human beings , not a collaborative effort with colonizing EBEs . I bring this up ? because it appears Carter has basically adopted this perspective on the mythology for the revival . Jose Chung s From Outer Space really does it explain it all ! When Fox releases the revival on DVD , they should include the episode as a prologue .
