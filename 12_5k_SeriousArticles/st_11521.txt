Disney attempted to counter program against " Catching Fire " with the Vince Vaughn comedy " Delivery Man " this weekend , but the plan didn ' t work out . " Delivery Man " delivered just 8 . 2 million worth of ticket sales . Vaughn , who enjoyed a hot streak from 2005 2009 with films like " Wedding Crashers , " " The Break Up " and " Couples Retreat , " has struggled at the box office as of late . " Delivery Man " will join " The Dilemma " ( 48 . 5 million total ) , " The Watch " ( 35 . 4 million ) and " The Internship " ( 44 . 7 million ) as under performers on his filmography . Audiences , which were evenly split between men and women , gave the film a " B " CinemaScore grade .
