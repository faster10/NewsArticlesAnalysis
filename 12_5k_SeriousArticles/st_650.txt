Whether you re for Bernie or Hillary , or just peace and justice , you may see how much we need a strong progressive movement . I ve no idea who will win this election only that whoever wins , there will be another election after it . In between them , there will be a country to govern . I know it s a crucial election but lately I think less about who I support than what I support . We ll face more hard battles when it s over . To win them , we must build our strength .
