The truth is that cultures , civilizations and lifestyles do not clash . It is humans who clash , with their interests , ambitions , illusions and fantasies . Instead of the twisted binary logic of ' us ' vs . ' them ' , terrorism should render us more keenly aware of the interconnectedness of our world , of our shared existence and the dangers that threaten us all . Terrorists do not ask for their victims IDs before mutilating their bodies in Paris , Beirut , or Tunis . The solution to the insane chaos into which we have been dragged since 9 11 begins with an active rejection of the ugly dualisms of " us " and " them " , of believers vs infidels and of Westerners Europeans vs the Muslim other .
