I recently attended an event where a group of startups in an incubator pitched their companies after eight weeks in the program .

Truth is , chances of the new business making money are very unlikely . In an environment where all the other companies around it seemed to be innovating in an interesting way with new technology , the pressure to innovate killed a good business .
