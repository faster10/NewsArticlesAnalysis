Yeah , I ' m sure . The better form you have , the faster you ' re going to go . It ' s extremely realistic . I found a lot of people were afraid to put their face under the water . So if they actually feel comfortable being able to just swim the strokes , maybe they ' ll feel comfortable when they get in the water . There are a lot of things that could happen and hopefully we can get more people in the pool and around the pool .
