If those figures are accurate , that leaves Hamas with over 3 , 000 rockets . The numbers can be deceiving , since we do not have a breakdown of how many of which type remain in the inventory do they have a large number of the more capable Syrian made M 302 ( 100 mile range ) or locally made M 75 ( 50 mile range ) rockets , or more of the less capable , locally made short range al Qassam rockets ? In any case , Hamas still has thousands of rockets .
