Kevin Hart : Yes . I wasn ' t sure of the direction I wanted to take the movie in , but I just knew I wanted to document everything I was doing that year because it was so much , especially the world tour aspect of it . It was just putting camera crews in place to capture absolutely everything that we did and at the end of it just put the pieces of the puzzle I had in my head together . It all came together well . But as we were going along I tracked it and I knew the pieces I had , and it was just tying them together .
