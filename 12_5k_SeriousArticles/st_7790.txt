Times have certainly changed . Today the campaign book of the GOP s presidential frontrunner is called Crippled America . It is an article of faith that our military is so degraded we cannot possibly defend ourselves . It is assumed that everyone around the world once loved us and now loathes everything we stand for and the patriotic right , which once lived by the mantra love it or leave it , now blithely asserts to anyone who ll listen that the United States is no longer the best country in the world . Who would have ever thought that was possible ?
