Consider , for example , the very different way the activism of Facebook co founder Chris Hughes has been received . Hughes , like Sandberg , is extremely , even obscenely rich , and he and his husband have used part of their wealth to become major champions of same sex marriage . Maybe someone somewhere has argued that their work for gay rights means little because it stems from self interest , or that they shouldn ' t be focusing on a bourgeois issue like marriage that does little for , say , homeless gay teenagers . If such critics are out there , though , they ' re certainly not on the pages of our major newspapers .
