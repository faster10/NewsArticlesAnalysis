There are loads . Beating Leeds 4 1 away when Don Revie was in charge of them , is right up there . It was proving impossible to beat Leeds and we absolutely hammered them . The Orient game , obviously , was the most emotional for every Burnley fan . Both play offs at Wembley have been great , too . I ' ve got loads of bad memories too , but I think it ' s the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special .
