Trump may come across as an idiot a lot of the time , but this quote shows how clever he can be . He deftly employs the liberal media bias framework , packaging this lie in the claim that it s actually a truth that is being suppressed by the omnipotent forces of political correctness , who are protecting pro terrorist types for nefarious , if obscure , reasons . This serves as a warning shot to ? Stephanopoulos , a reminder that should he aggressively confront Trump about telling racist tall tales , anything that ? Stephanopoulos says will immediately be written off by conservatives not as evidence that Trump is lying ( which he is ) , but that ? Stephanopoulos is out to get Trump . It s a real heads I win , tails you lose situation .
