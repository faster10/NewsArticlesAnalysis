" When you ' re competing as an individual you can find your own pace and if you mess up , you have a longer time to make up for it , " says Annie Thorsidottir , captain of the New York Rhinos . " But on the grid , everything is so fast and high intensity that you need to move fast while you ' re out there . If you start slowing down , it ' s time to rotate and change out . You need to be moving full speed , all the time . "
