A gaffe is defined as a mistake : a misstatement of fact , a mispronunciation of a word , a social faux pas . By way of example , President Obama made a classic gaffe by stating a few years ago that he had campaigned in all " 57 states , " when obviously he meant to say 50 states . Another gaffe occurred when President Obama was in Austria and commented : " I don ' t know what the term is in Austrian " for " wheeling and dealing . " The gaffe being that there is no Austrian language .
