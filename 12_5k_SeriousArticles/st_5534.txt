I was walking home from the library carrying nine books . That ' s the way my memory sees it . I can ' t know for sure if it was exactly nine books . Maybe I picture nine books because I was nine years old . I ' m certain that I was nine years old , because I ' m sure of the date June 9 , 1943 . There were a lot of books under my arm on that summer day because I loved books . I wonder what happened to those nine books . . .
