Blatt played 9 of the next 12 years in Israel , before retiring in 1993 to become a coach . We put our trust in him now . He ' s around us every day and he felt like as good as we can be we weren ' t reaching the potential to this point . " We ' ve got to follow his lead " . He will , however , attempt " to do some things better " . Lue isn ' t looking for a complete makeover . If they ' re winning like insane but with " a disconnect " , it ' s on the coach . " I think Griffin was right on everything he said . . . . " Try to get up and down the court before the defense is set on us .
