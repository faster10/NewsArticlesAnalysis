The problem was solved when I had one of those epiphanies that appear so " duh ! " in retrospect : that " somebody else " I conjured up in acting class was simply living her life , not acting it . I only had to be her . The corollary was that I could have a persona , one that would allow me to say out loud the wisecracks in my head , one that could hug people , one that could snuff out the sudden bouts of shyness that hampered my self assurance . All it took was stepping out of myself .
