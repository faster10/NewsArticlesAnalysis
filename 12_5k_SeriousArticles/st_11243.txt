Vanessa : As a mother now of four children , I can see her much more wholly as a woman , a mother , someone who has had a past and someone whose past has influenced her choices as well as mine . The wiser you get , the more experience you have , and the more you see people for who they are as human beings , as opposed to figures you have to fight against . I think I am much more conscious of back story , temperament and even going through perimenopause and how it can affect your mood , attitude and relations and how you deal with people . There are a lot of things that you don ' t realize that your parents are going through when you ' re a kid .
