Armstrong appeared 30 minutes into the show , atop a moving staircase , where he howled the " 1 2 3 4 " count off during " St . Jimmy . " The applause was deafening as he sang the first lines : He strutted down the stairs , grabbed his crotch during the thrashing breakdown , and joined the rest of the cast in their choreographed moves , shooting them up with heroin . As the track ' s final note was struck , he grasped hands with Gallagher , and remained in the position for a full minute , to huge applause .
