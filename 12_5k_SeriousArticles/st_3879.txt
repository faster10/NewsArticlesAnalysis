Obama , on the other hand , responded to an attack by Islamic State linked Muslims with a mixture of pablum and an effort at distraction ? by talking about gun bans for people on the no fly list . ? ( Even lefty publications like the LA Times ? and Slate ? thought that idea dumb ) . Before that attack took place , Obama was already polling terribly on terror : According to a CNN ORC ? poll taken between 11 27 and 12 1 , only 33 of Americans approved of Obama s handling of ISIL 64 disapproved . ? I doubt that Obama s ratings will improve when the post San Bernardino polls come in .
