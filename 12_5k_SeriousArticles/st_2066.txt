Make it a museum . Just like museums in most world class cities , many of those within Paris open themselves to visitors free of charge one day a week . In the City of Light , that ' s the first Sunday of each month . Save those euros for a few caf au laits or souvenirs and check out the Louvre , the Mus e d ' Orsay and the Mus e National Rodin ( hello , The Thinker ! ) , among others . Some , like the Mus e Carnavalet , offer free admission to their permanent and themed collections each day . For those seeking a free dose of nighttime culture and who visit Paris in mid May Nuit des Mus es is just the ticket . Nearly 200 city museums keep their doors open during this one night from 6 p . m . until at least midnight .
