If your child does catch hand , foot , and mouth disease , she may have a fever and a nasty sore throat , so make her as comfortable as possible by giving her acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the fever and pain . Also , encourage her to eat ice pops and drink whatever she ' s willing to swallow including watered down juice and milk shakes to prevent dehydration , which is often a concern when a sore throat is severe . If you ' re worried your child is dehydrated , call your pediatrician .
