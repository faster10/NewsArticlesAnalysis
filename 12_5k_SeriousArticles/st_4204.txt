Koryta : I ' ve always felt an incredible amount of generosity from the time I showed up , people going out of their way to help me who didn ' t have to . It seems like there ' s a really good spirit of brotherhood , especially in crime fiction . In terms of competition , anytime I read a book that I think is really good , like " The Black Box , " I love it and I ' m rooting for Michael as a friend but there ' s also a spark of , this is a better book than what I wrote and now I ' ve got to try and catch up with that . For me , that ' s the greatest motivation to improve is to see really good writers continue to get better and continue to pull farther away from you . You ' re always chasing the rabbit , and that ' s a good thing .
