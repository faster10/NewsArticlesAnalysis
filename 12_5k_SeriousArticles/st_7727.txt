Cruz victory gives hope to despised people everywhere , joked the New Yorker . Iowa cast a majority of its votes for inexperienced , difficult candidates who revel in anarchy .

Hillary s vote was strong among women , especially women of a certain age . But Sanders took around 84 per cent of the votes of people under 30 in a caucus dominated by self described liberals . His astonishing performance came in spite of Hillary having a brilliant staff operation ? albeit a staff that whispered to reporters that voters weren t that keen on their product . Just as the rise of Jeremy Corbyn in Britain was fuelled by resentment towards Blairism , so Iowa can be seen as a referendum on Clintonism .
