Season six of TWD is only three episodes old , but is already proving to be one of its most brutal . Not only is the fate of fan fave Glenn still up in the air ( though , we ' re pretty sure he ' ll pull through ) , but the sadistic Wolves have finally descended upon Alexandria , reminding us all that zombies aren ' t the only thing to fear in the Walking Dead universe . With the introduction of Jesus on the way ? and the looming threat of the ultra villainous Negan seeming ever closer ? we ' re sure the shocks are only going to get bigger .
