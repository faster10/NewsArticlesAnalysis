In Iraq , Britain will therefore be acting in cooperation with an army that is no longer the strongest military force in Iraq . In Syria , by way of contrast , the British will be refusing to cooperate with the Syrian army , which is the largest military force in the country , and which is now backed by Russian air power . The Syrian opposition has always pretended that the Syrian army was not fighting Isis , though this is demonstrably untrue and the Syrian army suffered a string of defeats near Raqqa last year and again at Palmyra this May . But it was losing ground this year up to the moment when it was rescued by Russian air strikes and greater Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah intervention on the ground . It has been taking back territory lost to Isis in the east and al Nusra and Ahrar al Sham in the north . And on 10 November , it broke Isis ' s siege of Kweiris military airbase , freeing some 2 , 000 Syrian troops trapped there in its greatest success for two years .
