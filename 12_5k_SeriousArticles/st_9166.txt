Conservatives can be forgiven for saying I told you so . They ve complained for years now about an environment on campus of illiberal intellectual bullying , speech codes and kangaroo court proceedings against students accused of racism or sexual misconduct . They have condemned the exclusion of conservative speakers from campus for fear they might upset the fragile students in attendance . In short , liberal education has come to resemble a totalitarian re education camp in which grievance mongering attains new heights , no offending messages are to be tolerated ( i . e . deviations from left wing doctrine ) and the free exchange of ideas becomes a threat , not a value in institutions devoted , we thought , to opening young minds . ? It turns out that refusing to defend open discourse and spreading learned helplessness were poor ideas . Who knew , huh ?
