BEST HIGHLIGHT : There were so many great highlights , ranging from Kyle Schwarber ' s series of mammoth home runs , to Kris Bryant ' s multiple walkoff home runs , to Addison Russell ' s endless loop of defensive gems . The best highlight though had to be Jake Arrieta ' s no hitter on Aug . 30 in Los Angeles . Arrieta was historically great during the second half , and had flirted with no hitters in the past , but everything came together in that outing .
