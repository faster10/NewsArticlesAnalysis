However , that was while attempting to run Gary Kubiak s offense , which with Manning under center is a classic square peg round hole situation . Manning went no huddle in the shotgun on the next drive and was 5 of 8 passing for 61 yards , topping it off with a touchdown to Emmanuel Sanders to cut the deficit to 14 7 . Manning repeated that success with a game tying drive at the end of the 4th quarter he was only 5 of 11 on the drive but finished with another touchdown pass to Sanders .
