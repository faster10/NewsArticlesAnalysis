" In high school I wore a nappy afro because of Kobe Bryant , " James said . " I always said my inspiration came from Jordan , but I always thought Jordan was so out of this world that I could never get there . Kobe was someone that I just always kind of wanted to be like and play like . And then , just being a competitor , he took me to that next level , and understanding how important competition is and just have a willingness to never die . "
