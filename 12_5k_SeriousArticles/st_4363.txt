In the end , the choice was a simple one . Sporto ' s 12th birthday was the next day , and we ' d previously kicked around the idea of perhaps seeing the movie on his birthday anyway . He would go to see " The Force Awakens " with me on opening night , and his younger brother would get his chance later , after we ' d completed our home viewing of the original trilogy . That was of small consolation to the 7 year old , but I assured him that had it been any time of the year other than Sporto ' s birthday , The Builder would absolutely have gone in his stead . And that ' s true , given that the younger boy is far more likely to construct his own Death Star out of Legos , while his brother would rather check the TV listings for the next can ' t miss college bowl game .
