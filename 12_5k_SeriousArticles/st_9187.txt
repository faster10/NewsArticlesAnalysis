I am writing from a bridge site in West Pokot where four people , sadly , drowned earlier this year . I wish all of you could see this setting , hear the sounds of rural Africa and meet this very happy community that I ' m serving . The scenery is breathtaking . I can see children mirrored in my computer screen standing behind my chair as I type under the shade of an Acacia tree children who will no longer have to worry about drowning in the river they paradoxically depend on as a source of life .
