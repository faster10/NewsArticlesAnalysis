Still , we bridle at the notion that any of our updates might be converted into " sponsored stories " by whatever business or brand we may have mentioned . That innocent mention of cup of coffee at Starbucks , in the Facebook universe , quickly becomes an attributed endorsement of their brand . Remember , the only way to connect with something or someone is to " like " them . This means if you want to find out what a politician or company you don ' t like is up to , you still have to endorse them publicly .
