The Islamic State s strategy is to polarize Western society ? to destroy the grayzone , as it says in its publications . The group hopes frequent , devastating attacks in its name will provoke overreactions by European governments against innocent Muslims , thereby alienating and radicalizing Muslim communities throughout the continent . The atrocities in Paris are only the most recent instances of this accelerating campaign . Since January , European citizens fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have provided online and material support to lethal operations in Paris , Copenhagen and near Lyon , France , as well as attempted attacks in London , Barcelona and near Brussels . Islamic State fighters are likely responsible for destroying the Russian airliner over the Sinai . These attacks are not random , nor are they aimed primarily at affecting Western policy in the Middle East . They are , rather , part of a militarily capable organization s campaign to mobilize extremist actors already in Europe and to recruit new ones .
