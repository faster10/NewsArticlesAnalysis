We have to look at each situation in its own context . In Iraq , there is a Shia majority . But that certainly isn t the case in Syria , where the Alawites only represent 15 percent or so of the population . But Iran has now almost 40 years of experience building militias in the Middle East , starting with Hezbollah . They have a committed ideology and worldview . They have a very clear goal in Syria , which is the continuation of the Assad regime . The Saudis don t really have a clear alternative worldview , and they have often been compromised by the fact that they are aligned with the United States . It s tough for them to win an ideological battle . It s easier to win a sectarian one .
