We all , men and women , can reject the script that gets played out in media every day that tells our boys to be unemotional and violent while objectifying girls at increasingly younger ages . The profound presence of media in our lives has only led to young people being exposed earlier and more often to salacious and sexual content . This media bombardment desensitizes our boys and girls to the reality of violence that is anything but the subtext of a life . Our silence only validates that script . We can speak out against it .
