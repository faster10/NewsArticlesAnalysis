The 2016 national championship had it all . It had unsung heroes like Clemson s freshman receiver Hunter Renfrow , a quarterback in high school , catching the first two touchdown passes for his team , and another no name , tight end O . J . Howard , catching touchdowns of 53 and 51 yards for Alabama . It also had Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry driving his team by rushing for three touchdowns and 158 yards , and Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson throwing for 405 yards and four scores .
