Miller , though , was stunned that his directing contemporary Ridley Scott wasn t joining him for his work on The Martian . I m quite taken aback by that , he said . I m a fan of The Martian and I m a huge fan of his work . He s made some of the abiding images in cinema ? those movies that you never forget where you were when you first saw them . I remember very vividly the night I saw Alien for the first time . ?
