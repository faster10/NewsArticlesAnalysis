Todra Payne is married to New York City , but it ' s not exclusive . " NYC is home for me , but L . A . is my secret lover , " she writes . " Can ' t beat the way you can walk Manhattan and meet people along the way , meander in and out of shops , restaurants , etc . You just can ' t do that in L . A . But the sunshine , beaches and palm trees and the laid back vibe in L . A . are golden . If there was a way to combine the two , it would be paradise . "
