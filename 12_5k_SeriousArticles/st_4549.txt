Although Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International wrote an open letter calling Sisi s rule the gravest human rights crisis in Egypt in decades , it seems that the U . S . is still willing to overlook all that , out of fear that without Sisi ? or the military apparatus backing him ? Egypt could potentially spiral into a jihadist rogue state , a notion that Sisi has been actively promoting . But I believe that it is in fact Sisi himself , with his brutal crackdown on all forms of dissent , who is to blame for the rise of jihadist factions in Egypt today . We saw the same things play out in Syria , where Bashar al Assad s heavy handed response to a peaceful protest movement in 2011 provoked a full fledged civil war . In essence , Sisi is nothing but a U . S . backed version of Assad in Egypt . Both are military backed tyrants who govern by coercion and respond to calls for much needed reforms with indiscriminate force .
