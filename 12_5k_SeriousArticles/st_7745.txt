Saban retribution . He is at his best when Alabama is coming off disappointment , which was the case in the past two Decembers ( losses to Auburn before the 2013 SEC Championship game and Ohio State in the 2014 semis ) . The first seven , five to seven minutes of the second half is where I wanted to see where we were , Johnson said . And the last thing I want to do is look at the downside and say , Our last game as Spartans we lost . We want to be positive people . That s a bad sign for any opponent . Taylor finished with eight points and seven rebounds . Alabama s defensive front was so good ? against a pretty good offensive line ? that it got pressure on Cook despite often rushing only four . It makes it easy . Alabama sealed the victory by scoring 12 straight points to take a 64 38 lead on Norris 3 pointer with 5 : 03 to play . But Alabama has not only the strength but the speed to contain Watson and the Tigers skill players . Since then , Saban has at least partially embraced the revolution : He hired disgraced USC coach Lane Kiffin as his offensive coordinator , and Kiffin has employed elements of both the spread and the hurry up offense . No . I m not insane .
