I loved it . It was fantastic . There are few times on TV where you just have two people in a room and their characters are just allowed to play , to butt heads , to move closer together , to explore things , and it s lovely . And when you can do it with an actor of John s caliber and his kind of skill , it s gravy . It s the best day to work , because anything you throw in his direction he is more than capable of taking on board and then throwing it back even better , so it was a lovely experience .
