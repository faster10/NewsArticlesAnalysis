T . J . Yeldon vs . Colts : The entire Jaguars offense is in play Sunday . Yeldon is looking like one of the top running backs to own for the fantasy playoffs with matchups against bottom barrel run defenses the next three weeks . He gets the Colts , Falcons , and Saints . All are bottom 10 fantasy run defenses and have combined to allow 40 touchdowns to running backs . The Colts lost top run defender DE Henry Anderson to a torn ACL in Week 9 , and well above average run defenders ILB Jerrell Freeman ( hamstring ) and OLB Erik Walden ( foot ) aren t practicing this week . Freeman isn t going to play . Without Anderson and Freeman last week , the Colts allowed DeAngelo Williams to average over 5 . 15 YPC and pile up 165 total yards on 31 touches . The Jaguars made a concerted effort to get Yeldon the ball in scoring position last week , and he registered four carries inside the 20 yard line and scored a one yard rushing touchdown , his first red zone TD of the year . Yeldon already gets a big workload he averages 19 . 4 touches per game . When he s getting red zone and goal line carries , he s a locked in RB1 . Fire him up with confidence against the Colts .
