Kopi means coffee in Indonesian and Luwak is a wild Asian palm civet , a fury creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a ferret . The civet climbs the coffee trees to find the best berries , eats them , digests the berries and eventually out comes the coffee beans in its stools . Farmers then pick up the civet droppings and take the beans to a processing plant . Something about the gastric juices in the civet ' s stomach gives Kopi Luwak its unique flavor .
