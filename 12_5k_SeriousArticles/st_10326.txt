The Clippers sent the message loud and clear ? they threw a haymaker at the start of Thursday night s anticipated showdown . The Clippers were pressuring on defense , forcing stops , then converting those to easy buckets going the other way . Chris Paul came out on fire hitting midrange jumpers and threes , he started 7 of 7 and had 18 of the Clippers first 30 points , added on four assists , plus got a couple early fouls on Curry that forced him to the bench . The Clippers led by 23 at one point in the quarter . The Clippers were clearly the better team .
