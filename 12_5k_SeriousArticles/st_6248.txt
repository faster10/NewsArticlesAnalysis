' The kung fu kick , it was great , too , ' he said , ' I think the good thing from that is , through me , everybody can realise , in your life , you can do good things and bad things . I ' ve done things I ' m proud about and I ' ve done some bad things that I don ' t regret because it ' s just my life . And if you ' re happy , it ' s good . If you ' re not happy , I don ' t care . Nobody will teach me how to behave myself . '
