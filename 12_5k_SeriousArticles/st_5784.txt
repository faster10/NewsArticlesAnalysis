The reality is that accidents without answers produce doubts about safety , and such doubt can eventually take a toll on the entire airline industry , not just one particular air carrier . True , millions of people continue to fly in the wake of the disappearance of MH370 . But tens of millions of dollars in passenger revenue have already been lost as Malaysian Airline ' s jets reportedly fly with large numbers of vacant seats . As a result of the drop in passenger numbers , Malaysia Airlines is set to be removed from the stock exchange as part of a 12 point recovery plan in an effort to rebound from the losses . But imagine the damage it could do to the entire airline industry if there is another tragedy and still no answer to the question of what caused the disappearance of MH370 . Such a turn of events would rock not only passengers ' faith in the airlines ' ability to keep them safe , but also governments ' ability to assure safe air travel .
