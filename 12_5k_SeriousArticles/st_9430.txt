These weren ' t the same Chilis that last played Lollapalooza in 2006 : guitarist Josh Klinghoffer was added to the mix following the departure of John Frusciante in 2009 . The Anthony Kiedis led crew delivered a set comprised largely of the classics , aside from opening with the otherworldly percussion of new tune " Monarchy of Roses " ( off 2011 album I ' m With You ) , and their trademark fusion of rock , punk and funk riffs was on full display . The setlist included everything from the melodic ( " Snow ( Hey Oh ) , " " Under the Bridge " ) to the mosh pit friendly rockers ( " Can ' t Stop " ) and even the Afrobeat inspired ( " Throw Away Your Television " ) .
