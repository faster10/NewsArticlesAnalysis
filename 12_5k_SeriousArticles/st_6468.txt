Hart : I don ' t approach it like it ' s a movie role . I genuinely love doing standup and I ' m a comedian first , so for me what makes my standup special is the fact that I don ' t have to adapt or adjust . I am who I am . I appeal to everyone , hence in the movie doing a world tour . I ' m not changing , I ' m not adjusting my voice , I ' m not changing my speed and the way that I talk . This is me . I ' m actually funny . So I think the prep for that is me just enjoying what I do .
