Van Zandt : To do our first show as a broadcast , that ' s real balls . I ' m proud of us for pulling it off . It was pretty close to flawless , I have to say . Keep in mind , we have a brand new five piece horn section . We ' re still working on horn parts . We ' re still working on vocal parts with the singers . We have a couple new people involved . I took it for granted , but they were probably a bit nervous . They did great , though .
