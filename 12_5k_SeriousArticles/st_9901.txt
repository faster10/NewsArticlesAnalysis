Managing director of Novus , Gerard Hooi , said : There is a certain rustic charm to the place , people are very nice if you get to know them and understand the culture . Although it ' s a bit laid back at times , there is a certain sense of honesty and willingness to engage foreign people , to learn through foreigners . And if you become very sincere and good friends with them , they ' re able to open up their hearts to you and engage you even for business .
