I had seen my gynecologist eight weeks before diagnosis and had a pap smear ( which does not test for ovarian cancer ) and a pelvic exam , which were clear . Over the next few weeks I began to experience bloating , decreased appetite , back pain , and frequent urination . I had all the classic symptoms but was not seeing what they were signs of ovarian cancer . I hadn ' t paid attention because I was busy running my practice and my home . Busy with life .
