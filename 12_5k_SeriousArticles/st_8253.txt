Cole : There are so many people that inspire me , and there are 90 role models in this book , some of whom I ' ve been very close to . I am the closest of all to my wife , who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do . So she ' s inspired me and she ' s done great stuff . So I think I ' ll stay with that answer .
