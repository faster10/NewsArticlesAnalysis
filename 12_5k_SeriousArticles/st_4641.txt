Government must guide and lead this transition . This is not a time to dismantle the state . By all means let ' s question again the boundaries between the private and the public sectors . Let ' s explore new models of ownership and enterprise . Let ' s question the role of productivity and the meaning of welfare . Let ' s revisit the concept and function of public goods . But for goodness ' sake , let ' s leave sufficient governance in place to have a decent chance at a new prosperity .
