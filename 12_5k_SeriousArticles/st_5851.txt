" ( W ) hen you talk about ' the gay community , ' you are talking about MY community , " Nairn said when questioned about his gay fan base . " I ' ve never hidden my sexuality from anyone , my whole life in fact , and I ' ve been waiting for someone to ask about it in an interview , ( because ) it ' s not something you just blurt out . I ' ve tried to lead the questions a few times , to no avail ! "
