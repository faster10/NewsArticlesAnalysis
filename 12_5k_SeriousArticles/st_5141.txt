It is added here that the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that the series will be called off if the Indian government does not give its approval in the next couple of days . The PCB would wait for a day or two before shelving plans for the series which is planned to be held this month in Sri Lanka . Miandad said the national team should not participate in the T20 World Cup as the security situation was not better in India for Pakistanis and in order to protest against them for not playing a series with Pakistan . " The Indian government is lingering on to the issue which is not the way to treat things , " he said .
