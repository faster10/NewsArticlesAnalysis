Genuine love is anti social . If you write a love letter and leave it for her , but post it on Facebook , too , your feelings disperse . The sentiments in the letter spread too thinly , and if she sees them elsewhere she wonders , " Hey , I thought your love was meant for me . " If she posts your letter on Facebook , you think the same thing . If both of you post the letter on Facebook , well , love itself wastes away , just as any noble , feeling full statement does when it turns into an advertising jingle . If you call him on the phone and hear him say for the first time , " I love you , too , " then hang up and text 20 friends and update Facebook with , " He said it ! " you may think that you are expanding and replenishing his declaration , but in truth you only deplete it . This is a moment to savor and ponder by yourself , to let it exist for a time on its own . Love can ' t run too swiftly or follow too many channels and last .
