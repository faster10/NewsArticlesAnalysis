But what about when search results contain more than simple lists , but come to include little built in utilities ? For instance , if you ' re doing a search for " plane tickets from NY to LA , " your list of results will begin with a handy Google flight finding application , built right into the page , complete with space for your desired dates of travel and a submit button . Below that , you get regular old links to Expedia and Kayak and all the other online travel agencies . These are not equivalent results . The Google flight utility isn ' t just a text link but an interactive tool that imitates the very functionality of Expedia or Kayak . ( Once you pick your flights , it sends you to the relevant airline site with all your data already filled in . )
