I made the decision in May , after visiting with my family , that I wanted to keep coaching , as long as I felt good and had the energy I needed , Pinkel said . ? I felt great going into the season , but also knew that I would need to re assess things at some point , and I set our bye week as the time when I would take stock of the future . ? After we played Vanderbilt ( Oct . 24 ) , I had a scheduled PET scan on Oct . 26th for reassessment , and then visited with my family and came to the decision on October 27th that this would be my last year coaching . ? I still feel good physically , but I decided that I want to focus on enjoying my remaining years with my family and friends , and also have proper time to battle the disease and give full attention to that , he said .
