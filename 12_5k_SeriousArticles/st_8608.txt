In many respects , both of these races are too close to call . In 2008 , Clinton led Obama by wide margins , but a record breaking turnout by young people ? the same cadre that s behind the Sanders surge ? propelled Obama to victory in Iowa . That same year in New Hampshire , Clinton came back and beat Obama after busing in supporters from upstate New York to stand on street corners with signs , an old New Hampshire get out the vote tactic . In 2016 , Sanders home state lies in between New York and New Hampshire .
