" White people adopt black kids to make themselves feel good . . . A black child needs black parents to raise it . " " Maybe she adopted one because the blacks in the community wouldn ' t step forward and adopt ? " " What ' s the big deal ? If no white person ever adopted a black child , they ' d be saying why don ' t white people adopt black children . " " Who cares what race they are ? A woman got a child , a child got a mother . . . it ' s BEAUTIFUL ! ! ! And yes I am black . . . if it matters . "
