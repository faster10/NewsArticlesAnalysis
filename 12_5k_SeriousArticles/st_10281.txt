JR : It ' s a book on the urgent need to have immigration reform . As we can see what happened in Arizona the overturning of parts of SB 1070 it ' s a step in the right direction for Latinos and immigrants , but it ' s simply not enough . Things are exactly the same as two weeks ago or two months ago or two years ago or even 20 years ago because we still have 11 million people in the U . S . without any rights whatsoever . It ' s really incredible that the most powerful country in the world is treating 11 million people as second class citizens or second class human beings .
