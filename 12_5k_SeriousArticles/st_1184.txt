' My greatest performing thrill was probably when I first took the stage at London ' s Royal Albert Hall anybody who is anybody has played there . And I ' ll never forget the joy of playing at New York ' s Radio City Music Hall or the Musikverein . I ' ve been very fortunate . One place I haven ' t played but would love to is on the Moon . Sir Richard Branson tells me he is going to build a hotel there and has asked if I want to be the first to play in it .
