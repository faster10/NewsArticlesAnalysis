Almost 50 years ago , I was watching a soccer match in the National Stadium in Chile ' s capital when , seconds after a gigantic rumble from under the ground terrified the 60 , 000 fans attending the game , the mountains suddenly disappeared . I am not exaggerating : The stadium was rocked like a cradle and rose in the air , blotting out my view of the Andes , and then , fortunately for all of us , settled back to stability . We had just been through what is still considered , at 9 . 6 on the Richter scale , the greatest seismic activity ever recorded .
