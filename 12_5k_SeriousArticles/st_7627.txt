I included " Compton " on my personal year end Top 10 list at No . 9 . But the Academy nominated only eight films ? they can pick anywhere between five and 10 ? and few would argue that any of those that were nominated were less deserving than " Compton " was . If the Academy still guaranteed 10 nominees for best pic ? as it did back when " Casablanca " won and briefly again just a few years ago , and as it still should ? I have no doubt that " Compton " would have been nominated .
