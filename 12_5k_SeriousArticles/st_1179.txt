As putrid as the Giants pass rush has been this season , their coverage hasn t been much better . While cornerback Dominique Rodgers Cromartie has played at a high level , their linebackers and safeties have been porous . J . T . Thomas has been their only LB that grades above 80 in that department , while aforementioned snap leaders Unga and Kennard have been heinous ( 44 . 7 and 39 . 7 , respectively ) . Old friend Brandon Meriweather has actually been decent in coverage ( 79 . 0 ) and starts alongside rookie Landon Collins , who has not ( 37 . 9 ) . Can these guys contain Rob Gronkowski ? They have allowed 5 touchdowns to tight ends this season , but haven t faced anyone near the caliber of Gronk ? and another old friend , Ben Watson , just torched them for 147 yards and a score .
