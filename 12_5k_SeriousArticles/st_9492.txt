We see similar trends nationally , though with greater nuances . Women vote more often than men , whites more so than minorities , and the wealthy in greater proportion than the disadvantaged . Mark Hugo Lopez , director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center , reports that the number of Hispanic people who could vote is growing far faster than those who do vote . In 2012 , less than 50 percent of eligible Hispanic voters cast a ballot , and in the 2014 midterm elections , the number dropped to 27 percent . Also , Hispanics are concentrated in states such as California , New York , and Texas , where presidential elections have not been heavily contested . This creates even greater opportunity to ignore them as a national constituency .
