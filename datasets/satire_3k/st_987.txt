" Karen and I have so much in common , " said Klein , 37 , of the first woman in five years who agreed to a second date with him . " Neither of us have had a serious relationship since the early ' 90s , we read the same self help books turns out we even gave up the hope of marrying early enough to have children of our own at the exact same time . I ' m so crazy about her , I ' m thinking of asking her to elope to Vegas before everything falls apart and I end up alone again . "
