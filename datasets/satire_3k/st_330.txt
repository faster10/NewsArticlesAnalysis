" A couple years ago , I rented the 1935 screwball comedy A Night At The Opera , considered by many to be their masterwork , " Logan said . " The whole movie , all they were doing was running around like idiots and using funny voices . It was like some annoying Adam Sandler movie . I thought I missed something , so I read about it in the Leonard Maltin video guide , then watched it again , but I still couldn ' t pick up on the ' brilliant subversiveness of this anarchic laugh riot . ' "
