According to McMillan , children can suffer broken bones , head trauma , and even fatal injuries from unsupervised exposure to childlike awe . " If your children are allowed to unlock their imaginations , anything from a backyard swing set to a child ' s own bedroom can be transformed into a dangerous undersea castle or dragon ' s lair , " McMillan said . " But by encouraging your kids to think linearly and literally , and constantly reminding them they can never be anything but human children with no extraordinary characteristics , you can better ensure that they will lead prolonged lives .
