" My fellow Americans , a year ago I was elected to the office of president of the United States , " Obama said . " With that responsibility comes a lot of expectations . A lot of pressure . I inherited a trillion dollar deficit , two wars , a financial system in crisis , and a failing health care industry . I ' ve been trying to piece it all back together , you know ? Trying to be the man everyone elected me to be . The man of this White House . But sometimes sometimes it ' s like I ' m suffocating . "
