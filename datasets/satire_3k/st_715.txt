" I ' d been suspicious for quite some time , " Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said . " There was one time when I was in his office to discuss an amendment to an energy bill . The phone rang , and he went white as a sheet . He answered it , said yes or no a few times , and then said something about how he couldn ' t ' come in ' and how now was not a good time , and then hung up . When I asked him about it , he said it was a wrong number . "
