" The American people had been running on scant grief supplies for a number of weeks , and unfortunately it seems as though yesterday ' s tragedy in Oklahoma City has just about tapped them out , " said noted sociologist Dr Martin Hanlon , who claimed that the nation ' s despair cache was running perilously low even before the arrival of Monday ' s tornado , which has so far displaced thousands of people , destroyed countless homes , and killed several schoolchildren . " We ' re simply at an unsustainable level of grief consumption right now , and unless supplies are somehow replenished in the coming days , I ' m not sure how we ' ll be able to handle the next inevitable heartbreaking tragedy .
