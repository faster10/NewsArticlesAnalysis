" Seeing all these TV and newspaper reports about whatever the current president just did or might do , hearing months and months of speculation about whether some guy ' s gonna run or not it will be the most amazing thing in the world to have a break from all that , " Columbus , OH resident Caroline Helling said . " I would love , absolutely love , to stop hearing a candidate ' s sound bite on loop in the media , then hearing the other side overreacting and denouncing the sound bite , then seeing all the thinkpieces that come out about the overreaction , then having to go through the same shit all over again the next day .
