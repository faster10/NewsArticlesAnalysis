" The Stretch Armstrong doll poses a severe strangulation hazard to children because the limbs of the doll , when extended to full length , can be wrapped around a small child ' s neck , " CPSC commissioner David Arnell said . " I know this for a fact , because when I was a kid , Benji Marchand , who lived next door to me , had one , and we used to stretch it out , like , eight feet and wrap it all around our heads and stuff . God , it was just the best . "
