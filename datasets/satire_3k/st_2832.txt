" It ' s the duty of all artists to expose Judeo Christian brutality through images of Christ engaged in acts of masturbation , rape , and torture , " said Diana Bloom Mutter , curator of New York ' s Rhone Gallery . " When I look at a painting of Christ , it ' s supposed to make me say to the person standing next to me , ' Yes , this is obscene , but do you know what ' s really obscene ? Two thousand years of white , male oppression in the name of God . ' "
