" First off , I ' d like to say ' great job ' to Isaac and Pamela , who put up a heck of a fight and have nothing to be ashamed of , " Banks said . " They were terrific opponents , and it ' s too bad somebody had to lose a life . But the Lord Jesus Christ was truly with me Saturday night . He guided my hand when I was able to make that big hit on Isaac , and I really felt His presence when I stepped up and made that great slashing cut to bring Pamela down from behind . "
