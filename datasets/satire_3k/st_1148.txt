" I want to assure Disney World visitors that these unaffiliated characters are being rounded up as we speak and removed from the Magic Kingdom , Epcot , and Disney ' s Hollywood Studios , " said company spokesperson Wesley Aldridge , noting that patrons may still encounter certain individuals wearing ox costumes , Belgian peasant girl costumes , or any number of other unfamiliar outfits for the time being . " However , before approaching any costumed individual in our park , you should ask yourself whether you recognize this character from an officially licensed product in the Disney or Pixar catalog . If not , please let security know immediately . "
