" Buying sports was the culmination of a childhood dream , but it wasn ' t cheap , " Cuban told the Wall Street Journal yesterday . " I sank almost everything I had into it , brought investors on board , even sold my jet in order to get sports . And while I ' m in charge I intend to rid sports of all the hypocrisy and old boy ' s club garbage and tennis and false sentiment that have been dragging it down it for so long . There ' s no reason I can ' t do that , have a ball , and then sell it a few years down the road at a profit . Maybe to Yahoo ! or someone like that . "
