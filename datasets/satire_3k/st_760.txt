" I was in church , watching all these people hold a candlelight vigil on the day of My crucifixion , when I suddenly felt a profound sense of emptiness , " Christ said . " I got up and walked out , and just sort of wandered aimlessly for a while , wondering what it all meant . Then , I saw something I ' d never noticed before . At the mosque down the street , supplicants were gathering to celebrate their weekly holy day of worship , which , by sheer coincidence , happens to be Friday . "
