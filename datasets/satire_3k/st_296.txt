" I remember the night I won that soda , " Turnbee said . " I was over at the Best Buy looking at TVs , and on the way back , I stopped at that McDonald ' s with the drive thru over on Sherman Avenue . The first red light I got to , I pulled the game piece off the side of my SuperSize Mello Yello . I saw I won , but it was too hard to turn around to get the free drink , so I just put it in my wallet . Besides , the Mello Yello was really big , so I didn ' t really need the free drink all that bad right then . "
