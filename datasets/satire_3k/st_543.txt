Developed at a reported cost of 2 billion , the new towel is the first to feature the Oblitersorb ' moisture punishing system . The advanced system , located deep within the core of the third ply , uses special anti wetness agents to trap moisture inside walled micro chambers . Once trapped , the moisture is violently pummeled into submission by a contracting textile weave lattice grid and then converted to simple molecular form and rereleased into the home ' s atmosphere as inert gases . Strategically placed vent points in the paper towel ' s quilted surface aid in the dispersal of the harmless vapors .
