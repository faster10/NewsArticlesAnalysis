Con : There are people out there who literally want to shoot you dead . Con : We live in a country seriously considering a Newt Gingrich White House . Con : You can help 40 million Americans receive health care , sign legislation that regulates a financial system run amok , give the order to kill Osama bin Laden , help topple Muammar Qaddafi ' s tyrannical regime without losing the life of one American soldier , end the war in Iraq , repeal Don ' t Ask , Don ' t Tell , stave off a second Great Depression , take out more than 30 top al Qaeda leaders , and somehow everyone still calls you the next Jimmy Carter .
