" Now , we all like Freddy everybody in the Senate does , " Sen . Tim Hutchinson ( R AR ) said . " We love the construction paper vases and desk placemats he made all of us , as well as the way he puts all his senator stuff away in the multi colored plastic bins in his office at the end of the day . But does that make him qualified to be a legislator ? Should he be in the position to cast the deciding vote on a key Medicare reform bill ? It ' s just not fair to the American people or to him . "
