" Richie ' s type of extended illness coverage costs this company an extra 22 per employee per month . That adds up . Not only that , but he goes through Cisplatin , Cytarabine , and Dexamethasone like they were going out of style , " said Atco Tool Design general manager Mel Huffinger . " And those drugs are not cheap , that ' s for sure . Richie would have to work here another 45 years without a single major illness for us to break even on him . And we all know that ain ' t gonna happen . "
