Drill foremen have already begun digging shallow exploratory holes through the surface flesh of over 5 million animals to provide workspace for the drillers and their equipment . Once this step is complete , an electrical generator powered by a large diesel engine will plunge rotating carbide steel tipped drill bits through the animal , boring through the skin , bone , or blubber at speeds of up to 6 , 500 rpm . The drillers will then guide the direction of the borehole using top drive rotary steerable wellbores , which allow them to drill through targeted areas in the wildlife with incredible precision .
