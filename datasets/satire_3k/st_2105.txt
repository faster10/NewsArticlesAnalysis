" My favorite girl in school is Courtney Davenport from my Algebra 2 class , " Royce said . " She has these incredible eyes , and she sits across from me so I can always see her legs . When she wears a short skirt , sometimes I can even , just barely , glimpse a tiny triangular section of what my friend ' s sister ' s cousin told my friend is Hanes Her Way girls ' cotton briefs . And when she ' s concentrating , like when we do word problems involving sine curves , she bites on the tip of her pencil eraser ever so lightly , and , oh God , oh God . "
