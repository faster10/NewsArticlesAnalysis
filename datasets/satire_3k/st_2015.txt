When found , the girl was clad in mismatched , threadbare castoffs from Mary Kate and Ashley ' s Wal Mart clothing line . She slept on a heavily tarnished serving tray believed to have been taken from a craft services table on the set of the 2001 straight to video release Holiday In The Sun . Police say she subsisted on rainwater , half eaten bagels salvaged from talk show green rooms , and any small rodents she was able to catch she saved their bones in a corner , along with a pile of coughed up pellets . The girl owned no toys other than a headless Mattel Ashley doll , onto which she had stuck hanks of her own body hair .
