" I ' m sorry , but Lovie Smith let us all down , " said Tony Dungy , the first African American head coach to win a Super Bowl . " I ' m sorry , I love the guy you know Lovie used to work for me but he was totally outcoached out there . He looked lost the other team had him spinning his wheels , looking helpless , unable to cover his weaknesses . It infuriates me that America had to see a black man so totally outmaneuvered in the biggest game of the season . "
