" God ' s prayer response system has been plagued by massive , chronic backlogs , and many prayers have gone unanswered in the process , " said Gene Suozzi , a Phoenix area Wiccan . " With polytheism , you pray to the deity specifically devoted to your concern . If you wish to have children , you pray to the fertility goddess . If you want to do well on an exam , you pray to the god of wisdom , and so on . This decentralization will result in more individualized service and swifter response times . "
