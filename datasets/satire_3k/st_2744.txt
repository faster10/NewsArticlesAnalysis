" There was this one bar called The Depot , where they serve beer in these humongous three foot glasses that are like giant boots , " Greaves continued . " You have to stand back and tilt the thing to drink it all . Our team conducted an experiment to see who could finish one off the fastest . Myself , Dr Milton Laurian and these eight 20 year old test subjects lined up against a wall and started chugging away . After completing the test and subsequently throwing up all over the place , I could only conclude that downing huge ass boot beers is really awesome . "
