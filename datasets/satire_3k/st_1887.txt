" It was just a bit too big for the living room , " Lennek said . " We could ' ve fit around it to eat or drink beer while watching TV , but it would ' ve been a pain to get around if no one was using it . I figured out how I could make this cool pulley system to hoist it up to the ceiling , but then I would ' ve had to put the legs on hinges so I could fold them under . Otherwise , you ' d clock your head when you walked under it . "
