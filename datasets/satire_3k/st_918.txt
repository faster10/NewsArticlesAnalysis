" That ' s what really matters to me . Obviously we ' re not always going to agree on everything in Congress . But something that every single one of us , to a person , can agree on is that when there is important gridlocking to be done , then it ' s time to set aside the hopes and dreams of the American people and focus on what really matters : our own blind self interest .
