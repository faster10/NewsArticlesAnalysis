" Is it any wonder so many Americans have lost faith in government when a high standing elected official like Al Gore doesn ' t even bother to look like he ' s doing something useful ? " D ' Amato said . " I ' ll admit , I ' ve slacked through some pretty uneventful days during my time in Congress . But at least I always made an effort to conceal my inactivity , either by spreading a bunch of official looking papers across my desk or having my computer on . The American people deserve at least that much . "
