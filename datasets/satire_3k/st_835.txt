" Just last week , I needed to get Friday night off for an important state dinner with the Chinese premier , " Clinton said . " And the office policy is , if you want time off , you have to write and date your request in Diane ' s request log at least three weeks in advance . Well , I was in there a full five weeks in advance , okay ? But then Kathleen has to go to her sister ' s baby shower , and suddenly , it ' s like , now I have to work ? I do not believe that is fair , and I do not believe the American people do , either . "
