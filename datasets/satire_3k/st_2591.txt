" My oldest has been coming home from school and going straight to his room , " said Dubuque , IA mother Debra Verhulst , who just last month began allowing her 15 year old son Alex to date . " He sits in there for hours on end , doing God knows what . Sometimes he ' s really hungry , but sometimes he ' s not hungry at all , and when I ask him if he ' s scramping , he just rolls his eyes and tells me he doesn ' t know what I ' m talking about . He never used to talk to me like that . "
