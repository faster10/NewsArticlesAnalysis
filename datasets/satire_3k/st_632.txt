" While there exist many grave threats to America abroad , we suffer still more problems from unemployment to a lack of quality , affordable housing right here at home , " Bush said . " After this resolution is passed , we will begin a 10 year project to clean out our nation ' s landfills and toxic waste sites , transport the materials to Central American jungles , and build low cost housing on the newly cleared land . This would solve the housing shortage , create thousands of construction jobs , and improve our nation ' s environment , all in one fell swoop . "
