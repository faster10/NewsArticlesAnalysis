" Maybe we should try letting a kind , responsible person run things for a change , " Cairo resident Nathifa Bakhoum told reporters . " I , for one , don ' t want to be told what to do by another narcissist who ' s drunk on power and who has absolutely no regard for my well being . It ' s just a thought , but perhaps we could go with a good , decent human next time , or at least someone who ' s not a completely egotistical pile of dogshit . That seems like a good thing to try at least once , right ? Could we even do that ? It ' s probably worth a shot . "
