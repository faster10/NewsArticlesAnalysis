" As we all know , basketball doesn ' t last forever , and at some point you have to think about what ' s next , and that time has come for me , " James said during a press conference at the Heat ' s practice facility this afternoon . " I ' ve done everything I set out to do I won a title , played for two fantastic organizations in the Cavs and the Heat , played for my country , and put myself in the conversation of best players of all time . I had a great career , and I walk away knowing I gave everything to the game . "
