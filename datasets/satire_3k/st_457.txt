" It ' s about time , " Atlanta Braves ace Greg Maddux said . " In fact , it ' s too lenient , if you ask me . When I throw the first pitch right down the middle and some punk like Barry Bonds swings and misses by five feet , I don ' t feel he deserves another chance , much less two . I know what these guys are like , believe me . They never change . They ' re gonna get right back in the batters box and do it all over again and keep wasting the ticketpayers ' money . "
