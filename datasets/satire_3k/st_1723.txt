Hazelwood has hired a round the clock staff of muggers , rapists , and beggars to insure that the crime rate around Le Mons remains at a level at least nine times higher than that of the surrounding community . " I was initially worried that I might turn into a commoner after moving out here and mingling with the lower gentry , " said Le Mons resident E . C . Mauer , " But I knew I ' d be all right when , upon entering the building ' s homeless strewn lobby , I was beaten and robbed by a gruff , ethnic gentlemen . It felt just like home . " Mauer also expressed pleasure at the fact that cab fares to and from Le Mons are ve to eight times more expensive than regular fares .
