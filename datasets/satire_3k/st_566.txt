" It just makes sense , " said Jolene Bunning , author of Capturing Customer Confidence and director of numerous employee training videos , including the award winning Smile And Speak Up ! " Where would you rather shop ? At a store where the employees do the very minimum to keep your business ? Or a dynamic , enthusiastic shopping environment with exciting uniforms and a contagious , friendly team spirit ? By providing employees with colorful , matching uniforms , GrocerKing has found a fun , low cost way to show their workers that they care about them as people . And when you keep your employees happy , you keep your customers happy , too . "
