The scoliosis checks , to be conducted in junior high school gymnasiums across the U . S . , are intended to diagnose and prevent the degenerative condition , which produces an S or C shaped curvature in the spine . During the 30 second procedure , citizens will bend forward roughly 25 degrees while federal health workers look for any abnormal distension , such as a bulging rib or fullness in the lumbar area . If a citizen tests positive for scoliosis , he or she will be fitted for a custom brace designed to halt the progression of the curvature .
