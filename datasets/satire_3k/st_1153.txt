" We provide the rides , games , and entertainment , and you do the rest whether you opt to loudly belittle your spouse on the teacups ride or wait until you ' re in your hotel room later that night to call your 8 year old son an ungrateful little shit , Ordeal Kingdom is perfect for families of all kinds , " said Bartlett , raising his voice over the park ' s theme song , which blares on a continuous loop from loudspeakers throughout the entire property . " Who knows ? Maybe your family will have that special Disney shouting match as soon as you enter the park , right after you shell out 75 bucks for your daughter ' s ticket only to have her scream right in your face that she hates you .
