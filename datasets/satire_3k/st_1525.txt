" The mistake so many women make is thinking they can slather on a layer of cedarwood foam , wait a few minutes , and then start rubbing on some shiny body butter , " said emergency physician Dr Thomas Nguyen , noting that his own girlfriend had a close call last week when she applied more than 80 doses of Jurlique balancing spray , or " pillow mist " as it ' s known in street slang . " The rule of thumb is to use a quarter sized dollop of lotion , wait an hour , then use more if necessary . Oiling up too quickly vastly increases the risk of internal organ failure , or worse . "
