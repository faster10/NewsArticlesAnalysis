Questioned about last week ' s deadly attack by the Taliban in Bamian Province , Allen responded by asking whether that was the bombing at the American military checkpoint or " one of those police station ones , " and then acknowledged he was " probably not the best guy to ask about that sort of thing . " Pressed about tactics , Allen conceded he wasn ' t certain exactly where his forces were currently deployed , but suggested all inquiries be directed toward one of his lieutenants , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , or " the British commander , maybe , " as one of them was probably handling such matters now .
