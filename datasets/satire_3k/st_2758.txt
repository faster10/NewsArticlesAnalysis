To avoid any appearance of suggestive or adult situations , the graphics consist entirely of rectangular polygons rendered in shades of brown against a simulated gray cinderblock wall . The game is free roaming inside the warehouse environment , meaning that no goals are set for stacking a certain number of boxes , nor is there a time limit for the stacking . The health level bar remains at a constant peak , and the first person perspective avoids the problem of players identifying too closely with the main character , whose name is never specified and to whom nothing actually happens .
