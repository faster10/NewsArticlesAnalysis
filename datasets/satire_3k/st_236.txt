The road to the Supreme Court for Wright v . Dreckman has been lengthy , convoluted , and filled with more than its share of tumult . After the 2005 Shea ruling , the case was appealed to the U . S . District Court of the state of New York , where the decision was reversed in favor of Wright . However , when it was revealed that the presiding judge was a lifelong Mets fan , the decision was thrown out and the case was again argued in front of the New York State Court of Appeals . That court , citing the 1994 case Bonds v . Davidson , sided with Dreckman .
