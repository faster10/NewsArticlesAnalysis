" Before NOPW , tolerance of imperfection was seriously lowering standards of prettiness across the country , " Peters said . " So , in 1985 , NOPW began visiting schools , teaching pretty girls to bring out the best in themselves by first recognizing their ' self center , ' then esteeming their own interests above those of others and , finally , learning such valuable skills as how to destroy a vulnerable young person ' s ego with a single remark . Today , there isn ' t a single girl who hasn ' t felt the effects of our work . "
