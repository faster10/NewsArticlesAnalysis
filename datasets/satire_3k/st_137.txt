" I have to be on top of my game every single day , because if I start slipping up , it ' s only a matter of time before they put me in a home , " said Powell , who explained that she keeps her calendar by her side whenever she speaks on the phone with family members so she can recall without hesitation the date and time of any upcoming appointment , social event , or anniversary when it ' s brought up . " I make sure I place my keys in the exact same spot 100 percent of the time . And I always speak at a steady , even pace too fast and I might trip over a word , too slow and they might think I ' m struggling to come up with the right words . "
