" I ' d always meant to buy more jazz , but every time I went record shopping , there ' d be something I wanted more , " Bergkamp said . " Finally , after seeing the thing on PBS , I decided to commit to getting some . I went down to Tower Records to get a Miles Davis CD , but there were , like , dozens of them , not to mention all these 40 disc Complete Live At The Plugged Nickel 1965 box sets or whatever . I ended up buying an Ornette Coleman CD , since I knew he ' s supposed to be pretty important , but that ended up being a total mistake . So a few days later , I went back for the Burns box . "
