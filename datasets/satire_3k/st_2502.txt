" I wanted to get the first Modern Lovers album , but I didn ' t want her to know I didn ' t already own it , " said Jody Osbourne of San Diego . " To cover up , I told her some big , long story about how my friend is such a jerk because he borrowed it a long time ago and never gave it back . When I was done with this four minute spiel , she just said , ' I hate Jonathan Richman . ' I wanted to curl up in a ball and die . "
