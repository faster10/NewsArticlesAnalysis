In the wake of the incident , Flynt held a special prayer service Tuesday at his Los Angeles area mansion . " And now , let us lower our heads in silent prayer , " Flynt , hands folded , told the assembled crowd . " Sweet Jesus in heaven , hallelujah . Praised be our Savior on high . Christ , we beseech you in Your Father ' s name , save us all , in Your mercy , from me , Larry Flynt , a sick , disgusting , crippled , drug addled , perverted , fat , shit covered pig of a man who would just as soon vomit in Your Most Holy face as listen to this sanctimonious , hypocritical bullshit a minute longer . Holy shit , there I go again , Lord ! "
