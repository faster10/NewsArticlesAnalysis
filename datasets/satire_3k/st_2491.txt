" Times are tough , what with the market crash and all , so it ' s really nice that for a little while you don ' t have to think about how hard it is to find factory work , " said Karen Dreisel , a Miami native . " And since so many of us haven ' t seen our sons since they left on the troop train to go off to war , it ' s nice they had a tribute to our boys in uniform overseas . Oh , and to the gals who are helping out over there , too , of course . "
