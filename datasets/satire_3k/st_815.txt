" I very much would have liked to attend the concert , particularly considering how much it meant to the members of Spacegoat . Unfortunately , a pressing foreign crisis prevented me from doing so , " Clinton said . " I have always been a strong supporter of the many fine musical artists in the Washington , DC , area and will continue to support them in the future . " Clinton said he was pleased to hear that nearly 150 people were at the concert , one of the biggest turnouts for a show at The Crowbar this year . He also pledged to " try his best " to make it to the next 50 Watt showcase .
