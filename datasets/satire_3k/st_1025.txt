Mommy , who said that Ryan and Rebecca could have pizza for lunch today because they ' re so special and then started crying like the time Rebecca skinned her knee , was not able to explain how long Daddy is going to have to live inside the ground . She also said she was not sure if the bye bye box has a night light for when it gets dark , whether there ' s books inside the bye bye box for when Daddy gets bored , or why Daddy was wearing a suit in the bye bye box if he wasn ' t going to work .
