" I ' m always mixing it up , " Haley said . " In my opinion , the other guys here cling to their niche too much . Like , Scott Schefter always plays a lot of psychobilly , and Tim Arbus plays a ton of emo . But with me , you never know what you ' re gonna get . I might play something like the new Sigur R s , then turn around and play something off the new Oxes record . Or maybe even Lovecup ' s ' Hi Pazoo , ' which is one of the best songs from the mid ' 90s Champaign scene . I challenge my audience , and that ' s why people respond to my show . My success should prove to other radio stations that people don ' t want to be spoon fed their music . "
