" I ' ve certainly had enough basketball in the last two weeks to last me a while , " said Cleveland fan Andrew Rappman , a regular at the Cav Shack , a Cleveland area sports bar . " It was really a great season the Cavs only lost two games , and to see Zydrunas Ilgauskas named as Finals MVP was bittersweet , since he probably would ' ve really had a great Finals if they ' d played , and because I ' m not sure he ' ll be back . Or me , either , actually , because I ' m taking a break from hoops until March Madness starts . "
