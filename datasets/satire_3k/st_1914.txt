The difficult role of prosecuting the Son of God has been assigned to County Prosecutor Sam Edlerbet . Outside his downtown office , a mob of 60 , 000 Christian protesters has backed up traffic for an eight mile radius . Brandishing placards that read , " He died for you too , Christ Jailer , " " Edlerbet , spawn of Satan , " and " Iscariot , Pilate , Edlerbet Burn ! Burn ! Burn ! " the protesters create a constant roar of vitriol not unlike a raging hailstorm that permeates the walls and cubicles of every office building in the city .
