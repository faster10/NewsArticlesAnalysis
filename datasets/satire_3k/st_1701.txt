There ' s no better way to completely change the nature of an election in a jiffy than to do something new with your hair . A new hairstyle will put your opponent on the defensive immediately . I mean , why didn ' t the other candidate change her hair ? Does she not care about her hair ? Is she old and out of touch ? These are the things people will think . Make sure you go to a big city salon though , like the one they have in Kansas City , because NOTHING will sink an election faster than a botched haircut .
