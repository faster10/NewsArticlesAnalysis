" Over the years , McDonald ' s has successfully introduced a number of new characters whose defining characteristic is a certain measure of comical , criminal intent , " said Andrew Perlich , McDonald ' s vice president of promotions . " Such shady characters as The Hamburglar , The Goblins , and the bloodthirsty pirate Captain Crook have all fit nicely into the McDonald ' s advertising universe . We had every reason to believe that the Hammurderer , with his long rap sheet of burger related crimes and his signature cry of ' Stabble Stabble Stabble , ' would take his place in this proud lineage of McDonaldland mischief makers .
