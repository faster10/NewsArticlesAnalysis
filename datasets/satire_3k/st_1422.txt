" We started Shining Star with one simple but vital goal in mind : to provide our mentally challenged actors , actresses , musicians , and television personalities with the assistance they so desperately need , " Davis said to the gala ' s 250 attendees . " We get up every day aiming to make a difference in their lives , even if it ' s something as small as driving them to Santa Monica and helping them buy designer clothes , or taking them out for some exercise with a personal trainer . We ' re there for them . "
