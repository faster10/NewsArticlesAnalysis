Kempner faced his first setback in mid November , when he brought his friend Matt into Creamy Pete ' s . " I thought I could buy a yogurt for myself and one for Matt and get credit for two yogurts , " Kempner said . " Matt didn ' t have a card , so he said I could have his punch . But the girl behind the counter pointed to the rules on the back of the card , which clearly state that credit can only be given for frozen yogurt items consumed by the card ' s bearer . Then I asked her if I could get an extra punch if I ate a little bit of Matt ' s yogurt before he ate it , but she said no . "
