The nonprofit , Schmucks For Schmuck , has compiled schmuck related data from the past 80 years and conducted its own independent research on contemporary " schmuck " usage . According to Brooks , the statistics are frightening : Utterances of the word " schmuck " have declined every year since its peak in 1951 , and in 2006 , the word was spoken a mere 28 times 17 of these times by Brooks himself . The study indicates that today , when faced with a situation in which one can use a targeted or self deprecating insult to convey a general feeling of disgust , people are 50 times more likely to use the word " jerk " than " schmuck , " 100 times more likely to use " dick , " and 15 , 000 times more likely to use " asshole .
