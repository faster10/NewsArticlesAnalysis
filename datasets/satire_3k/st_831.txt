U . S . Defense Secretary William Perry , along with other top Pentagon officials , have been working closely with Clinton to devise a rescue plan . While the plan ' s details remain strictly confidential , an anonymous Pentagon source confirmed that Clinton will use a grappling hook fashioned from a nearby machine part and some rope found outside the terrorists ' warehouse hideout to climb up the side of the lair . He will then rappel through a broken skylight into the warehouse , silently killing each terrorist in turn , then grabbing the girl and running out of the warehouse just seconds before it explodes into a spectacular ball of flames .
