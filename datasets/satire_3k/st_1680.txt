Hawaii got off to a quick start , scoring six runs in the first and taking full advantage of Mexico ' s sloppy defense . Third baseman Chico ( Skill 1 ) had a particularly rough day in the field , committing six errors and several mental miscues . In the fourth inning , Chico slid head first eight times in an attempt to catch a foul pop up before letting it fall to the ground , and later ran directly past a ground ball in the hole while on his way to inexplicably cover second base . On three occasions , he fielded a routine grounder and accidentally threw it to home plate instead of first base . Chico later claimed that he " didn ' t know how " to throw to first .
