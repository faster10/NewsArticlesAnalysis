" At this time , we are able to confirm that Ri Sol ju did , in fact , manage to board the Unha 3 mere seconds before it propelled off the ground , " said Defense Department spokesman John Kirby , noting that Ri " quickly evaded her handlers to jump aboard the 100 kilogram missile " in a frantic , yet successful , attempt to abandon her life in the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea . " When we found Ri this morning , she was floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean clinging to the remnants of the missile . "
