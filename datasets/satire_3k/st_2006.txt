The car is also needed to transport Dale and Sheila to their respective jobs , as well as to get Dale to his monthly meeting with his parole officer . Sheila described a typical day : " At around 8 a . m . , I drop Jesse off at Kidcare , then I take Naomi over to one of my friends , usually Bobbie or Angie , because Kidcare won ' t take Naomi until she ' s 2 . Then I wake up Dale , and he drops me off at my waitressing job at the Toot Toot Steak House , then he heads off to the screen door factory for second shift . "
