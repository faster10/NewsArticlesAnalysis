" The fact is , there ' s little a human legislator does that a machine can ' t handle , " Barnes said . " All you have to do is program the machine as either Democrat or Republican , and it ' ll vote along the exact same party lines as a real lawmaker . We know exactly how Ted Kennedy or Orrin Hatch will vote on , say , banning flag burning , so there ' s really no reason to keep them around when a machine can do it for a fraction of the cost . "
