" Sure , we could try to develop other energy sources , but we have no way of knowing if they would sustain us in the long run , " Global Tetrahedron CEO Hank Blakeley said . " Yes , solar energy looks good on paper , but how do we know the sun will continue to shine at its present rate ? Much of the sun remains unexplored , and our information about it is sketchy at best . Our sun could dim drastically over time , or even wink out entirely tomorrow , for all we know . Only by ensuring the continued transformation of our nation ' s ecosystems into subterranean strata of raw , non renewable chemical fuels can we ensure a future for our children and our planet . "
