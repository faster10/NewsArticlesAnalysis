" When voters head to the polls on Nov . 4 , they should understand that a vote for me is not a vote for the United States , " said Sen . Mary Landrieu ( D LA ) , responding to repeated accusations from her opponent that she was once close with the country .

These are desperate , baseless claims that seek to earn cheap political points with voters by portraying me as an advocate for America , which I am not . "
