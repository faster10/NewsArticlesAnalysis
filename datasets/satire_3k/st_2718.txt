" It is not unusual for the parents of a new baby to feel terrible isolation , as the demands of parenting force them to spend less and less time with friends , " said noted family therapist Dr Eli Wasserbaum . " Yet it is possible to cope with these changes . All the Hubers need is to find someone pretty much anyone with a pulse , really they can spend a little time with away from the baby , yet with whom they can talk about nothing but the baby for hours on end , without making the other person feel like tearing his or her hair out and screaming . That ' s all . "
