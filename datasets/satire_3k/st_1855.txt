" I deemed the motorist bone stick stone stupid for several reasons , " Lawrence said . " First , no motorist should ever attempt to outrun an oncoming train . Second , no motorist should ever place an ashtray containing two lit cigarettes on top of a car seat drenched in 190 proof Everclear , as the scorch marks on the deceased ' s crotch will attest . Finally , and this is the real mind blower , the accident occurred at a spot where the train tracks pass over the highway on their own bridge . Apparently , the numbnuts panicked when he saw the train approaching , veered off just before entering the underpass , and sent his truck into the bridge abutment . So even though ' stupid ' barely begins to cover it , let ' s decide that it ' s an adequate description of the cause of death and leave it at that . "
