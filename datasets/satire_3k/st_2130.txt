" Those account for about half the times the voices call me idiot on my headphones , and those are the worst , " said Smith , adding that while he would like to ignore the voices , circumstances have made it difficult to do so . " It ' s tough , because usually when they ' re calling me that , something really bad has happened and I ' m trying to figure out what to do next , and being called an idiot doesn ' t help at all , especially when it happens like 10 or 12 times a game .
