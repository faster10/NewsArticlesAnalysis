" Tom got so down last winter , he started taking heavy doses of antidepressants , " Reynolds said . " I was really worried about him , but he recently told me he ' s gotten so much better , he no longer needs artificial substances to be happy . He says he ' s off the pills and high on life . What a great new attitude . It ' s hard to believe there was a time when he was so bummed out , he didn ' t eat any solid food other than Doritos for a month . "
