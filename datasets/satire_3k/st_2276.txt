Boyce , who joined the McDonald ' s team in November 1998 , has all but admitted that his reasons for accepting the position were greed based . After returning home more than an hour late last Tuesday from a mandatory " Improving Customer Service " training session , Boyce allegedly told his girlfriend that he just wants to " punch in , do my job and punch out . " Several days later , he intimated to fellow cashier Amani Green that " if I win the lottery , I ' m never setting foot in another McDonald ' s for the rest of my life . "
