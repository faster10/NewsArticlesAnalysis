" I mean , how boring can you get ? " said Clovis ( NM ) High School junior Richard Booth , who made a special trip to the mall to buy a copy of John Knowles ' A Separate Peace upon discovering that his school had banned the novel for " inappropriate language , graphic violence , and representation of non traditional values . " " The swears weren ' t that great , and the violence was just a guy breaking his leg . I thought maybe the non traditional values thing meant that maybe the guys in the dorm were , like , doing each other up the ass , but all they did was talk , talk , talk . "
