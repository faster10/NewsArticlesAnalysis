" I ' m somewhat out of my depth here , " said Bush , a longtime Fermilab follower who describes himself as " something of an armchair physicist . " " But it seems to me that , when reducing the perturbative uncertainty in the determination of Vub from semileptonic Beta decays , one must calculate the rate of Beta events with a standard dilepton invariant mass at a subleading order in the hybrid expansion . The Fermilab folks ' error , as I see it , was omitting that easily overlooked mathematical transformation and , therefore , acquiring incorrectly re summed logarithmic corrections for the b quark mass . Obviously , such a miscalculation will result in a precision of less than 25 percent in predicting the resulting path of the tau lepton once the value for any given decaying tau neutrino is determined .
