" We needed a new face for the franchise back in 2002 , but our roster was pretty thin , " Ricciardi said . " So we included a clause in our pitchers ' contracts that said anytime they posted a decent start it ' d be attributed to a ' Roy Halladay . ' Then after the game , we ' d say , ' There ' s a Halladay start , ' or , ' Good old Roy , at it again . ' At the end of the season , we said he ' d won 19 games , and scouts were asking about him all over the place . It wasn ' t really too difficult adding him to the roster , since we haven ' t had any press covering the team in 15 years . "
