As for 3rd ' s scent , Chanel wanted something " clean , youthful , and beguiling , " said Chanel chemist Robert Geneau , adding that organically musky , smoky , and earthy tones had been rejected because the scent ' s intended users most likely had too much musk , earth , and smoke in their lives already . " 3rd has a bright , grassy base , like a fresh breeze after a rain a very exotic scent for our target customer . There are also notes of cocoa , citrus , spices , and other things our customer sometimes raises and harvests for foreign export , but rarely gets to savor herself . Captivating , and for a fraction of the cost of high end scents available in the West , 3rd is just the economic miracle developing nations need . "
