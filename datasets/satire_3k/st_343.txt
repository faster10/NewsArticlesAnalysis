" I said to him not two days ago , ' Don , don ' t you dare bring home any more ketchup , because it ' s practically coming out of our ears , ' " Shelly Turnbee said . " So what does he do ? He buys more ketchup ! He said the bottle in the fridge was almost empty . Well , of course it was almost empty : There was no need to replace it , since we had half a million ketchup packets overflowing our pantry . And we couldn ' t return the new bottle , either , because he ' d already opened it . "
