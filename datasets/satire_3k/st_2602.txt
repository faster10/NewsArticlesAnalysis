According to a CBS News New York Times poll , Seaver is not alone . Of the nearly 600 undecided assassins who responded to the poll , 37 percent said they strongly favor either Sen . Hilary Clinton ( D NY ) or Sen . Barack Obama ( D IL ) to win . Nearly 22 percent reported that Sen . John McCain ( R AZ ) would be an excellent choice based on such key factors as his immobility , his inability to raise his arms above his head to shield his face , and his stance on campaign finance reform . The remaining 40 percent responded that , due to growing disillusionment with the voting system and unsatisfying platforms from all the frontrunners , they would be happy to shoot any one of the candidates through the chest and throat from an abandoned factory .
