According to Latimer , the confined growing facilities are designed to restrict nearly all of the plants ' heliotropic movement and suppress their natural phytochrome production , which ensures that most of their available energy is dedicated to increasing their lipid to protein ratio , giving the beans the succulent , juicy texture of conventional beef or poultry . As a side effect , the soy ' s stems are reportedly too weak to support the weight of their growing beans and the plants eventually collapse on themselves , which Latimer cites as a further indication that his company ' s products are the most authentically meat like on the market .
