" My loyal subjects , " said Clinton , speaking from his great White House atop a shining hill , " once upon a time , the Kingdom was beset with great dangers , and the Bear ran amok on Wall Street , and the men from the Red Land menaced us with their great rockets , and everyone was much afraid . But , henceforth , I decree that all Americans will be happy and live in comfy houses filled with plenty of good things to eat , and all mommies and daddies will be kind and all children good , and the Wizard Greenspan shall set loose the great Bull , and we shall all live happily forever and ever . "
