Many citizens of New York awoke at dawn , prepared to do their CHRISTIAN DUTY of toiling for the cause of the betterment of their livestock , only to find that they had for the second time in a month been stripped of their precious Stock of Hay by ill tempered men , causing much Consternation and Confoundment .
