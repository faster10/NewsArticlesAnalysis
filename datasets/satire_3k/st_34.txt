" Whenever a weird , nobby toothbrush or a ridiculously complicated toothpaste comes out , Mark buys it , " Combes said . " He was really into this ' liquid calcium ' Enamelon for a while . Before that , it was Mentadent you know , the toothpaste with the ' unique dual chamber pump . ' But then he got tired of buying the big , stupid refill cartridges . He went through an extreme toothpaste phase for a while . But lately , since they opened the Whole Foods near his apartment , he ' s been on an organic , all natural kick . Hence the fennel stuff , the taste of which I ' m guessing he ' ll hate . "
