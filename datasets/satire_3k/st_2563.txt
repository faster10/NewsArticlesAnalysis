" Certainly , if you were to see me being raped , I would want you to call the police I ' m a 10 year old boy who couldn ' t possibly give my consent , or even fully grasp the horror of what was happening to me , " Sioux Falls , SD resident Nick Kealey , 10 , said between games of Mario Kart DS . " What ' s really at issue here is the act of rape itself . So , yes , if you see a 10 year old boy like me being raped , by all means , call the police . But don ' t just walk on by if you see , say , a teenage girl being raped in a locker room , or even a full grown man being raped in an alleyway . These are also situations in which you should definitely call the police , and right away . "
