" I ' m still pretty new and don ' t know many people , but Mike really went out of his way to welcome me here , " Bennett said of the consistently marginalized man whose meager contributions to the company are not at all valued by any of his 60 coworkers . " He ' s been so great . He showed me around the office and always encourages me to come to him if I ever need anything . Other people are really wrapped up in their work and don ' t pay me much attention , but Mike always seems to make time to stop by and talk to me in the mornings . "
