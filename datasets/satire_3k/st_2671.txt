Anatomical evidence from the 6 million year old fossilized remains of Sahelanthropus peina which was unearthed earlier this year in South Africa and is now believed to be the last common ancestor shared by chimpanzees and modern humans suggests that the animal frequently descended from the jungle canopy to retrieve delicious morsels that it fumbled from its pudgy hands due to inattention , overeager eating , or a loosening grasp as it dozed off after a meal . According to scientists , it was this snack retrieval instinct that gradually shaped the tree dwelling hominid into the modern terrestrial Homo sapiens .
