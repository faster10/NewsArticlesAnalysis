" Join me in saluting Brett Favre for breaking the all time interception record of 277 set by George Blanda truly a milestone for the ages , " Marino intoned during the opening montage , which featured Favre throwing some of his most memorable picks . " Some say records were made to be broken personally , I ' ve never believed that but in any case the career interception mark was believed to be unreachable . It takes a player with an unusual combination of not knowing when to retire , not knowing when to stop trying to rack up the completions , and not knowing when to stop trying to throw touchdowns . And it seems that lucky player is everyone ' s big hero quarterback , Brett Favre . "
