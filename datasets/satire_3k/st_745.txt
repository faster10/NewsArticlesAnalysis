Chinese toy manufacturers are reportedly complying with the government ' s wishes . According to the Xinhua News Agency , in the past three days alone , factory owners roused an estimated 365 , 000 Barbie dolls from their dream homes in a violent series of raids . During these raids , the Barbies were separated from their Kens , were stripped naked , and had their heads shaved . They were then taken to an undisclosed area , leaned against a wall because they were incapable of standing under their own power , and shot by a firing squad as toy soldiers were forced to watch .
