While Monday ' s ASCAP announcement stunned rappers across the U . S . , signs of the impending crisis were present years ago . In 1989 , James Brown became the first sample source to be exhausted , when the Jungle Brothers used a snippet of Brown sneezing during an outtake for " The Big Payback " on its album Done By The Forces Of Nature . By 1992 , the music of numerous other high profile artists was exhausted , including George Clinton , Rick James , Kool The Gang , Prince and Queen . By 1995 , nearly 80 percent of ASCAP registered artists were tapped out as sample sources , including Roxette , Peaches Herb , Bruce Hornsby , White Lion and Jon Secada .
