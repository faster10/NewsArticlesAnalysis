" Tuesday ' s loss was a prime example of the kind of baseball this team is capable of playing on a regular basis , " Baker said of the game in which the Cubs managed to score only two runs while leaving 15 men on base and allowing six home runs . " The key is that this was a balanced attack against us . Any team can allow a big inning as we did in the five run sixth that featured a grand slam but the Reds also scored a run in each of the first four frames . If we can consistently take that kind of well rounded beating and if any team can do it , it ' s us I truly think we can lose 90 games . "
