The Wednesday last , I was engaged as I oft am in the simple Pastime of taking a Bull Whip to the Back Side of my Slave ROBERT , whom I had caught in the Act of looking at a Bible as though the Arrangement of Words and Letters in it were familiar to his Mind , when against the Oddes of an overwhelming variety , as such a Thing has never happened , and it caused great MIRTH when it did happen , the Tail of the Whip snapped off and took Flight after the thirteenth Lash and in doing so put out the EYEBALL of an other of my Slaves , DAVID , whom I had also suspected of being in secret able to Read . I am quite certain he will not be putting his Eye to the Bible any longer , as he is now BLIND .
