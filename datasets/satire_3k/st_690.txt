" To all my longtime constituents , " Thurmond continued , " I want to stress that this sexual episode was neither planned nor expected . I was heading home from my senate office after working late on a revised defense budget , when I was approached by a tall , handsome man who asked if he could buy me a drink . We had a wonderful conversation about old Judy Garland movies , the sort I used to love back when I was in my mid 70s . Before I knew it , Stan was asking me back to his place to see his house plants . He had incredible blue eyes , the kind that no legislator liberal or conservative could resist . "
