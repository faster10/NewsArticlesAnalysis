" I really wouldn ' t want to force it , " Hazell said . " I ' ve never been to Hollywood , and she ' s probably not in Pittsburgh much . But who knows ? Maybe she ' ll be on location shooting something here . A bunch of movies have been shot here , like Wonder Boys and that Bruce Willis movie Striking Distance , so crazier things have happened . Or maybe I ' ll run into her in an airport somewhere . The bottom line is , you can ' t artificially manufacture these things . When it happens , it happens . And it ' ll be great . "
