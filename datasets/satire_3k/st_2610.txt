" We believe that as long as you change your sheets once or twice a decade you ' ll be fine , " said 27 year old Delaware man Jeff Kugler , who doesn ' t have a girlfriend , and later added that he ' s heard of how dust mites , mite excrement , and bacteria can build up if sheets aren ' t laundered but said all of that is " bullshit . " " My sheets have a few stains on them , but they ' re all dried now . You can ' t see them unless you are really looking for them . The outlines of the stains are there , but that ' s it . So everything will be okay for the next six years or so . "
