" The end of dinner was the toughest stretch , " Kowalski said . " He assumed we would be splitting the check which I accepted by noting it is actually pretty common these days before leaving the waiter a 10 percent tip , so I had to give him the benefit of the doubt on that and trust that he simply miscalculated . And then , as we were leaving , he started typing on his phone while I was talking to him , so I had to assume he had just gotten an important work email , which seemed plausible until I remembered that a few minutes earlier I had gotten over the fact that he only works part time by reminding myself that he probably doesn ' t want to put his full effort into a job he doesn ' t consider a long term career . The whole thing got pretty exhausting . "
