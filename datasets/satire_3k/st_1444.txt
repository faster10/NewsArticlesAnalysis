" Remember , under the oppressive Taliban regime , people live in constant fear of an oppressive order to which all must submit , " Rumsfeld said . " Under their system , it is illegal to practice a different religion or support a different political system . It is against the law for women to work or leave their homes without their faces covered . There is no freedom of speech , press , or assembly , as dissent of any kind is not tolerated . It is even forbidden to smile or laugh in public , and all who fail to unquestioningly obey are punished with reprisals of brutal violence . We must not allow such a regime to threaten our great democracy . We must stand for something better than that . "
