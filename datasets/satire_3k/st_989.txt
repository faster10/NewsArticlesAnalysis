" In my day , the Earth itself would move from the titanic force of my late husband Salvatore and I making with the romance in the midnight hours , " DiPaoli told reporters . " I would sing out in joy like an opera singer , with long sustained fortissimo arias . I was known as far away as Flatbush Avenue for the crescendos of passion I set forth on those breathless nights . Then my Sal , God rest his soul , would suddenly switch the tempo doppio movimento , and my heart would swell with joy . And those afternoon intermezzos , when he ' d sneak back from the warehouse and call out ' Mi amor ! ' with his hands full of flowers and his smile full of love , oh , that I will never forget . . .
