" It ' d be so cool to get to get my glove signed by a power hitter who can , I don ' t know , get more than 30 home runs during the regular season , " said Kelvin , who has been in the hospital for the last 11 months receiving aggressive chemotherapy treatments on a weekly basis . " I think if I could meet a player like that , it ' d really lift my spirits and take my mind off of all this medical stuff . But there isn ' t really anyone who can do that on the Astros right now , so I ' m just going to try to get by for a little while longer . "
