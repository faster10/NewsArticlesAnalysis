" Head bonk induced amnesia in which victims lose recollection of their identity after suffering sharp , zany blows to the cranial cavity with such household items as ladders , paint buckets , anvils and oversized novelty mallets has long baffled science , " Yates said . " Our research now indicates that this condition , long considered incurable , may possibly be reversed with the application of a second head bonk of equal or greater severity . It is our hope that millions of amnesiacs across the U . S . will one day have their memories of themselves and loved ones restored through such revolutionary , nutty treatment . "
