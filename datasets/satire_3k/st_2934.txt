" Well , of course I ' m sad we lost , but since we ' re still the No . 2 team in the country , it ' s hard to feel all that bad about it , " said Michigan quarterback Chad Henne , who finished with 21 completions on 35 attempts and two touchdowns . " And I ' ve still never beaten Ohio State , so that ' s too bad . But hey , apparently losing doesn ' t hurt Michigan in the rankings , so I guess I get to try again in the national championship game . See you then ! "
