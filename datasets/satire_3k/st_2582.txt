" Every day , my friends send me e mails exposing Bush ' s corrupt environmental policies , " said Flauman , a member of both the Green Party and the Sierra Club . " I used to spend close to an hour following all the links , and I ' d be shocked and outraged by the irreversible damage being done to our land . At some point , though , I got annoyed with the demanding tone of the e mails . The Clear Skies Initiative is bogus , but I ' m not going to forward a six page e mail to all my friends especially one written by a man who signs his name ' Leaf . ' Now , if a message ' s subject line contains the word ' Bush , ' it goes straight into the trash . "
