" Greater pain than ever is on the way , " said Erno Broussard , Department of Agony and Suffering spokesperson . " Say , for example , you accidentally step on a thumbtack . In the past , that would have hurt enough to make you hop around the room smarting for several seconds , swearing at the top of your lungs . But under the new , higher pain levels , such an injury will result in a white hot , blinding sensation of explosive force ripping through your entire body for several hours , as if you were being slowly shredded alive by the multiple razor arms of murderous , cybernetic death drones .
