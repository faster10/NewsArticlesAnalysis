" I have to say , it feels pretty good to have gone a while without seeing any TV news reports from a backyard crime scene where police are digging up half eaten corpses , " said New Ulm , MN resident Ethan Rhodus , who along with many other Americans confirmed he hasn ' t read a headline or watched a news magazine program ' s investigation about anything like that lately . " Sure , there ' s a lot of bad stuff happening everywhere , but nothing that specifically centers on some guy who lures people into his home , kills them , expertly butchers their remains , and then eats them . So that ' s been nice . "
