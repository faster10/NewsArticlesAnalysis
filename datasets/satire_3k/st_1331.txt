" Kobe ' s been the light of my world for 13 years now , but as amazing as it is to be married to him , it ' s always difficult when he leaves for games and road trips , " said Vanessa , who emphasized that she cherishes " every waking moment " spent with her husband . " But now , and for the foreseeable future , Kobe ' s going to be the first thing I see when I get up in the morning and the last thing I see when I go to bed . He ' s going to be a constant presence in our home , and I ' ll be there with him every step of the way , on call to meet his every need , every single day , for nine magical months . "
