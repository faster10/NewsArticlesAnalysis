" If a student is installing a crown , and feels midway through as though he or she would benefit more from , say , seeing where a tooth implant might lead , they can do that here , " said Montessori professor Donald Scheneke , who told reporters that he sees the dentist office as a place for exploration and expression , not rules . " In here , there ' s no such thing as ' absentmindedly drilling through to the lower gum ' or ' mistakenly pulling out the wrong maxillary lateral incisor . ' I can ' t tell you the number of times I ' ve seen people give up on the entire dentistry profession just because they were terrible at filling cavities . "
