" When a sound bite is going to be a fifth of a second , you have to be much more careful with what you say , " said Gerald Conroy , press adviser to Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards . " We can ' t have our candidate say ' Not only do illegal guns kill people in the inner cities faster than anything else , but more young blacks die of gunshot wounds than any other group , ' because the news will cut it to ' kill people ' or ' blacks die . ' That half second quote is what the audience remembers , not your five second explanation . "
