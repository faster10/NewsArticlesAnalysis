" The first couple days were really exciting , " Bush said . " I was having all sorts of cool strategy meetings with these high level military men I don ' t usually talk to , and it all felt very historic . But now , it ' s gotten to be kind of a monotonous grind . It ' s always , ' The line has advanced this much . ' ' We need to wait for backup here . ' ' We ' re making good progress , but it ' s been complicated by blah blah blah . ' It ' s all these tedious , same sounding details . Can I hear something new for a change , like ' They surrender , ' or ' Saddam ' s dead ' ? Something anything but more stupid reports of sandstorms . "
