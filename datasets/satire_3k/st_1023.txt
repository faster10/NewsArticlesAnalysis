" I honestly didn ' t see why it was necessary , " Cheryl said . " I could understand maybe one bag , just to try it , but why buy so many untested brands of cereal ? And in the end , I don ' t think we really saved all that much money . It was double coupon day at Sav A Lot , and if he ' d just used the coupons I ' d given him , he would ' ve spent , total , maybe 2 more than he did for the cheap stuff . I think we can survive that . "
