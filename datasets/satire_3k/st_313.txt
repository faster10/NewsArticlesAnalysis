" I usually just like to sit in a chair and maybe flip through a magazine while Vic or one of the other fellas cuts my hair , " Easler said . " But this Gina gal , she had a question every step of the way . Did I want guava essence shampoo or wildflower with extract ? Would I like to see a list of microdermabrasion scalp exfoliators ? Did I want vitamin E and a sea algae moisturizing spritz ? So I say to her , ' Look , if you want to maybe shave the back of my neck , that would be fine . ' "
