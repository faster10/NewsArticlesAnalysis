" Something that always gives me a chuckle is going to my computer and loading up Bobby McFerrin ' s ' Don ' t Worry , Be Happy , ' " said Mendic , who often watches the four minute music video clip several times in a row , staring intently at the screen and silently mouthing the lyrics in one of the saddest displays you will ever see . " It ' s funny , it ' s catchy , and it really helps remind you not to take this crazy business called life too seriously . I remember it used to cheer me up back when I was in college too . Good times . "
