" In 1914 , the hoagie was still a rather obscure and a not so giant sandwich , " said Madden , adding that the unique way of slicing the Italian bread was as much a part of the lore as the massive stacks of cold cuts and cheese . " The poor Hog Island dockworkers in Philly , nicknamed the ' Hoggies , ' found that their favorite tasty fillings would fall out of the sandwiches as they ate them . But by only slicing the bread most of the way through , thereby leaving a hinge , they were able to keep all the good parts , and cram it with three times as much meat and cheese . "
