" In our efforts to trace the underlying origins of the Middle East conflict , we found that the brutal hostilities started almost 4 billion years earlier than we previously thought , " said lead researcher Anthony Jackson , who added that the conflict could now be linked back to savage guerrilla attacks launched by the first single celled organisms to emerge in what would later be known as Jordan . " Eons before there were Israelis or Palestinians in the region or anyone else , for that matter fighting broke out at the microbial level , with the unusually fierce clashes soon spreading into what is now Iraq , Iran , the Arabian Peninsula , Egypt , and Turkey . Of course , it was just a barren , featureless landscape covered by a prehistoric sea at that point , but nevertheless , unrest was highly concentrated in this area . "
