" There are 14 , 000 homeless people in D . C . alone , but there ' s never been a retail business that catered to their unique needs , " store manager Geoff Alberts said . " Homeless Depot is a one stop spot for cardboard building supplies , used carpet scraps , filthy woolen blankets , and flattened garbage can lids . We also sell coffee cups , cigarette butts , soiled clothing , expired coupons , June 2001 People magazines , and half empty containers of Dippity Do hairstyling gel . Best of all , we have really nice , big , sturdy shopping carts . "
