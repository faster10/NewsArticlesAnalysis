" After Mark came out , he said he ' d been attracted to me for a long time , " Storch said . " We went out a few times , but he constantly acted like he had something to prove . Everywhere he went , he was mincing around like RuPaul at Wigstock . And , Lord , you should have seen the shoes he was wearing on our second date . I realize he ' s excited about being out of the closet , but you don ' t have to make up for those lost years of gayness all at once . "
