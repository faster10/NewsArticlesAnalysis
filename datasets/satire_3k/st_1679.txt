" I say it every year the short , fat players have the most power , " said commentator Orel Hershiser after the game . " When you ' ve got guys like Byron , guys like Steven even though he ' s just a Skill 2 , guys like the ' Big A ' s ' Aaron , Adam , and Alan you ' re going to score a lot of runs . It would take a stellar pitching performance to shut this team down , and unfortunately for Mexico , Ramon did not have his best stuff today . "
