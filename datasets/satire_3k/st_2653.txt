Ed Whitfield ( R KY ) , a co sponsor of the bill and owner of two schnauzers who has long pushed for congressional action to ensure all canines can be " absolutely precious . " " While it ' s unfortunate our country had to wait so many years for this legislation , it does not diminish the joy we all feel today knowing that American dogs will now be more lovable than at any other point in our nation ' s history .
