During last month ' s special episode , the studio audience watched carefully and was uncharacteristically quiet as Winfrey explained , slowly and with no big words , the fundamentals of reproductive biology and family planning . In doing so , Winfrey exposed her largely white , female , unemployed , lower middle class audience to the concept of " pregnancy avoidance " for what was , in most cases , the first time in their lives . " Oprah ' s right , " said Shelley Collica of Jackson , MS , a longtime Oprah viewer and mother of seven . " I never looked at it quite this way before , but if you think about it , there ' s no reason that a woman has to be pregnant all the time . "
