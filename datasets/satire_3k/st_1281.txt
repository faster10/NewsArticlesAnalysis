" See , normally , things that fall under the category of plentiful , undesirable junk would be worthless , simply due to the laws of supply and demand , " said Fred Franks , a Parsippany , NJ , dealer specializing in 1970s era sponges . " But nobody wants to sell what they collect , anyway : They just want to keep it and hoard it because it ' s so valuable . So , in this business , we ' re not talking about demand anymore , just supply , and lots of it . This has caused the value of even mundane , everyday objects to go through the roof . See this lint on my jacket here ? That ' s at least eight , nine bucks worth of lint there . I have Internet quotes to prove it . "
