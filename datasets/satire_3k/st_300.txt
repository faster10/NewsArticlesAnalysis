According to Rosenwald ' s descriptions and several crude sketches made on looseleaf paper , the dunk involves the player running toward the hoop , tossing the basketball off the backboard , jumping up while spinning around 180 degrees in midair , and catching the ball above his head while his back is facing the hoop . At this point , Rosenwald said , it gets a little tricky . The player , still in the air , must then palm the ball with his right hand , transfer it behind his back to his left hand , and , upon completing his full 360 degree spin , dunk the ball over the left side of the rim .
