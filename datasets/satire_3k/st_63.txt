One of the most successful American bands of the mid ' 80s , the Shufflin ' Crew broke up in May 1986 due to creative differences and infighting , particularly between Gault and keyboardist Gary Fencik . Gault embarked on a solo career in 1987 and scored a minor hit with the song ' Chocolate Swirl ( That ' s What I ' m As Smooth As ) , ' but never equaled the success he had with the Shufflin ' Crew . Fencik and Fuller went on to form the band Touchback with New York Giants wide receiver Phil McConkey .
