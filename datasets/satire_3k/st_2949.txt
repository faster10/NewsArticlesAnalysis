CONCAN , TX Todd Hays , the driver of the U . S . two man bobsled team , has spent all winter looking for the perfect song to accompany his bobsledding routine next weekend . " In a sport that depends just as much on the way the spectators interpret the performance as the physical maneuvering of a small metal sleigh down steep hills and through tight turns , the music you select is crucial , " said Hays , who has narrowed his search to Blue Oyster Cult ' s hard rocking " Burnin ' For You " and Shania Twain ' s reserved yet hopeful " You ' re Still The One . " " When I ' m careening down the track in sub zero weather at speeds approaching 90 mph , I want to faintly hear brief , wind distorted fragments of a song that inspires me , that influences the way I drive , and that also allows me to have a little fun with it . " Hays added that he has not ruled out commissioning the composition of an original piece for the event , as long as it speaks to who he is as a bobsledder .
