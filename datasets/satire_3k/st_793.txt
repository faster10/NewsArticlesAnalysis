" I know so many people , but I ' m way too busy to keep in touch with all of them , " Bush said . " Whether I ' m talking about our strategies in Gitmo or my dogs down in Crawford , the blog is an easy way to let everyone know what ' s been up with me . If I ' ve just had a really good lunch at a new restaurant , or something funny happens in a briefing from the NSA , I want to let my friends and family know about it . "
