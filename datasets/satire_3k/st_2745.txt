According to Greaves , much of the UMass team ' s research was conducted at a party at this one guy Matt ' s place . " My colleagues and I were doing beer bongs , keg stands , Jell O shots , Jager shots you name it , " Greaves said . " We were totally binge drinking and just having a great time . The best part was the crowd the study was packed , and there was this amazing random sampling of hot chicks . I was so drunk , I couldn ' t figure out what the source of the unusually large hot chick sample was , but by that point , I really didn ' t care . "
