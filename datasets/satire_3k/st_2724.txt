" We pretty much have it all down here , " said Kindler , gesturing around the room that was until recently the church ' s primary storage space , and which he has decorated with inspirational prints and several posters of Ohio sports teams . " There ' s a ping pong table , foosball , and cold sodas in the fridge . There ' s a corner with a big couch and some chairs where you can hang out , talk with friends , or just relax . We wanted to make this into a cool place for teens to come after school , you know ? "
