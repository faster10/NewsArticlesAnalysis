" When I told Teri about Amanda , she screamed , ' How could you do this to me and Nancy ? ' " Hubrin said . " Then she said , ' Don ' t you love me ? ' I said I did and still do , but that I ' ve never met anyone quite like Amanda . Teri is a smart , beautiful woman , and I wish her only the best . I know that somewhere out there is a married man who ' s going to make her a very happy mistress , but I just don ' t think I ' m that married man . "
