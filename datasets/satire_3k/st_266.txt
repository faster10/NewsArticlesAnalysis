" Oh , I go positively crazy , " Buster said , pausing to gnaw a spot on his left hindquarter . " He ' s right there , staring me down , eye to eye , all day long . The only way I can get away from his strong nose and bright eyes is to put my own head in the bag . And , you know how it is , once you smell the kibble , you can ' t help but eat all of it . . . And then there ' s no question about it : I ' m the worse dog . "
