" I almost couldn ' t believe it when I realized I ' d been counting on the city council to take responsibility for the dangerous intersection near my home that desperately needs a traffic light , " said Peter Layne of Mendota , CA , who confessed it wasn ' t the first time he had caught himself hoping for decisive action from those who , in accordance with the social contract governing democratic societies , have been elected to represent the general will of the people . " I don ' t know what I was thinking and this is the second time it ' s happened this week ! You ' d think I ' d know better by now . As irritated as I am with myself , I ' m just thankful no one else witnessed my boneheaded slip up . "
