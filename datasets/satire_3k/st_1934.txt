" There were a lot of challenges involved in readying John Glenn for display , " NASM deputy director Donald Lopez said . " Ideally , we ' d like to fully restore him to his original 1962 condition inarguably his most memorable period but that ' s beyond the state of the archival art . However , he is a 1921 model , and therefore close to the end of his current service cycle . When he inevitably fails in a few years , we ' ll have to take him down and overhaul him anyway . That ' s when we ' ll look into making him as period correct as the other displays here , using both our own knowledge and that of animal preservation and display experts from the Museum of Natural History .
