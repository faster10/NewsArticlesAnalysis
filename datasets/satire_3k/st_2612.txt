" There have been 4 , 192 films in the past 10 years in which male characters with sleek or slicked back hairstyles have been portrayed in a negative light , " said Ray Swartz , chairman of the National Organization of Men with Slicked Back Hair . " Even though men with this hairstyle comprise just 3 percent of the U . S . populace , they make up nearly 80 percent of all film and TV villains , bad guys , and just plain assholes . As a result , thousands of men who enjoy wetting their hair and then combing it straight back face a silent but pervasive form of discrimination every single day . "
