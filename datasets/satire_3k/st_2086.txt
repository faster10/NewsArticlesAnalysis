" You know I normally wouldn ' t be caught dead in some corporate suburban hellhole like that , " the 24 year old Larsen told friends at Jack ' s Wax , an independent record store he frequents . " But I was out near Jefferson Mall because I had to get a new air filter for my car , and they ' re about five bucks cheaper at that Crown Auto over there . Then , I got to thinking how my dad ' s birthday ' s coming up , and I should probably get him something . I figured I ' d try the mall , since it ' s got tons of the kind of stupid crap he likes .
