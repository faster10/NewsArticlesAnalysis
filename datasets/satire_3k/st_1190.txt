" It wouldn ' t hurt these kids to loosen up a little , " Shalala said . " I mean , yes , stay away from cocaine , LSD and all the heavy stuff , the stuff that fries your mind . But come on , you can certainly get away with some pot every now and then . Beer can also be nice . Or ask your parents to serve a nice table wine , like Beaujolais , with dinner . It adds a tangy zest to chicken and fish , and it ' ll take you out of your shell a bit . I mean , live a little . "
