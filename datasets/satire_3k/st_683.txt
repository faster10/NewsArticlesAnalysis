" We couldn ' t believe what was happening , " said Sam Weber , owner of Playmakers , a Raleigh sports bar . " I still don ' t understand it . We had a decent crowd here to watch the 1982 North Carolina vs . Georgetown NCAA Championship game on ESPN Classic when out of nowhere a lamppost comes crashing through the front window . Then these huge pasty white guys , all wearing , like , matching sweaters , run in screaming like madmen and holding this giant planter over their heads , which they demanded I fill with beer . They invited all my customers to join them , but we were too shocked , terrified and disoriented to even move , so the gang got angry and stole four of my big screen televisions . "
