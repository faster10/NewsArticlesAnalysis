" Expressing one ' s feelings and emotions via the firing of guns into the air is an ancient and noble artform , " said Henri St . Germain , president of the Federation Internationale des Discharges Aeriales ( FIDA ) , the sport ' s governing body . " In fact , it may even predate the practice of expressing one ' s feelings and emotions by shooting into other humans . And nowhere on Earth does this tradition continue to thrive more than in Iraq and Kentucky . It is a vital part of these two unique cultures . "
