" I have no idea how to make the plastic milk jug look gay , " Bellisle said . " I don ' t want to make him a bottle of water , for obvious reasons . Maybe I ' ll use a soy milk container when I draw the gay jug . Or maybe they ' ll let me switch him with the Chicano , this tin can here . I wasn ' t too pleased with the Chicano tin can to begin with , especially because my first instinct was to put tomatoes or beans on the can . Not because he ' s Chicano , but because he ' s a can .
