" We have done extensive testing with the AP 12 and we can say that these units are capable of carrying out everyday police work just as proficiently as any member of our force , " said police spokesman Gerald McClintock , who explained that the machine can be deployed to nearly any scene to which law enforcement officials typically respond , be it dispersing peaceful protesters by blasting a 14 nozzle pepper spray cannon or reacting to reports of suspicious behavior by immediately striking the knees , face , and throat of a potential suspect up to 10 times harder than its human counterpart . " Thanks to these robotic units , our deputies can rest assured their work will be performed to the same standards we have always expected of our patrolmen . "
