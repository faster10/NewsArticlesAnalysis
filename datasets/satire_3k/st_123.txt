" I can ' t even begin to enumerate all the safety protocols and fundamental principles of spaceflight that this particular vehicle violates , " said veteran NASA flight director Raymond Fletcher , who called the crayon drawn spaceship the " most poorly conceived and " shockingly hazardous craft he had ever encountered . " The asymmetrical oval shape of the craft alone would likely cause it to break apart upon reentry into Earth ' s atmosphere . That ' s assuming the long row of randomly spaced circular windows are properly coated with a heat resistant material to ensure they don ' t disintegrate before reaching space in the first place . "
