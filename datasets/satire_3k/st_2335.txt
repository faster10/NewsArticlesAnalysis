At 8 : 30 a . m . Wednesday , a horse drawn caisson transported Barbaro ' s body down a carefully planned route along Central Avenue , where people young and old stood silent , teary eyed , and completely motionless save for the occasional salute . Once he arrived at Churchill Downs , his body was carried to the base of the grandstand by a team of 48 pallbearers . Dressed in his finest silks , and wearing his Kentucky Derby garland and Presidential Medal of Freedom around his neck , Barbaro lay in state inside his 18 foot long , five foot deep mahogany casket .
