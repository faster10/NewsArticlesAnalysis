" As soon as we learn a child has disappeared down a pool of light underneath their staircase or through a strangely shaped attic door they had never before noticed , we must act fast to assemble search parties and cover as much enchanted territory as possible , " said investigator Joe Phillippe , who urged parents to contact authorities immediately if they believed their child had passed into a gleaming world of crystal palaces or been transported back in time to the age of King Arthur . " If they ' re not found within that critical 48 hour window , children typically become disoriented in the thick fog and dense forest of a land where it ' s always night , or they ' re led astray by a well dressed fox who promises to take them to a place where kids can play all varieties of games . At that point , they become almost impossible to locate . "
