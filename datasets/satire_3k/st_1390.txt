" We ' ve got a lot of options on the table it ' s just a matter of picking which one we want to use to paralyze every single sector of the world economy , " said Capital One executive vice president Peter Schnall . " We already burst the dot com and housing bubbles , so this time we can maybe mix it up by popping the education bubble and shattering the lives of everyone with outstanding student loans . Or maybe we ' ll artificially inflate prices of stocks in social media companies and then pull the rug out , bankrupting every investor tied to companies like Facebook and Twitter . Or do both . "
