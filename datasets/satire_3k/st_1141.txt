" A roasting pan that they cooked meatloaf in is about as tough as they get , especially since Smitty ' s lead cook Perry Tuscan likes it with a crispy bottom , " Polone explained to his trainee . " Those pans , you want to soak them for half an hour minimum , in really hot water with lots of soap , before you get to the scraping , or else you ' re just wasting elbow grease . You could soak it overnight to loosen things up , but I honestly wouldn ' t recommend that unless you ' re opening the next day , because you don ' t want to get on some other dishwasher ' s shit list .
