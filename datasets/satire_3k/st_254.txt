Michener explained that , after larger debris such as Yoo hoo caps and empty 24 oz . Monster Energy drink cans were cleared from the worksite , great care was taken to brush away layers of cigarette ash and Dorito dust from the pretzel fragments without causing damage to their golden brown crust . The remains of the snack were reportedly further covered in a hardened mixture of powdered sugar from Hostess Donettes , jerky grease , and other sediments that naturally occur in environments such as the one where the pretzel was discovered , and had to be thoroughly cleaned before further study .
