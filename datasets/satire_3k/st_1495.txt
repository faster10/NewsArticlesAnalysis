After GE was forced to remove 41 , 000 cubic yards of contaminated soil from the school ' s playground area , it installed new recreational equipment and athletic facilities on the site . The ad , which cites GE ' s playground equipment donation , features a delighted child on a slide and a voiceover stating , " GE knows you ' ve got to give just a little . . . to get a smile in return .
