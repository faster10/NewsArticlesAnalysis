" Kentucky is a major major major major basketball school , no two ways about it , " Cornell senior Jon Jaques wrote on his blog Wednesday . " We may be a low mid upper mid downer middle mid micro submacro school from upstate New York , but we ' ve never let it hold us back . When the Big Dance is over , I wouldn ' t be surprised to see people calling Cornell a mid upper parallel medial , or even a para demi duo double major . I think we ' ve proved something to the world . "
