" I have heard your worries regarding the nationwide grief shortage , and I want to assure you that when the time comes , we will all be ready to grieve again , " said Obama , his eyes red from crying . " The fact is , grief and horror and the general feeling that we ' re all small and weak and it ' s never going to get any better are some of our nation ' s most valuable resources in times like these , and we ' ve always managed to come up with them before when we needed them . Knowing the ingenuity and indomitable spirit of the American people , we ' ll come up with them again . "
