" Dad and I were watching the NBA playoffs Saturday , " 14 year old son Dylan said . " Someone missed a pass , and he goes , ' Sometimes , I get the feeling that some of these basketball players are smoking the rock . ' Then , a few days later , he sits down on my bed and asks me if I ' d ever been ' pressured into attending a raver party , where kids dance and take party drugs like truck driver , co pilot , Georgia home boy , and doctor . ' It ' s like he picked up a health textbook or something . Or maybe he found some weird talking to your kids about drugs web site . "
