" Just like clockwork , Socrates and I are up bright and early every morning at six when he starts howling and howling , " Emily Pressman said . " Sometimes it ' s more like 5 : 30 if he ' s having one of his vomiting spells . Of course , that ' s assuming he hasn ' t woken us up already with those deep , mournful moans . But once I force feed him his hyperthyroid pills and clean up the mess , he ' s usually pretty quiet for the rest of the day . I tend to forget he ' s even around . "
