" An attractive , brightly colored sticker , if placed in a highly visible spot like the rear bumper of an automobile , could theoretically move millions of motorists to political action , " University of Washington political science professor Karl Young said . " And in the case of Miss Unger , she encountered the sticker during her commute or ' personal drive time , ' a period of the day when commuters are at an unusually high level of political awareness . My suspicion would be that she is one of many who have been moved to free Tibet by this sticker . "
