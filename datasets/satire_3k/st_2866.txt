" My fellow Americans , it gives me devilish delight to declare that the annual D . C . Spooktacular is once again back from the dead to terrify and scare ify each and every citizen , " said the president , as the sound of rattling chains and disembodied screams emanated behind him . " Every single citizen , both living and deceased , is invited to Witchington , D . C . for a night of 1 , 776 frights . Join us on Capitol Chill , if you dare , for a sinister celebration of creepy crawlitics and representative demonocracy . "
