" Original host Bob Saget was a man obsessed , " Di Bona said . " After working on Full House , Bob was really excited to do a show with a purpose . But the 80 hour weeks started to wear him down . One late night during season six , Bob flipped . He started cursing , throwing things , and screaming that we were no closer to finding America ' s funniest home video than we were when we started . In 1997 , when he heard the news that Germany had found their nation ' s funniest video , he quit . He couldn ' t take the pressure anymore . "
