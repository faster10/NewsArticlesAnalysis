" One time , we were playing Quake against each other , and he killed my guy , " the 31 year old Reuss said . " A few minutes after the game ended , I get this e mail from him saying , ' Hey , sorry I killed you , Josh . But at least now you know what it ' s like to be dead . ' I thought that was kind of weird , but then he added , ' P . S . Did I tell you I ' m going to be in D . C . next week ? Maybe I ' ll swing by Dedham to see you . ' That ' s , like , 500 miles away . "
