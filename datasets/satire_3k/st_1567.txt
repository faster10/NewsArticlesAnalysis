" Some say that when people die , that ' s the end , but who knows ? " said the Supreme Being , adding that no one in the world could say with any degree of certainty whether one ' s existence completely ceases with death . " Others say that at the moment they die , people walk toward a bright light and into another world , but the thing is , only the people who die are the ones who know . I just know that it would be awfully sad to think that when they pass on they ' re gone forever . "
