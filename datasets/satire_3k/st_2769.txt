MacAlester ' s efforts to get the town ' s youths to dance , however , proved an entirely different matter . " Imagine my shock upon finding out that my new best friend at school , though sympathetic to my cause , didn ' t know how to dance a step himself , " MacAlester said . " I literally had to start from the ground up , tutoring him for hours on end , using a ' Walkman ' portable tape player with two sets of headphones , until he finally picked up on the fundamentals of the balletic , ' Solid Gold Dancers ' style rock and roll dance moves that came so naturally to me , given my urban background .
