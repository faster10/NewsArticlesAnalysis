" Ms . Streisand , you have lived a life of comfort and wealth , much of which was made possible by the selling of collectibles and memorabilia bearing your image . We feel it would be fair and honorable of you to ' give something back , ' both to your fans and the collectibles industry , by passing away in a manner that leaves the world stunned and deeply in want of some tangible object commemorating your rare beauty and talent , an object your fans can hold on to as a treasured keepsake and an assurance that your spirit will always be with them . "
