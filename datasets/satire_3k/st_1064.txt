" Come quick , there ' s a fire down at the ol ' Town Hall ! " local schoolteacher Eunice Quinn shouted into the cobblestone streets as the blaze spread through the building ' s storage chambers , burning up the surplus of dry goods and preserved fruits that had been safely stored away for the harsh winter months . " It was Bluebell again , kicked over an old lamp right in the middle a ' debatin ' ! We best send some of the older children down to the well and get a bucket brigade going . Hurry , before the flames get the fall harvest ! "
