" Just last week , I thought , ' Wouldn ' t it be cute if I took a picture of her on the phone ? ' " Meyers said . " I spent an hour figuring out how to strap her hand to the telephone . Then , I had to make it look like she was talking by giving her a little baby food to chew on . If you snapped the photo at the right moment , it totally looked like she was talking on the phone . My sister told me I was crazy , but I said ' You just wait until you see the photo ! ' "
