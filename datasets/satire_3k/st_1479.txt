" But the fox and the grapes incident is not just some fantasy concocted by the Aesopian Right . Our research has determined that it most likely occurred between 605 and 602 B . C . E . in the province of Phrygia , was witnessed by a young Aesop and ultimately recorded in what became the Holy Book of Aesopians . Our church ' s archaeological and historical data all confirm the details recorded in the Aesop account . "
