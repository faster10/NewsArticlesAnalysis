Last Friday , in the middle of a coloring activity , the planet Alderan was blown up , delighting 23 of the 24 children who witnessed the devastating power of the battle station . The sole exception was Libby Phelps , 3 , whose family was vacationing in Alderan at the time of its destruction . She was frightened by the loud explosion and began to cry upon realizing that her mother , father and younger sister were now dead . The emperor ' s elite squadron of imperial guards leapt to action , removing the girl from the room and giving her some ice cream treats to calm her .
