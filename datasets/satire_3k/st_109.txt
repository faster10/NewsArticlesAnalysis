Continued Krespie : " Kirsten really got into the mind of her character , even in the physical comedy scenes , like when she was trying to avoid Greg and get out of the house to get the abortion . And later in the packed abortion clinic , when she mistakes the number 81 she received from the receptionist for 18 , and finds out she has to wait much longer for her abortion . But it all leads to a nice , poignant ending when both characters realize they should have been honest with each other all along Trish with her pregnancy , and Greg with his sandwich . "
