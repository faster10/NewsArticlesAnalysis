In the weeks leading up to the war , the U . S . sought to make its intentions clear by air dropping hundreds of thousands of pamphlets over Iraq assuring its people that the U . S . was not launching a war against them , but against Saddam Hussein . The pamphlets also gave Iraqi soldiers instructions on how to surrender properly , as well as a promise that they would be treated well if they did so . Most importantly , though , they included a stern admonition to all Iraqis not to burn any oil wells , warning that they would be hunted down and prosecuted as war criminals if they did .
