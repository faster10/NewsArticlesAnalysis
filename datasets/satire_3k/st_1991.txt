Reports from the ground indicated that Johnson , once in possession of the perimeter region up to the cat dish , was forced in the early afternoon to retreat to the green rug zone , where he licked his paws with apparent disinterest for an estimated 10 minutes . Without warning , Johnson then launched a full frontal assault on Boswell ' s forces , pouncing from behind and eventually chasing his rival all the way to the bathroom sink . The heavy leaping and grappling was broken only by periods of intense mutual licking . At one point , the conflict escalated into full fledged upside down kicking of each other in the face before Boswell was distracted by an errant ball rolling across the floor , bringing the factions to an uneasy standstill .
