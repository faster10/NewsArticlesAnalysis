" A friend of mine who graduated from Portland State University that same year had Bill Clinton at her commencement , but I can ' t imagine anything could compare to the speech that Jim Gilmore gave , " said Eric Sheffield , who added that he rarely goes more than two or three days without rereading the transcript of Gilmore ' s speech he keeps pinned above his desk as a source of inspiration and courage . " I honestly don ' t know where I would be today if it weren ' t for his advice that we work to make the world a better place . That ' s a powerful , unforgettable message for which I am eternally grateful and indebted . "
