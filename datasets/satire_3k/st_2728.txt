" You know , even I ' m tempted to tell these kids to loosen up a bit , " Shalala said . " I mean , stay away from the heavy stuff , you know , the stuff that fries your mind , but c ' mon , you can get away with a beer every now and then . An oatmeal ale is nice . Or ask your parents to serve a nice table wine , like beaujolais , with dinner . It adds a tangy zest to chicken and fish , and it ' ll kind of take you out of your shell a bit , so to speak . I mean , live a little . "
