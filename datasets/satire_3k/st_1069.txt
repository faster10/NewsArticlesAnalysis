" My cartoon strip is not like the work of the typical campus cartoonists , who stick to easy , safe topics like cafeteria food or dorm shenanigans , " Mayhew says . " And I include more than your standard stock characters like ' Frat Guy ' and ' Sorority Girl . ' I have characters who are black , characters who are feminist , even one who is a lesbian . Sure , including controversial types like that may ruffle a few feathers , but it ' s something I have to do . Blacks , women , and , yes , even lesbians are human beings , just like you and me . "
