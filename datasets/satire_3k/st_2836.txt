" Perhaps we can reach some sort of compromise , " Anderson said . " I don ' t want to go so far as to soak the painting in the menstrual blood of a 13 year old girl , as some have demanded , but I ' m open to other suggestions . We might be able to scare up a pint or two of rhino vomit to splash on the canvas . And I know candied yams can be mashed into a nice , viscous paste and spread pretty easily . Personally , I like the painting as it is , but if a little shock is all it takes to calm everybody down , I ' m all for it . "
