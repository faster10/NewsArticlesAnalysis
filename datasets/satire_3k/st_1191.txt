" Stockbrokers , lawyers , English professors . . . you ' re not the problem here , " said DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson at a White House press conference . " If you are paying taxes and keeping your yard tidy , we ' re not going to hassle you if you come home from a hard day of work and want to enjoy a little pot or blow . But if , on the other hand , you ' re one of these lazy , shiftless types hanging out on the street all day looking for your next high , we ' re coming after you . "
