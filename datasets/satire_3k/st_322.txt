" If there is a thing that is universally cherished , then I have an obligation to help people understand why they ' re wrong for liking it , " said Lerner , adding that while it ' s tempting to let his friends simply enjoy a new song or TV show , he ultimately has a responsibility to point out its every flaw until it is utterly ruined for them . " I can ' t , for example , stand by in good conscience while everyone talks about how much they love Exile On Main St . . Not when the guitar riffs don ' t have nearly the inventiveness or clarity of the Rolling Stones ' earlier work and , let ' s be honest , the lyrics are hardly among Jagger ' s best . "
