" Herch knew what he was getting into when he decided to seek local fame , and now that he ' s grabbed the brass ring , he ' s got to live with it , " said Gus Brinkle , weatherman at rival station WPGN Channel 27 . " He wouldn ' t be here today if it weren ' t for his fans , but now that he ' s got the spotlight , suddenly he turns on them and starts complaining about the pressures of celebrity . It ' s ridiculous . If he can ' t take the attention , he should never have gotten into this business . It ' s not all store grand openings and charity fun runs , you know . If you want the glamour and the glory , you ' ve got to be willing to take the bad stuff , too . "
