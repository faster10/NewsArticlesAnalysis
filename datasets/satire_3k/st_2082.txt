Daemisch was referring to Rosie O ' Donnell , whose talk show topped daytime TV ratings in the late ' 90s . Unveiled in 1999 , Rosie ' s Chub Club encouraged overweight viewers to make gradual lifestyle changes and adhere to the motto , " Eat less and move more . " As a part of her commitment to the program , O ' Donnell would relate her own ongoing struggles with weight loss on air and reassure viewers that they were not alone in their dieting battles . She also motivated Chub Club members by listing successful dieters in the " Top 10 Losers " section of her web site , and by making regular entries in her " Chub Club Journal . "
