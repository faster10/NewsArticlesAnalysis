By Monday , the tour appeared to have lost all momentum . Sources close to Manson described him as " exhausted and discouraged , " despite not having even completed the first leg of the three month tour . By the time he arrived in Hoffman Estates , IL , Manson had resorted to leaving flaming bags of dog feces on doorsteps and shining a flashlight under his chin to make himself look " spooky . " He was ultimately chased from a Hoffman Estates subdivision by a group of bicycle riding teenagers who advised him to " get his chalk white goblin ass " out of their neighborhood .
