Before the emergence of the earliest humans , Dupuis said , if one of humankind ' s primate ancestors had been spending a long afternoon snacking and a treat slipped from its hand , the animal was content to let it go and continue lying supine on a tree branch . However , he explained that at some point in the Miocene epoch , after dropping what scientists believe must have been a particularly delicious treat , one of the hominids realized that if it wished to continue snacking , it would have to come down from the tree , wander out onto the savanna , pick the morsel up , and put it back in its mouth a behavior which , when first carried out , initiated the human lineage .
