" Well , I suppose with Brad Hightower in the Army now , and Jason Klaus marrying his pregnant ex girlfriend and working his ass off at the grain elevator , these kids ' party days are winding down , " said Sheriff John Pressman of Waushara County , WI . " Last week , one of my deputies did catch Bobby Hightower and Lee Olle over at the quarry with what looked like a Zima , but it turns out it was just a Pepsi Blue . Surprised the heck out of me , because the Hightowers are one hard drinking clan . They don ' t mean nothing by it they ' re good people . Why , I used to go with Brad Sr . ' s sister Bev back in high school . "
