NEW YORK Although American citizens are proud of the athletes representing their country at the Turin Olympics and wish their team the best of luck , their patriotism does not translate into a desire to actually watch the events , according to informal studies conducted by NBC , the network that will televise this year ' s Winter Games . " It ' s important to almost 100 percent of the viewers of NBC , MSNBC , and our partner networks that Team USA does well , especially in high profile sports such as hockey , figure skating , and skiing , " said NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol , whose network will provide 416 hours of coverage to as many as five times that number of people . " However , almost all those we spoke to said that they would be perfectly satisfied to see highlights and scores during commercial breaks on Law Order , Fear Factor , and Late Night With Conan O ' Brien . " Although Ebersol admitted that the estimated numbers were low compared to the legendary Winter Games of the 1980s , he said they were almost double those from the 1998 Olympics in Nagano .
