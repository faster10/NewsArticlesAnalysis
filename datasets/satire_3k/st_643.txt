" There is only one way to win over the hearts , minds , and votes of our nation ' s non presidents a group which , I ' ve learned , is larger than I had previous reason to believe and that ' s to ask questions , " Bush said . " Is security tight enough at their military retreats ? Do they have adequate support from their friends in the private sector ? Are the global petrochemical companies that back them doing a good job of adhering to government guidelines regarding their campaign contributions ? Do they and their households have access to high quality spin control ? If not , I ' d like to help non presidents and their families get the help they need . "
