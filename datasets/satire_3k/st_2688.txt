In the past several months , complaints against Williams have continued to mount . During a game in Indianapolis , the Globetrotters went into their famous football formation , an offensive scheme designed to confuse and disorient opponents due to the preposterous nature of football being played on the basketball court . When the basketball was " intercepted " by Generals center James Vilsaint , Williams tackled him and drove him headfirst into the hardwood court , giving his opponent a severe concussion and a fractured collarbone . In the same game , Williams , instructed to " get " a referee with a bucketful of confetti , grasped the official by the back of the neck and roughly shoved his head inside the bucket , holding him there until he passed out from oxygen deprivation .
