" One of our first chats was about how tough it is to find good Half Life levels on line . At one point , I said someone should make a really good Half Life file web page , but he somehow got it into his head that I was saying this was something the two of us should do . He brings up ' our web page ' every week or so , asking if I ' ve made any progress . I keep telling him I don ' t know anything about web site programming , but he just says , ' Well , there are books you can get that will teach you how to do it . ' It ' s like , then you learn to do it . "
