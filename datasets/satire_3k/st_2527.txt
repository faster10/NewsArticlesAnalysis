Continued Righetti : " The Scoliosis Man comic book they gave out was pretty lame , but at least it wasn ' t as dumb as that one we got from the suicide awareness and prevention assembly . Me and my buddies down at the lumber yard still quote it , it ' s so stupid : ' Chad , do you want my portable cassette player ? I don ' t want it anymore . ' ' But , Ben , I don ' t get it . That ' s your most prized possession ! ' Yeah , we get it suicidal people give their stuff away ! How dumb is that ? "
