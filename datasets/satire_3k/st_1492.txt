" For Debbie , Curtis is an ideal partner , " Paschal said . " He provides friendship , emotional support , and a certain sense of exoticism via his homosexuality . And since she is long accustomed to not having sex , she barely even misses that component in her quasi romance . As for Curtis , he receives from Debbie social respectability , unconditional acceptance , and a major ego boost via her obvious but unspoken crush on him . Best of all , he doesn ' t have to feel the tiniest bit guilty or uncomfortable about her attraction to him because the relationship can never be consummated , thanks to his homosexuality . Curtis and Debbie enjoy a symbiotic relationship of the highest , most dysfunctional order . "
