Over the years , the parade has seen an unusually high incidence of tragedy as it winds through 2 . 4 miles of downtown D . C . In 1977 , a burning , driverless garbage truck , reported stolen earlier in the day from the Happy Haul Away Sanitation Company , plunged into the " Telling The Tales Of Yesteryear " float , killing 17 men . In the ' 80s , the route was changed annually , in an attempt to circumvent the tendency of Colombian owned businesses to detonate as the parade passed . Also , the " Boxes Of Nails From Around The World " limousine caravan sponsored by the Sons Of Italy Working Men ' s Association has exploded with dire consequences seven out of the past nine years .
