Based on tried and true NASCAR designs from what many consider the golden age of stock car racing , the Car Of Yesterday is based on the racing team ' s choice of four door body styles : either the ' 77 Cutlass Supreme , the ' 79 Chevrolet Caprice Classic , the ' 78 Dodge Diplomat , the ' 77 Ford Granada , the ' 77 Mercury Gran Marquis , or for series newcomers Toyota , the 1989 Corolla . All cars , regardless of body style , must have fully reclining seats , column shifters , vinyl tops , ashtrays , and automatically retracting seatbelts . Adding spoilers and air dams for purposes other than providing advertising space is forbidden , although teams will be allowed to bolt wooden 2 by 8 planks to their front and rear bumpers for the contact heavy short track races . Mechanically , all cars will be basically identical , featuring 360 cubic inch V 8 engines with the air filters reversed , " glass pack " mufflers , and factory power steering .
