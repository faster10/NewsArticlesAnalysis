" I wish we could say there was something we could all do to prepare for all this , " noted pain therapist Eli Wasserbaum said . " Some have suggested using the body ' s own natural endorphins to create a ' neural block ' of the brain ' s sensory receptors , or some other such thing . Unfortunately , I ' m afraid that ' s simply impossible . There just isn ' t any hope of deliverance , for any of us . A nightmarish hellscape of unrelenting , endless agony awaits us all in the very near future . "
