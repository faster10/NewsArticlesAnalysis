" When you ' re out at a bar , what do you ask for , a vodka cranberry or an Absolut cranberry ? " Kiefer said . " Absolut , right ? Why is that ? By definition , vodkas are supposed to be odorless , colorless , and tasteless , so there really shouldn ' t be that much difference between them . People want Absolut not just for the flavor , but to be a part of the whole Absolut experience . And that all stems from this legendary ad campaign . I am honored to be carrying the torch . "
