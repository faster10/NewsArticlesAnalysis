" When young girls play with Barbie , we don ' t want there to be any limits on what they can imagine possible , and that ' s exactly why we created the first ever male version of the doll , " said Mattel CEO Christopher Sinclair , noting that while previous Barbies have served to model various careers for girls , none has let them picture what it ' s like to rise to the highest rung of any field they choose . " With this new Barbie , girls can make believe they ' re the one who actually calls the shots , whether they ' re pretending to lead a major corporate merger , direct a hot startup in Silicon Valley , or oversee a well funded research lab .
