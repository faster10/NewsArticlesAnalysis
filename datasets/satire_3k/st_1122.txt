" Freddy thought people were mad at him and didn ' t like him , and he was being a little grumpy with the police and his staffers , " Boxer said . " So on the car ride back home , I explained to Freddy that there will always be people who won ' t understand why he ' s a senator , but that he should know that it ' s okay to be different . I told him he should be proud of himself and the work he ' s done in the Senate . That seemed to calm him down quite a bit . He also really seemed to like the Koosh slingshot I gave him . "
