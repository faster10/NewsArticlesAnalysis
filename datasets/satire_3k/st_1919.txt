" We all love Jim , but it ' s no secret that he needs an extra hand , and that ' s nothing to be ashamed of , " said pitching coach Jeff Jones , who noted that Jim ' s poor eyesight would never have allowed him to notice that pitcher Justin Verlander was struggling to place his fastball the way Patti had . " Patti helps keeps the mood brighter , too . When Jim tried to tell us to get John Smiley up in the ' pen , we ' re all thinking , ' John Smiley hasn ' t played baseball in 15 years . ' Patti helped us laugh it off , though , and said to get Al Alburquerque up , which was the right call . "
