" Mr Jackson says that I stay out all night and that I ' m not talking right . He says he has rambling on his mind as a result of my treating him so unkind . He says I want every downtown man I meet and says they shouldn ' t even let me on the street , " Dobbs said . " Well , I refuse to allow my name to be dragged through the mud like this any longer . Unless my man puts an end to these unfair attacks on my character , I will neither rock nor roll him to the break of dawn . I am through with his low down ways . "
