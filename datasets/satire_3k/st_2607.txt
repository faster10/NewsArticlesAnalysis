" This is an extremely serious situation , " said Def Jam president Russell Simmons , whose label which has featured such artists as Public Enemy , Beastie Boys , EPMD , and LL Cool J was responsible for much of the sample depletion of the mid to late ' 80s . " Rappers may have to wait upwards of 10 years between albums , until there ' s enough new pop songs to sample . Other than that , the only solution is for rappers to come up with the music themselves . Let ' s just hope it never comes to that . "
