" When the burgers are fully cooked which they rarely are the orders are always screwed up , " Danielle Costa , 36 , said . " I ' ve gotten orders with a bun and no burger , two burgers and no bun , a Filet O Fish crammed into an apple pie box you name it . And the only visible cook is bobbing his head up and down listening to music on his headphones . I can ' t believe there hasn ' t been some sort of fast food coup d ' etat at that place by now . "
