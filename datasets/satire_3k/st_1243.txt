" Autonomous cars are all about making life easier for the vehicle ' s occupants . And by using real time satellite imagery and up to the second traffic data to flee the scene of an accident far faster than any human driver could , our self driving vehicle will remove any chance of having to deal with costly traffic citations , insurance rate hikes , or the irate owner of the damaged vehicle , taking all the hassle out of driving .
