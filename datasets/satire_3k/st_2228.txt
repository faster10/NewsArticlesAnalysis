" Within just a couple decades of his passing , Aaron Jacobson and all his achievements in life will be completely forgotten and never spoken of again , while the refuse he produced , on the other hand , will exert a profound influence that will endure for millennia , " said head researcher Kevin Wright , who confirmed that each of the everyday items Jacobson regularly tosses into the garbage including soda bottles , plastic bags , food wrappers , and the like will be considerably more important in determining the future of the planet than his roughly 80 years of life will be . " For example , while his recent promotion to senior sales associate had a modest impact on his company and , perhaps , a minor impact on his community , it will certainly not change the course of human civilization in any sense . However , the mobile phones he leaves behind will still be leaching toxic metals into the soil and groundwater thousands of years from now , impacting entire populations . "
