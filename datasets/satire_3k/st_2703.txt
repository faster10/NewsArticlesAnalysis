" Roger not only accepted the offer to drink with me , but he held his own , drinking three of the six beers , " Iwanski said . " He doesn ' t put his beer in a glass , so he ' s not some fancy wine and cheese guy , but he also says he ' s never shotgunned a beer in his life , so he ' s not a party hound . He still hasn ' t mentioned anything about having a favorite beer , which makes me suspect he ' s more of a hard liquor kind of guy . Nothing wrong with that , though . "
