The button making machine , a Badge A Minit ' I , is kept in the main office supply closet and is available for classroom checkout from Barthes . The school purchased the machine 14 years ago for 79 , a hefty sum that , according to Barthes , clearly indicates that the machine is not a toy . In May 1987 , days after the school ' s acquisition of the button maker , Barthes made a sign that has remained taped to its base ever since : " For classroom use only ! Do not waste materials ! They cost ! ! "
