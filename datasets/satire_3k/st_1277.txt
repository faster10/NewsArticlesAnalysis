" It also doesn ' t help that I ' m the oldest but still the least responsible , " Tim added . " Jack always remembers birthdays and is really good about keeping in touch with phone calls and e mails , even though he lives in another city . Anna gives Mom and Dad the most thoughtful gifts . Shit , I ' m lucky if I can remember my own goddamn birthday . I mean , they ' re my family , and I love them , but I ' ll never really belong the way Jack and Anna do . I swear , sometimes I think I ' m adopted . "
