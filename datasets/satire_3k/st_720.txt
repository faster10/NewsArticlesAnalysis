" I don ' t know what ' s happened , " Cheney said . " Less than seven years ago , 9 11 seemed like a huge event for every American . Back then , on Sept . 11 morning , everyone would dart downstairs at 8 : 46 a . m . sharp , shouting and screaming , and the ground outside would be blanketed in the most beautiful gray as far as the eye could see . I especially loved the streets of New York during this season the lights , the sounds , people rushing every which way , the sidewalks so crowded you could barely move , the wide eyed looks on the people ' s faces . The whole New York skyline was lit up like a Christmas tree . "
