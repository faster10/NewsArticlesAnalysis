We have been attacked from the far right , when Estes Kefauver conducted his witch hunt on comics in the 1950s , and from the far left , when Fidel Castro forced one of Mad ' s chief contributors to flee Communist Cuba for the subversive content of his cartoons . We have taken plenty of lumps tall , elongated lumps circled by chirping birds and musical notes yet we ' ve never given in . Or folded in .

' heard ' round the world . "
