" Man , I remember once telling her I thought her friend Liz was kind of cute , " said fellow junior Mike Nygard , 20 . " She got unbelievably offended and lectured me for two hours on Lookism and the society wide evils of the Male Gaze . At the time , I felt awful and apologized profusely for my insensitivity . I remember thinking how lucky I was to have someone like Amanda to point out how sexist I didn ' t even know I was being . Now , though , I ' m thinking maybe she was just being a sanctimonious , self righteous bitch . Of course , it would be sexist of me to think that , but I sort of do . "
