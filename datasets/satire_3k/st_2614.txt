" I have naturally oily hair . If I leave it dry , it ends up messy by the end of the day , so I slick it back , " Doug Roessner of Brockton , MA said . " I sell insurance for a living , so how am I supposed to get my clients to trust me when they all think I ' m some money hungry scumbag ? And every time I tell my bosses that I ' ll ' take care of ' a problem , they immediately assume I mean murdering someone . It ' s pathetic . "
