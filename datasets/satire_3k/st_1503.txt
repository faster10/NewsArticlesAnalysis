" We are all eternal beings waiting to accept the true nature of death , which , in many ways , is merely a new beginning for the human soul , " Bush said . " And , you know , just to clarify , we know those soldiers did not die in vain because that would be saying that invading Iraq was the wrong decision , and I don ' t believe that it was . When you ' re the commander in chief of the most powerful nation on earth , sometimes you have to make difficult choices , and not everyone ' s going to like those choices , but I ' d like to see anyone else here make the call , because , I ' ll tell you first hand , it ' s a tough one . People who criticize the decision now speak with the benefit of a hindsight none of us had when our country was being attacked . The fact is , Saddam Hussein was a bad guy , and I think anyone would have made the same call I did , even if there were never any weapons of mass destruction . I would do it all again if I had to .
