" When a species vanishes , the world loses not only that species , but the wide range of highly specialized physical and biochemical functions that species served . These ecological losses necessitate the creation of new , synthetic products capable of serving the same functions , " Quammen said . " So , for example , when we lose a strain of microbe that filters the water we drink , we compensate by developing the amazing Brita water filter , with its patented filtration technology . When we lose a plant in the jungles of Indonesia whose berry bears an extremely rare nutrient , we develop in its place fruity , fun to eat Flintstones chewable vitamin supplements . "
