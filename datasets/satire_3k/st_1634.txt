The hybrid bulb ' s structure slightly more complex than the older filament and wire models features a small , efficient four cylinder internal combustion engine at the base of the bulb that powers an electric generator attached to the glass mount . The generator produces electricity that is then fed to the electric motor , which ignites a small flame inside the glass casing . Any excess electricity is used to charge the bulb ' s 300 volt lead acid battery , which at full capacity is capable of independently lighting a 60 watt bulb for up to 30 minutes .
