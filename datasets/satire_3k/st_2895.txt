" I am saddened to accept the resignation of Attorney General Eric Holder . He held his office with honor and served his country admirably , and as we begin the difficult task of replacing him , I want the American people to understand that the country is now poised to erupt into a vicious maelstrom of horror ungoverned by the laws of man , " said the president , urging citizens to trust no one and to stay in their homes while bedlam consumes the nation . " With a leadership void in the Department of Justice , there is no question that utter chaos and disorder will prevail and our formerly rule bound society will descend into a cutthroat free for all . That is , until this administration and both sides of Congress agree on a replacement . "
