" Today ' s drivers want to get in touch with the experience of sitting behind the wheel of a finely crafted , planetary gear vehicle with manual crank shafts , " said Ford ' s president and CEO Alan Mulally , who expects the first line of Model Ts to be available for sale by mid December and safe for driving as soon as it is neither snowing nor raining . " We ' re getting back to the basics , bringing the quality and elegance of 1908 into the 21st century . We want to show the country why , at one point , every single car driven in America was a Ford . "
