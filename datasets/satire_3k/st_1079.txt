The Bush effigy , a surprisingly accurate likeness outfitted in a blue suit and red power tie , was originally to be taken to the steps of the Capitol Building for the censure proceedings . The mob turned back , however , when one among the rabble called a point of order and explained that the president would not be present if Congress were actually to pass censure . The crowd then unanimously moved to postpone its mock Senate vote until a detailed facsimile of the Oval Office could be constructed on the lawn of the Mall and the effigy placed inside it .
