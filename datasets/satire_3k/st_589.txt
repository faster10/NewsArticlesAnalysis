" In the name of the Great Teacher , we will stop at nothing to unleash a firestorm of empathy , compassion , and true selflessness upon the West , " said Rinpoche , adding that all enemies of a freely flowing , unfettered state of mind will be " besieged with pure , everlasting happiness . " " No city will be spared from spiritual harmony . We will bring about the end to all Western pain and anxiety , to all destructive cravings , to all greed , delusion , and misplaced desire . Indeed , we will bring the entire United States to its knees in deep meditation . "
