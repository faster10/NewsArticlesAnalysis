" There ' s a lot riding on this , " Escudero said . " Still , I think I ' m pretty set . I just have to learn the periodic table , be able to explain what triangular trade is , and remember that it goes egg , larva , pupa , butterfly . It ' ll be hard answering all those questions about Richard III and the New Deal , but at least I ' ve already got the numbers up to 20 totally memorized . And once I ' m done with the test , I won ' t have to go to school anymore . "
