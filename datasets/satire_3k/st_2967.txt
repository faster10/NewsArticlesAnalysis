" While it ' s true I have treated few players with Kevin ' s level of physical conditioning and mental resilience , I don ' t think it ' s fair for the NFL ' s doctor to tell him that he ' ll be able to fly , " Castillo said Wednesday .

Second , no matter what Dr Homburg says , people cannot just grow wings and fly , period , and to tell Kevin that is cruel . He probably won ' t even play football again . "
