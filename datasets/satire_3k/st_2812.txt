" I let my mind wander for a bit , and now I have absolutely no idea what I ' m watching , " said ballpark patron Jeffrey Arnold , noting that he didn ' t remember the game starting and couldn ' t say how long he had been sitting in his seat in the left field bleachers . " If I had to guess , I would say the score is 4 0 , but I have no idea why I think that . I ' m reasonably sure I remember someone saying something about a 4 , though . "
