" The marriage has been really hard on the kids , but we ' re making sure they know it ' s not their fault that it ' s like this , " said Beth , adding that she tries not to bad mouth David within earshot of her son and daughter . " Children are very perceptive they can always tell when something ' s wrong so we decided not to keep anything from them . It ' s not like we ' re ever going to be a happily married couple again , but at least we can try to make it as painless as possible for them . "
