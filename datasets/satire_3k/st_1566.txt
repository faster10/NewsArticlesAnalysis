" It ' s not something I do very often , but yes , I have been known to eat humans from time to time , " said God , claiming that while He didn ' t consider human beings " an everyday kind of meal , per se , " they do occasionally make for a decent snack . " In fact , sometimes I ' ll suddenly catch myself nibbling on a human being without even realizing it . They ' re nice and chewy and bite size , and there ' s always a lot of them just lying around so I figure , hey , why not . "
