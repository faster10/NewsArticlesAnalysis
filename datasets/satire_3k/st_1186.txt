" This isn ' t about Becky and me , " Garver said . " This is about building our child ' s self esteem , because we love her . Which reminds me , we ' re really looking forward to Valentine ' s Day . We found an adorable pink dress with little wings on the back for our little Cupid . How can she not be happy with all the attention everyone will give her ? Plus , her hair ' s finally growing in , so we can stop using the hats . She never seemed to like those . "
