" When we remodeled the basement , it was just to install a new washer and dryer and create a place for our old sleeper sofa and TV , " said Arlene Verbitski , a Worcester area mother of two teenage sons . " You know , like a room for rumpus oriented play . I never intended it for use as a den of hanging out . I don ' t know what they ' re doing down there . Are they flipping out ? Getting down ? For all I know , they could be getting over , stylin ' along , or jamming away . I ' m scared . "
