" My self esteemed colleagues , American voters come in all shapes and sizes . When you vote for me , you vote for a celebration of diversity , " said Julie , a veterinary assistant from Cedar Rapids , IA , in a ceremony at the Washington Hilton . " My presidency will prove that you don ' t have to be a size two to build better relations with China . That you don ' t have to be skinny to lower our skyrocketing trade deficit . All you need is the nonjudgmental support of the American people . "
