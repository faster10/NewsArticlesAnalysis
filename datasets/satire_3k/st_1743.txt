" Just t ' other Daye , one of these brazen Birds did swoop down and steal from my Line a fine and healthy Trout fish , " lamented gentleman farmer Thomas Parker , of Virginia . " In the morn , when I ope the Flu to my Chimney , I am startled beyond Sense , as the Roome fills of a Sudden with the flapping and screeching of a DOZEN OR MORE of the winged Thinges . And in the Night Time , one lies awake on constant guard against a bald eagle flying throu a win dow and with its talons prancing our bodies up and down . "
