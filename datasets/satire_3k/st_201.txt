" We did what we do every year , " Erstad said . " We split the boys and girls up , and showed them the version of the film appropriate to their gender , so as not to overwhelm them with information about what ' s happening to the other sex . The Your Body And You tapes tell kids what ' s happening to their bodies at this time of life , with a special emphasis on disease and pregnancy . Then , we give the kids a pamphlet , usually on the last day of school , and there ' s a question and answer session , and that ' s it for another year . "
