" This one time , we needed a whole bunch of Wild Turkey and tonic water for a study that was just getting going at midnight , so we sent him out to this store that ' s open until 2 a . m . , and we ' re waiting for , like , hours until he finally comes back , and he doesn ' t have any of the stuff , but he ' s carrying this big railroad crossing sign , and he ' s all like , ' Guys , check out the sign I found . ' It was funny as shit . I swear , I was laughing so hard , I almost left a urine sample all over my pants . "
