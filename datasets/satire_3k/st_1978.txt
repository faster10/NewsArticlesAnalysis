" I can ' t believe he ' s finally heading out on his own , " said Veronica Hunt , 17 , adding that her father was only able to bring a few items from the house , including his favorite DVDs , an old box fan , a few mismatched utensils , and an unwanted futon from the basement . " We knew this day was coming , but there ' s still nothing you can do to prepare yourself for it . I kept it together while we were getting him settled , but on the drive back home , the tears just started flowing . It ' ll be hard tonight knowing he ' s not asleep right there in the bedroom down the hall . "
