A nationwide marketing campaign of television commercials , print ads , and billboards is scheduled to debut this week . One 30 second commercial shows a rugged cowboy on horseback driving cattle and ripping the lid off a yogurt container to the resounding crack of a bullwhip . As he tries to spoon out the yogurt , his utensil snaps , causing him to stare despondently into the cup until a gruff older cowboy rides up and hands him a ladle from his saddlebag . Another ad depicts a Texas Ranger in a high speed chase with a man in a stolen car , whom he runs off the road , catches on foot , wrestles to the ground , and arrests . A fellow Ranger arrives moments later and tosses him a cup of Musky Blueberry Blast , which he guzzles before wiping his brow and throwing the suspect in the back of his patrol car .
