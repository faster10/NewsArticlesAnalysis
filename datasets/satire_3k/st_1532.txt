" I do not particularly enjoy absolving humans of their earthly transgressions I prefer to punish the wicked , hold grudges for thousands of years , curse entire regions and ethnicities for the sins of a few , and so forth , " said God , Our Father . " I typically ignore the words and deeds of the repentant and make a concerted effort to restrict any such individual from ever taking my side in the Kingdom of Heaven . I also take particular satisfaction , even glee , in repeatedly punishing those who have sinned at any point in their lives and are endeavoring to gain my forgiveness through prayer and good works .
