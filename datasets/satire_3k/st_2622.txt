" Ever since I was a kid , I haven ' t been able to stop wearing my down jacket until I see a UPS man in shorts , " said Virginia Bourne , who , as office manager for a Buffalo law firm , signs for packages daily . " This year , I still haven ' t seen one , but something tells me today might be the day . UPS delivery driver Russ Zorn should be doing a drop off pick up around 3 p . m . , and I ' ve got a good feeling . "
