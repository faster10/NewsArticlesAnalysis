Thatcher said he theorized that the dude must have been a buddy of Bogen ' s , as third roommate Josh Friesz was out of town with his girlfriend for the entire weekend . At one point , he leaned over the sleeping guy in an effort to get a better look at his face , which was shielded against the sunlight with his forearm . Thatcher also studied the height of the individual and concluded that the guy was way too tall to be Lee , Juan or Skeeter , friends of the roommates who likely were up late partying with Bogen the previous evening .
