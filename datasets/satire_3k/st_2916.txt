" As presidential speechwriters , whenever a catastrophe occurs , it ' s our responsibility to come up with a reassuring address that draws on the positive character of the afflicted region , but with Ft . Lauderdale , that might be a little tough , " said head speechwriter Cody Keenan , adding that nothing about the small coastal city is particularly conducive to inspiring a battered nation in the wake of disaster . " The fact is , if your job is pointing to the unique identity of a community as a symbol of everything that makes this country great , you ' re going to find yourself in a bit of a bind if your source material is Ft . Lauderdale . "
