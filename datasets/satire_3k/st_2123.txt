Despite its many benefits , the project is not without its detractors . " What the city of Los Angeles is doing is nothing less than an inhuman , criminal violation of the public interest , " Fifth District Councilman Marv Salerno said . " Under the current plan , the city would need to siphon over 12 , 000 minority citizens a day just to meet its estimated minimum needs . At that rate , L . A . will have completely exhausted its available supply of minorities by the year 2002 . What we need is a sensible long term minority conservation policy that will ensure the annual regrowth of enough new minority residents to provide us with an indefinite supply of renewable human water sources .
