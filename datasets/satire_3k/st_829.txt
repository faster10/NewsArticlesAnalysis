" Joe is the only person who can beat me at Star Wars Trivial Pursuit . He knows the English lyrics to ' Lapti Nek . ' He was also the one who told me that Uncle Owen is really Obi Wan ' s brother , which came as quite a surprise , because , like most people , I had always assumed that Owen was Anakin ' s brother . I did , however , inform Joe that Bruce Boa , the actor who played General Rieekan , also played the guy on Fawlty Towers who wanted the Waldorf salad . Joe did not know that . "
