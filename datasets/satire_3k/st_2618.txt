" Why should I be made to feel like some kind of monster , just because I happen to own a van , and enjoy driving that van around the city , with maybe a little puppy or an adorable kitty cat in the backseat ? " said Chicago area stranger Dale Phelan , adding that it ' s wrong to judge people based on how they look , or the fact that they ' ve never had a serious relationship their whole adult lives . " I ' ve heard some of the terrible things people say about us strangers , and to be honest , not only is it hurtful , but the whole thing just makes me feel kind of sad . "
