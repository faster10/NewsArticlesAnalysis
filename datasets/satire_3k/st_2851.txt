" Please , take a long look and explore the many flaws inherent in the corporeal body reflect for a moment on how quickly our trivial concerns are brushed aside by decay and change , " Ronzo said as he slowly twirled his pale form before the crowd . " Indeed , entropy and chaos constantly bear down on us at every second of every day . To think , at one moment you can be on your way to take a nice , hot shower , and the next your front door can slam behind you after you thought you heard the dog trying to get in . But do not take these simple facts as a curse view them as an opportunity , as an affirmation of why it is so important to live , and to live lustily , with fire and passion in your hearts ! So please , go home , hold your loved ones tightly , and take careful stock of those things that are truly important to you . "
