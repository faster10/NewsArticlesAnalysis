" They kept wanting to play more and more gigs , and I felt like if we wanted to land a record deal , what I needed to do was stay home and write some strong new material , " Eiler said . " Even Jill had stopped going to see us because she said she was getting sick of hearing the same songs and she was our number one fan . Finally , they said I had to make more time for shows or they ' d get a new guitarist . I was like , ' Screw you guys , ' and left . Jill pointed out that the band wasn ' t really going anywhere anyway , and that I was better off in no band at all than one made up of a bunch of unambitious losers . "
