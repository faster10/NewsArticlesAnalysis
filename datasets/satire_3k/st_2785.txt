" Not all the news is bad , " FBI assistant director Paula Witherspoon , a special agent in charge of major metropolitan crimes , said yesterday . " The theft of major Rodin sculptures from the Museum of Modern Art by a well trained group of quarterback masterminds , while tragic , resulted in no loss of life , and we are currently questioning Tom Brady in the incident . The city of Green Bay has reported nothing worse than a 700 percent increase in public drunkenness . And we should all be proud of the citizens of Detroit , who managed to capture the Detroit Lions during a bank robbery in which the team forgot to load its guns and put gas in its getaway cars . "
