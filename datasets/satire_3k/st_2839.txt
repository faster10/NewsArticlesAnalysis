" Kids today are told , over and over , by their classmates , their siblings , and images on TV and in magazines , that normal , mainstream behavior isn ' t ' cool , ' " institute director and study co chair Iris Evantine said . " The message these kids are receiving is : ' C ' mon , don ' t you want to be different like us ? ' Sadly , kids who resist these pressures to be different are usually ostracized . For the average teenager these days , the pressure not to do what everyone else does is enormous , and often unbearable . "
