To her advantage , Shore already has " tons " of experience working with children . " My sister Megan has two kids , Ashley and Andrew , and I just love them to pieces , " Shore said . " Whenever Megan goes out , I babysit for her , and me and Ashley and Andrew just have a complete blast . Sometimes , I seriously think I have more fun playing with blocks and coloring than they do . I just get so into it . My friends say I ' m still totally a six year old at heart . "
