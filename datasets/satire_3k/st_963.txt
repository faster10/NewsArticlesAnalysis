Read the EPA report : " The planet Earth stands on the brink of one of the most devastating global extinctions in history . By the year 2040 , nearly two thirds of all current species will be extinct . Rainforest habitats that were once lush canopies of life , sustaining millions of highly specialized and interdependent species of plants and animals , have been reduced by upwards of 95 percent in some areas . Thankfully , however , retail outlets which , as little as 50 years ago , were the domain of only a handful of basic staple goods , have evolved into lush , highly developed supermarkets and department stores with a nearly limitless abundance of consumer goods .
