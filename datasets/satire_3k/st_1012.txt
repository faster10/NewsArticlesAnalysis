" I heard a sound coming from a far off clearing . Hoping it was a hunter or camper , I headed toward it , " Clinton said . " As I got closer , I heard some rustling sounds , and I shouted hello . But when I did , a creature came charging at me . I am not sure what it was : It looked like a bear , but it was gray and not quite big enough to be a bear . I ran for approximately 50 yards , but it caught me when I tripped over a log . I tried to get up and continue to run , but my ankle was pinned . "
