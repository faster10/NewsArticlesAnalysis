" On the ladder of toy desirability , promotional toys are the lowest rung , " said Daniel Nestor , author of Bins Of Despair . " They are the shoddiest and , by virtue of their promotional nature , most dated and disposable . A child who finds a McDonald ' s action figure of an Asian warrior at Goodwill is highly unlikely to recognize him as a character from Mulan , and it would take a movie trivia whiz of the highest order to know that his name is Captain Li Shang . Removed from the context of the movie and the corresponding Happy Meal box , the toy becomes that much more pitiful and obsolete than its non promotional counterpart . "
