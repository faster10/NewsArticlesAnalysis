A nationwide advertising campaign for the new medication is slated to begin next week . In the first of two 30 second TV spots , a woman is shown walking outside on a winter ' s day and coming upon a puppy that has frozen to death . As she stares unblinkingly at the small , frail carcass , a disembodied announcer tells viewers : " Don ' t spend another day unable to shed a single tear for the eternal tragedy that is existence . Embrace the pain . Advil pain . It ' s the only thing that ' s real . "
