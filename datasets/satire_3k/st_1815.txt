" Christmas is a magical time of year when people of all ages and backgrounds put aside their differences and are reminded of the things that truly count : the joy of giving , the gleam in a young child ' s eye , and the sound of voices raised together in song , " said James Samuelson of the Hartford based Institute For American Cultural Mores Values , which tracks the rise and fall of human love and kindness throughout the year . " Mid January to early February , by contrast , is a magical time of year when people forget all about that stuff . This leads to mid to late February , a magical time of year when people everywhere feel overpowering , soul crushing emotional pain , causing them to hate their coworkers , their loved ones , and themselves .
