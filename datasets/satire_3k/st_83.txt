" I ' m excited to bring my Emmy Award winning writing to the field of animation , " Sorkin said in a speech before approximately 30 , 000 screaming fans , many of whom were dressed up in the business suit costumes of their favorite Sorkin characters . " The costs of live action production restricted me to a set only slightly larger than the actual White House and an ensemble cast of under 15 actors . But animation technology will enable us to provide fans with extended 40 minute walk and talks , digitally compressed dialogue for faster delivery , and a cast of over 70 main characters . My vision will finally be presented in its truest , most uncompromised form . "
