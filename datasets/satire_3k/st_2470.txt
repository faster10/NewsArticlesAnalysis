" Yesterday I had a wonderful , hour long conversation about how crazy contestant Andrew D ' Ambrosi on Top Chef is , but at least he adds an interesting dynamic to the show , " Deirdre Miles , 26 , of Sacramento said . " It was such a relief to know that nobody would be bringing up superdelegates , the Pennsylvania primary , or John McCain ' s comment about having our troops in Iraq for the next 100 years . I ' ve got two brothers fighting over there , so that is the last thing I want to think about right now . "
