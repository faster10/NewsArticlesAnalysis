" I ' ve got some stories that would curl your hair , believe me , " Polone told Garrick , who half listened while twirling his apron strings . " One time at this place in Orlando , we were short staffed , and I had to do all the dishes myself . Just as we were closing , this party of 15 comes in . Now , you ' d think I ' d be screwed , but about half an hour earlier , I ' d overheard the host confirming their reservation over the phone , so I had a bit of lead time . The lesson there is , always stay on top of what ' s going on out front . Awareness is key . "
