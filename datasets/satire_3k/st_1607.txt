" We want to get these people as riled up as possible , so we ' ll be going in big and going in fast , " ATF agent Greg Lornberry said of the plan to use a large and dramatic show of force to take away the citizen ' s lawfully purchased assault weapons , handguns , shotguns , and hunting rifles , as well as every single round of his ammunition . " We intend to burst through the front door and the back door simultaneously in full tactical gear while screaming , We ' re here to take them all . " ' Then we ' ll pin the guy down , round up every gun he owns , and tell him right to his face that he ' d better let his friends know we ' re coming for theirs next . "
