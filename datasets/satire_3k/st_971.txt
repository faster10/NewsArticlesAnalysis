" I absolutely realize where she ' s at in life , " Campbell said regarding the 12 year old girl who has seen The Wild Bunch . " I don ' t care if she likes boy bands , but there are plenty out there that have some artistic merit : the Monkees , the Beach Boys , the Jackson 5 . Come on , each of those guys is cuter than the next , and they ' re slightly talented , at least . I ' d even be okay with Peter Frampton if she were really adamant about it , especially his early stuff with Humble Pie . "
