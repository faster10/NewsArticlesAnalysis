" Up until about 1890 , Lewanaho County was famed across north central Wisconsin for its sugar beet production , " said Pavlik , 37 , the county ' s unofficial historian . " But two factors put an end to its predominance : a blight which wiped out much of the beet crop in 1891 and 1893 , and a growing interest in cranberry farming , which was ideal for Lewanaho County ' s vast tracts of marshy land . Incidentally , I should mention that the blight was bacterial in origin , and not a fungus , as some of the old timers in our community would have you believe . "
