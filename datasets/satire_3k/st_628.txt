" Virgil was born in the year 70 B . C . let ' s see , that would be during the consulship of Gnaeus Pompeius The Great and Marcus Licinius Crassus , if I ' m not mistaken , " Bush said . " It is said that while Virgil ' s mother was with child , she dreamt she gave birth to a laurel branch , which , upon touching the ground , sprang up into a full grown tree , its branches laden with ripe fruits and flowers . The next morning , she gave birth to Virgil . The legend goes that Virgil was born without crying , so mild was his countenance . "
