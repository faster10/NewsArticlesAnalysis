" We knew we had something special when we found the largely intact section of the pretzel ' s upper left arc , but it wasn ' t until we arranged it alongside several smaller fragments that we realized just how significant this find was , " said lead researcher Dr Brian Michener , describing the process by which his team methodically mapped and staked off the nearly 30 square foot expanse of asphalt across which most of the snack ' s remains were spread . " Of course , it ' s important to understand that there is a lot we still don ' t know . Had this pretzel ever been slathered in some kind of processed cheese sauce ? Was it a stand alone snack or part of some kind of party mix ?
