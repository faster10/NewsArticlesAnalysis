Shortly after dipping into his daughter ' s college tuition fund to put a down payment on a Mazda Miata in July , Kauske met Kari Helgenberger , 23 , at J . P . McBleacher ' s , a sports bar where Kari works as a waitress . " Kari ' s incredible . She lights up every room she walks into , " Kauske said . " Sure , I did have reservations at first after all , she is only a few years older than my daughter . But she ' s incredibly mature for her age we went to the Detroit Institute of Arts the other day and , I swear , she knew more about the paintings than I did . "
