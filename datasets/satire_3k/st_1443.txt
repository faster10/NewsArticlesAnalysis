" Now is not the time for such divisive , destructive things as dialogue and debate , " McCain said . " Now is not the time for , ' My opinion is just as valid as yours , ' and ' What are my country ' s leaders doing and why ? ' and ' I have a question , Mr President . ' Now is the time for one thing and one thing only : The defense of the American democratic ideal . Any and all who disagree with this directive , or who have different ideas about how it should be accomplished , should learn to shut their mouths . "
