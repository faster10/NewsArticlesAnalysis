" God was the first to approach the Jewish people with a ' covenant ' contract that guaranteed they would be the most favored in His eyes , and He handed down standards of morality , cleanliness , and personal conduct that exceeded anything else practiced at the time , " lead defense attorney Patrick Childers said . " He readily admits to being a ' jealous ' God , not because He is threatened by the prospect of competition from other gods , but because He is utterly convinced of the righteousness of His cause and that He is the best choice for mortals . Many of these so called gods could care less if somebody bears false witness or covets thy neighbor ' s wife . Our client , on the other hand , is truly a ' People ' s God . ' "
