" At Space Camp , each attendee experiences the trials of real life astronauts who simply are not provided the resources they need to explore outer space , " said director Deborah Barnhart , noting that campers get a firsthand look at what it ' s like to pursue cutting edge astronomical research on a budget that , when adjusted for inflation , is a mere fraction of what it was in the 1960s . " Our campers endure constant setbacks throughout their week here , from engaging in spaceflight training modules that can be shut down at a moment ' s notice , to working tirelessly on a solar probe project only to be informed that an across the board spending freeze has led to the indefinite suspension of their work .
