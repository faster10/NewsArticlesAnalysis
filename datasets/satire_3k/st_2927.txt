" President Obama has become a monstrous freak of economics , and he must be neutralized , " said U . S . National Guard chief Gen . Frank Grass , who is leading efforts to subdue the genetically altered head of the executive branch . " By carving a swath of destruction across the Northeast , he may have already created more infrastructure repair jobs than American workers can fill . We have readied numerous armored divisions around the nation ' s key financial and manufacturing assets , and we ' ll be sending in a squadron of Apache attack helicopters to confront him directly . I have given the order to take him out if necessary . "
