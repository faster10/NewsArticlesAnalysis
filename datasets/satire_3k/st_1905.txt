" Well , look at that ! " Gordon said , grinning as he examined an illuminated license plate frame bearing his likeness , signature , and yellow number 24 . " That there ' s a real nice piece of tackle . I ' ll bet you could put one of my collectible laser cut license plates in there and display it in your house . That ' d look good next to your Jeff Gordon Collectible Shot Glass or your set of diecast 24 cars . Get a second one for your car , to match your Jeff Gordon Floormats and Jeff Gordon DuPont Racing Keychain , and you ' ll be good to go . "
