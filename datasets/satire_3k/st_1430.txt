" Observant fans sometimes point out that a character named Michael Corleone appears in all three movies and that he ' s played by Al Pacino each time , and I can assure you that ' s no coincidence , " said Coppola , who noted that " all the puzzle pieces are there " for anyone who looks hard enough at the three motion pictures . " In fact , those aren ' t three different people , but rather one character who appears three times . Michael in New York in the first film , Michael in Lake Tahoe in the second one , then Michael back in Manhattan in the third they ' re the very same man . "
