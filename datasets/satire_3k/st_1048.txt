" Five years ago , we lost Dale Earnhardt , a great racer , a great champion , and a great friend , when he hit the wall here at Daytona for the last time , " said NASCAR president Mike Helton said at a press conference held to announce construction of the 1 . 3 million Armco and cement memorial barrier . " This Sunday , the entire field of the 2006 Daytona 500 will honor his memory when , on the very first lap of the Great American Race , they run full speed toward the wall that will forever bear his name . "
