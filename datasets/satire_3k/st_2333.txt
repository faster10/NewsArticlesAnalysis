" I know about government log jams , " Mullins said . " I ' ve dealt with log jams all my life . When something is holding up the processes of our democracy , you ' ve just got to get in there with a broom and clean out all that muck that ' s been collecting . Just take the stick end of a broom to it and scrape out all that gunk all that dirt and grease and hair and gristle and chunks of Lord knows what , beaks and feet and other what have you . "
