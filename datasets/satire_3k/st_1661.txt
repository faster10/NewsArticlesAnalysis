" Some people may say that U . S . News World Report ' s commitment to incisive , cutting edge news reportage , and all the fun that entails , is excessive or immoral , " the 72 year old Zuckerman said . " In fact , Calvin Trillin wrote a very critical piece in last week ' s Time about us probably because he was mad he wasn ' t invited but such condemnations of the newsgathering lifestyle are both hypocritical and unenlightened . There ' s no reason reporting the news can ' t retain the fantasy element it had when we were in our teens and 20s . News should be informative , but also sexy and fun . That ' s always been my magazine ' s approach , and it ' s the only way to get unbiased , comprehensive coverage while remaining young at heart . "
