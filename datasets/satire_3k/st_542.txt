" We still have a strong barrel , a proud barrel , and we ' ve got a long way to go before we get to the bottom of it , " U . S . Sen . Mike Dewine ( R OH ) said . " Rep . Cooper is well meaning , but needlessly alarmist . For example , we haven ' t even begun to exhaust the potential of scraping the bottom of other cultures ' barrels overseas . There are enormous resources waiting to be scraped at the bottom of Japan ' s barrel alone . Just look at the enduring multimedia popularity of those Power Rangers guys . We need to look at this optimistically : The barrel isn ' t 99 . 9999 percent empty , it ' s . 0001 percent full . "
