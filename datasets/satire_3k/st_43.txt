" It was an amazing weekend , and I think the school would be a really good fit for me , " said Pince , who had previously determined that the individualized attention of a liberal arts college would suit him better than a school with tens of thousands of undergraduates , but has reportedly changed his mind following the visit in which he spent a total of 25 minutes walking through the actual campus . " My buddy Jeff ' s dorm room is pretty nice . He has a mini fridge that he keeps some food and beers in , and he introduced me to some guys on his floor who all seemed pretty cool . His roommate even skipped a lecture to hang out with us . It ' s awesome to know you can do that . "
