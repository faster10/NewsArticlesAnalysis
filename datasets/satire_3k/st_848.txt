" Dasani comes in many forms , " Chen said . " On Earth , we find it in servings as small as four ounces or as large as a 48 liter multi pack . The first stows easily in your purse , and the latter is the life of the party . In between , there are other sizes perfect for a gym bag , a car ' s cupholder , or a child ' s lunch bag . Similarly , Dasani could have existed on Mars in various forms , like ice or vapor , and in many convenient locations , such as Martian oceans or the craters dotting the planet ' s surface . "
