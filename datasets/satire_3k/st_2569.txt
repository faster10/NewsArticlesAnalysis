According to the results of a recent NDAS " Who ' s A Good Boy ? " survey , dog owners are split roughly into three camps , with 40 percent favoring " What a pretty , pretty , pretty boy " and 31 percent holding that " You ' re such a puppy ! " The final 29 percent argued that the correct answer is , " You are such a stinker , a stinker , a stinky dinky dinker ! " The NDAS survey did not , however , include members of The Pat Pat League , an extremist group that wants entirely non verbal resolutions to the issue , including play wrestling , head rubbing , fur tousling , chin scritching , and even great big hugs .
