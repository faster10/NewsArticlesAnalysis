" Think about it , " said Dartmouth College political science chair Dr Kent Finlayson . " A seven headed dragon with ten horns whose arrival heralds the Age of Armageddon and the time of tribulation ? Who , furthermore , will decree that all who swear allegiance to him be affixed with the Number of the Beast , which is 666 ? It just makes perfect sense . There must be some logical explanation as to why this beast hasn ' t surfaced to torment the earth . If we simply remain calm and avoid jumping to conclusions based on things we don ' t yet understand , I ' m confident we ' ll find out why through research and clear headed analysis . "
