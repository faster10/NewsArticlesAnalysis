" Basically , all the people with the last name Corleone who appear in the films are supposed to be related to each other , " said Coppola , recalling how during production he actually took the time to painstakingly map out the entire fictitious Corleone family tree that runs through all three projects . " For instance , Santino Jr . from the third film is the grandson of Vito from the first film , played by Marlon Brando , who is meant to be an older version of Robert de Niro ' s character of Vito Corleone from the second film . It sounds confusing , but believe me , this is something we actually planned out . "
