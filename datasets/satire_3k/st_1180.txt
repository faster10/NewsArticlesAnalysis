" We ' ll be adding a little height to the rises for more ramp effect and raising the curbs a bit for better rebound , so the cars stay in the intersection where the action is , " Caltrans spokesman Fred Wendell said . " And we ' ll be adding more cameras in this intersection , switching the ones we already have to high resolution color , and making sure the area is shot from at least three angles at all times and the footage saved to disk . This intersection is a bomb waiting to go off , but it could still be better . "
