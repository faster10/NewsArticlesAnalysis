" This is my first internship , and I feel like Mike has kind of taken me under his wing , " said Bennett , who falsely assumes that other employees like and respect Fryer as much as she does , and that being taken under Fryer ' s wing might somehow be an advantageous thing for her career . " He ' s obviously worked here for years and knows how everything works , so he ' s a great resource in that respect . But we ' re also friends , so we can have fun and chat about random stuff , too . "
