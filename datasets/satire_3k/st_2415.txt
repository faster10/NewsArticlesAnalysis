" At a certain point I started wondering if I was even doing the hajj correctly , " said Marikh , adding that while performing the Sa ' i , in which pilgrims traverse back and forth between the al Safa and al Marwah mountains , he was " just going through the motions by the end . " " Everyone else seemed to be having these incredibly deep spiritual reawakenings falling to their knees in prayer , or hugging complete strangers , or weeping uncontrollably , that kind of thing . So I guess I was the only one who didn ' t really get it . I ' m not sure why , but for whatever reason it just didn ' t do it for me . "
