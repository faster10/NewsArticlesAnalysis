Besides the usual maiden mother crone conflicts , the strained relationship between Birch ' s sister , Pythia , who recently converted to Wicca , and his father , a devout Dionysian , is another source of tension , according to Birch . " Last year , Pythia brought her covenmate home , and Dad ' s still having a hard time with it , " Birch said . " It ' s obvious that he doesn ' t approve of her lifestyle . He ' s always asking her why doesn ' t she find a nice warlock to settle down with , or telling her maybe what she really needs is a good old fashioned bacchanalia . Are other pagan families like this ? "
