According to Paulson , the idea that his friends had not slowly disbanded started to become clear to him after seeing that first photo of the men with their arms around each other , cutting up for the camera just as they might have a decade ago . Following the initial discovery , Paulson reportedly looked through more social media posts , where he found additional pictures showing the group playing Frisbee and grilling together on Bannen ' s back porch , noting with surprise that the dates on the images were mostly from the past three years a period in which Paulson said he hadn ' t seen a single one of his old friends in person .
