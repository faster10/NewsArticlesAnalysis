" God , can you even imagine the rallies that will be held in Washington after this , with everyone chanting about government overreach and constitutional rights ? They ' re going to be so worked up , " said acting ATF director Thomas Brandon , adding that he ' s already excited at the thought of the fundraising letter the National Rifle Association will send out after the operation . " I swear , every anti gun control protester will be carrying a photo of the man whose house we hit and calling him a hero . I can already picture all the guys in cowboy hats and camo shirts giving speech after speech about how they won ' t back down and how they ' re ready to fight back . Oh , boy , they ' ll probably shout so much they ' ll get all red in the face , too . "
