" Everyone my age has a story about where they were when JFK was assassinated , and I ' m no exception , " said Denton , emphasizing that his memories of the Friday morning in which he shouldered his M14 rifle , brought the presidential motorcade into his sights , and sent a bullet into the brain of the 35th president of the United States remain as vivid as ever . " I remember I was in Dallas at the time . Specifically , I was positioned behind a fence at street level in Dealey Plaza right when I gunned down the president . "
