According to engineers , the driverless car features an advanced Culpability Evasion System , which rapidly utilizes front , side , and rear mounted cameras to determine whether the other vehicle involved in the collision sustained any visible scrapes or dents and survey the area for eyewitnesses . Technicians confirmed that the self driving vehicle ' s onboard computer calculates within several microseconds of the crash if its own actions are to blame , and if it finds it is at fault , it then initiates a strategy to floor it and speed onto a major roadway before the police arrive .
