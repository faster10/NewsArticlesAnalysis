" I am truly sorry for the inappropriate , untrue , and hurtful things I wrote about the moon , " Bolden said at a press conference from Johnson Space Center , adding that he was vacating his post immediately so that NASA could quickly begin the search for a leader who " better embodies the agency ' s high standard of conduct . " " My words were poorly chosen and do not reflect my true feelings about the moon nor the beliefs of the dedicated men and women at NASA . The moon has been integral not just to our nation ' s space program , but also to Earth itself , regulating tides and stabilizing the planet ' s rotational axis for billions of years . "
