" It ' s still far too common for a person who knows she ' s sick to enter her symptoms and get a response back from the web site that says nothing ' s wrong , " Hartley said . " If that happens , you should get a second opinion from a different site . Or maybe take stock of your physical state again . You may have missed something that would alter your diagnosis . Or , if a web site is asking you ' yes or no ' questions about the symptoms you ' re experiencing , just say yes to all of them . That way , you ' ll get a wider list of diseases , conditions , or syndromes you might have . "
