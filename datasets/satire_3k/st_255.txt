" The pretzel ' s larger size clearly sets it apart from the smaller , or mini ' variety , which are generally found in groups , " said Dr Bethany Folta , who worked on the laboratory team that was tasked with classifying the discovery within the broader pretzel taxonomic category . " At the same time , it ' s not nearly as mammoth as members of the fresh baked soft pretzel family , while the absence of a honey mustard coating was enough for us to rule out all known subtypes of Rold Gold and Gardetto ' s pretzels . Only after laboratory testing of its gluten content were we able to determine that it was a Snyder ' s and not its close cousin , the Utz Sourdough Special . "
