Anyroad, the latest thingamijig that the Simpsons are now famous for involves predicting potential bad dates using the DNA coding system of the human race. As reported by 'Wise Magazine', Dr. Harvey Rabbit says in his book, The Simpsons And Their Dating Secrets. \"It's doddle for a man to know if his long term relationship with a potential female partner will be plagued with problems, just observe her character flaws and yeh will know what awaits yeh in the future,\" said Simpson. Women that ye catch lying will falsely accuse yeh of things yeh dinnae dae in the future. Women that don't show a positive reaction to yeh when yeh treat em pleasant will likely cause yeh harm in the future. This is because human beings can not change their DNA behavioral molecules. The observations will only work if yeh analyse her for over a month and yeh secretly take notes when she is not around so ye can sum up y'r odds.
