Palin’s Son Offered WWE Wrestling Contract
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has signed a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) contract. According to a report in Wrestling News, the WWE is hoping to cash in on the youngster’s reputation for brawling, following a well-publicized fight at a house party in September. A police report released Thursday says Track arrived at the party shirtless, “heavily intoxicated” and “belligerent.” After other guests insulted his sister, he reportedly started throwing punches. He left the house with “a bloody mouth and injuries under his left eye and on his left elbow.” The police report sparked interest by the WWE and soon contacted the eldest son to sign a development contract. Although reluctant at first, Track soon recognized the opportunity. “All the other members of my family have turned stupid white trash behavior into lucrative careers,” he told the press. “So why can’t I?” Palin is currently at the WWE’s training center in Orlando to begin his career in the NXT league. The 21-year-old will reportedly be known as “The Rogue American.” In the NXT league, the tough guy from Alaska can hone this in-ring wrestling ability and practice microphone talking skills before being brought up to the major league, WWE Raw and Smackdown. Triple H, real name Paul Michael Levesque, the head of development and COO,  told Wrestling Inc., “His finishing maneuver will be a submission hold called ‘The Palin Quitter.’ It’s basically a modified ‘Texas Cloverleaf’ that really locks it in.” “He’s only 24 and will have time to grow. I know he’s excited to be here and we are very excited for him to be part of the WWE family. We are a little nuts here in the WWE but we know he’s already used to being around a crazy family so it will be just like home.”
