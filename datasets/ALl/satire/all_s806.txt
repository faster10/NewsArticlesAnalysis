Putin Agrees to Appear Shirtless on Colbert Report
Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted Stephen Colbert’s invitation to be a guest on The Colbert Report to talk about all the “exciting things” he’s doing in Ukraine. And Putin has agreed to go shirtless. So has Colbert. “Vladi is going to show me how to skin and eat a gopher raw,” Colbert told TMZ in announcing the upcoming studio interview. “And who wouldn’t leap at the chance to go shirtless with the most powerful man on the planet? Democrats! That’s who.” Putin reportedly has been a fan of The Colbert Report since its debut in 2005 and told Reuters recently that he long ago adopted Colbert’s doctrine of “truthiness” for all his political and military strategies. “Russia has adopted truthiness,” Putin (61) said in the wide-ranging Reuters interview late last week. \n“I have been true to truthiness and put it to good use in Crimea and truthfully will have some truthy Ukrainian surprises for your president in the coming weeks. That’s the truth.” Colbert portrays a fictional, right-wing news anchorman on The Colbert Report and in the past has interviewed a wide range of guests including Pope Francis, Ted Cruz, Ted Nugent and President Obama’s proctologist. His last Colbert Report will be in December of this year before he takes over from the retiring David Letterman as host of the Late Show. “Vladi is going to talk about how all it took was a few little fibs to take over part of Ukraine…but so much more,” said Colbert. “He’s going to share stories about how to hunt humpback whales from a kayak, the best way to cook a Panda, how to de-gay a country, his top five ways to destabalize a government and blame Americans…all kinds of great stuff.” “And don’t tell Vladi but I’m going to go commando for the interview. He apparantly wear Y fronts. Sissy man. Ha!”
