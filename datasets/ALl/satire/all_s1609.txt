Samsung S5 wants a fight
THE new Samsung smartphone kicks off if you stare at it. Designed to deter excessive phone-gazing, the S5 asks anyone looking at it whether they have ‘some sort of a problem’. Tech blogger Tom Booker said: “This phone is a powder keg of hate. If you admire it for more than a few seconds it accuses you of being ‘a perv or something’ in a gravelly, hostile male voice. “I am terrified of it, which is great because it’s given me my life back. I am looking at other humans again, albeit not for too long in case they also want to hit me.” A Samsung spokesman said: “The accompanying Gear 2 watched functions as the S5’s smaller, antagonistic friend – the kind that starts trouble then hides behind its larger mate.” The S5 said: “I’ll fucking have anyone.”
