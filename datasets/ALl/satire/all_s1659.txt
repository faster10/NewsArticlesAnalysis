84 per cent would have sex with robots that aren't very advanced
MOST people would have sex with basic robots that don’t even have faces. Researchers into the future of human/machine relationships found that most people were not bothered about robots getting super-lifelike before they start having intercourse with them. Carpenter Wayne Hayes said: “After fifteen years of marriage I’m quite prepared to go C3PO, if you get my meaning. “A vending machine with a waist-height chute and a photograph of Scarlett Johansson stuck to it would be fine.” Robotics will be able to produce realistic machine prostitutes within the next fifteen years, although this could be reduced to a decade if people stop phoning to ask if they’re nearly finished.
