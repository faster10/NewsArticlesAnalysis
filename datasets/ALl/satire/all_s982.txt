Daniel Radcliffe willing to get off with Emma Watson if JK Rowling fancies a re-write
Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has admitted that he would be willing to endure a love scene with Emma Watson if JK Rowling fancied re-writing the end of the boy wizard series. After Rowling admitted that hero Harry was probably a better fit for Hermione than the ginger one she ended up with, Radcliffe said he couldn’t agree more. An eager Radcliffe told reporters, “It’s all about the artistic integrity of the story, and ensuring that the real Harry Potter fans get what they need to be truly fulfilled when completing the movie series.” “If that requires me to find a few days in my extremely busy schedule and spend them frolicking in the nude with Emma Watson, then I will do it. I am an artist, and a professional.” “I’m just saying that after 8 films we could probably add in a bit at the end showing Harry and Hermione making a few little Harrys.” “Maybe for the DVD box set?” “This type of thing is not without precedent, I mean they went and added Hayden Christensen at the end of the Return of the Jedi DVD.” “I’m just saying we should do the same, just with a bit more mood lighting, and lots and lots of takes.” Rupert Grint who plays Ron Weasley in the films admitted he would disappointed to see his character lose Hermione to Harry, but insisted it raised some interesting themes to explore in a new addition to the movie franchise. He told reporters, “I don’t know, I’m just brainstorming here, but maybe something like ‘Harry Potter After Dark’ in which these young adults are forced to explore their sexuality with spells and toys and lubricant in wizard costumes and to a bass heavy soundtrack?” “I dunno, I haven’t really thought about it that much.” “But look, If you can get Emma then I’m definitely in.”
