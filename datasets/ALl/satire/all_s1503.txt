MEDIA METRIX CHANGES MEASUREMENT TERMS
Internet audience measurement firm Media Metrix, seeking to differentiate itself from competitors NetRatings and PC Data, announced yesterday it will no longer use the term “unique visitors” in reference to site traffic, but will instead use the term “poached slinky nuts.” No explanation was given for the change.
