Adam Sandler cheetah attack film voted his funniest work
Footage showing a cheetah attacking Hollywood star Adam Sandler whilst on safari in Africa, has been voted his funniest work. The incident, which occurred when he was invited to go into an enclosure with a range of rescued animals, was hailed by film experts as the best thing he’s done in years. Film fan, Michael Hay, recalled the moment when the cheetah lunged at the American with unremitting fondness. “I couldn’t stop smiling when I first saw it, it looked so real.” “I was still pretty sure it was just a trailer showing the best bit of two-hour film in which he played a female version of himself on safari,” he told us. “But when I saw it was genuine life-endangering incident, I almost split my sides. It’s the first time I’ve genuinely laughed out loud at Adam Sandler film.” “It was so much funnier than ‘Grown-ups 1 & 2′.” Hay said he was looking forward with excitement to the sequel, hoping it contained more blood and guts. “They say never go back, but in this instance I disagree.” “Of course they could change the lead for a couple of co-stars to make it even more entertaining.” “Yeah, a couple of crocodiles should do the trick.”
