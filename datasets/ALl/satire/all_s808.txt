Harper Sends Neil Young a Jar of Vaseline
The war of words between rock/folk star Neil Young and Prime Minister Stephen Harper over Alberta’s oil sands took a distinctly odd and uncomfortable turn early today when a package was delivered to Young’s Calgary hotel by federal security staff. The small box contained a jar of Vaseline petroleum jelly and a hand-written note on letterhead printed and embossed with “From the desk of the Right Honourable Stephen J. Harper. Prime Minister of Canada.” “Harsh winters can chap a guy’s skin Neil. I recommend you give this a try.” The note was signed “Steve” and Mr. Young’s spokesperson Danielle Tyler made it and the jar of Vaseline available to media this morning in the lobby of the Fairmont Palliser Hotel where Young and his entourage are staying. “That’s a whole lot of creepy right there,” Tyler told CBC in a follow-up radio interview. “There is an obvious message if someone sends you a jar of Vaseline.” Young is nearing the end of a four-city concert tour to raise awareness and funds for the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation as they mount a legal challenge to Netherland-based Shell Global’s application to more than triple the output from their Jackpine oilsands facility. “The Prime Minister reached out on a personal level to Mr. Young with hopes he remembers how to deal with Canadian winters that have not warmed up since Mr. Young became an American,” said PMO Director of Communications Jason MacDonald. “The Prime Minister sincerely wants to make sure Neil Young does not get cracked lips.”
