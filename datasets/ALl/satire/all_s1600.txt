Iran Completes Military Exercise by Carving Giant Sudoku Puzzle Into Sand Around Afghanistan Border
Iran has been flexing its military muscles recently after sanctions were levied against them.  They strongly cautioned US naval ships to stay away and just completed additional military exercises on the border of Afghanistan.  Iranian leaders confirmed that they did order their troops to draw a large Sudoku puzzle in the sand for the Afghan’s to “chew on.” Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, had this news relayed to him while he was reading to children in Kabul.  Karzai quickly left the school, after saluting the children.  Afghan intelligence was quickly called upon to see what this thing was all about.  “I’m still reading the fucking rule book,” commented an angry and frustrated top level official.  “My team is telling me that people do this shit for fun?  That is very bad.  Very bad.  We need to figure out this puzzle to make sure Iran is not sending some sort of hidden message but I can assure you that these puzzles will not ever make it to our citizens.” Afghan border guards seemed to pick it up pretty quickly.  Two men were heard arguing about whether a #2 would fit in the 3rd column and the 4th row.  Unfortunately, the argument escalated and one man was shot and killed.  It won’t help the popularity of the game in Afghanistan.  That’s for sure. “It’s an unprecedented move by a confident Iran,” says John Brennan, director of the CIA in the United States.  “We’ve got our eyes on them.  We’re prepared to send in delta force units to go in and solve the puzzle for Afghan leaders if this tensions between the two countries continue to heighten.  If there’s going to be another war out there, we want to make sure that we’re part of it.”
