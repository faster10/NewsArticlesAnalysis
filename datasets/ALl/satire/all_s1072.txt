Kanye West Planning To Storm Oscar Stage If Beyonce Doesn't Win Best Actress Award
Rapper, trophy husband and all round 'cock' Kanye West, who reprized his infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, by unexpectedly taking the Staples Center stage as Beck was accepting the Album of the Year award has told friends (hangers on) that he plans to do the same at this years Oscar ceremony if Beyonce does not win the best actress award; despite the fact she has not been nominated, nor appeared in a movie since starring as Foxy Cleopatra in Austin Powers - Goldmember.  Beck, who also won Best Rock Album, seemed as surprised as the rest of the audience when he won the award and appeared to be looking around for help that's when West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down, but not before getting laughs from Beyoncé and her husband, Jay-Z. However, West wasn't laughing after the show, ranting that if Beyoncé does not win an Oscar, a Noble Peace Price, the Superbowl, the Fifa World Cup, Best in Show at The Westminster Dog Show, a Pulitzer Prize and the World Series of Baseball that he will once again cry and moan like a spoiled little cunt and storm the Oscar stage.  Appearing on the E! network's aftershow, West said, \"I just know that I am a spoiled pretentious little worm, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop me coming and being a total and utter prick to others, ruining their nights and forcing my personal opinion on others. Lets face it - I have no class, I am a complete tool. Cheers.\" The incident was an echo of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech.
