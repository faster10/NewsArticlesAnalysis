Getting out for a walk and being nice to others is the key to living
Ground breaking findings show that not being a complete self-absorbed tosser and going for modest walks in the local park are key to a happy life. Really?! It appears that you don't need to spend thousands a year in membership to a Gym , just moving your legs and arms in a cool new activity called ' walking' (not the 'power' kind, no leg weights required), will keep down your weight. And a heretofore non-hip practice, known as 'being civil', to other humans, can bring it's own reward, too. A non profit margin yielding thing, called 'smiling at and/or thinking of others, can help raise us above the status of dog-eat-dog animals and bring it's own MORAL reward. You don't have to do some bigged-up Twitter Charity 60000 km walk in the Andes, to care about your fellow human, while dismissing the local homeless man as a 'scrounger'. It's the little things that count.
