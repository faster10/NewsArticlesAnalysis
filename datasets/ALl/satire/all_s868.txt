Charlie’s Angels sequel to star bearded male cast
A controversial sequel to the popular Charlie’s Angels movie has been announced this week, with a cast comprising entirely of bearded men from the West Midlands. The unexpected twist on the 2000 blockbuster comes just days after director Paul Feig announced an all-female cast for the reboot of the 1984 classic Ghostbusters, much to the dismay of many dedicated fans. Many fans loyal to the widely watched 70s series and subsequent movie have already hit out at the news, claiming that it’s ‘political correctness gone mad’. ‘The character Natalie Cook played by Cameron Diaz is my favourite Angel’, explained super-fan Gemma Matthews. ‘She’s a brave, intelligent, strong and beautiful woman; a match for any man. Now she’s being portrayed by Dave Robins from Smethwick. He has a neck beard and a drinking problem’. Defending his decision, Joseph McGinty Nichol, who directed the film adaption fifteen-years ago, said: ‘Tell me, why do the Angels have to be tall, sexy women? Why can’t they be slightly overweight, piliferous blokes from in and around Birmingham? It’s 2015, man. I was hugely inspired by Feig’s bold move with Ghostbusters. It took courage and it demonstrates that we no longer have to suffer an entertainment industry that feels inclined to follow tired stereotypes’. ‘Feig of course has a bumpy road ahead, convincing his audience that a team of women are just as capable of catching wayward demons as a group of strong men are’. He added: ‘Similarly I also have hurdles to face, like squeezing Dave into a flowery mini-skirt and size three platform shoes, but as a skilled director it’s a challenge I’m willing to face’.
