Jennifer Lopez accused of being a cougar
An Alabama teen named Scarlett Johanson is accusing her ex-neighbor Jennifer Lopez of being a cougar for stalking her little brother Ryan.  The actress, 45, was linked to her Boy Next Door Ryan Johanson, 18, after appearing on a paparazzi photo together.  \"She needs to date men her age, she's robbing the cradle,\" Scarlett Johanson commented. Lopez denied the rumors and claims she only bought her next door neighbor a pair of Nike shoes which he desperately wanted.  During an interview she reassured Ellen DeGeneres that there's nothing going on with Ryan and she was not a predator cougar like many have portrayed her to be.  \"He's so fun. He's a real sweet. He's a gentleman,\" the movie star said of Ryan. \"We are doing all kinds of things together to help his future.\" \"So, there's nothing going on?\" DeGeneres asked. \"No, no, no,\" Lopez vowed. \"We skinny dipped together, but then later we went to church to ask forgiveness for our sins.\" \"We had some fun,\" the \"Booty\" singer added, \"and it was good.\" DeGeneres asked if Ryan's mother knows about their friendship, to which Lopez replied, \"I think she might. I'm not sure.\" After the audience laughed, the actress asked, \"What? I'm not in his pants like that.\" \"What the heck?\" she asked. \"What's going on around here?\"
