Russell Brand starting revolution by revolutionizing men’s hairstyles
More than two months after he called for a revolution against global elites, British actor and comedian Russell Brand has started by revolutionizing men’s hairstyles. The 38-year-old star of such films as “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “Get Him to the Greek” has been busy devising ways for men to express their frustration with the political status quo by cutting, gelling and styling their hair into new and exciting looks. Among the most revolutionary hairstyles Brand is asking the world’s men to adopt are the the Foppish Trotsky, a sort of spruced up Leon Trotsky cut, as well as the Cheeky Che, which resembles Che Guevara’s untamed mane — minus his iconic beret.
