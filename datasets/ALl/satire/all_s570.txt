Amanda Bynes Calls Royal Baby ‘An Ugly Little Loser’
Amanda Bynes took to Twitter today to insult her latest celebrity target - the royal baby. In a series of rapid-fire tweets the troubled former child star unloaded on the 2-day-old child, who is third in line for the British crown. "Why is everyone talking about this #royalbaby?" her rant began, "it looks like a rat crossed with the fugliest human alive." "@princewilliam UR baby is an UGLY LITTLE LOSER!" she continued. "@drake and I are going to have a beautiful baby that will KICK UR BABY'S ASS!" "what's wrong with his eyes? It looks like kate fucked a chinese person or something." "@princewilliam your baby looks GAY! They don't let queers become kings do they? #gayroyalbaby" The attack against the royal baby is only the latest in a long string of bizarre Twitter metdowns for Bynes, who has also gone after celebrities like Jason Biggs and Rihanna. A once popular children's television and film star, Bynes has seen her career falter after years of rumored psychiatric problems and drug abuse have reportedly taken a steep toll. The 27-year-old actress has been involved in several car accidents and was charged with driving under the influence in 2012. This year she reportedly threw a bong out the window of her high-rise Manhattan apartment to hide it from police. In an official statement, a spokesperson for the Royal Family refused to comment on Bynes' insults, but expressed a common sentiment heard from victims of Bynes' invective. "We here at Buckingham Palace hope Ms. Bynes gets the help she needs."
