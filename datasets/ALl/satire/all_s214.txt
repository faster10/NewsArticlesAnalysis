Al Gore: ‘You Fuckers Just Don’t Listen’
Former Vice-President Al Gore released a scathing video on Youtube today chastising politicians and the American public for their inaction and disinterest on global climate change. In a brutal seven minute rant the Nobel Prize winning loser of the 2000 presidential election tears into oil companies, Congress, President Obama, and the creators of South Park before turning his ire directly on the American public: "What more do I have to do to get through to you people? I wrote a book. Then I made a presentation with lots of pictures. Then I made a movie with even more pictures." "And what did that get us? Zero action on climate change. While Europe and Asia move forward, we move backwards. A majority of Americans now don't even believe anthropogenic climate change is real." Sanity In The Balance "People allow me to put this simply. There is a MOTHERFUCKING HURRICANE in MOTHERFUCKING MANHATTAN in MOTHERFUCKING NOVEMBER." "Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? What more fucking evidence do you need? The frequency of extreme storms like Sandy is increasing as temperatures and CO2 levels rise. Is that just a fucking coincidence? How fucking dumb can you be?" "At first I thought everyone in this country was retarded. Now I think I've found the real problem: you fuckers just don't listen." "Well you might not have to listen to me. But you're gonna be forced to listen to mother nature. That nasty bitch is howling and she's ready to tear your roofs off." Gore then used the last 30 seconds to call out cartoonists and climate experts Trey Parker and Matt Stone: "Hey Matt and Trey, I just found Manbearpig. He's in a New York deli drowning under 10 feet of fucking seawater."
