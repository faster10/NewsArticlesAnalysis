Nobel Physics Prize Accidentally Awarded To Micro Chips Inventor Dyson McDonald
The Nobel Prize for innovative development in physics has been accidentally awarded to Dyson MacDonald, the inventor of "microwave chips" and not the microchip inventor Werner Jacobi.  The invention of the integrated circuit, or microchip goes back to 1949, when the German engineer filed a patent for an integrated-circuit-like semiconductor amplifying device showing five transistors on a common substrate in a 3-stage amplifier arrangement with two transistors working "upside-down" as an impedance convertor.  Jacobi disclosed small and cheap hearing aids as typical industrial applications of his patent. The prize unfortunately was accidentally awarded to Dyson McDonald for the invention of the aluminum lined microwaveable box of partly cooked potato fries known affectionately as Micro Chips. Dyson MacDonald is rumored to have absconded with the cash and to be living in Florida.
