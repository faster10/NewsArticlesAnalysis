Supreme Court strikes down rule requiring Supreme Court to work on Saturdays
In what is being hailed as a victory for the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a rule requiring justices to work on Saturday mornings. In an 8-1 decision, the court stated that the rule instituted in 2013 goes too far, as it violates the justices’ constitutional right to adequate leisure. “Petitioners wish to have their weekends free to go shopping, visit friends and relatives, or simply escape the stresses of Washington for some quiet time in a Virginia forest,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. “Though the state does retain the right to try to get more bang for its buck out of the Supreme Court, this does not trump the petitioners’ right to enjoy a hearty pancake breakfast at home every Saturday morning.” “And some of us have a Zumba class on Saturday morning, and we really like that one because it’s not very crowded and the instructor Tom, who happens to be gay but that’s not important, is really fun and dynamic,” wrote Justice Elena Kagan in a concurring opinion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that many people have to put in a few hours during the weekend, and that doing so does not necessarily compromise one’s quality of life, or qualify as a violation of the Constitution. “Who among us actually has anything better to do?” he wrote. “Seriously, guys.”
