TDLC Announces "Dancing With Disabilities"
The Disabled Learning Channel is launching yet another wonderful learning inspired program. In the pilot, dancers with fake feet who could tap dance and a hunchback who weighed over 300 pounds did one hell of a Polka with a blind midget. Myron Schlocker VP of reality programming from TDLC explained \"Just think 'Dancing With the Stars' and then replace their stars with the freaks that our audience just goes wild for AND we are even gonna have our freako stars in the mix with Honey Boo Boo doing a Rhumba with a quadriplegic ex Navy Seal.\" Elise Mandelbaum of The Hollywood reporter asked: \"It seems to me this may be a new low in your network's exploitation of learning for an audience of morons!\" Schlocker replied; \"Well fck you miss big tits! Those morons have a right to watch what they want!\"
