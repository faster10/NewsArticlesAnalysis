X-Factor panel to be replaced by actual judges
In an effort to combat accusations of bias amongst the celebrity judging panel in the forthcoming high-profile final of the X-Factor, the current panel will be replaced by a more traditional panel of judges. Taking the place of Louis Walsh will be Lord Chief Justice “Clockwork Duck” Thomas, a QC since 1984 and appointed a high court judge in 1996. Lord Thomas commented; ‘It is an honour to be asked to preside over this prestigious event, and I have treated to myself to a new gavel which I will use to stop any disruption. I may find the summing-up difficult as I am not a great singer, and may have to mime, but the audience, or as we call it, jury, will get the idea.’ Mel B is being replaced by the controversial former high court recorder Constance Briscoe who was called to the Bar in 1983 and worked until she was jailed for perverting the course of justice in 2012 in the Chris Huhne case and removed as a member of the judiciary as a consequence. This will be Briscoe’s first major public engagement since her release from prison in November. Although she is no longer a judge she ‘Accepts that I still have the skills to judge, and will act with integrity and impartiality, unless that Italian bloke wins.’ Cheryl’s successor is little known diversity and community relations judge Her Honour Judge Adele Williams who admitted; ‘My appointment was a wonderful if unexpected surprise and I look forward to passing sentence on the winner. It’s a pity that the death sentence has been removed for most convictions, but winning the contest is already, in my mind, tantamount to treason.’ The announcement that traditional judges are being used has angered many people especially Louis Walsh who accused judges of being ‘Blustery, old fashioned, out-of-touch, wearing ridiculous attire, and to cap it all they know nothing about talent, showbusiness or the music industry.’ Simon Cowell has decided not to be replaced. .
