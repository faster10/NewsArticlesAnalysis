Ancient coins whoard found in field
Chrissenden, UK - One of the biggest ancient hos in Chrissenden has been discovered by nettle detector enthusiasts in a remote Southern Counties peat bog close to the M25. Remains of the Coin Goddess Vagalia were unearthed by the Weekend Wanderers Detecting Club inside a lead bucket two feet under a field near Aylesbury. Described by the British Museum of Unnatural Hystery as dating back to the 11th Century late Anglo Saxon/early Norman period 'because of a tampon imbedded up its fossilised arse' the find is being treated as treasure trove. Also discovered at the hysteric site were the heads of kings Ethelred the Unready and Canute. They will now be dug up and reinterred alongside the remains of their descendant King Richard whose remains were found under a Leeds car park. Commenting on the Coin Goddess discovery a lead bucket collector from Camden, New Jersey said lead buckets are the latest must-have in ancient artefuct memorabilia. The archaeological dig will now be closed down ahead of the arrival of fracking kit.
