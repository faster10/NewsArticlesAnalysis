Nigerians Worry About Jay Z After Beyonce’s Sister Assaults Him — CNN
CNN reported today that there is a “huge amount” of concern for the well-being of mega-millionare rap star Jay Z sweeping through the Nigerian capital after the groin-kicking he received yesterday from Beyonce’s sister, Solange. “American Rapper Kneed in Genitals,” read a page 9 headline in the Abuja Daily Trust newspaper. In markets and coffee shops, CNN reporter Gordon Ward asked Nigerians to speculate on the reason for the attack.  The general consensus seemed to be that there are people out there who are religious fanatics who have slipped into insanity, reported Ward. Television station The Nigerian Television Authority mentioned the Jay Z attack in their World of Entertainment mid-afternoon broadcast, which CNN indicates has an audience of over 2 million.  The station’s coverage mistakenly referred to the rapper as “Gay Z.” “It’s hard to imagine what this Jay Z is going through,” said Brila Radio host Debo Ojelade almost shouting at Ward. “One cannot even imagine,” she said loudly as she walked away from Ward and his cameraman, adding other comments the CNN microphone could not pick up. In other CNN news out of Nigeria, Ward reports that the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has released footage purporting to show the more than 200 girls abducted from their school, and has offered to release them unharmed if all Boko Haram prisoners are released by the government. “Nigerians send you good wishes Jay Z and hope you were not hurt in the attack,” said Ward in closing his report. “Back to you Wolf Blitzer in New York.”
