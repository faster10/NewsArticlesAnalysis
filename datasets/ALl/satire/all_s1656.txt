Double Gloucester wins Nobel Prize for Cheese
BRITAIN’S Double Gloucester has won the highest accolade in the world of coagulated milk protein. The cheese was awarded the Nobel Prize for ‘creating a paradigm shift in what it means to be semi-hard’. The prize, which comes with a cheque for $1m, is decided by a secret jury of Scandinavian professors. It is not awarded every year, becomes sometimes all the cheeses are rubbish. Double Gloucester said: “My name is on the prize, but it’s not just about me. It’s also about cows. Cheese begins and ends with cows. Or goats, or possibly even sheep if you’re an attention-seeking nightmare. “I’m not hard, but I’m not soft. That’s not ‘fate’, that’s not ‘magic’. There is no ‘Cheese God’.” Double Gloucester said it hoped the Nobel recognition would inspire innovative young British cheeses such as Wetherby Tickle, Norfolk Blue Fudge and Cornish Scowl.
