Mike Read ‘struggling’ with difficult second racist song
Sources close to DJ and UKIP half-time entertainer Mike Read have reported that the writer of ‘UKIP Calypso’ is struggling with the follow-up to the smash hit. ‘Mike doesn’t want to rush genius, but he’s conscious that he’s surfing on the crest of a wave,’ said a friend, who confirmed that potential tracks include ‘All About That Race’, ‘Bigotry’ (It’s Easy as 1,2,3) and ‘That’s Why the Lady is a Slut’. He continued: ‘Time is of the essence – he’s got a golden opportunity to capitalise on the limelight before either the electorate reads the UKIP Manifesto or the Daily Mail gives away another Diana memorial DVD.’ ‘It is the problem that has plagued artists from Coldplay to Timmy Mallet – how do I make lightning strike twice?’ Says the editor of NME, who couldn’t confirm rumours that Read will ‘black up’ for his next live gig.  ‘His best bet would be a Christmas number – I’m Dreaming of an Exclusively White Christmas or perhaps Drive Them Home for Christmas.’ Nigel Farage has allegedly stepped in to support Read, who reached number 21 in the charts with UKIP Calpyso before the single was withdrawn from sale in the UK, despite unconfirmed reports that it made the Top 10 in Bongo-Bongoland. ‘Nigel reminded Mike that he was famous for refusing to play the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song, Relax,’ said a UKIP spokesman, who insisted he had a darkie in his house once who did a smashing job with the boiler. ‘At the time, Mike felt the lyric, ‘relax, don’t do it/When you want to come’, was simply too controversial. But recorded in the right way, it could work as a poignant plea for tighter border controls. So long as it’s done in a Nigerian accent. And a tribal costume.’
