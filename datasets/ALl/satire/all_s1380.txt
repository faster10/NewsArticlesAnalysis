Rise in female gamers improves prospect of girlfriend for nerds
A 20% rise in female gamers has led to increased hopes amongst males who play computer games that they might one day find a girlfriend. New research has shown that the number of females playing games on devices such as the iPad is up 20% since in they were last asked. The rise is believed to due to more female friendly games such as World of Warcraft, and the fact that everyone else was doing it. Teenage gamer Simon Williams explained, “I have a dream that one day showing a girl how many points I’ve accumulated on a game on my iPad will be the new ‘giving her a ride in my car’.” “Who knows, being good at online poker might become the new ‘being good at proper sports’!” “Oh, and by the way, if you actually get to speak to any real live girls could you maybe ask them if they fancy a multi-player game on Call of Duty Modern Warfare? You can give them my gamertag. Thanks.” “Let them know I’ll protect them in the game, obviously.” The gaming industry has welcomed the changing face of the average gaming customer, insisting it could always do with being a little prettier. Head of Consumer PR at Ladbrokes Casino David Matthews has spoken about the social gaming creating relationships theory, telling us, “The rate at which social gaming is growing is undoubtedly one of the most exciting developments on our landscape.” “The history books are littered with concepts that have withered quickly on the vine but there’s no doubt in our minds that this is an area set to explode.” Female gamer Sharon Jones told us, “I guess using an iPhone kinda got me into gaming, with a bit of Candy Crush in between Facebook surfing – but now I love a bit of bingo on the bus!” “Call of Duty Modern Warfare? No, never heard of it.”
