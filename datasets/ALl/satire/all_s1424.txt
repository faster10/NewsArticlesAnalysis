#IceBucketChallenge is stupid, claims man without any nominations yet
The viral #IceBucketChallenge is a stupid idea and makes you all look like morons, according to a man yet to single receive a nomination this morning. Simon Williams spoke of his disdain for the practise of pouring ice-cold water of your head, claiming it was just a chance for people to show off, rather than give money to charity. He told us, “My Facebook feed is absolutely full of people doing this – it seems like everyone is having a go, well almost everyone. It’s stupid. I wouldn’t do it, even if you challenged me, which you haven’t.” “We’ve got people in wetsuits, flippers, with wheelie bins of water – they’ve all lost sight of the real reason for it in the first place.” “I’ll still be donating – even though I haven’t done the challenge – because I’m a good person.” “I don’t need someone to pick me out from their list of friends as the sort of ‘fun’ person who would do this, in order to give a charity a few quid.” “Just because I’m pretty much the only person I know who hasn’t been challenged doesn’t make me a loser, it makes me sensible.” “Oh, hang on, someone’s just challenged me – you haven’t got a bucket handy have you?” If you want to donate – some suggested options for you: If you want to donate – some suggested options for you: Text “WATER” to 70007 to give £3 to WaterAid UK Text “ICE” to 70550 to give £3 to Macmilliam Cancer Centres Text “ICED55 £3″ to 70070 to give £3 to the Motor Neurone Disease Association
