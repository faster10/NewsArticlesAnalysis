iPhone 6 Plus performing badly in hammer stress tests, complain morons
The iPhone 6 is so poorly made it is unable to withstand a sustained hammer attack without breaking apart, numerous twats have concluded this morning. Arseholes with too much money to spend are dismayed with the poor reception their phones give after a prolonged hammering either by a hammer or a set of clumsily located arse cheeks. Social media is rife with photos of iPhone 6 owners who have attempted to destroy their phones only to be dismayed at their apparent success in doing so. Apple spokesman Simon Williams said, “Despite the extortionate price tag, iPhone 6 performance deteriorates significantly the more you smash them with a heavy blunt object.” “Such as a hammer.” “It’s much like the iPhone 5 and every other previous model in that respect.” iPhone user Steve England said, “iPhone 6 fails to maintain a signal when I throw it against a wall and then repeatedly stamp on it.” “If I recall correctly, the iPhone 4S suffered similar issues when I threw it under a passing tube train.” “These are serious design issues. You’d think Apple would have learnt their lessons by now.” “It’s a disgrace.” Apple’s Williams added, “The iPhone 7 will be made from graphene, an invincible type of carbon just one atom thick.” “Still, I’m sure some of you will find a way of fucking even that up.” “And then posting a photograph of it on Twitter, obviously.”
