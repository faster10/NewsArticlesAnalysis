Blows To The Head Make 9-Year-Old A Man
The NFL runs "Moms Clinics" through an operation called "USA Football." It targets moms who determine which sport their kids will play. It is an effort to show that children's football is safe. But kid football isn't safe. As background, Pop Warner Little Scholars Inc., is open to children as young as 5 years old and as light as 35 pounds and thousands of children play in "pee wee" leagues with boys whose ages vary from 5 to 14 plays.  They are part of youth-football-industrial complex-3 million players and tens of millions of dollars in revenue, backed by the NFL, college football, equipment manufacturers, and other sports businesses. Research shows that boys repeatedly being hit in the head through tackle football during a time of brain development, under the age of 12, have poor cognition. But "The concussions, the violence on the field, and the manic parents and coaches who push children as young as 6 to play a dangerous game are part of the sport," says Brian Morgan, who co-founded the Texas Football League.  "In Texas, all football is next to the Bible and the Flag in importance," said Morgan. " My 9-year-old TFL football kid is a true miniature man who loves God, guts and glory."My child will be able to defend American values when we invade countries like Iraq.   My kid will make a better soldier than a child who has never had concussions like he has. That makes him tough to fight for American ideals and the military-industrial-complex," said Morgan.
