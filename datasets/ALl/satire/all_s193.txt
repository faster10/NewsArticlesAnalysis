New Poll Puts Bill Clinton at 18% in Presidential Race

The TDC Opnion Research survey done overnight now puts President Obama at 42%, Mitt Romney at 40% and newcomer Bill Clinton at 18% - despite the fact that Clinton is not running for office and has endorsed President Obama.

But the confusion around Clinton's status will remain a headache for both the Obama and Romney campaigns in the fall, who will likely have to spend precious resources to remind millions of voters that a vote for Bill Clinton will go to waste. The new numbers have shocked the political establishment in Washington, but should not have come as a total surprise. Another recent poll found Clinton has a 69% approval rating, higher than any other Democratic political figure. The full video of the speech can be found below:
