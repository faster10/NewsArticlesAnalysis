Hollywood Spotlight: Bad Chicken Nominated for Best Film for 2nd Year!
Bad Chicken, the independent dark comedy blockbuster film that took Hollywood by storm last year and took the esteemed and highly coveted Montgomery Award for best film of the year has again been nominated in several categories for this year’s award by the Artists Academy of Cinema Arts (AACA). Due to the film’s awards season early release date Bad Chicken, is eligible to be nominated the award for a second year in a row. If the movie takes the award this year it will be the first time in the academy’s 28 year history a single film has taken the Montgomery two years running. And there’s more good news for fans of the film – a rumored sequel currently in development. However it’s all hush-hush at Puppetball Inc., where I spoke to writer-director Carter Mays. Unfortunately, Mays refused to “confirm nor deny” the rumor at this time, but acknowledged that there is a “surprisingly massive social media movement petitioning for a sequel”. Who knows… 2015 stands to be a great year for Puppetball and Mays. Bad Chicken has been nominated by the academy for the 28th annual AACA awards show in the following categories, Best Film of the Year, Best Visual Effects for use of puppetry in a film and Best Original Song. I recently reviewed this hysterical film and after recovering from laughter I can honestly recommend Bad Chicken for anyone who enjoys great comedy.
