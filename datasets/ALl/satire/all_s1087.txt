Big budget movies get swept under the rug
Hollywood, CA- Hollywood studios are having a difficult time achieving unbiased results from their experimental, marketing research using human guinea pigs.  Every film they have marketed, received bad result from crowds of educated theatergoers in various screen test.  They gave bad ratings to what was perceived to be exiting narratives, recognizable stars, and spectacular special effects.  It was theorized by executive producers that the joys, laughter, and tears experienced by the audience would come from big budget actors.  In desperation to attain a precise answer, executive producers interviewed every individual in the audience to question them about their reviews and all gave the same answer,\"The movie wasn't as good as the trailer.\" The poor results showed that deception and greed were the best options for promoting a film that people would eventually hate. The reason some movies make more money than others seems to be based on superior imaginary themes created by trailer promotions in association with one time adolescent viewers who spread lies among their contemporaries. \"I saw spider-man picking his nose on screen, it was the craziest thing ever,\" said one adolescent theatergoer. 'Dead Man's Chest' made more money than 'Worlds End' because of the words Dead Man in the title. 'Avatar' made more money than 'Toy Story 3' because it was about blue people with yellow eyes. It appears humanity has a long way to evolve.
