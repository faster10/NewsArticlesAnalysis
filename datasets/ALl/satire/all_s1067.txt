What were people wearing at this years' Oscars?
A few eyebrows were raised at the Oscars last week when Beyoncé came onstage dressed in a strapless armoire. But among the young and the trendy, she was only copying a style they have been wearing for years. Many interested journalists wanted to know who had designed the unique piece for her - was it La Dida? Or perhaps Gaudé? \"No,\" replied the bootylicious singer. \"It's from DFS.\" She was not the only one. Scarlett Johansson wore a delicate self-assembly IKEA number with sliding doors, which kept slipping apart to reveal her shelves. Oprah Winfrey impressed everyone, dressed in a classy chaise longue. She looked quite happy in it until Ben Affleck sat on her. There is nothing new about wearing furniture, said fashion expert Al Wairanything during the brief few seconds of my interview with him. \"Ducky! I can't seriously talk to you while you're wearing normal clothes,\" said the flamboyant clothesmonger, who then attempted to strap me into a pouffé. So how common is it for ordinary people to wear these clothes? Watching people passing a coffee shop in fashionable Soho, London, I only counted two people wearing wooden furniture, and one of them was a homeless man in a barrel. Fashion expert Shay de Grey, who specialises in advising people to dress modestly, thought that furniture was best left to celebrities. \"It's embarrassing when you see some young wannabe walking down the street in a wardrobe. You just know their drawers are going to fall out and they're probably going to get splinters.\"
