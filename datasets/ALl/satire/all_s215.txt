Congressman Yells ‘Go Back to Kenya’ During State of the Union
A member of U.S. Congress from the state of Texas shouted the phrase "Go back to Kenya" during President Obama's State of the Union address tonight. GOP Rep. Randy Neugebauer made the outburst about 10 minutes into the President's speech, shocking those within earshot. Audio of the comments was outside the range of network microphones, but some viewers could see the stunned faces of members of congress sitting near the freshman lawmaker from Lubbock. Neugebauer's verbal spasm took place at a particually ironic moment, right after the President appealed for bipartisan unity. "The American people do expect us to put the nation's interest before party," Obama proclaimed. "They do expect us to forge reasonable compromises when we can." "Go back to Kenya!" Neugebauer responded. A Lone Star Neugebauer is known for his extremely conservative views, and has previously co-sponsored a bill to force Obama to reveal his "real" birth certificate. His most notable outburst to date had been an incident in 2010 when he screamed "Baby Killer!" to Democratic Representative Bart Stupak on the House floor to protest his vote in favor of Obamacare. Negebauer's words provoked immediate condemnation by both Democrats and Republicans in the chamber via Twitter. Even former rocker Ted Nugent, who was also in attendance, says Neugebauer's actions went too far. "You won't find a bigger critic of President Obama than me. I think he's a Socialist, Muslim overlord trying to destroy this country," Nugent tells The Daily Currant. "But you need to have some respect for the dignity of the office. "These guys in Congress are completely crazy. It's out of control." The event calls to mind a similar occurrence in 2009 when South Carolina representative Joe Wilson shouted "You lie!" to President Obama during a joint session of Congress.
