Obama Motorcade Kills Kitten in Maryland As Horrified Child Watches On
A vehicle belonging to President Barack Obama’s motorcade ended the life of a young house cat on Friday, as the cat’s owner, a young girl, watched on helplessly in horror. And to make matters worse, the United States Secret Service reprimanded the girl for being “careless.” The incident occurred on the morning of Friday, November 7th in Bethesda, Maryland. Young Molly Wilson, age 7, was playing in her front yard with her kitten, named Tiger, when President Obama’s motorcade came through her neighborhood. Tiger then darted out in front of one of the vehicles in Obama’s motorcade, where he was struck by a tire and killed instantly. Which vehicle it was specifically is unknown. The child was physically unharmed in the incident. According to the Wilson family, the presidential motorcade didn’t stop, but two Secret Service agents approached them shortly after the incident, first to ask if the girl was okay, and then to reprimand her and her parents, placing the blame for the vehicle accident solely on the child. “These guys, these Secret Service guys, they yelled at my daughter. It was despicable,” says Molly’s mother, Stacie Wilson. “They told her it was her fault Tiger got run over, and were grilling her with questions. And when I tried to tell them to cool it, they threatened me. If these are the kinds of people Obama surrounds himself with, it makes me question why anyone would vote for him. And now I don’t feel so bad for having never voted.” Molly Wilson was visibly shaken, but her mother did permit her to make a brief statement regarding the incident. “I thought Obama was supposed to help people. I thought the president was a good man before today. But he isn’t a good man. He’s a bad man. He’s a bad man and a bad president, and I want him to stop being president, because he hurts people and he hurt Tiger.” Neither the White House or the Secret Service would comment on the incident.
