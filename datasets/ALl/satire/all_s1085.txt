Three Oscar-winning cinematographers reveal their favorite shots
Los Angeles - \"Favorite shot would be the Measles/Mumps/Rubella triple,\" Emmanuel Lubezki, maker of Gravity, said this weekend, \"sure saved my ass during the last pandemic as well as my kids'. Tetanus booster comes a close second of course.\" The Oscar-winning cinematographer was responding to a survey about Academy Award winners' 'favourite shots' in the run up to Sunday night's razzmatazz gala. He was joined by Conrad Hall, posthumous winner of the 2001 movie Road to Perdition, who sent a reply via the HollywoodHexoplasm.con website. Hall nominated his favorite shot as a 'double double-tequila slammer' - something the late movie maker's liver probably wore - uh, bore! - out. Finally Philippie Rousselot, 1991 Best Cinematography Academy Award winner for his awesome A River Runs Through It, also posted his nomination today. The movie maestro has chosen for his favorite shot the 2-bullet rat shot 'suicide' of ex-Clinton Rose Law partner Vince Foster in a Sugar Land, Texas, parking lot in 1993. More 'favorite shots' of Oscar-winning cinematographers will follow soon.
