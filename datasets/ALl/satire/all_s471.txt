Secret White House Memos Reveal Obama Exploring Options for Third Term!
Emboldened by his recent sweeping victory over House Republicans, President Barack Obama may be considering the once unthinkable: A third term as President. Despite this once seeming unthinkable, recent polls have shown that a growing number of Americans are either supportive of the idea, undecided or unopposed. Documents obtained by the National Report, including emails and private memos between Obama and Attorney General, Eric Holder, contain specific, though as yet, ‘speculative’, questions from Obama, seeking advise regarding either circumventing the 22 amendment to the Constitution, which restricts Presidents to two terms, or drafting another constitutional amendment which would pave the way for Obama to ‘legally’ be reelected. A source in Holder’s office, who agreed to speak with The National Report on condition of anonymity, had this to say: The memos also provide insight into Obama and Holder’s thinking on the proposal. In one memo, written by Obama, the President asks the Attorney General’s advice on whether it would be ‘feasible’ to call a constitutional convention under Article V, as a means of avoiding predicted opposition from the House of Representatives. In Holder’s response, he informs the President that in addition to ‘difficulties’ with the House, 3/4 of the states must ratify the amendment, going on to lament that 26 are now under Republican control. Obama, in a follow up memo the very next day, asks for a list of ‘contingencies’ which would give the President extraordinary powers, such as in time of war. Obama goes on to ask about the legal constraints on a Presidential declaration of Martial Law. A White House spokesman, reached for comment, played down the memos, questioning their legitimacy. The National Report will stay on this story and report new findings as they become available.
