World’s first webpage had comment calling author ‘faggot’
The world’s first webpage, recently relaunched by CERN, contained a profane comment questioning the author’s sexuality. The page, which contained instructions on how to use the “World Wide Web”, was online for just seven minutes before the person responsible for the content was called a ‘faggot’. Internet expert Simon Williams explained, “People will suggest that online abuse and bullying is a relatively new phenomenon, but I am here to tell you it’s not.” “Just minutes after appearing, this page drew comments such as ‘This is so gay’, and ‘OP is a faggot’. These people have always been there.” “What we’re seeing here is that the Internet hasn’t evolved, it was born this way.” The abuse was closely followed by an automated comment complimenting the excellent article and author on their insight before linking back to a site selling watches that didn’t even exist yet. Williams went on, “This glimpse into the early hours of the Internet and the way it has been used for shameless self-promotion and witless bullying.” “You had better learn to accept it.”
