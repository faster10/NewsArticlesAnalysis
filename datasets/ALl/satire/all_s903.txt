200 year-old mummified monk to present Strictly Come Dancing
The BBC has announced that a mummified 200-year-old body discovered in Mongolia has been signed to host Strictly Come Dancing. The body of a monk, which is alleged to display “faint signs of life”, is an “ideal fit” for a peak Saturday night show, insiders claim. “For many years Strictly has been presented by a desiccated husk with a faint spark of life”, said a BBC spokesman. “So why change that now?” “Apparently the mummy shows changes in body temperature when interacted with, which is more than you can say for Craig Revel Horwood these days.” Bruce Forsyth was asked to comment on the change of lineup, but we were told it might take several years to get a reply.
