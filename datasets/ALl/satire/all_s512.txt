Obama to Host Religious Awareness Halloween Party: Will Go As a Muslim
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced today that President Obama will be hosting a “Religious Awareness Halloween Celebration”. President Obama will be wearing traditional Muslim attire, and Mrs. Obama will be attending as an Atheist. The event is intended to increase religious tolerance by showing that members of any religion can congregate peacefully. Additionally, the event will allow attendees to learn about the religion they choose to dress as. President Obama’s choice to go as a Muslim will undoubtedly draw criticism from Christian conservatives. The President has long been criticised for being sympathetic towards Muslims and has even been accused of secretly being Muslim himself. His announcement to dress up as a Muslim on a holiday traditionally celebrated only by children will likely draw even more ire from these conservative groups. According to Earnest, the President will be hosting several influential Muslim leaders at the Halloween party. It is unclear if they will be attending as Muslims or if they will come dressed in the traditional attire of another religion. American Muslim Ahmed Mohamed Usman, founder of the group One Nation Under Allah will be attending the party and had nothing but praise for President Obama’s costume decision. In an interview this afternoon on NPR, Usman had the following to say: “America is supposed to be the land of freedom and of tolerance. We must have celebrations that enforce this. This Halloween at the White House, we can replicate a Utopian society in which members of all religions congregate peacefully and share traditional foods, such as candied corns and miniaturized candy bars. To be welcomed into the highest office of America on this proud American holiday is an honor and is a step for Muslims in America to begin to establish our rights. President Obama is truly opening the door for Muslims in America.”
