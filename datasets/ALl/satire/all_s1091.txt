Leonard Nimoy Donates His Ears To Medical Science
The final will for Leonard Nimoy has been released and his legendary ears are receiving most of the attention. The recently deceased 'Star Trek' actor has donated his pointy ears to medical science in the hope that someone will find a cure someday. The compassionate actor didn't want anyone to suffer like he did for most of his life with the curious affliction. Leonard Nimoy had a very difficult life. His odd ears always made people laugh at him. He cut them off numerous times while growing up, but they always grew back. He spent most of his early adult life with a towel draped around his head to hide his shame.  The only bright spot in Leonard Nimoy's life was his time on 'Star Trek' playing the part of Mr. Spock, He was born to play the role. At last, he could show his pointed ears in public. Much later in life, Leonard Nimoy was diagnosed with COPD. He knew his time on Earth was limited so he wanted to something good for society. At first, he wanted to donate his ears to the Society To Prevent Pointed Ears. He changed his mind when he learned only one other person was in the society--the little boy who played Eddie Munster on TV. Leonard Nimoy's pointed ears were cut off from his head after he died. Bits and pieces of the strange ears have been sent to medical schools throughout the country. Hopefully, someone will find a cure someday.
