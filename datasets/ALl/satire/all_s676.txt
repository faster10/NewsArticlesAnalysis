Mike Tyson Says Budweiser’s ‘Lost Puppy’ Commercial Made Him Cry, Adopted Dog Next Day
Once considered the meanest, baddest, and most powerful man on the planet, former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world as a professional boxer, Mike Tyson, in recent years has not been afraid of showing his emotional side. The previous statement was proven 100% true when the former knock-out artist told shock-jock Howard Stern that the Budweiser “Lost Puppy” commercial that aired during Super Bowl 49 made him cry, and for quite a while.“Man, you know so I’m chillin, hangin with my  boys and all that, life is good, ya know, hangin’ out, watchin the Super Bowl, eating those little hot dogs, and that puppy commercial comes on. Ya know man…I got so caught up in it, I could not stand it. Here it is this little sweet, innocent, lost puppy ya know, and I’m like man,” Tyson said.Howard Stern, laughing, asked the former champ if his eyes got welled up with tears. “Man, don’t laugh Howard, but I was all like caught up, thinkin’ ‘is he gonna be okay? Will they ever find him?’” Tyson said, reliving the moment. “I could relate ya know as a boy I was…I was a damn mess. I was lost. So then the big horses busted loose and save him from the wilder-beast. Well whatever the hell that thing was..some kinda werewolf, I don’t know, whatever, you know, Howard?”Tyson says that he was so moved by the commercial, that he went and adopted a dog the following morning.“I started cryin’ and shit, and I  had to leave the room. I went out on the roof to feed my pigeons, I cried for at least twenty minutes over that puppy, I mean damn we tryin to hang and Mike’s cryin over a puppy commercial? Can’t have the crew seein’ that ya know?” the charismatic Tyson stated. “Anyway..puppy made me cry man. So ya know what? I went and rescued a lil’ guy the next day to honor the puppy from the commercial. I named him ‘D-OG’. It felt good ya know?”
