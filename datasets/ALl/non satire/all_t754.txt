Upon hitting the stage, Hemsworth immediately asked for a mullet of his own after seeing how cool Jackman and Fallon looked in their wigs. The late-night host gave him the mullet off his own head.Photos: Hollywood's sexiest shirtless menThen the Aussie men, along with the SNL stars and Fallon, competed in a game much like Musical Chairs.
