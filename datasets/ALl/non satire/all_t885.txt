'Still Alice' Co-Director Richard Glatzer Dies at 63
Filmmaker Richard Glatzer, best known for co-writing and co-directing Still Alice alongside his husband Wash Westmoreland, died Tuesday from complications due to ALS. He was 63. Glatzer was first diagnosed with ALS in 2011 when he began working on adapting Still Alice from a novel by Lisa Genova. As production progressed, his condition deteriorated severely, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance in the film, which tells the story of a woman suffering from degenerative Alzheimer’s.

According to Westmoreland, he and Glatzer watched the gala event from the hospital ward.   Glatzer and Westmoreland met in 1995 and got married in 2013. During their time together, they worked on several other well-received projects including the 2001 drama The Fluffer, the 2006 family drama Quinceanera, and the 2011 Errol Flynn biopic The Last of Robin Hood. Following the announcement of Glatzer's death, Moore remembered the director with some moving words.   "It was a great privilege to know Richard Glatzer, " the actress said in a statement to ET.  "He put every ounce of who he was as an artist and a human being into Still Alice --  his fierce intelligence, his wicked sense of humor, his compassion and his love -- and it showed in his gorgeous film. Rich loved film because he believed it could be a meditation of who we are and what we truly value -- each other. He gave me the gift of this experience, and I will forever cherish it.​ "
