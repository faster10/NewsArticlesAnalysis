This summer's "Sharknado 3" will usher in the Cuban-Coulter administration.The SyFy network said Monday that Dallas Mavericks owner and "Shark Tank" star Mark Cuban will play the president of the United States in the third installment of the goofy "Sharknado" TV movie series, set to premiere in July. Conservative commentator and author Ann Coulter will be his vice president.The network previously said Bo Derek will have a cameo as star Tara Reid's mother, Jerry Springer will play a tourist and *NSYNC singer Chris Kirkpatrick will be a pool lifeguard."Sharknado" star Ian Ziering will also be back. "It's kind of like disaster movie, meets road trip," the franchise star told CBS News."This is a campy science-fiction movie done with a very low budget. So therein lies the organic ability to not have the quality content you might expect from a James Cameron movie....This is fun, where everybody is in on the joke -- except the actors," he said laughing. "We all take it very seriously. You have to act very naturally in this imaginary circumstance no matter how crazy it is because if you don't then the audience knows you're in on the joke. And it loses its fun."This year the toothy storm terrorizes Washington, D.C., before moving down to Florida.
