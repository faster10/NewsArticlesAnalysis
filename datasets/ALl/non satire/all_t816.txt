Tudyk and Fillion have added additional goals with additional rewards, to make sure people know where their money is going. They've said that the additional donations will be used to make more episodes. Con Man, a semi-autobiographical comedy, tells the tale of two actors who starred together in a beloved sci-fi series. After the show gets canceled, the two actors enjoy vastly different levels of success. Fillion will star as Jack Moore, whose career sky-rocketed. Tudyk, the writer and director of Con Man, will star as Wray Nerely who has been stuck playing bit roles and spends a lot of time reliving his former sci-fi glory at various fan conventions.

"Con Man is a way to share some of the surreal occurrences we have had, while telling the story of a guy learning to love and embrace his fans… I wanted to celebrate the world where heroes, villains, zombie hunters, and space pirates all overlap I especially wanted to work with my friend Nathan Fillion again. " While Firefly fans may never get the chance to see their favorite show return to TV, this is a great opportunity to see two of its stars act together once more.
