"But then I saw the audition. She understood Margo in ways that no one I have ever met understands Margo."Wolff, meanwhile, appeared alongside Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort last year in "The Fault in Our Stars" as Augustus' best friend, Isaac.Directed by Jake Schreier, "Paper Towns" will arrive in theaters July 24.
