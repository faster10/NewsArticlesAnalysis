January Jones Debuts 'Grease'-Inspired Pink Hair
As the countdown to the final episodes of Mad Men approaches, January Jones celebrated appropriately -- with a decidedly modern dye job. On Thursday night, Jones showed off her new pink hair that will be sending thousands of women to their stylists over the next few weeks. Alongside a photo of herself at a salon, she posted,  "Can you guess where I'm going with this? #backtomyroots "  NEWS: The Party's (Almost) Over for Mad Men A few hours later, the Last Man on Earth star debuted the result: Beautiful blush-pink locks. She wrote that they were inspired by the movie Grease.  "Call me 'Frenchie', " she wrote.  "Thanks for the dip @jenniferjbeauty.
