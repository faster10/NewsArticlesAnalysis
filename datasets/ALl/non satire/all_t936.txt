Watch Robert Downey Jr. Present Young Boy with a Bionic 'Iron Man' Arm
If this video doesn't make you love Robert Downey Jr. even more, then we don't know what will. The 49-year-old Iron Man star recently presented a bionic arm to a 7-year-old fan named Alex, who was born with a partially developed right arm. The arm was built by college student Albert Manero, who builds and donates low-cost, 3D-printed bionic limbs for children around the world. In the heartwarming video, Downey Jr. remains in character as Tony Stark, referring to himself as a  "leading bionics expert. " For his part, a snazzily dressed Alex impressively retains his cool demeanor throughout the video, but watch for the cute moment when he acknowledges that he's sitting next to  "Iron Man.

"Now I want to inspire others to help engineer hope for the world. " Albert's first arm that he gave to Alex cost less than $350 in materials, which is astounding given the $40,000 price tag of some prosthetics.  "Albert has made it so affordable. I'm probably going to start farming out most of my tech work to Albert too, " Downey Jr. jokes in the video.  "I feel like he can cut the price point down to one of my suits, which right now is, I donâ€™t know, about a billion and a half dollars.
