Justin Bieber gets roasted, apologizes for behavior
Justin Bieber really wants you to like him again. After being the butt of the joke for hours during the taping of his Comedy Central roast, the 21-year-old singer gave a contrition speech."I turned a lot of people off over the past few years, but I know I can still turn out good music and turn everything all around," said Bieber, whose music has been overshadowed by his offstage antics, which include reckless driving, public urination and throwing eggs at a neighbor's home.24PhotosJustin BieberThe Canadian teen is the latest music sensation"I've lost some of my best qualities.
