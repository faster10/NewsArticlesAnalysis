Kate Middleton Visits the 'Downton Abbey' Set!
Kate Middleton may be the beloved Duchess of Cambridge, but on Thursday, March 12, she was also a super-excited Downton Abbey fan when she visited the set. Kate, 33, looked ecstatic arriving at Ealing Studios in west London where the show is taped. Sporting a cream Jojo Maman Bebe babydoll coat and black heels, the eight-months pregnant Kate was greeted by writer and show creator Lord Julian Fellowes, before visiting make-up artists, costume designers as well as production, editorial and Ealing studios staff.

Of course, the show couldn't have Kate leave without a few unique gifts to remember her visit. She was adorably presented a wooden train for her one-year-old son -- Prince George -- by Master George Crawley himself, who was accompanied by Dockery, his on-screen mother. A delicious chocolate cake given to her by Nicol and McShera was also part of the festivities. Finally, the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate the visit and an official photograph  with cast members, writers and producers finished off her eventful visit.
