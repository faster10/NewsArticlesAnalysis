Boehner: Will Senate Dems ‘get off their a—’ on DHS bill?
Never mind that Republicans control all of Capitol Hill, House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday wondered when Senate Democrats will “get off their — and do something other than to vote no” on a House GOP plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security. “The House did its job,” Boehner said to reporters Wednesday after a closed-party meeting. “We won the fight to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to stop the president’s unconstitutional actions. Now it’s time for the Senate to do their work. In the gift shop out there, they’ve got these little booklets on how a bill becomes a law. Alright? The House has done its job.” Story Continued Below Senate Democrats have voted uniformly against taking up a House bill that would fund DHS through the end of the fiscal year, while gutting President Barack Obama’s changes to the enforcement of immigration laws. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that it’s up to Boehner’s House to pass another bill that can get through the Senate. In December, when Boehner designed the plan to fight over Obama’s immigration executive actions this month, he promised to fight tooth-and-nail. Asked if it’s working as he envisioned, Boehner said, “It’s working exactly the way I envisioned.” “The issue here is not Senate Republicans, it’s Senate Democrats,” Boehner said. When reminded that McConnell said it’s up to him to pass a bill, Boehner smiled and said, “I love Mitch. He has a tough job to do, and so do I.”
