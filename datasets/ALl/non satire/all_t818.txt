Kim Cattrall Disses 'Fifty Shades' Star Jamie Dornan: 'He Doesn't Look Like a Man to Me'
There's one glaring reason Kim Cattrall has no intention of seeing the record-breaking Fifty Shades of Grey. She doesn't find former Calvin Klein underwear model Jamie Dornan, who plays the super-hot S&M-loving billionaire Christian Grey in the film, attractive. At all.  "Maybe it's my age, but he doesn't look like a man to me, " the former Sex and the City star, 58, tells The Independent bluntly.  "He looks like a young boy. I like men to look like men. I saw the preview and you know they say in three seconds you can tell if you find someone attractive or not? Well, I just thought, 'No.' " PHOTOS: Calvin Klein's Hottest Celebrity Models   Though perhaps if the film had allowed the 32-year-old Dornan keep his scruff, she might have changed her mind! Dornan himself addressed his boyish looks in a recent interview with Glamour for their March 2015 issue, when he admitted to some insecurities about looking  "aggressively young. "  "From when I was 12 to when I was 27, I looked aggressively young for my age. I hated it, " he said.  "I think that’s why I love having a beard -- it's some kind of proof that you're a man.

That would be Edge of Tomorrow star Brendan Gleeson, 59, who like Dornan, also happens to be Irish.  "Now, if he were Brendan Gleeson -- well, there's a little something going on there, you know, the twinkle in the eye…  " Cattrall said.
