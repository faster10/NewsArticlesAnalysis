Sarah Hyland and Boyfriend Dominic Sherwood Get Matching Tattoos
Getting serious? Although they've only been linked together since February, 24-year-old Modern Family star Sarah Hyland and her boyfriend, Vampire Academy actor Dominic Sherwood, already have matching tattoos. Hyland took to her Instagram to show off her new ink this past Sunday -- an arrow on her back -- with the caption,  "What did I do this weekend? Got some ink with my best friends. 3♐️s.

"Evidence of last night’s escapades!! " he wrote about the sizable new ink on his right arm. Given the timing of both their posts, it's safe to assume the two got their tattoos together. Hyland started dating Sherwood -- her Vampire Academy co-star -- after a messy breakup with her ex-boyfriend, actor Matthew Prokop, last August.
