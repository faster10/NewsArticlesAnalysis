Keystone foes to dog Obama in Philly
Environmental activists are planning a protest over the Keystone XL pipeline during President Barack Obama’s speech to House Democrats here on Thursday.

The Senate is expected to vote Thursday to end debate on its version of the Keystone bill. “Let’s tell President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline once and for all,” 350 Philadelphia’s website says. “We will rally outside the meeting and tell him to say no to [the] pipeline and to demand renewable energy, energy efficiency, green jobs, and a just transition to a sustainable economy.” Obama is scheduled to give a keynote address to House Democrats on Thursday during a 6 p.m. dinner.
