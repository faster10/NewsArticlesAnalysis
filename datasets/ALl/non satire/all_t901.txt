Hilary Duff on Whether or Not She Lost Her Virginity to Joel Madden
Hilary Duff has clearly been in a sharing mood lately. Aside from posting very revealing bikini selfies and opening up about her soon-to-be ex-husband Mike Comrie, the 27-year-old  "All About You " singer also recently revisited her 2004 relationship with 36-year-old Good Charlotte frontman Joel Madden. At the time, Hilary was 16 and Joel was 25. The two split in 2006.  "I had a pretty serious relationship at a young age that I ended, and it wrecked me for a good year and a half, " Hilary told Cosmopolitan, via E! Online.  "I didn't really enjoy being single.

"I had a 26-year-old boyfriend. So everyone can make their own assumptions about what I was doing, " she said. And in the time since both Hilary and Joel -- who's been married to Nicole Richie since December 2010 -- have both moved on, the former Lizzie McGuire star has managed to maintain her good girl image in Hollywood. She credits the feat to  "a massive friend cleanse " she did when she was 19 years old.  "That was really hard, to sit down with people and say, 'We can't be friends anymore,' " she revealed.  "They were like, 'That's f**ked up. You're a b**ch.' But having a good reputation was important to me. ... That's not to say I didn't screw up and do little naughties here and there.
