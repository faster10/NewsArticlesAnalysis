Kathy Griffin abruptly quits "Fashion Police"
The "Fashion Police" force is dwindling, with Kathy Griffin following Kelly Osbourne out the door.Griffin announced her departure Thursday, after just seven episodes, in a posting on her Twitter account. The tweet was verified by her office.Griffin said her style didn't mesh with the E! channel show's "creative direction," but her lengthy tweet also veered off into apparent criticism of how "Fashion Police" critiques celebrity looks."There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people's bodies into it. ... I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference," she posted.Griffin tweeted that her goal is to help "women, gay kids, people of color" and anyone who feels underrepresented to have a voice and a laugh.pic.twitter.com/XL12skIPK4â€” Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) March 13, 2015Osbourne exited "Fashion Police" two weeks ago after complaining about co-host Giuliana Rancic's red-carpet criticism of African-American singer-actress Zendaya's dreadlocks. Rancic said they suggested the smell of marijuana.Zendaya went online to slam the remarks as "outrageously offensive." Rancic later apologized, saying the experience taught her not to perpetuate cliches and stereotypes.Griffin came to "Fashion Police" as a replacement for her friend and mentor, the late Joan Rivers.When she signed on in December, Griffin said, "I get it! These are some big shoes I'm going to fill. Joan was truly one of a kind. Now I hope you will accept me for me."In a statement, the channel said the next episode will air as scheduled March 30 with remaining co-hosts Rancic and Brad Goreski, and with Melissa Rivers, Joan's daughter, as executive producer.There was no word on who will permanently replace Griffin, whom the channel thanked for her work, or Osbourne.
