Concerts in Australia and Asia will be announced at a later date, according to Madonna's website. Last week the Grammy-winning singer took a tumble on stage while singing "Living for Love," a single from the album, during a performance at the British music industry's annual Brit Awards.She fell backward down a few stairs when a flowing cape that was part of her matador costume failed to loosen. The singer regained her composure and continued the performance.During a taping of "The Jonathan Ross" show that will air on March 14 on Britain's ITV network, Madonna said the fall was not a publicity stunt. She added that she had suffered a bit of whiplash and had hit her head.Last December early demo tracks from "Rebel Heart," Madonna's 13th studio album, were leaked ahead of its release  next week. An Israeli man was arrested on suspicion of hacking into the computers of Madonna and other singers.Madonna responded to the hacking by releasing six tracks from the album for purchase on iTunes in December.
