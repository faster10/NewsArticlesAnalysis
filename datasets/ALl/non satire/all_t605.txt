Marvin Gaye's family wants to put a stop to "Blurred Lines." Gaye's children filed an injunction in court Tuesday to prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit song featuring Pharrell, Robin Thicke and T.I. Pharrell and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4 million to three of Gaye's children after a jury determined last week that the performers copied elements of the R&B icon's 1977 hit "Got to Give It Up." Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I., whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr., as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment. The injunction against "Blurred Lines" could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits. "With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist," the family said in a statement released Wednesday. "It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued." "Blurred Lines" was the biggest hit of 2013. It sold more than 7 million tracks in the United States, topped the pop charts for months and earned two Grammy Award nominations.
