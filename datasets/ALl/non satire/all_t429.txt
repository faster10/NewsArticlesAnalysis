John Boehner: ‘Too early to predict’ fate of Obama’s war request
House Speaker John Boehner says it’s “too early to predict” whether Congress will approve President Barack Obama’s proposal to authorize the use of military force against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. “The president is asking for less authority than he has today under previous authorizations. I don’t think that’s smart. We need a robust strategy to take on ISIL,” the Ohio Republican told Chris Wallace in an interview aired on “Fox News Sunday.” “No one has seen one from this White House yet.” Story Continued Below “In addition to a robust strategy,” the speaker added, “I think we need to have a robust authorization, and I don’t believe that what the president’s said here gives him the flexibility or the authority to take on this enemy and to win. And so I look at the submission by the president as the beginning of the process.” “We’re going to have a big debate,” Boehner predicted. “To do this correctly, I think we need to have bipartisan support on both sides of the Capitol.” Boehner, who took office in 1991, said his first vote in Congress was authorizing President George H.W. Bush to push Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. Last week, Obama asked Congress to approve military action against ISIL that would not allow “enduring offensive ground combat operations,” vowing the terrorist group “is going to lose.” Boehner says bipartisan discussions to strengthen the president’s actions are necessary before any final approval. “He says the threat is being diminished. The fact is, ISIL continues to gain new territory,” Boehner said.
