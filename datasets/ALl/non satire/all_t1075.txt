I loved Spock," President Barack Obama, whose unemotional approach to problems has been likened to the character Nimoy portrayed on "Star Trek."  "I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent and his capacity to love," William Shatner, who co-starred on "Star Trek" as Captain Kirk, said in a statement."Today, the world lost a great man, and I lost a great friend. We return you now to the stars, Leonard. You taught us to 'Live Long And Prosper,' and you indeed did, friend. I shall miss you in so many, many ways," "Star Trek" fellow cast member George Takei, who played Ensign Sulu, wrote on Facebook."My heart is broken. I love you profoundly my dear friend. And I will miss you everyday. May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest," actor Zachary Quinto, who portrays Spock in the current "Star Trek" film series, said on website Instagram."He was a true force of strength and his character was that of a champion," "Star Trek" cast member Nichelle Nichols, who played Lieutenant Uhura, said in a statement.
