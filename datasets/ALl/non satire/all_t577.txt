"Jeopardy" player lands in final round all alone
And then there was one.The final round of "Jeopardy" typically features three contenders ready to take one last shot at a chance to win some big cash in the long-running TV game show. But one Wednesday night, one lone contender remained ready to answer the Final Jeopardy round. The other two contestants ended up in the negative, which meant they got the boot, leaving Kristin Sausville -- a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom -- to compete with -- well, no one. "This was not one of our greatest days," host Alex Trebek said as the final scores were announced. "Kristin, I think you're going to win."Sausville  got the question wrong, but she still managed to walk away with $6,800, bringing her two-day totally to $31,601."It was more nerve-wracking to be the only person on stage," Sausville told People. "On the one hand, it was nice not to have to worry about what anyone else was wagering, but at the same time, it meant that all of the contestant coordinators, compliance people, and stage crew were standing around me."
