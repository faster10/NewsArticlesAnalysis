Several western retailers, including Zara owner Inditex, Britain's Burberry and ASOS, have joined TMall this year as they look to boost their presence in China.Imported food, shoes, toys and kitchenware are listed on Amazon's store, one of the many on Tmall that sell brand-name goods to Chinese shoppers, Bloomberg, which first reported the news, said on Thursday.Amazon also operates its own e-commerce site in China.
