A source also told Us Weekly that Cooper and Waterhouse decided to "take a break" because of their busy schedules. Cooper and Waterhouse were first linked in March 2013 and have mainly kept their romance under wraps."I don't talk about my boyfriend because it's boring," she told ELLE U.K. last year. "At least, that's what I decided to tell you when you asked. ... Maybe it's best for me to say, 'I'm not one of those girls who goes on about their boyfriends.' I do think whatever I say will sound weird. But the truth is, if I start talking about him, I probably won't be able to stop. And I don't really want to talk about him, you know?"E! News, which was first to report the split, adds that Waterhouse's rep declined to comment, while Cooper's rep didn't respond to a request for comment.
