Mitch McConnell: ‘I’m a big fan of vaccinations’
Polio survivor Mitch McConnell declared himself a “big fan” of vaccinations Tuesday but declined to endorse mandating the practice, as several prominent Republicans face controversy over their positions on child vaccines. Broad vaccination efforts helped the United States eradicate polio more than 30 years ago, though McConnell was afflicted with the disease when he was a toddler. He said, given that experience, that parents should vaccinate their children against infectious diseases, a hot-button issue given the spread of diseases in California theme parks that has been blamed on parents opting against vaccinations.

And if I were a parent who had a child who might be subject to getting any particular disease I would come down on the side of vaccinations,” McConnell told reporters. But he was careful not to argue that the practice should be required by the government, and said he was speaking only for himself and what he would do as a parent today. “I can tell you what I would do if I was a parent and I had a child in this situation,” McConnell said when asked if vaccines should be mandatory. McConnell’s close ally and presidential hopeful Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) drew major criticism on Monday for saying vaccines should be “voluntary,” going so far as to posit that vaccinations could lead to mental problems.
