NASA probe seeks new planets to borrow money from
A NASA space probe has been launched to find Earth-like planets who can lend us money. As global debt approaches $200 trillion, the probe is aimed at making contact with alien civilisations and sending back information on their interest rates and whether they accept children as collateral. NASA spokesman Nathan Muir said: “Obviously we’re also keen to exchange technology and forge friendships, but realistically speaking this is about cash. “Perhaps we can provide an example of how not to build a financial system so rapacious that the entire planet is facing bankruptcy. Or maybe we could sell them iPhones.” Previous missions to touch other planets for a loan included the Beagle 2 expedition to Mars, which was equipped with irresistible, big begging eyes.
