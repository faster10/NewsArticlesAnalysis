" The park has this thing , it ' s like a solid wood hamster wheel , " Brandt said . " I figure that ' d be the best place to go , because you can ' t see it from the street , and we can still smoke there even if it starts raining . It ' s either that or underneath the big slide , which isn ' t as hidden . Plus , it smells really bad under there , so that ' s a last resort . "
