AD NETWORK RELENTS
Online advertising network DoubleClick, under fire from the New York state attorney general for its now-scrapped plan to personally identify Web surfers and their habits through its software, denied today it ever implemented the scheme and offered to make amends by paying for online subscriptions to “any of the numerous porn sites” the attorney general frequents daily between 11:35 a.m. and 2 p.m. from his Dell XPS D300 office computer running Windows 98 and Netscape Navigator 4.6.
