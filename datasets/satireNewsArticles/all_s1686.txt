Hillary Clinton has ‘totally safe’ private internet

No one knows about that raunchy joke except us.” One reporter asked Clinton if it was indeed her who had sent world leaders emails from the account with ads for discount Viagra, profanity-laden criticism of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign, and misspelled references to Monica Lewinsky’s mouth. “Rest assured that my internet is safe, because I invented it,” she said. “I’m the only one who can break it.”
