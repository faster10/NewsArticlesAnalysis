As of press time , the Yankees , in conjunction with Major League Baseball , are not planning any type of formal tribute to honor their fallen star ' s memory . In addition , when asked if the jersey belonging to the 10 time Silver Slugger Award winner , multiple Gold Glove Award recipient , and 12 time American League All Star would be retired in Yankee Stadium , or even if his bust would one day be enshrined in baseball ' s Hall of Fame , no comment was forthcoming from either the Yankees or Hall of Fame voters .
