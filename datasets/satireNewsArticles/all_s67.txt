Sarah Palin: “I’m Glad Mr. Ferguson Wasn’t Indicted”
Sarah Palin confused the city of Ferguson, Missouri with police officer Darren Wilson tonight on national television. In an interview on Fox News, the former Alaska governor said she was happy that “Mr. Ferguson” was not indicted in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in the town of Ferguson on Aug. 9. Palin has apparently been confusing the two names for months. “Mr. Ferguson was just a good officer doing his job,” she told host Sean Hannity. “And the Ferguson family has been a pillar of that community for decades. “The police need to be able to deal with thugs without worry they will get in trouble. This is a great example of showing how America has the best justice system in the world. I just can’t believe Officer Ferguson did anything wrong. He could have died in the incident.” After a long investigation, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced tonight that officer Wilson would not be indicted. Reactions of the news flooded social media and news outlets. In a subsequent interview tonight with the Alaskan Moose Gazette, Palin was asked about victim Michael Brown. “We all know stealing is wrong and sometimes these things happen,” she told the paper. “It shouldn’t take away from the fine job police do all over this country. Law enforcement officials are role models and heroes. Hopefully, people learn from this. “I just pray Obama doesn’t take this matter into his own hands. The justice system has spoken, Mr. President, so keep your hands away.” In final words she told the paper, “My prayers go out to Mr. Ferguson and the entire Ferguson family.”
