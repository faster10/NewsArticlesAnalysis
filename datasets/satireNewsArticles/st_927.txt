" First of all , the astronauts are not secured by any seat belts or straps there aren ' t even seats to begin with meaning that they would be thrown about the cabin immediately upon liftoff , " said former space shuttle Endeavour commander Christopher Ferguson , who noted that , even if the seemingly rudimentary boosters could generate enough thrust to reach orbit , there appeared to be no coolant system to prevent the intense 5 , 000 degree temperatures of fuel burns from vaporizing the entire craft . " In addition , the large glass dome surrounding the cockpit would shatter almost instantly from the intense atmospheric pressure of reaching escape velocity . They won ' t be playing on a basketball hoop on the flight deck when that happens , I assure you of that . They would be propelled out of the module and suffocate within seconds . "
