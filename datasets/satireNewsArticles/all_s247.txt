Morsi Declares Himself Dictator For Life
Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has declared himself dictator for life, scuppering hopes that Egypt's revolution will lead to a flowering new democracy. During a live interview with BBC Arabic Television, the United States-educated engineer says he is canceling the writing of a new constitution and will remain in office indefinitely to "protect the integrity of the revolution." Morsi was elected as Egypt's president in June as the candidate of a party affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. It was the first democratic election in Egypt's history, but since taking office Morsi has been slowly reversing democratic reforms and taking on authoritarian powers. Morsi Is The Solution (محمد مرسي هو الحل) The BBC News reporter asked Morsi about the disillusionment many in Egypt feel over the betrayal of promises made on democracy during the revolution: "Democracy?...Nope. I don't remember anything about democracy," Morsi responded, 'Are you sure the revolution was about democracy?" "Yes sir," replied the anchor. "The protesters in the last days of Mubarak's regime were calling for free and fair elections, and a new democratic constitution." "Really? Yeah... no sorry that just doesn't ring a bell." "Let's see I remember the protests. I remember Tahrir Square. I remember Mubarak resigning. And I remember Anderson Cooper. We let him come over here to report. This was before we knew he was gay, of course. "But no I don't remember anything about democracy. I'm pretty sure millions of people were in the streets because they thought Mubarak was too old and wanted someone younger and better-looking as their dictator." Leaders in Europe, the U.S. and the Arab League have all condemned Morsi's move. Egypt was the largest and most influential country to overthrow its leader during the Arab Spring. Its reversion to dictatorship will disappoint democracy advocates in the region.
