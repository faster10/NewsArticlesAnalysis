Bruno Mars Tells Harper to Stop Performing “Uptown Funk”
Lawyers for Atlantic Records have warned Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to cease and desist singing the Bruno Mars hit “Uptown Funk” in public. “He ain’t got no funk, man. None…at…all,” Young Jeezy, Atlantic Vice President of A&R, told the L.A. Times today. “I mean I was watchin’ video of him do some gig for all these stuffed people and I was dyin’ man…I was cryin’ it was so bad.” “But fuck, I wasn’t laughin’ when he started tryin’ to sing Bruno’s Uptown Funk.” “I knew I had to slap that guy down when he started to dance…oh man oh man oh man.”  Prime Minister Harper has frequently taken to stages to sing and play the electric organ for Conservative Party members and big business leaders. In a 2014 visit to Israel, Harper wowed a Tel Aviv crowd by singing a medley of Jewish folk songs, then breaking into pop songs and finishing with Helen Reddy’s 1975 hit “You and Me Against the World”, which reportedly brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to tears. The Times is reporting that calls to ask the Canadian Prime Minister’s office about Atlantic’s demand were put on hold and the background music was “an off-tune man singing the lyrics “I’m too hot (hot damn)…Say my name you know who I am”, lyrics from Mars hit song. “Look, if Canada’s man wants to sing it in the shower, all good,” said Jeezy. “He sings it within 10 feet of a microphone, I’m suin’ his amateur ass.”
