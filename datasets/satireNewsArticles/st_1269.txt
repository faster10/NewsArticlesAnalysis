According to Morris , Alvin ' s father sent the chipmunk to Hollywood while still an infant , with the stated intention of following later . The elder animal remained in the forest , however , leaving Alvin and his brothers alone in the human world . It was then that Alvin met Seville , who developed a liking for the chipmunks and adopted them as his own children .
