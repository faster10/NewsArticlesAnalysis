Bill Gates Announces Plan To Put Giant Digital Billboard On The Moon
The uber-rich computer pioneer, Bill Gates, has released plans to launch one of the most ambitious projects since America shot a man into space. Gates, in collaboration with NASA, will be installing an enormous flat screen television on the moon so that all of Earth’s inhabitants can see it in the night’s sky. During a recent press conference, Gates announced his new project. The Microsoft mogul told press, “First man walked on the moon. Now we’re taking that extra step towards marketing on the moon. It is prime real estate for advertisers.” Blueprints have been submitted and all the required permits have been obtained in order to pull off this legendary leap in advertising history. The screen will be be remotely controlled from Earth to display beautiful HD images and video. Gates financial team expects to pay 75 million to construct and install the one thousand mile wide monitor. Gates stands to make 3 billion dollars in the first fiscal year based on advertisements alone. Several big name corporations are clamoring over the coveted first advertisement from the moon, including Disney, Chrysler and Sony. Pepsi has reportedly offered the highest bid thus far, and is making arrangements with Beyonce to create an elaborately spectacular show which will be streamed live via the surface of the moon. People will be able to tune into the audio broadcast accompanying the show via mobile devices. Others aren’t so thrilled about Gates plans. Darren Walker, an amateur astronomer who attended the conference had the following to say, “We already have advertisements shoved in our faces everywhere we go, now someone is planning to install an obnoxious fixture that will obstruct the view of the moon. It’s like putting advertising screens all over the grand canyon. It’s tasteless and ought to be illegal.”
