" Although violent , cockfighting is a traditional part of the American lawmaker ' s way of life , " the legislator said . " It ' s a sport , with a code of conduct the uninitiated simply wouldn ' t understand . I ' m sure many of the good people of Oklahoma , hypothetically speaking , would agree that there ' s a place for different people ' s tastes in this great country . As far as the cruelty charges go , that ' s ludicrous . I love my fighting cocks my wife likes to say I treat my champion red eyes better than I treat her and I ' m sure my fellow Congressmen would say much the same . "
