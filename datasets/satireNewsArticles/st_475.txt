" If I want to miss the point , that ' s my own business , " said Ernie Schayr , a Wheeling , WV , auto mechanic . " If I want to complain about having to pay taxes while at the same time demanding extra police protection for my neighborhood , that ' s my right as an American . Most people in other countries don ' t ever get the chance to miss the point , and that ' s tragic . The East Timorese are so busy fleeing for their lives , they never have the chance to go to the supermarket during the busiest time of the week and complain to the cashier about how long the lines are and ask them why they don ' t do something about it .
