" At this desperate hour , my hands are tied , " the letter continued . " My office phone lines have been cut . By gnawing through my gag and inching my chair along the floor , I have been able to reach my computer , turn it on using my nose , and activate my ViaVoice speech recognition typing software . However , my time is limited , and I have managed to successfully stick only one adhesive backed , mass mailing address label to an envelope . MICHAEL , it is not yet too late to prevent the extinction of noble , majestic Robert Redford , if only you act now ! "
