Blackhawk’s Patrick Kane Rushed to Hair Salon
Immediately following the Chicago Blackhawk’s victory over the Boston Bruins in the NHL Stanley Cup series, Patrick Kane was rushed to a hair salon for emergency treatment of what the team is calling an “upper body” concern. “Patrick took some pretty good shots to the mullet,” said a grim Hawks’ coach Joel Quenneville. “He was mussed up pretty badly but he’s day-to-day and we’ll know more over the next 48 hours.” The games between the two teams have been rough with neither team shaving or giving an inch, resulting in the latest injuries to the Bruins’ Patrice Bergeron (suspected ruptured spleen or kidney) and Hawks’ captain Jonathan Toews (suspected concussion or sinus oozing). “We expect Patrick to be lookin’ good in the lineup for the game in Boston,” said Quenneville. “His feathered bangs may not be 100% but these guys all play through these things at playoff time.” The diminutive Kane has over 200,000 twitter fans and his facebook page…”I Want to Have Patrick Kane’s Baby”…was briefly shut down due to high volumes when reports of his do injury were first reported.
