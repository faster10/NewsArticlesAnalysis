Internet users told to change all passwords to swearing
WEB users should change their passwords to really dirty swearing, it has been claimed. Experts warned that the only way to stop hackers using the Heartless bug to steal absolutely everything was by creating super-obscene passwords. IT expert Stephen Malley said: “Your current passwords are something lame like ‘Gary1977′ or your dog’s name. You need to swap them for swearing because Russian hackers don’t know our rude words. “The dirtier a password, the more secure it is. “‘Havingawank01′ is weak but ‘shitfuckorgyfanny69′ is strong, especially as not many people use the word ‘orgy’ these days.” 67-year-old Mary Fisher said: “As a ‘silver surfer’ I find these things a bit confusing. I already had ‘fistmyfishym1nge’ as my Lloyds password, just because it sprang to mind at the time, but is it lewd enough?”
