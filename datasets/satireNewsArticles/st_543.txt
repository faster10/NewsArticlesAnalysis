" The new album will definitely reflect our maturation as a group and as individuals , " said Perry , who may be large but is no dumb cookie . " Back then , we were young , wild and arrogant : Jim McMahon had his spiked hair , shades and controversial , message bearing headbands , and I had my legendary eating exploits and rushing touchdowns . We kind of had this attitude like , ' We ' re so bad , we know we ' re good , blowing your mind like we knew we would . ' But while the new record will still have that trademark Shufflin ' Crew swagger , it will also show our more reflective side . "
