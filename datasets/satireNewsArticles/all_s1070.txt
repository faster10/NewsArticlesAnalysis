A Buff Madonna Punches Out Taylor Swift and Lady GaGa
Backstage at the Grammy Awards was apparently quite a rowdy affair as details are just emerging of a backstage fight.  Apparently Lady Gaga had leaned in to kiss Madonna and Madonna swung and hit her, knocking her to the floor. At this point Taylor Swift ran in to assist Lady Gaga and Madonna decked Swift, knocking her out with one punch. \"I'm tired of these bitches and their redactive music!\" Madonna could be heard saying as she left the auditorium, flashing a few alley dwellers on her way out. \"Madonna can get mean when she is really juiced and has been working out. Sometimes it's best to just stay out of her way\" spoke a Madonna publicity hack.
