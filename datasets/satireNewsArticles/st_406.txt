" I worked out for three months , focusing my full energies on preparing for this race , " Worth said . " I switched to a vegan macrobiotic diet just to be in top shape . Three kilometers in , I felt great , like this was going to be the year we cured it . I did break my personal 5K record , but even that wasn ' t enough . Then , after I crossed the finish line , I watched other racers finish , but they came in empty handed , as well . "
