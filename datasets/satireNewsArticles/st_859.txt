On display at the base of the memorial are hundreds of letters written by those who fought in the war . Among the many stirring testimonials is a letter written many years ago by a nameless , 21 year old copywriter who lost his job in the Cola War . It reads : " I dream of a day when there is no Coke , of a day when there is no Pepsi . On this day , the people of the world will not be bitterly divided between two leading brands . On this day , there will be only one beverage , uniting us all : sweet , refreshing cola . "
