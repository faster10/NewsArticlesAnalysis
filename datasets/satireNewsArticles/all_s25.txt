Lucky man closer to dream of being losing Republican presidential candidate in 2016
Demonstrating that he is moderate enough to appeal to voters in both parties, Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie easily won reelection Tuesday, proving himself the best candidate to lose the presidential election in 2016. “I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Christie said to thousands of cheering supporters during his acceptance speech. “It’s with great pride and honor that I remain your rather likeable and middle-of-the-road governor.” “With this victory, I’m also one step closer to being the GOP’s losing presidential candidate in 2016,” he added. In an interview with The Star-Ledger, Christie said he would be thrilled to be nominated as the Republican loser in 2016, joining the ranks of moderates John McCain and Mitt Romney — two electable Republican candidates who went on to lose in 2008 and 2012, respectively.
