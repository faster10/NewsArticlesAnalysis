Tinder to charge ugly users more for premium services
People who receive far more left swipes than right ones will be charged more to use dating app Tinder, the app publishers have announced today. The move is seen as part of a drive to monetise the app whilst simultaneously driving ugly people away from the platform. A spokesperson for Tinder said, “We have done extensive customer testing, and the number one piece of feedback we get is ‘fewer ugly people please’.” “People are bored with having to swipe left all the time.” “So our new feature will still allow ugly people to have a profile, but you will be safe in the knowledge that even though they’re not much to look at, the fact that their still on Tinder means that at least they’re rich.” “It also allows us to effectively monetise the growing market of horny young people who are seemingly incapable of meeting someone in the real world.” Tinder user Simon Williams said he was disappointed by the announcement that Tinder will start charging ugly people. He told us, “I don’t think there are that many ugly women on tinder, so it’s never really been a problem for me.” “I mean, I swipe right for 90% of the profiles I see – so I’m pretty sure that I’ll get a match from someone soon.” “It’s only been three months, so it’s still early days.” “Anyway, I’m sure my chances have improved now that I’m paying £20 a month for the privilege.”
