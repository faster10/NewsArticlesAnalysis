Fermat’s theorem proof found in pudding
For once it’s not an overstatement to say that the world is in shock today with the announcement that the proof really is in the pudding. Following the accidental discovery of the missing short proof of ‘Fermat’s last theorem’ halfway through a pineapple upside down cake last week, the scientific community, religious groups and anyone with a point to prove have been contemplating and eating puddings. Faced with unequivocal proof of evolution based on Richard Dawkins’ mum’s apple crumble, Creationists have been having meetings with each other where they stare at fools. Some have started turning to tarts for inspiration. In a race to prove the existence of god, the Pope has ordered all church services this weekend to include a communal ‘pudding introspective’ when ‘all religious people should study the deeper meanings of Spotted Dick’. Professor Brian Cox has been seen eating brownies with a glazed look in his eyes exclaiming that the wall of his room is a mirror on the cosmos while other cosmologists are running ‘pudding date evenings’ with couples being encouraged to try some divine puddings and see if they find the big bang. The government is considering the implications of using puddings as evidence in Court and has appointed Eric Pickles to investigate all things pudding related. Homeopaths have invented a water pudding consisting of 1 part water, 2 parts water and the rest water. After staring at it for a while, one of them said ‘What the hell am I doing staring at a bowl of water. This is all rubbish’ which is being taken as proof that homeopathy is rubbish. Philosophers have started to examine whether a tree falling in a forest makes less noise than one falling the Black Forest with a nice gateaux nearby. Large numbers of people in Scotland and Yorkshire have been drinking pints while eating Haggis or Yorkshire pudding but this is not thought to be related to the new discoveries.
