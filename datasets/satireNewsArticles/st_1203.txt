" In challenging times such as these , there is really no use in pretending all of our children represent the best we have to offer , because in every conceivable sense , that just isn ' t the case , " said Education Secretary Arne Duncan , adding that operating under this delusion had cost the nation untold trillions of dollars . " We want our country to remain strong and competitive , obviously , and for the next generation to make a better world than the one we left for them . Therefore and trust me on this we must put everything we have into these 50 kids , and only these 50 kids , because their less meritorious peers are , by comparison , outright dullards . "
