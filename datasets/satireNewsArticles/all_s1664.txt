All new houses to be made of televisions
BUILDERS have completed the first UK home made entirely from television sets.  The three-bedroom Swindon dwelling is constructed from flat screens of varying size slotted together, creating a light-but-strong structure that allows unrivalled telly visibility.n Building contractor Stephen Malley said:“Increasingly people want televisions instead of windows, televisions instead of internal walls and don’t bother with lights because the telly’s never off. However this is the first build we’ve done where we just welded a load of telly sets together into a rough house shape.n “I think the result works very well except it does get quite warm and the family’s dog chewed off its paw after being unable to escape The One Show.”n Telly house owner Nikki Hollis said: “In the original plans the house was made of bricks and the furniture was obscuring our view of the telly.n “The only thing in life that’s really worthwhile is telly, so why not live in it?n “Having Eastenders on the floor is really great for when you’ve got a tired neck and don’t want to look straight ahead.n “The only thing in the house that’s not a television screen is the roof, because we don’t really go on the roof. But we might get it done away, in case people in planes want to see a few seconds of Salvage Hunters.”n
