Dot-Coms Sick of All the Survivor Analogies
Executives at nearly a dozen flailing Internet companies said today they were “sick and tired” of all the analogies to the CBS show Survivor, and just hope it all comes to an end now that the show is over. “It was real cute at first,” said Timothy Harrington, CEO of online sports retailer Fogdog. “You know, like the one about how the Internet, just like TV, went from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? to Survivor. Ha ha. But the truth is, to equate some stupid television show to the misfortunes of real people and real businesses is insensitive and irresponsible.”Asked if Fogdog planned to apply as a particpant in next season’s Survivor, Harrington became highly agitated, forcing a reporter to hastily exit Fogdog’s offices.
