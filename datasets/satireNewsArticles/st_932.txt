" When Teri canceled on me , I was pretty disappointed , " Hubrin said . " I didn ' t want to just mope around in front of my wife , so instead of going home , I went to a coffee shop . This beautiful woman was working the counter alone , and we got to talking . She told me her name was Amanda . Next thing you know , it ' s nearly 11 p . m . , and the place is closing . Just before I left , on a crazy whim I said , ' What are you doing Wednesday ? ' That ' s how it started . "
