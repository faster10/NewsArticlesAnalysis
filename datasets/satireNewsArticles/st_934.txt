" We went to this little out of the way place for drinks and just talked and talked until I had to race home before Nancy suspected something , " Hubrin said . " The whole time , I kept thinking , ' She is amazing . ' I told her about my wife , but she ' d already deduced that I was married from the ring mark on my finger . The first few months I was seeing Teri , she had no idea I was married . So , obviously , Amanda has a little more going on upstairs , which I always find attractive in a mistress . "
