" I know I really should save for my future , but it ' s almost impossible with all the great crap you come across , " Vartan said . " If I ever do manage to save enough money , though , I ' d love to get a house in Celebration , FL , that freako Disney planned community near Orlando . That place sounds so unbelievably weird and depressing , it ' d be hilarious . "
