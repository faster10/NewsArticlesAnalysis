Nebula Alleges Hubble Pics Faked
The Omega nebula, also known as the Horseshoe nebula or M17, filed suit today against the U.S. government and NASA claiming recently released pictures allegedly taken by the Hubble Space Telescope were faked. “Anybody who knows me knows that those are not my star clusters,” said the massive, star-forming region of the Milky Way galaxy. “Clearly, those are somebody else’s clusters superimposed over my hydrogen cloud.”NASA refused to comment about the suit, although officials said they had agreed to stop referring to the Nebula as a “hotbed” of stellar activity.
