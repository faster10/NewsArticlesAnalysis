Glass exists, admit flies
FLIES have admitted the universe contains a substance which light can pass through but they cannot. The hypothesis is based on countless hours of repeatedly smacking into every point where such a barrier is thought to exist. Fly scientist Tom Booker said: “How could something be hard and see-through? It’s too mental. “Fly wisdom had it that any barrier is only an illusion caused by not flying at it often enough. “But after seeing hundreds, if not thousands, of close friends suddenly explode in what seemed to be mid-air, it’s time to accept that the ‘glassers’ among us are not just crackpots.” The ‘glass theory’, which most flies admit they find impossible to even understand, follows last year’s claim that the wonderful sound of buzzing may act as an irritant to higher-dimensional beings. Fly Nathan Muir said: “It’s utter nonsense. I’m just having a bit of trouble flying through this bit, that’s all. “I’ll try this bit. No? Then this bit. Have I tried over here already?” Tom Booker said: “There may be a way to instantly teleport from one side of the barrier to the other. I saw a film about that, I can’t remember the title but it was good.”
