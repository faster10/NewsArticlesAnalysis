" We ' re seeing a lot of adults all across the country getting together and doing 10 , 15 years of comfortable routines at work and at home , losing touch with any real passion or energy that they presumably had for their partners or jobs , and gradually slipping into a kind of numbed routine devoid of variation or joy , " said lead researcher Susan McClintock , adding that wondering why one ever embarked on a particular career path or relationship to begin with is a particularly popular variant of the trend . " They ' ll start out by not putting a lot of effort into a report that could have gotten them a promotion , or forgetting an anniversary . Pretty soon they ' ve full out ' plateaued ' in their professional and personal lives , and the driven , passionate selves they once knew are just a distant blip in the rearview mirror . "
