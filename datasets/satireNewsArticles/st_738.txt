" I ' d go crazy working in a sterile cubicle all day , " Pelinka said . " Just take a look around this place . Desk , computer , chair . Wall , wall , door , wall . Management might as well drop us in a sensory deprivation tank and say , ' Get to work . ' Now , my cubicle , on the other hand nobody ' s going to mistake it for any other around here , that ' s for sure . "
