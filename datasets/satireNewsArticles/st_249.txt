In response to the relative tragedy , Greyhound has agreed to donate 200 worth of rolled quarters and greasy , crumpled dollar bills they had collected as bus fare to a local charity . The casualties of the crash will also be memorialized with a small commemorative plaque that will hang at the Albany station , between an out of order vending machine and a set of bathrooms where customers can often be heard weeping .
