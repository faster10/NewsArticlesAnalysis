" These kids today have no idea what real punk is , " said Tolbert , who called himself " Steve Spew " from 1992 until May 1999 , when he was forced to revert to his real name to take a job at Roberto ' s Custom Auto Upholstery . " Those so called punk bands they listen to today ? Sum 41 ? Good Charlotte ? The Ataris ? They ' re not punk . Back in the day , man , we used to listen to the real deal : Rancid , The Offspring , NOFX , Green Day . Those guys were what true punk rock was all about . Today ' s stuff is just a pale , watered down imitation . There ' s no comparison . "
