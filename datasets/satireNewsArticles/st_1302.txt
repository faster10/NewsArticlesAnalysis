" Ever since my divorce nine years ago , I ' d been meaning to keep this place a little more clean and presentable for visitors , " said Pulsipher , who last had a houseguest in April 1997 . " But with all the different sprays and sponges you have to use , who has the time ? But when I saw the Swiffer ad on TV , I thought to myself : Wow , all that cleaning power in one simple , easy to use tool ! And such a bargain ! I guess I thought that maybe if I bought one , my life would be easier , more fun , more special . Well , I thought wrong . "
