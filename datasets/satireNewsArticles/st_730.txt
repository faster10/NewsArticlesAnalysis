" We can have no arbitrary setting of limits when it comes to the Bill of Rights , " Strossen said . " The Constitution does not say , ' You have the right to express these opinions , but not those opinions . ' Nor does it say , ' You can express these opinions by word , but not by violence . ' For a free society to work , hatred , in all its forms , must be encouraged . "
