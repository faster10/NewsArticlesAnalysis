Olsen was similarly disappointed . " It is truly disheartening for a star like myself to be let down by his fans like this . I specifically appealed to my public not to let this precious child of God die , and this is what happens ? " said Olsen , whose television career has included roles on the heartwarming family drama Little House On The Prairie and the modestly successful Catholic themed early ' 80s action crime drama Father Murphy , as well as numerous commercial and parade host appearances . " I looked directly into the camera and said , ' See this child ' s eyes ? These are the eyes of a beautiful young person who needs your help , ' you know , the whole bit . But , apparently , millions of viewers figured , ' Let him die . ' What is with people these days , anyway ? "
