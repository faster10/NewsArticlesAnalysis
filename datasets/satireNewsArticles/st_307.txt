" Unfortunately , ' Earth Day 2000 ' wasn ' t as successful as we had hoped , " Time managing editor Walter Isaacson said . " After selling out of such special issues as ' The Future Of Medicine , ' ' Baseball At 100 , ' ' The Kennedys : An American Dynasty , ' and ' Celebrating The American Automobile , ' we thought we had another winner with this one . But of a press run of 485 , 000 , only 35 , 000 sold . I guess we overestimated the demand for a full color , 98 page Earth Day issue printed on glossy , high pulp paper . "
