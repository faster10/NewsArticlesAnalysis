Oscar Salad by Ann Tone
Red faces were very much in vogue in Hollywood after last nights Oscars.  A delivery person, carrying a long wooden tray of salad ingredients was sent by security staff to the front entrance of the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, instead of the servants/delivery entrance. Security at the front door asked the man his business and he said he was accompanying a batch of cucumbers. Quite remarkably, security let him enter the main hall where the stars were all seated and then even more surprisingly he was asked to leave the salad staples on a seat - at a table - with the placename 'Cumberbatch'. No one appeared to notice as the tray of greens sat there on the chair for the most of the night and it was even awarded best actor for the movie 'The imitation game', ironically enough. Friends of Mr Cumberbatch remarked that they hadn't noticed 'Benedict' wasn't there because they saw someone or something sitting in his seat and assumed it was him as it had the same personality as him. The real Mr Cumberbatch had earlier been arrested outside the Dolby for imitating himself.  Academy Awards (A.A.) organisers are said to be reviewing their security. \"Imagine if those cucumbers had been the suicide bombing sort\", one member of the A.A. was overheard saying. Only in La-La land folks.
