House Sends Spam Bill to Senate; Senate Spam Filter Deletes It
The anti-spam bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday was sent to the Senate today, but the Senate’s spam filtering software automatically determined it was junk mail and deleted it. Amy Lee, Chief System Administrator of the Senate, defended the software’s actions: “Our filter recognizes the email addresses of anyone known to propagate junk,” she said. “This one came from house.gov. Of course the program blocked it.”Undeterred, House leaders vowed to send the Unsolicited Electronic Mail Act again. “We sent that bill to the Senate because they were referred or requested additional information,” said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M. “I don’t want to waste their time or ours, but we are seeking positive, motivated individuals that are serious about voting for this bill and making their dreams come true! Hot House staffers are waiting for their call !!!”
