Disgusting Yoga Pants to be banned from the Streets of London!
CIA HQ, down the sewer sends this latest fashion mind-blowing report!  Jaggedone's CIA star fashion reporter, GayGordon Voyeur-Buttockbouncer, has just sent this shocking fashion newsflash from the top of a manhole in Oxford Street: Yoga Pants are indecent!  \"Religious leaders, hypocrites and judges are claiming the latest craze to hit the streets of London, yoga pants, are indecent, seductive and should not be worn in public! Brit women wearing high-heels, min-skirts up to their bums and low cleavage tops revealing their cleavage (That's logical) and busty boobs are no problem (We agree to that one, nod, nod!), but these disgusting yoga pants really should be banned.The reason is obvious, yoga pants are tight and reveal the outline of women's private parts (you know what that is don't you dirty old men) and men wearing them reveal their bunches of grapes and depending on size and thickness, show a perfect outline of their favourite toys (Indian men excluded because one needs a microscope to see their pride and joy!).Judge Percy Pedo-File and Catholic priest, Reverend Sebastian Suckercock, have also condemned the wearing of such disgusting pants in public, but in their private quarters, no problem!\"  Our star fashion reporter, GayGordon Voyeur-Buttockbouncer, has also commented on wearing yoga pants in public and his opinion is that if they are worn by young males, no problem, but the outline of a clit, oh, by golly, how revolting, and should really be banned! More as we see it and look here Jaggedone's CIA is always on the 'hub' of fashion back to front!
