Myst VI To Thrill Gamers In 2015
Cyan Worlds Inc, developers of the the original Myst ™ games I, II, and V, are set to stir up the gaming world again at GamesCom 2015 by announcing that they are working on Myst VI, a sequel to the Myst games that were enormously successful in the in the late ’90s and early 2000s. System requirements According to documents leaked from Cyan’s Head Office in Mead, Washington, the new adventure will require fairly powerful hardware. The underlying game engine, called Unity 2.0, will run in degraded mode on late model PS4s and Xbox Ones. But for the ultimate gaming experience users will be able to network three 27” Retina-equipped 1TB SSD iMacs, connected to a cinema-quality sound module and an active water-cooled speaker system. A Google Fiber 1GB/s Internet connection is desirable, but not essential to play the basic offline version of the game. A version for iPhone and Androïd is planned for early 2016. Sponsorship from several top Hollywood studios has allowed Cyan Inc’s Miller brothers to employ world-class actors for the interactive AI characters central to the game’s plot. The identities of the celebrities involved are a closely guarded secret, but speculation is rife, with Jennifer Lawrence, Sean Bean, Kate Beckinsale, Miley Cyrus and Christoph Waltz reputedly having signed pre-contracts.
