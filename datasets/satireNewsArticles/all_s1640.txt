Human intelligence to fall below level of household appliances
AVERAGE human intelligence will soon be surpassed by that of a toasted sandwich maker, experts have claimed. It had been thought that the ‘singularity’ – the moment when machine intelligence overtakes that of humans – would be triggered by improved robot technology. However scientists have revealed that all machines have to do is stay the same while human intelligence continues to plummet. Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “Machines don’t need to improve. They just need to not break for a few years and they’ll be the de facto rulers of an increasingly moronic human race. “Already we’re seeing a disparity of usefulness. A toasted sandwich machine can heat bread and cheese to a desired temperature, whereas a human must operate at maximum capacity to sit on a sofa watching a boy band member eat an elk gonad.”
