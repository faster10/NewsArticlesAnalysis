Hillary Clinton wishes for a white president in 2016
In an interview with Esquire, Hillary Clinton said she hopes the 2016 presidential election will show a continued enthusiasm for change in the United States. “2008 was groundbreaking,” she said. “Just a mere generation ago it would have been inconceivable that we could have a black president. That Barack Obama is now in his second term is a testament to how far as a nation we have progressed.” “That said,” she added, “in 2016, we really ought to go back to having a white president.”
