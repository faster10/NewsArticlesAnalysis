Sites Offer Large Print for Old People
Reacting to new studies claiming people aged 55 and older are the fastest growing segment of new Internet users, hundreds of Web sites have begun offering large print versions, as well as embedding helpful reminders in their text, such as “Don’t forget about that urology appointment,” and, “Your glasses are on your head.”“Technically, you can change the font size in your browser software if the text is too small, but the people who need to do that are exactly the ones who can’t figure that out,” said Jill Smith, a spokesperson for DeadClassmates.com, a new subsidiary of Classmates.com that helps people find out which old friends and schoolmates are now dead.
