" I ' m definitely going to make the NFL . There ' s no doubt in my mind , " said a gay former college standout who has struggled with the transition to the pros and been cut for three consecutive years . " I ' m going to make it onto the Cowboys this year . I haven ' t been this sure of anything since I was 17 . Mark my words : I ' m going to be playing out there right alongside those straight guys , just like all the other gay players people don ' t realize they ' re cheering for every week . "
