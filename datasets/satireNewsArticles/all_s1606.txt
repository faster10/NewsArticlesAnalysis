Rejuvenating blood must be from virgins
BLOOD transfusions can reverse the ageing process but only if the donors are sexually pure, according to scientists. Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “It appears that after a person has had sex their blood is somehow soiled or tainted. “Interestingly the best blood comes from buxom female virgins, the type that combines innocence with a thinly-veiled sensuality. “It’s best if they come from a medieval-style peasant village where superstition is rife, partly because they are more healthy but also they’re less likely to be missed.” 71-year-old Tom Logan said: “As a part of the baby boomer generation I’ve already had all the houses and money, I’m sure young people won’t mind giving me their blood too.”
