" I don ' t know how he got these thoughts into his head , " the elder Zollner said . " I ' ve always tried to make sure he has a healthy interest in girls . I try to point out the best looking ones to him , in real life as well as in those Victoria ' s Secret catalogs . I also give him lots of encouragement , telling him he ' s going to be quite a stud someday . And just to show him I ' m not uptight , I josh him about the girls he ' s dated , asking him what ' base ' he got to . If he has any specific questions about sex , I make sure to send him to his mother , who ' s better at explaining this stuff . "
