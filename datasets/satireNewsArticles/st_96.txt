" I was hanging out by my car with my buddy Bryan , and this really hot chick comes walking up , " Muntner said . " She asks us for a smoke , and I give her one of my Camels . So Bryan , who ' s a good guy but kind of a goober , says , ' What are you doing Saturday night ? ' She says , ' Nothing with you . ' Then , for some reason , I say , ' How about me ? ' and she smiles and says , ' Sure . ' "
