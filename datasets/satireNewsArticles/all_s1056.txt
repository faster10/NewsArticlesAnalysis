Kanye West Applies For Refugee Status
Should celebrities be legally classified as a protected class of individuals?  Kanye West thinks so when it comes to the way the press and paparazzi treat famous people.  The rapper, producer and fashion designer reportedly applied for Temporary Protected Status under a law designed to safeguard persecuted refugees.  The legislation assists individuals “wishing to avoid returning to their homeland because of civil strife.” “When I try to get from the airport to my home, I become a target for abuse and my family is also in danger,” explained West. “At times they make me want to avoid getting back to my own home. Doesn’t that mean me and my family aren’t protected because of the class we’re in?  Genius level artists need legal protection like exiled people get.  The amount of taxes I pay makes me entitled.” West’s encounters with photographers have led to at least one lawsuit.  Last July, West received a 2-year probation sentence following a plea of no contest to a misdemeanor battery and grand theft charge.  Photographer Daniel Ramos accused West of punching him and throwing his camera to the ground during an unprovoked attack at Los Angeles International Airport. West’s recent remarks comparing photographers to Nazis, and equating the struggles faced by celebrities to acts of violence endured by civil rights freedom fighters have created a considerable amount of controversy.  At a concert last July, the singer again raised eyebrows when he compared the treatment he receives from tabloid photographers to be similar to an act of rape. “That’s what I said,” West reiterated, and if you are in my life, living the way I do at my level, you would know what I’m talking about.” No word yet on when the decision on West’s application will be made.
