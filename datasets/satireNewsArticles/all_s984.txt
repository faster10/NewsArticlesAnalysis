People who post Game of Thrones spoilers the new paedophiles
People who spoil your enjoyment of Game of Thrones are worse than kiddy fiddlers, according to Twitter this morning. With another major character killed off in a ‘surprise twist’ that was only known about by millions of people who own the books, many fans have lashed out at Twitter users for ruining the story for them. As one Internet user explained, “Jesus Christ these people discussing what happened in last nights episode of Game of Thrones are the scum of the earth.” “I swear they take deliberate pleasure in ruining the lives of others, like a sick pervert intent on getting themselves off.” “Why is it so hard to simply enjoy the show in peace and keep it to yourself? Just because you watched it as it was broadcast last night doesn’t make you a better person than me.” However one fan explained, “I watched it last night and I couldn’t wait to get on to Twitter to talk about it at all those people who haven’t seen it yet.” “God, it makes me hard just thinking about all the disappointment I’m causing.” Fan of the show Simon Williams said he has struggled to avoid twitter spoilers this morning, in the hope of watching it like any normal person, when he could find an hour spare to do so. He explained, “This morning has been a case of treating everyone and everything like a potential paedophile. This must be what it’s like to live as a Daily Mail reader.” “It’s bad enough avoiding the Twitter sickos, but there’s this one guy who works in IT who reckons he has read all of the books.” “We’re calling him Hitler.”
