Holder flies to Paris to investigate French cops
Attorney General Eric Holder will fly to Paris tomorrow for what had been billed as high-level talks on security issues with French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira. However it now appears that the actual motive for the trip is to investigate whether French police used profiling or excessive force in their handling of last week’s terrorist attacks in Paris. “It hasn’t escaped the attorney general’s attention that the victims of these police shootings were North Afro-French, and the officers involved were white,” said a DOJ spokesman. “We want to know whether correct procedures were followed, and to what extent these shootings suggest institutional racism and/or white privilege on the part of the hostages who were rescued safely.” In New York last night, a small band of protesters took the the streets, shouting slogans including, “Hands up, my AK-47 has run out of ammo,” “I can’t breathe in this stupid balaclava” and “Je suis Eric Garner et Michael Brown.”
