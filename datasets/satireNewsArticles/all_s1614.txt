Mesolithic hunter was first hot man
FEMALE scientists have unearthed a swarthy, blue-eyed Mesolithic hunter they believe was the first hot man. Professor Mary Fisher, who found the skeleton, said: “In the early stone age there were no good-looking men, they all had protruding foreheads and chimpy walks. “Then this hunting, gathering stud muffin comes along and totally changes the game. “With his square jaw and piercing eyes, he combined strength and sensitivity. “He would venture out in the cold with his spear, bring back a cave bear carcass and cook it himself using delicious foraged herbs and spices. “Then he would wash up all the stone plates in preparation for attentive lovemaking. And he remembered birthdays by scratching off the days on the cave wall with a piece of flint.”
