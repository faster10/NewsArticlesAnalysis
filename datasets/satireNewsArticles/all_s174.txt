Sean Hannity Says Obama ‘Sabotaged’ Super Bowl
Fox News host Sean Hannity has blamed President Obama for Sunday's power outage at the Super Bowl. In a quickly deleted tweet the conservative commentator insinuated that the Obama administration hated capitalism so much it sabotaged the advertising-filled corporate event in an act of civil disobedience. In a tweet posted at 09:07 EST - a half-hour into the power outage delay - Hannity posted his thoughts on the matter:  "Capitalist icon Super Bowl sabotaged days after Socialist @BarackObama takes office. Coincidence? #tyranny" The tweet was deleted just minutes afterward, but was caught and saved by liberal bloggers. Power was soon restored to the New Orelans Superdome and play resumed as normal. A spokesperson for Hannity says he has no comment on the tweet specifically, but hinted that he may address the controversy on his Fox News show. "There's certainly something fishy about a power outage that helped the liberals in San Francisco. Mr. Hannity will provide the details of his suspicions soon."
