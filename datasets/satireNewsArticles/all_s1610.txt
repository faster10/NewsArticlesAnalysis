Twitter exercise demonstrates how unpopular teacher is
A TEACHER has proved what an imbecile he is by attempting to demonstrate how quickly messages spread on social media. IT teacher Mr Cook, known to his pupils as Mr Cock, tweeted a picture of himself holding a message about how fast an image can be shared worldwide. By the end of the day the message had reached only 111 people, 82 of them bots, and the furthest it had travelled was Swansea. Mr Cook, who has a startlingly prominent Adam’s apple, tweeted Harry Styles, Lady Gaga, Graham Linehan and the Department of Education, all of whom deleted his message. Pupil Stephen Malley said: “Not even the other teachers retweeted it. Though the PE teacher did DM ‘Fuck off knobstand.’” 14-year-old Eleanor Shaw said: “It actually taught me something very valuable, namely that contrary to what they tell us complete geeks have no friends even when they grow up. “Their bullying will never end. As an alpha female, that’s actually enormously reassuring for me.” A Vine of a visibly upset Mr Cook accidentally reversing his car into the headmaster’s Alfa has since been seen by 51,660,000 people after being retweeted by Barack Obama.
