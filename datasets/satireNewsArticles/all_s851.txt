Voldemort was a ‘beautiful man radicalised by wizard baby’, claims group
Lord Voldemort, now revealed to be former Hogwarts student Tom Riddle, was today described by an advocacy group as a ‘beautiful man’, whose violent actions can be traced back to a ‘long campaign of harassment by the same schoolboy’. According to the charity group ‘Incarcerous’, which worked with Riddle across a number of years, the schoolboy in question constantly monitored their client’s movements and attempted to convince him to change sides, even offering at one point to leave him alone if Riddle gave up his lowly ambition to kill everyone and live forever. The group also claimed Riddle was repeatedly tortured; his arch enemy burned his host body using a magic stone, stabbed a book he possessed with a basilisk fang, and actively sought out and destroyed horcruxes containing his soul. In emails exchanged between the group and their client, Riddle (a.k.a. the Dark Lord) expresses his feelings of hopelessness at being unable to venture out of the Forbidden Forest for fear of constant surveillance by the Order of the Phoenix and only ever being able to move freely under an invisibility cloak or on the back of someone’s head. According to many who knew him, Tom Riddle was a prize student who loved Quidditch and had no interest in destroying all half-breeds until the harassment began. However, the charity has itself been accused of attempting to hide its own radical agenda after one of its founders was filmed calling for The Dark Lord’s eternal rule, declaring: ‘we know who the answer is – You Know Who!’. The charity claims their only aim is to help represent ordinary Death Eaters such as Riddle who have been victimised by the war on evil magic. Critics of the Ministry of Magic have called for an investigation into radicalisation in schools, arguing that Riddle was a victim of an education system which blatantly segregates good and evil into separate houses.
