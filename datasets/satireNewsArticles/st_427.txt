" I ' ve been temping at Mt . Sinai Hospital for two years now , 60 hours a week , " said Emily Schreiber , 23 , of White Plains , NY . " Mostly , they ' ve got me doing appendectomies , but I also do bypasses every now and then . It ' s a pretty good job , as temping goes : I make 9 . 75 per hour and get a full hour for lunch . Before this , I was doing typing and filing in a law office . Now that was boring . "
