CBC to Launch Canadian Version of House of Cards
Earlier today CBC announced they would be filming a Canadian version of the hit US and UK television series House of Cards. The US series focuses on the backroom deals and deception of US politician Frank Underwood and his never-ending quest for more power. Canadian producers say the CBC series would not stray far from the feel of the Kevin Spacey led US version. In a rare dramatic turn, CBC stalwart Rick Mercer will play the lead character Gary MacDonald, who begins the series as Deputy Minister in the cutthroat office of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency in Ottawa. But MacDonald has his goals set higher; the Deputy Minister of the Department of Agriculture. Creators say that Mercer’s MacDonald will stop at nothing to ensure his rise in the ranks including a plot line revolving around MacDonald and his right hand man, played by Brent Butt, rigging a local bonspiel for their own benefit. It is also rumoured that Canadian comedy legend Steve (Red Green) Smith will play a weary office worker who spends his days chasing down Employment Insurance fraudsters.  Furthermore it was revealed that Dan Aykroyd will play Prime Minister Richard (Dick) Cameron for the duration of the first season.  A teaser for the first episode was released online and featured vague hints about the plotline which appears to include MacDonald getting caught in a bad snowstorm outside Saskatoon on a business trip and Prime Minister Cameron controversially skipping out on a Cabinet meeting in favour of watching a Leafs playoff game.
