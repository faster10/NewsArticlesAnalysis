Liberals in Colorado Announce “Weed for Guns” Program
Democrats in the Colorado legislature have pushed through a “Weed for Guns” buyback program.  The bill is now on its way to Gov. John Hickenlooper to be executed.  Republicans tried desperately to stop the program arguing against such blatant abuses of the Constitution.  “It’s not going to work, and I hate to say that,” concluded Senator Mark Sheffel (R).  “What it will do is infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens.”  At the end all efforts proved futile as Republicans were only able to pick-off two Democratic defectors. Democratic Sentate President John Morse stated Monday that he was “proud” that his caucus was promoting the Weed for Guns program in an effort to reduce gun violence. Participants will trade weed for guns from  9am – 7pm weekdays from April 1st, 2013 – June 30th 2013 at any local police station.  The guns will be purchased on a walk-in basis and no questions will be asked.  Police ask that all guns submitted be unloaded and transported in a container.  Participants will be compensated for up to three weapons.  Weapons will be bought back at the following prices: Assault Weapon: 4 oz Blackberry Kush OR 4 oz Green Crack Semi-automatic handgun: 3 oz Skywalker OG OR Jamaican Pearl Revolvers:  2 oz White Widow OR 2 oz Blue Dream Rifles and Shotguns: 1 oz Sour Apple OR 5 Clones Inoperable firearms: 1/2 oz Afpak Kush OR 4 Bhang Bars BB Guns: One premium pre-roll OR “Weed for Guns” lighter Knives:  Grab bag special OR one edible *Early Bird Special ~ Come before 12:00 and get a free special blend joint OR edible.
