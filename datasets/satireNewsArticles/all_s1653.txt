Museum to remove size zero dinosaur
LONDON’S Natural History Museum will remove a fat-shaming dinosaur exhibit, it has confirmed. For decades the slender diplodocus, with every single one of its ribs visible, has greeted visitors with its trim and once-enviable late-Jurassic physique. But campaigners have long argued that it sent out the wrong message about what constitutes a healthy exhibit and caused people to judge woolly mammoths harshly. Curator Wayne Hayes said: “The diplodocus skeleton set an unattainable standard in 180ft-long sauropod beauty. “Fashions change in the museum world, and we need to reflect that with a massive dead animal that celebrates its natural curves.” From 2017 the diplodocus will be replaced by a blue whale, which curators believe more accurately reflects modern Britain with its unfocused spirituality, constant consumption and thick layer of blubber. Hayes continued: “We’ve had the whale in storage since 1891 but the public just weren’t ready to accept the voluptuous beauty of a size-4,820 exhibit before now. “Dippy the diplodocus is a product of its time, 65 million years ago, when society believed you could never be too thin or have too long a neck.”
