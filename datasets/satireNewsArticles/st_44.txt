Continued Rumsfeld : " These oppressed Iraqi oil wells deserve the right to pump oil as freely as any other oil well on God ' s Earth be it in Saudi Arabia , Nigeria , or an Alaskan wildlife refuge . It is crass and cynical to view this operation as being motivated by greed , profit , or the second largest oil reserves in the Middle East . This war is motivated by one thing : democracy . Our military action is meant to provide all of Iraq ' s oil wells be they big or small , staggeringly lucrative or merely very lucrative with their God given right to pump under a democratic system of self governance .
