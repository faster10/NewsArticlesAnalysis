Facebook privacy notice status updates ‘even less effective than homeopathy’
Copying and pasting a lengthy status update asking Facebook not to invade your privacy has finally been classified as the least effective thing on the planet, according to experts this morning. The viral Facebook status takes the crown of ‘least effective thing in the world’ from former record holder, homeopathy. The massive rise in people cutting and pasting a two-hundred word status update in the hope that Facebook will stop advertisers targeting them has been likened to people buying sugar pills thinking they make them better. Efficacy analyst Simon Williams, told us, “Posting this privacy notice on your Facebook page is about as effective as standing in your back garden and screaming, ‘I declare privacy!’ – i.e. not very.” “Short of giving people an IQ test, this Facebook status message is the next best thing for spotting a borderline simpleton.” “If you want to spot a moron, just take a look at their Facebook profile for this privacy status update, or look in their medicine cabinet for homeopathy sugar pills.” “Both are sure-fire signs that the person is ill-equipped in the cranial area.” It was long believed that nothing would ever be classified as less effective than homeopathy, but Williams insists the new trend for users posting lengthy status updates demanding Facebook give them their privacy leave homeopathy trailing. He told us, “At least Homeopathy has the placebo effect, but unfortunately just thinking you’re becoming more private doesn’t actually make you any more private.” “If anything, the subsequent false sense of privacy makes you even less private about what you say and do.” “It’s like taking homeopathy as an AIDS treatment, if the sugar pill actually gave you AIDS.”
