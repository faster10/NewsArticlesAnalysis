Facebook apologises after site outage causes surge in conversations
Facebook has apologised after it was taken offline by hackers today, prompting an hour of chaos in which people spoke to each other, looked out of the window or simply sat in quiet contemplation. The social media site was disabled from 6am to 7am by cyber warrior group the Lizard Squad. Shares in cupcakes, cute kittens and mild racism immediately plummeted as a panic-stricken world wondered what the hell to do with itself. “It was absolute pandemonium,” said Shirley Piffle, of Bromsgrove. “Imagine waking up and suddenly realising you have no way of knowing if the woman who used to do your hair thinks there are too many mosques nowadays, or if your husband’s second cousin is fed up of woman drivers. “To make matters worse, I had just taken a photograph of my dog wearing a pair of fairy wings. I had to print off a hard copy and start knocking on my neighbours’ doors, asking them to tick it with a biro if they liked it. “Yes, it was rudimentary but how else would I have known if it was LOL-worthy.”\nMrs Piffle said she spent the rest of the hour chatting to her children about their hopes, dreams and fears. “Luckily it then came back online and everything was back to normal,” she added with a relieved sigh. A spokesman for Facebook apologised for the incident, saying: “We are very sorry if this morning’s systems outage caused anyone to talk and enjoy the warmth of genuine human contact. We shall do our best to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Lol.” Waffle
