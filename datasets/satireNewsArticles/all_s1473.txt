Cool Ant Leaks From International Space Station, Major Evacuation Under Way
The Cosmos - Space paleoentomologists (WTF dat? 'Ed') at NASA's insect fossil cloning division are studying reports that a species of glacier ant indigenous to comets has gummed up the works in the International Space Station. Close-ups of a colony of Solenopsis TenaLadi Comet Lovejoy - the weak-bladdered comet ant - were posted this morning showing an escape of fluids from the station's Russian wing where insect experiments take place. "We think the critters are pissing industrial strength formic acid," NASA head of cockroaches, saw flies and ants commented, "darned toxins are burning a hole in the ISS air lock." An evacuation of astronauts is under way, the second in just weeks following last month's brush-past by Comet Lovejoy which grazed the ISS insect wing. NASA reckons the ant colony may have jumped ship onto the Station some time during the comet encounter before setting up a nest in the Yuri Gagarin section.
