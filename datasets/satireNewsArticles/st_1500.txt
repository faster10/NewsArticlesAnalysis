" But you know what ? It ' s Labor Day . I ' m not going to think about all the follow up phone calls I have to make to potential employers , or how I ' m behind on updating my CV . In fact , there is a job application to Burger King sitting on my kitchen table right now , and it ' ll just have to wait until tomorrow . "
