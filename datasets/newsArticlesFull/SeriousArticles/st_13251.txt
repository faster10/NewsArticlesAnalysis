In the case of " Apartment 23 , " the new title was rather anonymous it didn ' t tell you anything about the show . The new version more clearly suggests the show ' s premise about a naive midwesterner ( Dreama Walker ) who moves in with a hardcore party girl ( Krysten Ritter ) . And given that CBS ' " 2 Broke Girls " and Fox ' s " New Girl " have successfully launched girl with new roommate ( s ) in the big city premises this fall , the cleverly written " Apartment 23 " might likewise pop for viewers . The show does not yet have a premiere date , but is expected to debut sometime this season .
