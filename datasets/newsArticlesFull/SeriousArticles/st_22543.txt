What can easily get lost amid all of Alabama ' s recent success in the Saban era is that the program was in despair before he arrived . Save for one 10 win season in 2005 ( that had its victories later vacated because of NCAA violations ) , the Tide had not achieved a double digit win campaign since 2002 . ? They endured two losing seasons in a four year span . In addition , they were coming off a five year probation hit . Times were tough , and it was Saban who transformed the program . No coach in the country has recruited better , no coach gets more out of his talent and no coach is better in the clutch .
