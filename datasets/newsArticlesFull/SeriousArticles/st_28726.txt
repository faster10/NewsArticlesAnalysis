The first sign came when Jos Mar a Gim nez blocked Dani Alves s volley . Su rez and Andr s Iniesta then combined to draw a sharp save from Jan Oblak , the first time either had been seen half an hour in . Next , Neymar slipped the ball left to Jordi Alba . Alba paused and waited , just long enough for Messi to move . Alba saw it , Koke did not . Nor did many inside the stadium , and in a flash Barcelona had equalised . The ball fizzed towards Messi s foot , then fizzed away again , first time low into the net by the near post . Oblak did not have time to react . It had happened so fast .
