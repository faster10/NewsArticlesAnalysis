That ' s where Bill Clinton comes in . There ' s no one who was better at empathy . And so , as Obama and the Democrats trudge toward an election bound to make them unhappy , the question is this : If Obama loses seats ( or even control of the House ) , who will he be ? Will he be Bill Clinton ( a la 1994 , after losing the House to Newt Gingrich and the GOP ) , adjusting to his new circumstance , working to pass welfare reform and a budget agreement ? Or will be Jimmy Carter , who went from bad to worse , sulking with not much to show for it ?
