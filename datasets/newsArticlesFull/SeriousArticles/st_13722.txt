Mike Piazza had as pretty a right handed swing as there ever was . So powerful , with more opposite field power than anyone I ve ever seen . Man was he an imposing figure in the batter s box . How loud was the ball off his bat ? Watch again the last out of the 2000 World Series , the fly ball that died in left center , caught by Bernie Williams . The reaction off the bat by Mariano Rivera is frightening , like he just heard a gun shot . Almost every Yankee I ve ever spoken to about that says they thought it was going out . Of course , it didn t . But it just made me remember that his outs were loud , too .
