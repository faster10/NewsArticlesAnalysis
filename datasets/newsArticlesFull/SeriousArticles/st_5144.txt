However , make no mistake about it , Kerry ' s compromised much to get Vienna off the ground . Actually , I do not question what he had to do to lure Putin and the Iranians to Vienna . These are " inside the Beltway " prices , but prices worth paying . In a complete about face the U . S . acceded to Russian demands that Iran be permitted to attend the Vienna talks . This is an acknowledgement of " realpolitik " given that Iran has been pouring ground forces into Syria in coordination with Russia ' s new air offensive . And don ' t expect the White House to be calling for Assad ' s ouster anytime soon . Here , too , Russia and Iran have trumped Obama . Assad ' s departure now runs into the cruel reality there is no one to take his place . In order to get Iran and Russia to agree to a Vienna meeting the U . S . formally conceded that Assad the ONLY source of the Syrian calamity is now an essential part of the solution and his longevity will be the subject less of Obama ' s empty hubris but of concessions imposed on us by the new Syrian Russo Iranian Axis . Mark my words , Assad will not be long for this world one way or the other .
