Top boss : To simplify things , I ve made a chart of all their power centres . 1 ) State actors ? a rare breed 2 ) State non actors ? most of the administration 3 ) Non State actors including 3a ) bad Taliban ? Taliban in Pakistan 3b ) Good Taliban ? in Afghanistan 3c ) Bad terrorists ? terrorists against Pakistan 3d ) Good terrorists ? against India 4 ) State within a state ? Pakistan army 5 ) State within a State within a State ? ISI 6 ) Rogue elements within 1 4 5 7 ) pseudo State actors ? the Hurriyat 8 ) sectarian outfits 9 ) Dawood Ibrahim and 10 ) non State non actors ? the people . All of them gang up with and fight with everybody else . To make things interesting , terrorist outfits constantly change their names , the Jaish e Something becoming the Lashkar e Something else or the Harkat e Whatever whenever they feel like it . So there s absolutely no point talking only to Nawaz Sharif . Why , sometimes even Nawaz refuses to talk to Sharif .
