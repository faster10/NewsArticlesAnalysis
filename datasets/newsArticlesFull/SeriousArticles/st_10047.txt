There seemed to be a vague suggestion that her solo albums were cut from a different , more robust cloth , but clearly Furler s attitude to her commercial songwriting has softened , perhaps because 1 , 000 Forms of Fear ? her most successful album by some distance ? was also musically the closest to the work she sells to others . Its followup largely contains songs rejected by major artists . That a song has been rejected isn t necessarily a comment on its intrinsic value ? Seabrook s book is packed with tales of tracks being turned down for the most whimsical reasons , then going on to become huge , indelible hits in the hands of others ? although sometimes here the reason they got the elbow is pretty clear . Footprints has a lyric based on that poem you see on posters about walking along a beach with God , whose footprints disappear when he carries you there seems a very real possibility that , elsewhere among Furler s reject pile there might lurk songs called things like The Impossible We Do at Once ? Miracles Take a Little Longer ! ! ! or Sex Instructor ( First Lesson Free ) . It s unclear whether Beyonc rejected it because she thought the poem itself was completely ghastly , or she preferred the song previously based on it by Half Man Half Biscuit ( When you only see one pair of footprints , that must have been when I was appearing on Junior Kickstart ) , but either way , you see her point .
