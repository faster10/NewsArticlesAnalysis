The lack of a local face to front the BJP s battle for Bihar and the presence of a popular incumbent on the other side has also helped the Grand Alliance play the sub nationalist card , possibly a first for the State , successfully , converting Mr Modi s jibe at Mr Kumar s DNA into an insult to Biharis . It has run like a leitmotif through the campaign with the Chief Minister asking at the end of each public meeting : Whom do you want as your next CM , a Bihari or a bahari ? The audience would roar back : Bihari ! It is this sub nationalist thread , combined with the belief that social harmony is a necessary pre condition for development , running through the campaign that has helped Messrs Kumar and Prasad to take the political battle beyond caste and development so that this election s two keywords stand entwined in a socialist embrace . If the Gujarat model of development only chased growth , Mr Kumar and Mr Prasad are offering voters the idea that inclusive growth is impossible without social justice , communal harmony and freedom of choice ? a view of the world that sits well with the State s core liberal ethos .
