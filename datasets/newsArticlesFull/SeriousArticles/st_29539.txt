The majority of the really , really amazing techniques I have came from students . I worked summers for years . I taught a six week class where students could either remediate or jump ahead . You taught it for an eight hour day . I had a young man , Victor Rodriguez . He came up to me , " Ms . D , we ' re just learning and learning and learning . We ' re just forgetting and forgetting and forgetting . We need to practice it . " I asked " What do you think we should do ? " He said , " I think we need to go to the boards . " Every day , except on test days , my kids go to the board ( to work math problems in front of each other ) . If they finish and they get it right , I give them a thumbs up and they go help another student .
