It ' s true that receivers will average more yards after catch on shorter passes than they do on longer ones , and offensive coordinators Mike Shula and Josh McDaniels have built their respective passing attacks around the strengths of their quarterbacks and receivers . I don ' t think it ' s Brady ' s fault that he throws shorter passes . QBR attempts to control for air yards , and Brady still has a healthy lead there , but Brady has had far better receivers than Cam for the vast majority of the season . It ' s only now , with Lewis and Edelman on the shelf , that their receiving cabinets are similarly bare .
