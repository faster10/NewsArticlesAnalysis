Yet what matters more than total enrollment is the health mix of enrollees , relative to what insurers expected when they provided their lower than expected insurance bids . We won ' t really know about this health mix until the end of May , when insurers release their rates for 2015 . I expect that we will see only moderate increases in insurance rates at that point , as the federal government has created risk sharing programs that should mitigate any " rate shock " to the market . But we won ' t know for sure until we see the rates .
