Cameron knows he cannot sell the deal as outlined so far , as it is full of holes and lacks detail . Over dinner , he will tell Tusk that an emergency brake would have to apply immediately , meaning it could be triggered the day after the referendum result in UK ( assuming the vote is to stay in ) . Brussels will struggle to agree to that . He will also say it should apply to current levels of immigration and should be in place for long enough to resolve the underlying problem . And , crucially , a senior government source said he would also demand that it only be a temporary measure on the road to a more permanent solution . But what the permanent solution might be is not clear at all .
