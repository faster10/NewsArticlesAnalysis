NT : The problem is that we all import the same thing , and we all export the same thing almost . So there is not really intra trade between us that makes sense a lot . Because for the GCC , for example , we all import everything from outside . What are we importing from each other ? Nothing . Almost , I mean a minority . But , that ' s what ' s needed in the future . If we go , for example , into production more like petrol chemical and mining and whatever we should really create less barriers , and facilitate intra trade and intra production as well . . . and go in mega companies , not to have a petrol chemical company in Saudi and one in Kuwait and whatever , and compete , we should work more towards collaboration .
