The door also opened for Fiorina as well , but she peaked very quickly , only reaching 7 . 7 in late September , less than half of Carson at the time , and it remains to be seen if she can bounce back ? which , by the way , Trump has already done , another basic fact about the campaign shown on this chart that the media seems to have missed . It s strange to hear all the recent coverage about Carson taking the lead , when the polling average shows Trump still more than ten points ahead , and shows that his real problems showed up in September , most of which he spent in a slump , falling from 31 . 5 to 28 , and then recovering in October , up to 32 . 3 at the time of the debate . Carson s rise has been much more steady , with only a brief plateau from September 15 to 23 . Aside from that , he s improved almost continuously since August 4 when he stood at 6 . 9 , just barely above the outsider electeds , up till the third debate , which found him averaging 21 . 7 .
