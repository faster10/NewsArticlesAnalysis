With no competition this weekend , The Wolverine pulled in about 55 million domestically in 3 , 924 locations on target with studio estimates , but far below tracking projections , some of which went so far as to predict an 80 million weekend . With the majority of screens showing the Fox tentpole in 3 D , the movie averaged about 14 , 016 per screen on an estimated budget of 120 million , so this weekend ' s performance is really nothing to scoff at . Interestingly , at 55 million , the film is right in line with 2011 s X Men : First Class which made 55 . 1 million in its first three days at the box office in early June . But so far The Wolverine is holding steady as the second lowest opening of all of Fox ' s six X Men movies that title goes to the first in the series which opened at 54 . 5 million . But X Men was also released 13 years ago with no 3 D surcharges , so it ' s not an entirely fair comparison .
