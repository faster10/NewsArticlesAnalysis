There are countless difficult things hiding away deep within us which we should give some thought to even though the desperate temptation is to keep clicking and looking . We need news sabbaths . We need long train journeys on which we have no wireless signal and nothing to read , where our carriage is mostly empty , where the views are expansive and where the only sounds are those made by the wheels as they click against the rails . We need plane journeys when we have a window seat and nothing else to focus on for two or three hours but the tops of clouds and our own thoughts .
