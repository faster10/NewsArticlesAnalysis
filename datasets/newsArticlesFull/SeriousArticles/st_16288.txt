Complicating matters further , Turkey and Syria have a long standing border dispute in exactly the area where the Russian plane was shot down , and Russia has sometimes voiced support for Syria s claim . The Hatay province of Turkey runs south along the Mediterranean Sea , deep into Syria . It is a melting pot of ethnic Turks and Arabs .

Ethnic Turks led the province s secession from Syria and declaration of an independent republic in 1938 , and that republic then joined Turkey the next year .
