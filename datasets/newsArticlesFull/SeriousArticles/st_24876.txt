The American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting , but it ' s important to remember it ' s just another step in the scientific process . " Researchers have been working on this and similar technologies for some time , and others have predicted a day when we will be able to diagnose cancers before they are otherwise visible by current techniques , " said Dr Len Lichtenfeld , the group ' s deputy chief medical officer . " It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm , but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer .
