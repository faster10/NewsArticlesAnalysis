I love to hear a song that changes everything . That ' s the reason I ' m in a band : David Bowie ' s " Heroes , " Arcade Fire ' s " Rebellion ( Lies ) , " Joy Division ' s " Love Will Tear Us Apart , " Marvin Gaye ' s " Sexual Healing , " Nirvana ' s " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " Public Enemy ' s " Fight the Power . " But at the top of this dysfunctional family tree sits the king of spitting fire himself , the juggler of beauty and truth , our own Willy Shakespeare in a polka dot shirt . It ' s why every songwriter after him carries his baggage and why this lowly Irish bard would proudly carry his luggage . Any day .
