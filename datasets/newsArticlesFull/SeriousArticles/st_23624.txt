The real takeaway from Trump s night , particularly compared to the scene in Mobile , was how normalized this all has become . Mobile was rowdier , bawdier , a little crazy . Sioux City was normal . It was well behaved , and Iowa nice , a regular political rally . There were children running in the aisles and elderly women knitting and the Pledge of Allegiance and volunteers handing out guides to where you could find your caucus on Monday night . It s amazing how quickly the absurd ? Phantom of the Opera blaring over the loudspeakers ! Long digressions how about Trump wants to build an extravagant ballroom in the White House ! ? can become accepted , even become the ? usual . There s a greatest hits quality to Trump s appearances now . He says , Who s gonna build the wall ? and the crowd screams Mexico ! and everybody laughs and applauds like they just saw Neil Diamond dutifully plow through Sweet Caroline again . We all know how this works now . It s not so weird to go to a Trump rally anymore . ? Now it s just Trump being Trump . We have come toward him far more than he has come to us .
