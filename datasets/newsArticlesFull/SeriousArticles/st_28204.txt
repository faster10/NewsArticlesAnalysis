Romney ' s biggest mistake may simply be in his attitude . In short , he acts like a leader from the 1950s who is still trying to prove to the world that America is not just the best country , but the boss of the world . And in 2012 , that just doesn ' t fly . Are we the leader of the free world ? Yes . Are we a nation that should continue to share our democratic values with the world ? Yes . Can we control everything that happens in the world ? No and we shouldn ' t try . Simply put , we can ' t afford it and we don ' t need to .
