Carolina was able to make lemonade out of lemons this year without Kelvin Benjamin because of one thing ? yards after catch . They led the league in YAC , usually turning medium gains to long ones . Ted Ginn , Jr . ( 10 touchdowns this year ) only catches about half the passes thrown his way , but when he does hold onto the ball he s as electric as anyone in the league . Rookie Devin Funchess is coming into his own , and tight end Greg Olsen isn t on Rob Gronkowski s level , he s top five at his position . They will have to have at least two or three big plays through the air to stretch out the defense and get the run game going .
