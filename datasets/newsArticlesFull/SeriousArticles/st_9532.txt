Now , is there a risk to sending the house ? No doubt . Even a four yard route can beat you as a defender . But the more I look at this situation , it ' s obvious that pressure is a true weapon . In this case the Lions almost got there with three rushers , and still left a guy wide open . What if they had rushed five ( like the two guys guarding turf ) ? And it tells the quarterback that he better unload the ball unless he wants to wind up on the ground . Go get the quarterback and tackle . Keep it simple to win the game .
