What about Manning s performance in the 2014 Divisional Playoff against the Colts ? With the temperature at 40 degrees at kickoff , Manning completed 3 of 4 passes for 36 yards and a touchdown to Demaryius Thomas on the Broncos first drive . That would be the last time the Broncos found the end zone , as they lost 24 13 , but it wasn t necessarily because of Manning s own play . He completed 19 of 27 passes for 140 yards in the second half and , despite the effort being futile , completed his last six passes in a row . Not exactly the kind of performance you d expect from a QB who just can t play in the cold .
