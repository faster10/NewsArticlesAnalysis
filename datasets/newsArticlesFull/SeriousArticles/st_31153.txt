Mark Schmitt , writing at Vox , noted that the top 1 percent should bear a very large portion of the responsibility for funding programs to help struggling workers . But the upper middle class ? those with incomes well into the six figures but short of the quarter million mark ? have also done well , very well and have responsibilities too . A politics that pretends all the costs can be borne by some other , in its distant gated community , is a narrow and shortsighted view of democratic possibilities . http : bit . ly 1PUxpXh
