Well , when you ' re fixing problems at the city level , you ' re actually fixing things . You ' re fixing potholes , you ' re fixing the zoning case , you ' re fixing a traffic problem . You ' re not generally setting big policy aims or , more importantly , dealing with foreign heads , dealing with diplomacy . Those aren ' t things you fix . Those are things you lead on . It would be strange for a city council candidate to talk about leading on world issues . Just as I think it ' s weird for a presidential candidate to talk about fixing things .
