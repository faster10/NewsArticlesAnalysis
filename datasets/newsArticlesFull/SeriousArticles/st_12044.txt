Human happiness is U shaped , according to new research from a team at Warwick University , which basically repeats a line happiness researchers have been trotting out since forever : on average , humans tend to be happy as children , only to plummet downhill in their teens , as sexual rejection and hating your parents and the terror of not fitting in with everyone else starts to bite . Things reach rock bottom in the early 40s , but after this comes a rather less well documented climb out of the trough of despond . Humanity returns to peak happiness somewhere in early retirement , before beginning one last downward slide .
