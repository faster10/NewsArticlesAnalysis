Theater is New York and New York is theater , and New York is not much like the rest of the country . ( Shake Shack , a summertime favorite in Madison Square Park , has a menu for dogs . ) New York is one of the world capitals of self importance . And , with the possible exception of Washington , there is no city in the country where self importance is more disconnected from actual importance . If I could buy New Yorkers for what they ' re worth and sell them for what they think they ' re worth , I ' d own Fifth Avenue from Saks to Harlem .
