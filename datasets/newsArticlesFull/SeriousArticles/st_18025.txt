Last rodeo : Every player wants to win a Super Bowl , there are no exceptions . But rare , accomplished players are respected by their teammates and the quest of those players can provide added motivation . The Broncos have two such players in quarterback Peyton Manning and linebacker DeMarcus Ware . Manning , 39 , missed seven starts because of a left foot injury , and even some Broncos players privately believe this could be it for the future Hall of Famer . If it is his last season , they would all like to send Manning off with another ring . Ware played in his first conference championship game in 10 seasons Sunday . The two are important , respected voices in the locker room and the desire their teammates have to help them win a ring is very real .
