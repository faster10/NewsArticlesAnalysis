Appliance giant LG shared its vision of a " better and more beautiful future " in which its HomeChat platform might allow your LG smartwatch to understand that you ' re sleeping restlessly , and instantly tell your LG audio system to play soothing music , your LG air conditioner to reduce the temperature , and your LG air purifier and humidifier to pump some scented mist into the room . Meanwhile , your LG coffeemaker is grinding some fresh beans for next morning ' s automatically brewed cup of joe , and your LG smartphone is transmitting your daily schedule to your LG enabled car system , so you can be guided directly to your first appointment when you wake up in the morning . ( All of which will give you more time to watch " Game of Thrones " on your LG widescreen OLED Ultra HD television and play Candy Crush Soda on your LG tablet , naturally . )
