Morin stresses that Path isn ' t the worst offender in that the data it ' s collected is used only for the features Morin outlined . Path has no advertising , so unlike Facebook and Google , no information is used to target and tailor ads to individuals , he says . What ' s more , he says , his company ' s servers are secured behind a firewall , and Morin and his team are meeting with TRUSTe , a privacy policy certification service , on Wednesday afternoon to discuss Path ' s measures in keeping user data safe .
