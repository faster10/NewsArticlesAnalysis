In late 2011 , we ' re planning countrywide rollouts of the Better Place model in Israel and Denmark . With the infrastructure deployment under way , both of these countries will be ready when the first EVs from Renault come to market . We are talking about mass market with these cars as Better Place and Renault have committed to 100 , 000 electric cars for Israel and Denmark beginning in 2011 . This is just the beginning , and we ' re seeing clear direction and new visionaries emerge such as Carlos Ghosn , CEO of Renault Nissan , who sees a future where EVs are mass marketed and make up 10 percent of all car sales by 2020 .
