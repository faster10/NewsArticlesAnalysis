Update : Jim Grant reports Thursday night that the " Why the fork not ? " sign is gone , but people have been taping normal sized forks to a nearby road sign . Meanwhile , readers in the comments below tell us about a giant fork with a happy ending in another part of California . In a similar guerilla art prank , an artist erected an 18 foot tall , 500 pound fork in the road in a Pasadena median in 2009 . The city ordered it removed after 7 months ( which required a forklift ) , but in 2011 , it was properly permitted and permanently installed .
