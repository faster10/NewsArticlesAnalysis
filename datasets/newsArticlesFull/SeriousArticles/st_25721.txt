( SK ) : Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President . So I think if we ' re ready to potentially have a woman run the country , I think we are getting ready as a country , to potentially have a woman run a money center bank . Now , you know , the board wouldn ' t ask and I wouldn ' t accept , but if you look across Wall Street , there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO ' s who move along , and I think it ' s a very exciting development for the industry and for the country .
