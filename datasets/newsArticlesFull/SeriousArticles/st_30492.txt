It s telling that every time Colbert tried to lead her into a joke , he steered her into shakier waters . When he joshed that he hoped a return to the 90s wouldn t mean everyone will have to start wearing parachute pants , it led Clinton ? to say that he d look good in those pants , and that he s a good dancer , and don t you agree , Jon Baptiste , the band leader , and it threw the whole thing off . Feeling like she has to be Comedy Hillary always leads to her trying too hard , and that overeager laugh , and it throws her off her game .
