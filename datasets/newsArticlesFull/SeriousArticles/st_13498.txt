It ' s really tough . That ' s the hardest part because there ' s so many unique young people out there that are doing incredible , incredible things . To narrow it down to 12 was really hard . We have a research team for instance , I ' ll say , " We ' re interested in doing a homeless kid , or we ' re interested in following someone with autism or we ' re interested in a cage fighter , " and then our research team will investigate those worlds and see who are the different characters out there that are interesting . The one thing we ' re really , really , conscious of is trying to find people that don ' t necessarily want to be on reality TV , or be on a TV show , I should say .
