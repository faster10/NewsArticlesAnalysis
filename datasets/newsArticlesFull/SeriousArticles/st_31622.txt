If your quarterback gets trampled all day ( four sacks , 23 hits ) and you can t open a hole for a single run , you failed miserably at your job . Linebackers Von Miller ( 21 ? 2 sacks ) and DeMarcus Ware ( seven hits ) embarrassed tackles Marcus Cannon and Sebastian Vollmer . Neither could handle the quickness , agility or power . Cannon gave up a ridiculous 10 pressures , two sacks and seven hurries , plus he had a false start on a third and 1 QB sneak . Why move if you didn t block anybody all game ? Ware repeatedly beat Vollmer off the line to the outside and with a spin move inside that left him blocking air . Interior pressure also was a problem with guard Josh Klein allowing 11 pressures , four hits and seven hurries . Defensive linemen Malik Jackson and Derek Wolfe created the kind of interior pressure Brady hates , all while Denver blitzed only 17 percent of the time . Center Bryan Stork wasn t much help and took a stupid penalty for a post whistle head butt that negated a 5 yard run . On one play , Cameron Fleming cam in to play next to Cannon , putting more than 600 pounds of beef in front of Miller . Miller came out of his stance so fast he was past them both and on a path to Brady before Fleming turned his hips . Noise was a factor for the line , but not as big as the physical mismatches .
