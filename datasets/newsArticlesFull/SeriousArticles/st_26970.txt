It is important to remember that women ' s rights in Tunisia today do not depend on the actions of a few , and that while progress is slow , not all is lost .

Whereas civil society has been vigilant in defending this young woman ' s rights and raising awareness about violence against women , the government has yet to act in a constructive manner .
