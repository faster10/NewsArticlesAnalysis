Don t get blitzed : The Cardinals blitz more than any other team ( 45 percent of the time ) in the NFL . Panthers quarterback Cam Newton has an NFL best 19 touchdown passes against the blitz this season . He has a career high 59 . 2 completion percentage against the blitz . Newton and the Panthers must win this battle or it ll be a long day , as it was in 2013 when Newton threw three interceptions and fumbled once against the Cardinals blitz . The blitz should create opportunities for the Carolina receivers . Arizona often sends a defensive back , which means man coverage . This could be an opportunity for Ted Ginn Jr . , who leads Carolina receivers with 10 touchdown catches , to get open deep . It also could mean running back Jonathan Stewart has opportunities with screen plays .
