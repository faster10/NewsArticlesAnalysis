Daniel S . Martin of Manchester , Connecticut My younger brother who is an American Airlines pilot flew on 9 11 01 from Boston ' s Logan to NYC ' s Kennedy and finally San Diego . He left Boston around 6 or 6 : 30 a . m . , landed in NYC , took off no problem and headed to the West Coast around 8 : 30 or so . . . . Unfortunately , we all know the rest of the story . . . . He was ordered to land in Indiana , which he did , arriving safely ( knees shaking ! ) with his crew , passengers and aircraft . . . . He ' s my hero .
