I began translating a lot of the English articles and books about Kobe on my blog , and that got me a lot of attention among NBA fans in China , she said .

That was when I got more involved in getting as much news as I could find for Kobe fans in China . I followed Lakers reporters , got pictures and videos , and brought all this to Chinese fans to get all the information they can about Kobe .
