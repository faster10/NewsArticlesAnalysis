Asked by MSNBC after his remarks if he was calling Trump a fascist , O Malley would not quite go there . I don t know that he knows that the appeals that he s making , the sort of toxic mix of opportunism with public panic are the same sort of appeals that have proceeded fascists and fascism in the past , and I think we all have a responsibility to call it out , he said . When he pushes things like registries and ID cards based on religion , I do believe that is the sort of appeal that historically has often proceeded fascism .
