Hakura : If the resolution was passed then it could cause lasting damage . . . although this is not the first time the two countries have been through this . In 2007 the recommendation vote was 27 21 so the vote has narrowed this time . Hillary Clinton ( U . S . secretary of state ) says that passing the resolution would damage U . S . Turkey relations , although I think this is a fig leaf and the real reason is U . S . national security . Turkey is militarily important to the U . S . . . . it has a military base at Incirlik and in February several senior defense staff signed a letter asking for the resolution to be withdrawn .
