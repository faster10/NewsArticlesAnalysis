Around that time , gay people began seizing every opportunity to get sort of married . They traveled to Canada and rushed to appear before activist justices of the peace in Oregon , upstate New York and San Francisco . I interviewed people who got married over and over again , before judges would shut everything down and make them unmarried . These didn ' t feel like weddings to me they felt like news stories , protest weddings that came without the gift of benefits . They meant something to the people exchanging rings , but I felt no more or less legally married than they were , so it was easy to remain objective about what these things meant .
