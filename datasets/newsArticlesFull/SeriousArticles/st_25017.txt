In the Biblical tradition , there are parables and sayings that cast the rich in a negative light , implying it ' s wrong to hold too much wealth , especially if you ' re not using it to help less fortunate people . See Matthew 19 : 24 : " Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God . " " There ' s something immoral , from the Christian perspective , about being very rich , " said Warburton , the author and podcaster . " That ' s explicit . " ( Warburton happens to be atheist , by the way . )
