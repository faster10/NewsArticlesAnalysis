Now New York has racinos , including the crowded ones at Aqueduct and Yonkers with computerized table games , robots and videos , even a roulette wheel under glass , but no human croupiers . It has six off track betting authorities . It has the once scandalous New York Racing Association with its tracks and its own website and off track operation . It has approved slot parlors for Long Island that can ' t get open . It has approved several casinos to revitalize the upstate economy that haven ' t yet been licensed but that very same constitutional amendment says similar casinos can ' t be sited downstate until 2020 . And it has the big jackpot lotteries . And scratch offs .
