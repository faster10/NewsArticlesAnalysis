I try not to let the crowd influence me , Collins said . What I want is the players . When you looked in this kid ' s eyes , when he came off that inning , and I mean , he ' s been through a tough summer . He ' s been beaten down , and I just trusted him . I said , " You got it . You ' ve earned this . So go get ' em . " So it ' s my fault . It ' s not his . That ' s who he is . I know better than that . I know that he wants the ball . He never wants to come out , and he was pitching good . He was throwing the ball great . We got in the spot where we wanted to get to , and we talked about it all day yesterday and all day today . This was my fault .
