Denver Broncos : The Broncos are 7 1 and already have played five of their eight road games this season . They are 3 0 at home this season , which means they are now 25 2 in home games since Peyton Manning signed in 2012 . Toss in the fact they ' re 8 1 in AFC West games at home since Manning arrived and it ' s all piled on the bottom line . Certainly the Kansas City Chiefs ' cause is helped this week in that the team is coming off a bye , so it has had two weeks to prepare for an already familiar opponent . But the Broncos already have done more of their road work as compared to the other AFC power brokers ( New England has played five home games , Cincinnati has played four ) . They ' ve been tough for everybody to beat at 5 , 280 feet , but especially for their division rivals . Broncos 28 , Chiefs 17 . Jeff Legwold
