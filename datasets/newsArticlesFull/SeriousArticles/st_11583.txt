" Steve Jobs was a visionary who changed the way we live , an innovator whose products brought joy to millions , a risk taker who wasn ' t afraid to challenge the status quo , and an entrepreneur who led one of the most creative companies of our time . His sage advice was respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle . His courageous fight against cancer brought strength to many . I hope it is a comfort to those who loved him , especially his family , that so many grieve his loss and are praying for them at this sad time . "
