The Redskins patchwork secondary has held it together to this point and will need to do it again on Sunday . Rodgers doesn t have the playmakers that he usually does , but wide receivers James Jones and Randall Cobb are still effective . One of Rodgers strengths is extending plays , so it will take plenty of effort from the Redskins defensive backs to run with the Packers receivers . Free safety Dashon Goldson is still banged up with rib and shoulder injuries , but expects to play through it . How he holds up is another question , along with the effectiveness of newly signed cornerback Cary Williams . Their success will largely be tied to the production of the Redskins defensive front .
