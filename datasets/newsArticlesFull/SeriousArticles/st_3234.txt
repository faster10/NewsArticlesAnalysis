' Each of us has our own personal motivation for deciding to join the boycott of this particular game as a form of protest or not and we respect that . If you feel you cannot miss the game for whatever reason , but sympathise with our protest , we would encourage you to join us for the pre match protest at the Leazes End , where we can provide you with protest materials to express your discontent with Mike Ashley inside the stadium , and to join us for the post game protest under the Milburn Stand .
