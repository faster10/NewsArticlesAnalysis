" This is an attempt not only to remember articles of the Constitution but to remember and salute those who were part of the Constituent Assembly , " he said . " Only leaders associated with our party were not part of the Constituent Assembly . The country has been made by the positive contribution of everyone . That includes even leaders from Congress . We have the ' sanskara ' to salute them . This is not about ruling party and opposition . There is a need to rise above and take an objective view . There is a need to tell our future generations about our Constitution and those who worked for it , " Modi said , adding that if in the past Constitution Day was not celebrated , it should not be seen as a fault of previous governments .
