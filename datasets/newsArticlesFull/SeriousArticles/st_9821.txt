Luxury goods defined in duty free stores as high end watches , designer name handbags , and the like account for 36 percent of duty free sales . But you need to comparison shop for these products to make sure that an item is truly on sale . A case in point : Hong Kong International ' s DFS Galleria , a duty free shopping area , sells the Armani Obo Bag for 450 ( HK 3 , 500 ) . But shoppers can buy the same bag off Armani ' s website for about the same price ( or , when we checked , on sale for 285 ) .
