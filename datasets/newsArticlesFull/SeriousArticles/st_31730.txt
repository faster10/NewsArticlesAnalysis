Two years ago at the first GeekGirlCon , I met Chase Masterson , who played Leeta during the final five seasons of " Star Trek : Deep Space 9 . " Masterson has mentored kids in gangs for many years , and she views bullying prevention as a passion project . " There ' s strength in the knowledge that countless bullied kids , who have felt so hopeless , have overcome that pain and have rich , fulfilling lives and relationships . And people who have been bullied have a unique ability to become compassionate voices , leaders and champions over oppression the potential for healing to conquer injustice is huge , " she explained .
