Only six of our British military chaps , it seems , are helping the Sunni Saudis kill Shia Yemenis . And they re not actually in Yemen , merely helping to choose the targets ? which have so far included hospitals , markets , a wedding party and a site opposite the Iranian embassy . Not that our boys and girls selected those particular terrorist nests for destruction , you understand . They re just helping their Saudi mates ? in the words of our Ministry of Defence ? comply to the rules of war .
