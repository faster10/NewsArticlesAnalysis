Then I thought about Hillary Clinton ? but again , not for long . On the foreign policy side Killary ( as some take to calling her ) does not make the grade even by lesser of evils logic . She is not the lesser of anyone else s evil insofar as she offers us a dangerous set of policies that will ineluctably exacerbate the problems of an ever more disorderly world that , as 2016 opens , is undeniably in grave crisis . I find her current assertions that we must lead to avoid a vacuum a tired , nonsensical , altogether contemptible trope . I fold my arms , naturally , at the thought of voting for her .
