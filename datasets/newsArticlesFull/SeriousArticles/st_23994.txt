The idea that Trump is the Democrats best weapon has been around for a while ? consider this Washington Post article from July about Democrats cheering his candidacy . And it s perhaps understandable why some would see a Trump nomination as a boon to Hillary Clinton or anybody else who wants to block a Republican from the White House . But I hope that this line of thinking doesn t gain too much credence , because Donald Trump s candidacy is no gift to anyone . Nobody , even the most hardened Democratic partisans , should be gloating about his continued strength , because it s helping to plunge us into truly dangerous waters .
