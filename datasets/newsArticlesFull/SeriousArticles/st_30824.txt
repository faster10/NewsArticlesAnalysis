It ' s amazing , I walk into a woman ' s home , and she opens up her life to me . She tells me everything . She endows me with this beautiful sacred trust of her story , and I ' m telling you that ' s all she has . She has her children , and she has her story . That is it . And I promise her , I will never forget her . I tell her I will share her story with other American women , and I will speak her story to power . I say , " I cannot make promises to you about what my government will do , but I promise you I will take action on your behalf . "
