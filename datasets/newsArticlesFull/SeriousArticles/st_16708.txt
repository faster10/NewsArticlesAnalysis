Every year as Thanksgiving approached , many of my weight loss clients would beg me to think up some reason they could use as an absentee excuse , because they couldn ' t bear to be with their families for the holiday . Their weight was always the issue . If they had gained , then every morsel of food put into their mouths would be scrutinized and " tsk tsk " would be heard from someone who saw any food my clients ate , as being too much food . On the other hand , if they had lost weight , there was the pesky relative telling them they looked wan , gaunt , and even sick so why didn ' t they have some gravy on the turkey or a larger piece of pie ? Now , of course , these beleaguered individuals can escape . Who can fault them for skipping dessert entirely or packing a piece of pie in their tote bag as they race out the door to stand in line to buy a tablet or a computer driven stuffed animal ?
