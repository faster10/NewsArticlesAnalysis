Lisa Grimmer , a group fitness instructor , teaches the class . " What I love about Skinny Jeans is it takes everything from Pilates the core workout , which would be the tightening around of your abdominal muscles , your lower back . People think of that as " the core . " But there ' s also the shoulder girdle , which we work out a lot in Skinny Jeans , too , " says Grimmer . " So really we ' re thinking about anything that would be postural or placed into your jeans , so you ' ve got your abdominals , of course , and we work the inner and outer thighs that go into the jeans .
