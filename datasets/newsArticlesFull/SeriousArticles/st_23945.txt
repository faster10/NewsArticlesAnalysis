Familia needed a strikeout in the worst way . The Royals wouldn t give it to him . A Mike Moustakas groundout to first moved Hosmer , who had doubled home Lorenzo Cain , over to third . So with one out , catcher Salvador Perez smacked a ground ball to third . Mets third baseman David Wright caught it , peeked over at Hosmer ? who shuffled a few feet off the bag , but not far enough for Wright to run over to him ? and let the ball fly towards first . Hosmer took off for home , daring the Mets to deny the Royals their first World Series in three decades .
