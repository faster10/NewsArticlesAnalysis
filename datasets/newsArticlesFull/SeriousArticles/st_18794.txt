How clear that will be to outside observers depends a good deal on whether the quality of the polling gets better after Iowa . Polling , generally , is in a state of real crisis , because response rates to telephone surveys have reached such low levels that creating statistically representative samples has become virtually impossible . People have fewer land lines than they used to , and are much less likely to answer them ( or to be home ) when pollsters call . Cell phone users are much harder to reach , and that has made life even harder for political pollsters .
