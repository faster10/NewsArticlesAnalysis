" Once we started the parade it all went so fast ! It was exhilarating to see the amount of people watching and the constant chant of ' Go Illini ' or ' I L L ' as we marched the parade , " said Victoria Sewell , another drum major . " Once we reached the red ready line of Herald Square , the adrenaline set in and we were on our way . The routine went by in what felt like seconds and it was such a rush that I couldn ' t help but beam as we left the square . It was something I ' ll never forget . "
