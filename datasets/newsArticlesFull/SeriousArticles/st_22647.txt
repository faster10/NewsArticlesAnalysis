Opec production levels have continued to remain elevated in line with our expectations . Opec produced 31 . 38 million b d of crude oil in October , a decrease of 190 , 000 b d month on month . Saudi Arabian crude output was close to 10 . 13 million b d in October . Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , UAE and Angola have all increased output in 2015 , with Iraq increasing production by 24 per cent y o y in October . Output increases in all these nations have been steady and relentless ( with the exception of Angola , which has experienced field level production issues ) , as these countries have begun to compete with each other following Opec ' s paradigm shift . This competition is not only evident through the increases in production volumes but also in aggressive pricing . OSPs ( official selling prices ) have been cut on several occasions to key markets , such as Asia by Saudi Arabia , Iran and Iraq . The market share battle between Opec and Russia also intensified , as Saudi Arabia cut its OSPs to Europe . Additionally , Iran looks set to return to the market in the coming months , with suggestions sanctions will begin to be lifted in January 2016 . Based on the fundamentals , we expect markets to remain in excess until at least the end of 2016 , averaging well above one million b d for the year as a whole .
