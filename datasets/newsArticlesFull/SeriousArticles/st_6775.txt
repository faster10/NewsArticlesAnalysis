Britain is becoming committed to a military campaign of exactly the kind that Eyre Crowe , the Foreign Office mandarin , warned against . Political and military preparations have not gone hand in hand , but have entirely failed to complement each other . In Iraq , Britain is seeking to cooperate with an army that is weak and defeated , while in Syria it will refuse to cooperate with the army which is the most powerful military force in the country . In the recent past such disharmony has produced failure and defeat . It could well do so again in Syria . ?
