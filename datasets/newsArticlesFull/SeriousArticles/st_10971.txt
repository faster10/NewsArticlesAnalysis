Soule : Absolutely . If you look at the ideas that that story had , Iron Man thought superheroes should have to register with the government , and become something of a police force . Captain America thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country . It was a debate of security versus freedom . We ' re taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas . The Registration Act is all in the past at this point . It ' s more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war , and it ' s a huge story and it ' s fun to be able to involve every Marvel character there is .
