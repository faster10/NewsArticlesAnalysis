The disclosures that all Google Shopping results are paid are somewhat hidden . On the main Google Shopping page , a disclaimer that Google is " compensated by some " vendors is buried at the bottom of the page . Search results are formatted to look like a typical Google results page , and you must click on a link that says " Why these products ? " to see a similar disclaimer . ( Bing ' s big Scroogled marketing push might actually address this problem for Google . Now , everyone will know they ' re paid . )
