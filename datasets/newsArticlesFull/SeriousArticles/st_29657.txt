The NLD will have to win 67 of the seats from both chambers of parliament that are not reserved for the military in order to form a government . They will be building on their 2012 by election win where they won 43 of 44 seats contested and could possibly achieve the same result on a larger scale . The NLD can win in a landslide if it draws support from voters seeking to finally make count their votes from 1990 , those that are drawn to Aung San Suu Kyi ' s popular appeal and legacy borne out of the 1988 uprising and her familial heritage , or , mostly importantly , those that view a vote for the NLD as a vote against the military . Many in Myanmar are drawn to Aung San Suu Kyi ' s story as the daughter of the country ' s founder Aung San , and see her as the rightful heir to his leadership .
