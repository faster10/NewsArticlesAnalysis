If not a Best Picture nomination ? even though the movie was considered a sure thing ? why not an overdue nod for its director ? Don t hold your breath . Todd Haynes was egregiously snubbed back in 2003 for the Douglas Sirk homage Far From Heaven , as his film was left out of the Best Picture and Director lineups , with only a screenplay nod for Haynes . This year , he was ousted in favor of Adam McKay for The Big Short . That means that Haynes , who has staked his claim as one of the best directors of his generation through accomplished work like Safe , Mildred Pierce , and I m Not There , still has never been nominated for Best Director . Instead they gave his nomination to the guy who directed Anchorman .
