Earlier this month , the United Nations urged the U . S . to ease its ethanol mandate . The origin of this policy goes back to 2005 when Congress set requirements of corn to be used for automotive fuel . In 2007 , the Energy Independence and Security Act greatly increased those requirements to improve air quality and become more energy secure . Behind the scenes , however , corn and other agricultural lobbyists were promoting the mandate to create a larger market for corn . Using current numbers , this year ' s ethanol mandate would theoretically require 44 of this year ' s corn crop , a third of which is recycled back as distillers grains for livestock feed .
