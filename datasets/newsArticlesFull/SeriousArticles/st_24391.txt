That ' s what people have been saying all along . Back in July , when Trump criticized John McCain for getting captured in Vietnam , a writer in US News suggested that Trump " may be bumping up on his ceiling of support . " At the time he stood at 24 percent in national polls ( for our purposes , I ' m going to refer to the Huffpost Pollster poll average ) . A few days before , The New York Times ' data driven Upshot blog predicted that the McCain controversy " will probably mark the moment when Trump ' s candidacy went from boom to bust . " The pattern continued ? every downward blip in the polls was greeted with the conclusion that now this weirdness was finally going to end . " Trump momentum shows signs of stalling , " said Politico in September . Trump " is very likely to find his upside limited as other candidates start to drop out , " wrote an analyst in the National Review . " Is Donald Trump losing steam in early states ? " asked CBS in October . The only thing that has changed is where Trump ' s ceiling is supposed to be : At first it was 30 percent , then maybe 35 , and now that he ' s polling in the high 30s , it ' s supposed to be 40 percent or so .
