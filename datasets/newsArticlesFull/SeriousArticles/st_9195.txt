We hope that the Pope will challenge African religious and political leaders and captains of industries to hoist the banner of righteousness and moral rectitude in order to stamp out corruption in the conduct of state , church and private businesses in the continent . Indeed , the Pope will call forth the African spirit of Ubuntu and Sankofa in challenging Africa to find from the heart of Africa new pathways to solidarity , reconciliation , consensus building , wealth creation strategies and the promotion and protection of the common good .
