Ireland recorded stunning economic growth during what is known as the " Celtic Tiger " era from around 1993 to 2007 when the global financial crisis hit . Irish banks , like others around the world , loaned money to people who in some cases couldn ' t pay it back . Cheap loans created extra demand for housing and as prices surged the construction industry raced to build more . House prices multiplied during the period , making many homeowners impressive profits and generating fat tax receipts for the government . However , when the housing bubble burst , consumer spending slowed sharply . Unemployment tripled from around four percent in 2005 to 11 . 8 percent in 2009 . The most recent figure , for September , puts it even higher at 13 . 7 percent .
