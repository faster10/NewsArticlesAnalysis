"Homeland" season 5 heading to Europe, Carrie leaving CIA
"Homeland" is going to jump forward in time between its fourth and fifth seasons, the executive producer of the Showtime spy drama revealed over the weekend.  "We're going to take about a two-year forward jump," Alex Gansa said Friday at the opening night of PaleyFest, the annual TV celebration at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.On the purple carpet, Gansa said the next "Homeland" season will be filmed in Europe, most likely in Berlin. He said the setting would be Germany.The fourth season of "Homeland" was shot in Cape Town, South Africa, which doubled for Islamabad and Kabul.Gansa later told the PaleyFest audience that CIA officer Carrie Mathison, played by series star Claire Danes, will no longer be an intelligence officer.Many of the "Homeland" crew members said the fourth season was critical to the series, given the death Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) at the end of season 3. So the show got a "reboot," said director Lesli Linka Glatter, referring to the fourth season's new plot direction and darker-than-ever twists.Showtime renewed the show for a fifth season in November.PaleyFest organizers said about 20,000 fans were expected over the course of the 10-day festival. Other events include screenings and conversations with the casts of "Girls," "Scandal," "Jane the Virgin," "Glee" and "Modern Family," among others.
