I haven ' t even spoken of former governor of Texas John Connally who , unlike Perry , served as a competent governor , served as both secretary of the Navy and secretary of the Treasury . Even I am getting tired of beating this pi ata of a field . The other Republicans of the presidential primaries of 1980 consisted of Sen . Lowell Weicker of Connecticut , who was a liberal Republican and a rather influential member of the Senate Watergate committee ( for those of you over 45 you can remember such a species . )
