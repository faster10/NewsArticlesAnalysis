First Dexter broke out a rote James Brown tribute act with " Sexy Machine . " Ladies loved it girls adored it , but Simon could see right through it and asked him to sing 15 seconds a cappella . During that entire commercial break I honestly wondered if maybe this guy would freeze up and either refuse for some creepy reason or not be able to think of just the right song . But he did ! Nicole , who ' d been switching up her dialects according to the occasion , called Dexter " one of the funkiest cats I ' ve seen up here . " Ooh . Two hours of actual funky cats auditioning for The X Factor probably would have flown by .
