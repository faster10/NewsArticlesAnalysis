" I know it ' s time consuming . Especially working women and mothers don ' t have a lot of time to pay attention to how they ' re wardrobing themselves . . . but there ' s a certain amount of time we need to give ourselves as women , because it ' s an expression of who we are . What we put on our backs when we go out in the morning speaks more than what we say or do initially in terms of how people perceive us . It ' s a little bit of an investment in that we need to make to be able to feel better about ourselves . "
