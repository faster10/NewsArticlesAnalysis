The fear of this autism epidemic is used to justify any number of illogical , yet widely accepted , perspectives , like the repeatedly debunked notion that childhood vaccines cause autism . It is apparently better for dozens to die from measles than to possibly risk that your child might become autistic . In this perverse worldview , autistic adults do not matter . We are the worst outcome . We can be consigned to segregated workshops where we do meaningless work like unwrapping bars of soap or capping lotion bottles for less than minimum wage ? if we are employed at all . After our parents die , we disappear entirely . This may seem dystopian , but it is reality for many Americans .
