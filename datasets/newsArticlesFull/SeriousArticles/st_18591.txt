Others count the days until Christmas or look forward to seeing the fireworks on Independence Day or watching the ball drop on New Year ' s Eve . However , for me , and perhaps oddly enough , I look forward to the inconsequential holiday of Groundhog Day . A holiday that arrives every year on Feb . 2 and which stands in the shadow of the romantic and heartwarming holiday of Valentine ' s Day . A holiday , which falls during a somewhat gloomy time of the year , when the nights are longer , and the days are colder .
