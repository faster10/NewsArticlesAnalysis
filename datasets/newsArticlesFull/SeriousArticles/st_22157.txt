Another step , which is a bit more challenging is to reflect on one ' s own behavior and actions . You should ask yourself , " Am I perpetuating these discriminatory acts ? " It is very easy to get caught in the moment and make a laugh at a sexist offensive joke , but try and remember that it can start with jokes and then the problem becomes more serious leading to harassment , violence or even death . If you are one of the fortunate ones who have the upper hand in society , do not be a silent bystander , STAND UP , SPEAK UP . Become role models and act to change mindsets about stereotypes and social norms .
