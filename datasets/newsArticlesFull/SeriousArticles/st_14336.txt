Cruz added , You know , how about we stop letting left wing liberals moderate Republican debates ? How about instead of a bunch of attack journalists , we actually have real journalists ? Yes , real journalists like Limbaugh . That s all we need to know . And again , CNBC is absolutely not a liberal network with liberal hosts . Neither is Fox News . That s two of the three debates , and I don t recall a lot of bitching after the CNN debate . Again , inside the bubble , the CNBC and Fox News debates were moderated by left wing liberals . This is exactly why Cruz can get away with such nonsense , even though the rest of us , outside the bubble , know he s talking in gibberish .
