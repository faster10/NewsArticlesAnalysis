By playing out of the game . Even if he hadn ' t been baseball ' s trailblazing crossover star , Robinson had a talent on the field that was explosive . He was a wizard at stealing bases , and the movie glories in his quickness and bravado how he steps off first base and eases down the path , hopping back and forth like a jackrabbit on a hot stove , holding his arms low , letting his fingers wiggle like nervous antennae . 42 portrays this athletic showmanship with an element of racial psychodrama . Robinson isn ' t just teasing the pitchers ( the more they look at him , the less they can tell what he ' s going to do next ) . He ' s mocking them , working off his anger . He triumphs , and holds on to his sanity , by beating racist players at their own game .
