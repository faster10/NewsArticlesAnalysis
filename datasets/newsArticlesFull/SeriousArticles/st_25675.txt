The underlying problem here is that some of the networks have leaned so far left in the past that the RNC Republican National Committee felt the need to insist on including someone who speaks conservative among the debate panelists . But some of the best conservative speakers are prominent figures at opinion publications who are 1 ) appalled by Trump , and 2 ) unconstrained from expressing their feelings about him . That makes for a lively public conversation , but is it a good idea for a presidential debate ?
