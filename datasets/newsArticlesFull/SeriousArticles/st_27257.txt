Your death at home . Many people I talk to as part of my job think that death predominantly happens in hospitals , in very clinical settings , but I presume you chose home and planned this in some detail . This is one of our aims in palliative care , and your ability to achieve this may mean that others will see it as an option they would like fulfilled . The photos that emerged of you some days after your death , were said to be from the last weeks of your life . I do not know whether this is correct , but I am certain that many of us would like to carry off a sharp suit in the same way that you did in those photos . You looked great , as always , and it seemed in direct defiance of all the scary monsters that the last weeks of life can be associated with .
