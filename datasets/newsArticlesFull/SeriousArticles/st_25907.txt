The tying run in the ninth in came on a stunning and rarely seen play . Eric Hosmer was on third after advancing on a groundout when Salvador Perez hit a squibber to the left side of the infield . Third baseman David Wright played it off one bounce in front of shortstop Wilmer Flores and looked at Hosmer for a moment before crow hopping and throwing it to first to get Perez . The instant Wright got into his throwing motion , Hosmer took off for home , and Lucas Duda s throw sailed far wide of the target .
