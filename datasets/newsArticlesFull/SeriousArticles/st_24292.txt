When all the bustle gets to be too much , there are plenty of sites that give you a chance to relax . South of the Jemaa el Fna stands the 19th century Bahia Palace and gardens , originally built for a high ranking official and his concubines . You won ' t find a palace in the sense of Versailles or the Hofburg . Instead , you ' ll meander through a series of rooms with little more than lavishly decorated floors , walls and ceilings , leading to courtyards with fruit trees and fountains . We walked through the palace on our own , though I suspect a proper tour could be organized . The Ben Youssef Medersa , a former boarding school where for hundreds of years young men studied the Quran , will amaze you with its intricate stucco and cedar carvings .
