The reality is that OPEC ' s maneuver to reduce oil prices short term would not have been necessary had demand for oil been rising fast enough to absorb more expensively produced oil , such as Canadian oil sands , ultra deep water oil and shale oil . But as the International Energy Agency has pointed out , oil demand is relatively flat with only a slight drift upward . Essentially , oil demand is on a " peak oil plateau " that I identified back in June of 2014 when I predicted oil prices would fall .
