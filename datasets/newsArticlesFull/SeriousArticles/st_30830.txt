Carolina ' s defensive linemen were the unsung heroes in the win over Seattle . The first quarter interception that Panthers linebacker Luke Kuechly returned for a touchdown happened because Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was harassed by defensive tackle Kawann Short . Short ' s 10 yard sack then defused Seattle ' s second possession while end Mario Addison forced Wilson ' s second interception in the second quarter with his pressure . With the Panthers leading 31 0 before halftime , Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch ( six carries for 20 yards ) became a non factor . Arizona rushed for only 40 yards on 19 carries against Green Bay and surrendered three sacks but this unit was a Cardinals strength for much of the season .
