The Faces also soldiered on without their lead singer , recruiting Simply Red ' s Mick Hucknall to fill his slot . He ' s done a bunch of shows with the group over the past few years , and he sounds exactly like early 1970s era Rod Stewart . " Ooh La La " was a lot of fun , but they absolutely destroyed with " Stay With Me . " Ron Wood played guitar with fiery passion , almost like he was trying to prove to Mick and Keith that he ' s in fighting shape for a Rolling Stones tour . Ian McLagan demonstrated that he ' s still one of the greatest keyboardists in rock and roll , and drummer Kenny Jones still has the chops that got him Keith Moon ' s old job in the late 1970s . Here ' s hoping that one day Rod comes to his senses and agrees to a tour with these guys .
