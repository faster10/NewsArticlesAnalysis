I reached out to Baroness Patricia Scotland , former UK Attorney General and Patron of the GFEDV for her view in this article . " Domestic violence does not discriminate it can affect every corner of our society from our campuses to our homes . Women aged 15 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than they are from cancer , malaria , motor accidents and war . As a community , we have to make it very clear that this is unacceptable and work collectively to sensitize communities to the violence that continues to permeate our homes . "
