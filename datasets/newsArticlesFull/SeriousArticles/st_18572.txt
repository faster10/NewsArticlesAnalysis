The Islamist terrorist attacks that took place almost simultaneously in five locations across Paris last Friday night were shocking in scale and unprecedented in Europe over the past decade : 129 killed immediately , 352 injured ( of whom 99 are in critical condition ) , a country wide state of emergency declared , ? thousands of troops deployed to Paris , demonstrations forbidden in the Ile de France region encompassing the French capital , border checks reimposed . ? The death toll would be bad enough alone , but that one of the assailants entered Europe ( in October , via Greece ) as a Syrian refugee compounds the fear and dread resulting from the massacre : Hundreds of thousands of migrants ( two out of three of whom are male ) ? have poured into Europe this year , and a majority are from ( Muslim ) Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan . Some of the other attackers were French or Belgian born Muslims .
