5 ) DeMarcus Cousins ? is back , drops 31 on Dallas and Sacramento gets the win . The Sacramento Kings with DeMarcus Cousins in the lineup are 6 5 on the season and a dangerous team . It s the 1 7 without him that holds them back . Cousins had 16 fourth quarter points ( 31 points , nine rebounds and six assists on the night ) , and that combined with some impressive defense down the stretch got the Kings a much needed win . That defense late has to be the most heartening thing for Kings fans ? they have been bad on that end of the floor . A little Cousins and a little defense and suddenly things look much better in Sacramento . Now they just have to do it consistently . And keep Cousins healthy .
