Perhaps the tone for the game was set right away when the Texans kickoff unit allowed a 106 yard kickoff return for a touchdown to open the game . That gave Kansas City an early seven point lead and Houston never recovered from the big moment . The special teams unit is not the reason that the Texans lost , but that opening sequence was simply foreshadowing what was to come over the next three plus hours . If the Houston kick coverage can make a tackle there , maybe the game is a little different .
