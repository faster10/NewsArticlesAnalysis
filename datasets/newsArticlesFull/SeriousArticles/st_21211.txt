Alta Crystal Resort lies just outside the northeast entrance to the park , giving it the closest proximity to Sunrise , the area ' s highest point . Each of Alta Crystal ' s 23 renovated suites has a fireplace and a small but fully equipped kitchen . An arched log entry and handmade doors enhance the appeal of the two story honeymoon cabin . The pool and hot tub stay heated year round , and you can join the resort ' s bonfires , barbecues , and other nightly events in July and August ( on weekends in other months ) .
