Unlike the very stupid , highly incompetent people running our country into the ground , Mr Trump knows when to walk away . Roger Aisles and FOX news think they can toy with him , but Mr Trump doesn t play games . There have already been six debates , and according to all online debate polls including Druge , Slate , Time Magazine , and many others , Mr Trump has won all of them , in particular the last one . Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater , he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process ? and it has been very good for him , both in polls and popularity . He will not be participating in the FOX news debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warrios , who have been treated so horribly by our all talk , no action politicians .
