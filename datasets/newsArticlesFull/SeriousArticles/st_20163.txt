Cruz miraculously falls somewhere very slightly to the left of the right wing of the pack on most major issues ( proving just how insane Trump and Ben Carson are ) , so it s natural for him to try to occupy this spot on foreign policy as well . Both frontrunners have glaring weak spots : Trump is a cartoon villain billionaire who has garnered support by lying about entire groups of people and events that nearly every eligible voter in 2016 witnessed , making him completely unelectable to the national electorate . Rubio , whose frontrunner status is based more on Bill Kristol fanfiction than reality , has transformed from a Jim DeMint devotee into the darling of Republican elites this perception that he s an establishment shill and lingering questions about his one attempt at doing anything remotely productive in Washington aren t doing him any favors .
