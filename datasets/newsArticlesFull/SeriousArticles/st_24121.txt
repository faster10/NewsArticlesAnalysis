The latest contraception mandate is only a precursor of what could come once Obamacare is fully implemented . The law itself grants the Health and Human Services Secretary an unelected bureaucrat far reaching powers . One breakdown of the law found more than 700 mentions to instruct that the secretary " shall " take action and more than 200 cases in which the secretary " may " issue regulations . We won ' t know the full extent of the secretary ' s power until Obamacare is enforced , but if the contraception mandate is any indication , the secretary could have the power to regulate what health care Americans receive , what doctors they see and what insurance coverage they are eligible for .
