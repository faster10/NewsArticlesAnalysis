2 . Stay ( somewhat ) private : We ' ve already discussed the nosy media , but now with Twitter and other social media , celebrities can live out every action , thought and event in real time for all of the world to see . Sure , it ' s a great promotional vehicle , but it ' s one more trap that is 100 avoidable . Don ' t want your Twitter account hacked where someone posts nasty things in your name ? Well , don ' t have a Twitter account . If you keep access to yourself somewhat limited , when you do actually have something to say , it makes it that much more powerful . Otherwise , people will get bored with hearing you tell them what you ate for lunch that day and miss the good stuff when you ' ve got it . Plus , it adds a bit of mystery and allure to you .
