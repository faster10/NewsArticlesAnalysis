The opening title track has a twinkling sense of optimism Martin croons I think I landed where there are miracles at work , and an anthemic oh whoa oh cry emerges from the background . That works fine as a table setter . But it s with the third track , Hymn for the Weekend , that the album truly lifts off on the wings of an angelic choir ( including Beyonc ) , a swaggering piano , and a euphoric , lightly funky track bolstering Martin s exclamations of feeling high . The rubbery , Chic esque bass lines of Adventure of a Lifetime keep the mood buoyant , and Army of One is a pleasantly woozy drifter .
