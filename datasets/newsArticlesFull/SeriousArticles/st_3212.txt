It typically consists of a 19 by 19 square board , where players attempt to capture empty areas and surround an opponent s pieces . Whereas chess offers some 20 possible choices per move , Go has about 200 , said Mr Demis Hassabis , co founder of Google DeepMind .

DeepMind should highlight how these phenomenally powerful machines are beginning to think in a more human way .
