My commitment and my day does not end with my charity . I am a member of the Veterans Advisory Committee and Palm Beach County Veterans Task Force . I have helped with the burials of indigent veterans . I am also opening a local Veterans Court to help prevent veterans from cycling through the courts and to get them the help they really need . Many have resorted to drug use and other negative behaviors to deal with their combat and service experience , and wind up in our criminal justice system . In fact , I just got the news that our first case will be heard there on November 18 .
