Margaret Hoover , a big Thatcher fan , shared the thrill of meeting the former prime minister years ago . I refused to speak ill of the recently deceased Thatcher . So instead , I read excerpts from a recent op ed penned by British comedian Russell Brand ( we all know comedians tend to write the best opinion pieces ) . Brand was highly critical of Thatcher ' s reign . John and Margaret both defended Thatcher from Brand ' s allegations that she was an uncaring person who favored the wealthy at the expense of the working class .
