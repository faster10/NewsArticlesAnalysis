" Imagine for a second you ' re Hillary Clinton , " he said . " You ' re trying to think , ' How do I run ? ' Well you can ' t run on the economy because we have the lowest percentage of Americans working any year since 1977 . You can ' t run on Obamacare because millions of people have lost their jobs , lost their health care , lost their doctors , seen their premiums skyrocket . You certainly can ' t run on foreign policy because every country you touched as secretary of state is a disaster . "
