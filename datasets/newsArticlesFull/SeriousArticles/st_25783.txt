' I was 16 and I went for a job interview for that day with my United scarf , my hat and my rattle . My mum said ' You ' ll never get a job like that . ' But I had to get to the game . I sat in the office and the manager says , " To be honest with you , Mr Butterfield , we don ' t have any vacancies . . . but just hang on , I ' m like you , I ' m a Manchester United supporter . So that ' s why I ' m giving you a job . " So I ended up working there as an optical mechanic for the next 22 years all to go and see Manchester United against Yeovil Town . '
