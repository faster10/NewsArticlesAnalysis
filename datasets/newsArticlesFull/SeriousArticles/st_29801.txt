For instance , HUD awarded 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the San Francisco Bay Area , including Silicon Valley , in January . And we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment . To empower communities , President Barack Obama has also requested 300 million for new Local Housing Policy Grants to help them increase housing affordability , economic growth and access to jobs . All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast to coast .
