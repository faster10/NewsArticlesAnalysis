When Paul Ryan was growing up , the charismatic , anti communist John Paul II was Pope . His traditionalist ethos has been continued and expanded under Benedict XVI , who has talked seriously of the church becoming smaller but purer . In this context , Republicanism and Catholicism find synergy and Ryan is its embodiment . He has a large family , boasts a 100 percent prolife voting record , and supported the constitutional ban on same sex marriage . Ryan also is happy to lend his Catholic moral theology credentials to his new boss , who sometimes struggles to strike a chord with religious voters .
