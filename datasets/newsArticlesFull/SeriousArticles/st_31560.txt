Second , anybody who thinks there ' s a mass of voters clamoring for a fantastically wealthy , politically correct , middle of the road candidate is someone who ' s probably been in hibernation or a coma for the last six or seven months . All of the movement in 2016 has been away from tepid centrists like Bloomberg . Voters seem driven by anger , whether it ' s toward immigrants or toward billionaires , and not motivated by a quest for someone to continue the status quo . The elites don ' t understand that the masses are NOT feeling like they have a lack of choices for 2016 . To the contrary , the masses like their 2016 candidates because they hate elitists like Michael Bloomberg .
