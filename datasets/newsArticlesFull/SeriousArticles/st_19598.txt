The Prime Minister was at pains to emphasise that the UK had learned the lessons of the Iraq invasion . To launch air strikes over Syria , as a laggardly partner in a coalition , and with the broad support of the United Nations , is indeed an undertaking of a quite different order . The enemy unmistakably contributes to global disorder , and cannot conscionably be left to cement its brand of far reaching and indiscriminate savagery . The case for Britain sending RAF fighters into the skies above Raqqa has merit ? so long as the drawbacks are acknowledged , and the relative military insignificance of such a move is understood .
