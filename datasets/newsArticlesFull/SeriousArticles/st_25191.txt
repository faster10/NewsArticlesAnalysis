Ben Carson doesn t even try to hide that this is a big grift , taking a couple of weeks off from his campaign in order to promote his new book . As Erin Gloria Ryan at Jezebel ? argued , the Republican primary is a lot like the plot of that Mel Brooks movie The Producers : It s more profitable to lose than to win . Losing means you get to spend the next few years of your life raking in millions by telling conservatives the country is under siege from sex having women and rappers . Being president means you have to work a real job . ? That s why Republican debate stages ? should be regarded more like an American Idol for wingnut welfare than an actual political contest .
