Mrs Clinton s comments were in stark contrast to President Obama s response last year . He was reported to be madder than hell about the corruption at the VA , and said that he would not stand for it . There must be consequences . The failures Hillary now minimizes caused him to fire former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and appoint Rob Nabors , his own deputy chief of staff , to investigate the agency . ( That report , contrary to Mrs Clinton s characterization of the problem , found significant and chronic system failures at the VA . )
