Tight End : The Broncos turned to Kubiak favorite Owen Daniels when the Jacksonville Jaguars made Julius Thomas the NFL ' s second highest paid tight end with a five year , 46 million deal containing 24 million in guarantees . Daniels played under Kubiak for eight years with the Houston Texans and joined the Baltimore Ravens in 2014 for the Denver head coach ' s lone season as offensive coordinator in 2014 . Virgil Green , whose role has dramatically increased since Super Bowl XLVIII , and Daniels received three year contracts for 8 . 4 million and 12 . 5 million respectively . Their combined deals don ' t quite equal the 21 million Thomas had fully guaranteed at signing . The Broncos gave 2016 and 2017 sixth round picks to San Francisco 49ers for Vernon Davis , who has an expiring contract , and a 2016 seventh round pick at the trading deadline because Daniels and Green were struggling to make up for the loss of Thomas . Davis hasn ' t made much of impact since the trade .
