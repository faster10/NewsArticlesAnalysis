Jack Holland , lecturer in international relations at the University of Surrey , said that since 2002 2003 , use of the term WMD had generally been " political in use and political in implication . " WMD had been used to refer to chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( CBRN ) , but the term had more recently been used for " deliberate political reasons " and broadened out , Holland said . " It ' s increasingly just something explosive or destructive that makes the term so broad as to be meaningless , " he said . " In 2002 , there weren ' t people talking about pressure cookers as WMDs . "
