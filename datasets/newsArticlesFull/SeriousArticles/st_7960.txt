He added saying , " I wonder why their criticism of the Samajwadi Party is so restrained . Perhaps it is a case of chor chor mausere bhai ( all thieves are related ) . They are both similar parties and they know how bad they both are . It is also possible that they are keeping future alliances in mind . It is ironic that they are targeting us over farmers ' issues when agriculture is a state subject according to the Constitution . Despite that , the Prime Minister approved a loan of Rs 6 , 000 crore so that sugar mills can pay farmers the overdue cane arrears . The rest is up to the state government and they are failing . "
