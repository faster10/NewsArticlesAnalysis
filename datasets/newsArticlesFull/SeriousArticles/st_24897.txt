Jesse Jackson ran two campaigns for the Democratic nomination , once in 1984 and again in 1988 . No , he didn t win . But he presaged the present day Democratic coalition ? of minorities , young people , and educated liberal whites ? and paved a future for black politicians with presidential ambitions . What s more , his campaign was a darkroom for a whole generation of Democratic operatives , who would work in other campaigns and seed the lessons of Jackson s effort throughout the Democratic Party .
