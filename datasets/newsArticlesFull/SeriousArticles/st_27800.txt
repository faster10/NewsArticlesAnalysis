To me , this is very likely a feint from establishment Republicans for one important reason : They don t directly address Trump s electability , which , like Cruz s , remains poor . General election ? matchup polling this early comes with many caveats ? the fact that the general election campaign is still six months away , notably . And we should expect that the instant Trump were to win the nomination , he would move to rebrand himself as a lifelong pro choice feminist Latino . But those early matchup numbers are still awful ? and worse than Cruz s ? because Trump has gone to great lengths to viscerally alienate so many demographic groups and has certain . . . let s say , temperament issues .
