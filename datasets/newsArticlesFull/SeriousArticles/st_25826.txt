Recently , however , the GOP s internal cohesion has been shattered , in part because of epic policy failures ( 9 11 , the Iraq War , Katrina , the Great Recession ) and in part because of structural changes empowering entities like super PACs which diminish the relative power of cohesion oriented party organizations . As a result , this cycle has seen unprecedented fragmentation , and a lack of issue landscape stability . In fact , the dominant candidate , Donald Trump ( who still has a healthy polling average lead , despite Ben Carson s recent gains ) doesn t define himself in terms of issues at all , but in terms of attitude . In retrospect , even his initial seeming fixation on immigration was as much about Trump s attitude ? if not more ? than it was about those who called rapists and murderers . And so it s difficult for observers to say what s likely to happen , because they re having a hard time understanding what s already happened so far . And the rise of Ben Carson is only making that worse , not better .
