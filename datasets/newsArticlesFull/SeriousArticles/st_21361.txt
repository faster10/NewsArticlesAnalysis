The young local reporters present were far more sanguine than we veterans on Saturday . I envied their confidence , their assumption that things would work out fine . Back in the Stone Ages , I used to cover the occasional Charlton match for the local paper . In my second or third game , as a novice reporter , I described a Charlton centre half as ' The finest in the Second Division ' . The Sports Editor was a kind man . ' I take it you ' ve seen all the others ? ' he enquired . Naturally , I hadn ' t . He smiled , and sent me off to make the office tea .
