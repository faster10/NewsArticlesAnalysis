Rubio ' s strategy of dropping in and out of the state for visits only in the campaign ' s targeted counties ? which drew criticism early on for seeming piecemeal ? helped him drive out bigger than expected turnout in some of his key counties , particularly the suburbs of Des Moines . Where Rubio was once ridiculed as the " Mayor of Ankeny " for spending so much time in the suburban Des Moines area , he ultimately eked out a win over Cruz in that county by just 500 votes , making it one of a handful of counties where Rubio pulled ahead by just a few hundred votes .
