The Herman Cain campaign for president in 2012 was unconventional by every expression of the word . It is unusual for a person with no electoral experience to be taken so seriously as a candidate for the office in the first place ( as he was , early on ) .

As a black conservative , Cain put fear in the hearts of the Democrats and of the media that has put themselves in the position of protecting the left . A black conservative being elected president had the potential of changing the entire electoral landscape , and that was too much to for the media to handle .
