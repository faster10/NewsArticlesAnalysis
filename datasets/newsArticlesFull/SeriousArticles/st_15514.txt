I speak from experience , having just returned from two weeks in one of the Colt Cottages . It wasn ' t my first visit to the castle I ' ve visited every year since I first learned about the holiday cottages four years ago . While the Colt Cottages are the smallest cottages available to rent , they are my favorite because of their close proximity to the castle just a couple hundred yards away . If you are looking for more room , there are larger cottages to choose from , all rented on a weekly basis .
