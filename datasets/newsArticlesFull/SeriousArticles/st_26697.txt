Islam is a philosophy of life a set of traditions and commandments for saying prayers , social engagements , familial relationships , philanthropy , charity , marriage , parenthood , dressing , eating and drinking and education , plus some edicts on governance for the leaders of an Islamic society which I ' m not delving on here .
