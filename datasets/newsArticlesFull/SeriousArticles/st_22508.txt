Second , the Taylor trial suffered as all international criminal cases do from the narrowness of the charges against him . Because of the inherent length and expense of international trials , prosecutors typically focus on crimes that they can most easily prove , rather than those that may be most representative of the suspect ' s atrocities or most salient in the eyes of affected populations . While the 11 charges against Taylor are more expansive than those brought against most international suspects , they still ignore arguably Taylor ' s most egregious crimes , namely those committed in his home country , Liberia , because of the special court ' s mandate which focuses solely on crimes committed within Sierra Leone .
