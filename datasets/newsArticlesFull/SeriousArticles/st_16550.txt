Rosie Ruiz , the marathon After taking gold medal in the 1980 Boston Marathon and setting the third fastest time ever recorded for a female runner in the process , many spectators noticed how remarkably sweat free and relaxed the 23 year old Ruiz appeared as she took to the winner ' s podium . Race officials were also dismayed by the jubilant victor ' s absence from the numerous photographs taken during the competition , and none of the checkpoint monitors or fellow runners were able to recognize the young champion after the 26 mile race had ended . It was not long before a few members of the crowd came forward to reveal that they had seen Ruiz simply jump in during the last half mile , where she duly sprinted to the finish line .
