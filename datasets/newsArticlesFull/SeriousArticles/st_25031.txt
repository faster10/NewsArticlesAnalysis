London Reports coming from Russia suggest that hundreds of people have been injured by a meteor falling from space . The force of the fireball , which seems to have crashed into a lake near the town of Chebarkul in the Ural Mountains , roared through the sky early on Friday morning local time , blowing out windows and damaging buildings . This comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid known as 2012 DA14 which is due for a close approach with Earth on Friday evening . The asteroid will skirt around our planet , however , missing by some 27 , 000 kilometers ( 16 , 777 miles ) . Based on early reports , there is no reason to believe the two events are connected .
