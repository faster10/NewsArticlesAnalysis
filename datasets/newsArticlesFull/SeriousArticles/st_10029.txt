Rickman was born Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman to Welsh and Irish parents on a west London council estate . His career making success came in 1985 , in the irresistible role of the cold blooded rake Valmont in the Royal Shakespeare Company staging of Les Liaisons Dangereuses . He and his co star Lindsay Duncan reunited with their director , Howard Davies , for a Private Lives revival that , like Liaisons , traveled to Broadway . Hearing and seeing Rickman in action truly was an occasion , starting with the sheer joy he took ( as did audiences ) in his wry vocal flourishes , those astoundingly sharp final consonants , those trademark legendary very nearly self parodic pauses .
