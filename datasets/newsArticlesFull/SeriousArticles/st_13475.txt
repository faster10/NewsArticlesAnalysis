This is unfortunate . Years ago , Obama ' s own State Department produced an environmental impact statement green lighting the project . " The central finding in the draft environmental impact statement , " The New Yorker ' s Ryan Lizza told NPR ' s Terry Gross back in 2013 , " was , if you don ' t build Keystone , the Canadians will sell this stuff anyway , they ' ll build pipelines to their east coast , to their west coast , and they ' ll send it to the Gulf of Mexico via rail ? and by the way , sending oil by rail releases a whole lot more greenhouse gas emissions than putting it in a pipeline .
