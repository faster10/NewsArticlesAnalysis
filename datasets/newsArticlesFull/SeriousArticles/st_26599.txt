So , as part of my research , I undertook a pilot study of six schools in Edinburgh in 2009 . I found that over the course of a season , the average risk of injury to a player is 17 per cent , or one in six , and in other studies , in some schools it is as high as one in three . In our small study , in just 193 matches there were 37 injuries . Of these , 20 required A E attendance , and 65 per cent prevented further participation in the sport for three weeks or more . If you knew your child was taking this big a risk , would you still want them to play rugby ?
