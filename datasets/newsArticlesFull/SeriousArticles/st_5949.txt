The sinister tone of the phrase laying on of hands reminds me of the scene that finally killed off my enjoyment of Bond . In 2012 s Skyfall , Severine ( Berenice Marlohe ) confesses she has been the victim of trafficking and sexual abuse , and Bond s response ? To immediately ? and without so much as a glimmer of empathy ? have sex with her in a shower . Quite apart from Fleming s assumption that male sexual prowess is the answer to every straight woman s problems , his sheer non comprehension of lesbianism is yet another affirmation that Bond inherits his psyche from an emotionally immature , psychologically ignorant author .
