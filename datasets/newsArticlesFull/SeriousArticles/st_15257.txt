The Giants have not had the same 11 players starting on defense in any game this season , and the shuffling of personnel is one reason they have not brought as much pressure or blitzed as often as coordinator Steve Spagnuolo prefers . One of the things that does get tough is when the parts are changing , Spagnuolo said . There s certain positions that change a lot . With Johnathan Hankins ( torn pectoral ) on season ending injured reserve , second year DT Jay Bromley is going to get increased playing time . The thing that Jay can do is he can rush the passer , in addition to playing the run , coach Tom Coughlin said .
