If Europe does not give more ground , then Mr Cameron will be taking back a deal to Britain that some may judge is full of empty gestures ? jeopardising the pro EU campaign . The Europhile machine is likely to be highly professional and stacked with weighty personalities . But if they are forced to make a case for what is essentially the status quo , they are more likely to lose . Were that to happen , the consequences of Brexit for those left behind in the EU would be significant . They would wave goodbye to a country tipped to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030 , a major military power , a diplomatic ally to those European capitals that favour greater liberalisation and a political bridge to the United States . If Britain and the EU are currently engaged in a grand game of bluff then Britain still has plenty of bluff to call .
