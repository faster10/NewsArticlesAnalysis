COMCAST ANNOUNCES NEW GIGABIT SERVICE IN FIVE CITIES ? The country s largest cable company announced Tuesday the arrival of a super fast cable broadband service in Atlanta and Nashville early this year , with expansion to Chicago , Detroit and Miami to come later in 2016 . The service comes thanks to the much anticipated DOCSIS 3 . 1 cable standard , which Comcast says will eventually allow for gigabit speeds across its network without the need for fiber deployment . The rollout likely means a pretty sizable boost for the percentage of Americans that have access to gigabit speeds . Only 7 . 9 percent had that sort of access as of the summer of 2014 ? the most recent figures from the National Broadband Map . A Comcast spokesperson says the company varies the markets in which it chooses to roll out new products , but says it faces competition in each of those markets from both traditional telecom providers and overbuilders . Indeed , the broadband map shows that at least part of all five of the chosen cities have at least four wired Internet providers .
