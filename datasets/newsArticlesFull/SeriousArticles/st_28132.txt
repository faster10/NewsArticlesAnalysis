What Sanders is attempting to do , as far as I can tell , is reform the Democratic Party . In a sense , he is hoping to bring back the economic ideals of the New Deal era , while promoting the social ideals of the modern era . This has received sharp criticism from actual socialists , like the writer , Chris Hedges , who ? believes ? that Sanders ill advised decision to validate the Democratic Party by becoming one of its presidential candidates , is a waste of time . ? But for other no less cynical progressives , who see reforming the Democratic party as the only viable option at this time , Sanders is creating an important grassroots movement that may well shift the political debate leftwards ( after being pushed to the right for about 40 ? years ) .
