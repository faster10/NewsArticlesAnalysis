Consider it the moveable flea . In high season ( April through Thanksgiving ) , 150 vintage antique artisan booths set up outdoors in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Fort Greene ( Saturdays ) and Williamsburg ( Sundays ) . Come winter , they head inside the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank , a 1929 wonder with vaulted ceilings , gold leaf mosaics , and marble floors . Expect vintage maps , retooled bicycles , and retired classroom furniture , along with handmade geometric jewelry , architectural salvage , and troves of used designer handbags . It ' s a scene , to be sure , but also a great place to get inspiration for your next apartment ( or wardrobe ) makeover and perhaps discover an untapped appreciation for kimchi topped hot dogs . The related market Smorgasburg focuses entirely on such creative street food .
