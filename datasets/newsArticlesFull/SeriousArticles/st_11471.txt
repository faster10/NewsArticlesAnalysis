The second half of the season is going to be a real challenge for McPhee . He s been the best player on defense by a wide margin but he s only going to get more attention from opposing offensive coordinators as they prepare for the Bears . They re going to account for McPhee . He s going to still create havoc but this is clearly a serious need area for the defense when you start projecting ahead to the future . You can t have too many quality pass rushers and you better have more than one because quarterbacks with plenty of time do damage and Bridgewater had too much time when he found Stefon Diggs for the 40 yard touchdown against McManis .
