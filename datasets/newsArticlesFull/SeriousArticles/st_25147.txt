Travel often shakes you from your comfort zone and that ' s a good thing , especially for those of us who feel an obsessive need to always be in control . Why not consciously decide that while you ' re away from home , you ' ll do something that ' s a bit out of character ? Nothing dangerous , of course just eyebrow raising for you . For some of us , that ' s sampling a dish we ' d never try at home whether fish cheeks in China or Tuscan cinghiale ( wild boar ) at the always lively Il Latini ristorante in Florence . ( So what if you hate it ? You never have to try it again . )
