The best explanation I ' ve seen of late comes from a focus group run by Peter Hart , a Democratic pollster , on behalf of the Annenberg Center for Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvania . The group , which was in Indianapolis , was comprised of 12 Republicans , 11 of whom are " hardcore " GOPers . ( Before you lambast the idea of a Democratic pollster leading a GOP focus group , Hart helped conduct the bipartisan NBC Wall Street Journal poll for years and is widely recognized by pollsters in both parties as one of the best in the business . )
