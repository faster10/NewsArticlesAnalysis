First , Glass Steagall would not have protected us during the financial crisis . Remember , the sales pitch for bringing back the law is about separating plain vanilla banking from investment banking and other riskier forms of finance . But the financial crisis didn t occur primarily in the supermarket firms where investment banking and banking were commingled . It occurred largely in the most plain vanilla market of them all : the mortgage market . And while there were certainly some supermarket style firms ( like Citigroup C , 0 . 54 ) that were dangerous , there were plenty of plain vanilla banks ( like Washington Mutual ) that failed along with totally separate investment banks ( like Lehman Brothers ) . We had separate investment banking and plain vanilla entities that managed to blow themselves up without the help of the supermarket financial model . Glass Steagall would not have stopped the housing boom or the bust from occurring .
