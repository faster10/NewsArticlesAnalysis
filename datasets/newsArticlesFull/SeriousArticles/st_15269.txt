I supported the XL project for one primary reason : security . I ' m old enough to have lived through the oil embargoes of the 1970s and experienced the whipsawing of oil and gas prices caused by geo political upheaval over the 40 years since . At one point , the US was importing over 60 of its crude oil burn from countries who hate us . The horizontal drilling boom has reduced imports significantly , but that domestic boom , like all other booms , won ' t last forever , especially when a glut of supply causes prices to fall below break even for development . OPEC countries have some of the lowest production costs in the world , and they are winning the oil price war . In the event of an upset in supply , which has happened before , I would rather the US have access to an additional 800 , 000 barrels per day of supply than not . Rejecting this project , in my view , was short sighted , and we ' ll likely regret it some time in the future .
