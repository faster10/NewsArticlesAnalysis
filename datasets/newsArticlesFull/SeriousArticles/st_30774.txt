Clinton visited on a Friday , the last day of the preview week , during a time when the show was closed because of supplier days , so security was relatively easy , said Gilbert . During the public days it s going to be very difficult because there are two things that they do for a presidential visit : One , they ve got to sweep the whole building to make sure nothing threatening is left there , and then after they sweep the building they ve got to make sure that everybody who goes through is screened with a metal detector , bomb sniffing dogs , things of that nature .
