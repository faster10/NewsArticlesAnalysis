You can , however , share the city with the hundreds of thousands of Amsterdammers who ride their bicycles to and from work every day . The law does not require you to wear a helmet and practically no one does . You are , however , required to have a light and a bell on your bike . If you walk , make sure to stay out of the official bike lanes . If you choose to drive a car , it is illegal to use a mobile phone while you drive , and if you run into a bicycle , Dutch law places the responsibility on the driver of the car . So , if you go to a coffee shop , better not drive a car , or even a bicycle .
