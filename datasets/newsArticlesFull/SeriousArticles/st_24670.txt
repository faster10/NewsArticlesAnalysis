Bobby Bell Jr . , son of Chiefs Hall of Famer and former Mizzou player : It hurts , because he ' s the leader of the biggest program Mizzou has . . . . It used to be Norm Stewart . The expectations for the program were always there , but you had to find a coach that can elevate the program to that level again . Unfortunately , after I left , the University football team kind of crumbled a little bit for a while . That was hard to swallow for a while , because nobody wants to come back and watch somebody get beat down . They were at the top ( under Pinkel ) , and I think they ' ll be back . I hope they will be . . . . We had a big gap in there for a while . The program ought to be able to sustain itself with the people that he had underneath him . He built the kingdom , but he ' s got some pretty good guys underneath them .
