1 . Rubio s list of accomplishments doesn t include anything that can be seen , heard or touched in the actual world . ? Unless there s a broad conspiracy in the media to hide Rubio s many and monumental accomplishments , the campaign dynamics will soon ? reveal that there s not much there , even on ? Rubio s own ? campaign website : ? As a U . S . Senator , Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative , conservative ideas to address these fundamental issues and to restore hope in the American Dream . Not the kinds of concrete verbs and measureable achievements one would advise a recent college grad to put on his resume , much less a candidate for president . Noting Rubio s anemic record , Ted Cruz backers recently released a ? funny ad ? that asks , Can anyone think of ANYTHING Marco Rubio s ever done ? Anything at all ?
