The trend of not receiving vaccinations has been fueled by many , including Jenny McCarthy . The son of the former co host of " The View " was diagnosed with autism in 2007 . Since then she has been fervently critical of vaccination , claiming vaccines such as those for measles , mumps and rubella cause autism . She founded an organization for the cause , wrote books on the topic and made countless appearances all the while arguing , absent any scientific data , that vaccines cause autism . McCarthy ' s views have been influential in fanning parents ' fears of vaccinating their children .
