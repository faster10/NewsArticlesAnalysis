The Australian native s seventh studio ? album , This Is Acting , takes the idea of ? remove one step further : It s composed ? almost entirely of songs written for ? and in ? some cases rejected by ? other artists . Lead ? single Alive was co penned with Adele but ? ultimately left off her November blockbuster ? 25 , and other tracks were purportedly ? meant for Rihanna and Beyonc , both of ? whom Sia has written hits for in the past . ? Not many vocalists would be brave ( or ? crazy ) enough to take on a ballad designed ? for Adele s titanic range , even if it belonged ? to them first Sia may be one of the few actually ? capable of it . The sweeping , defiant ? Alive suits her richly distinctive voice ? a ? quicksilver warble that swoops and dives ? and bends itself around every note .
