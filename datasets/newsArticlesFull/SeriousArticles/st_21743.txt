" We tell those suffering respiratory distress to avoid going out during the dawn and dusk hours when pollution levels are at their peak , " said Dr J C Suri , professor and head of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjang Hospital . The presence of respirable pollutants in the air not only effects breathing , but leads to fresh problems . According to Dr G C Khilnani , professor of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS , when a person inhales , the heavier pollution particles get stuck in the upper respiratory tract leading to sore throat and cough , while smaller particles cause infection of the lower respiratory tract . " High pollution levels have also been linked with increased risks of heart attacks and strokes , " he added Persistently high levels of pollution also prolong the recovery period for patients suffering from respiratory illnesses , warned Dr Arup Basu , chest specialist at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital . He cited the example of a 65 year old asthma patient in critical condition who has not responded to treatment over five days when he would normally be up and about in two days of care . " We have tried a range of medications , from antibiotics and steroids to nebulisers , but the patient is still struggling to breathe , " said Basu .
