And there s a strong case to be made that LeBron James ? the sharpest basketball mind to come along at least since Michael Jordan ? knows more about the game and how to win it than almost any human on Earth , including every coach he s ever played for . If he has to butt heads ? and even replace coaches ? to win , then isn t that the point ? If that s not enough to convince you , consider that Magic Johnson got his coach fired once , and everybody ( except people who watch late night TV ) loves that guy .
