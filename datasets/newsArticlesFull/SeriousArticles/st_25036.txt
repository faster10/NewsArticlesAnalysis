One of the great virtues of the ACA is that it has managed to extend coverage significantly without disrupting the three primary forms of coverage enjoyed by most Americans . Nearly half of Americans are insured through their employment , while Medicare and Medicaid each cover another sixth . The ACA has expanded benefits for employed Americans by requiring coverage for preventive services and capping out of pocket expenditures . Employer sponsored enrollment has remained largely stable under the ACA , while Medicare and Medicaid enrollment have grown . Premiums for employer coverage and for Medicare have increased more slowly than in previous years .
