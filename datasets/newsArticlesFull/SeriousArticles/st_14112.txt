Brian Baker of Beatrice , Nebraska I am 30 years old , and for my 30th birthday my wife pre ordered " Halo 3 " for me as a birthday present . The 6 month wait for the present game didn ' t bother me one bit . The story that is " Halo " is something that people can easily identify with . The late ' 70s to late ' 90s had Luke Skywalker and the alpha male heroes of " Star Wars . " The Generation X , Y and Z now have an alpha male hero of their own in the Master Chief that they can relate to , or use to associate different attitudes and help instill values of patriotism . In this case , patriotism is not for just a country , but an entire planet and species . I am a very patriotic person , a veteran and a father and see the values that may hide below the surface in this Trilogy , which is why I ' m a " Halo " fan .
