I want my little girl to know she can do anything she sets her mind to . She can be herself , silly purse and all , and star in whatever version of life she desires . Kaia went to sleep last night clutching her American Girl doll tight , updo still in place , as I imagine Q did with her puppy purse . Both , I am sure , completely unaware of the storm brewing online in defense of little girls like them . In defense of their innocence . When our children take their turn in the spotlight , they have the right to leave it unscathed .
