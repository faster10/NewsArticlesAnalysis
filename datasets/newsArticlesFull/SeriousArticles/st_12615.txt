The most telling criticism of how the Martin case had been handled came from U . S . Rep . John Lewis , D Georgia , whose involvement in the civil rights movement goes back to the Freedom Rides of the early 1960s . Lewis compared the killing of Martin with the infamous 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi . Fourteen year old Till was beaten and then shot for whistling at a white woman , or according to other accounts , saying " bye , baby " to her . No one was ever punished for killing Till .
