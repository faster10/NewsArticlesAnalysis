Leaders of past climate summits tried to build top down climate agreements in which countries would agree to broad guidelines to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions . Treaties borne out of that approach ? like the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which required developed countries to commit to binding greenhouse gas reduction targets ? gave governments little flexibility in addressing climate change . Some countries , like the United States , opted not to participate in the agreement . Others , like Canada , ratified it , but ultimately ignored its provisions . Climate advocates set a 2009 conference in Denmark as an opportunity to achieve a comprehensive agreement that would actually lead to a reduction in emissions . But the conference was poorly organized and China and other countries refused to cooperate . In the end , the negotiations fell apart and the resulting Copenhagen Accord fell flat .
