Patrick Henningsen : I wouldn t be surprised actually because if you look back at history , especially regarding the Federal government and any sort if similar controversies , there have been many examples where federal agents have been trigger happy and people have died , unfortunately . And innocent people have died , too . So , history is not on the side of the Federal government in this case . But what we have in America , there s been almost a complete media blackout today on the mainstream media interestingly about this issue . And it might have something to do with what transpired yesterday . ?
