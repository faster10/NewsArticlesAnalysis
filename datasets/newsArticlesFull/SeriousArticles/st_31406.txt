Storm : I haven ' t really gone to the grill . It ' s the first time I ' ve been out there . I won ' t cook on that grill . Maybe that seems silly , and maybe that ' s just today , but it was . . . a terrible , traumatic , frightening event . And I don ' t want to be I don ' t like being afraid . I believe in tackling things you ' re afraid of . But I think it will be a very long time before I grill on that type of grill again . You know , I was in a hurry . That ' s when a lot of accidents happen . You ' re hurried , you ' re distracted , you ' re rushing , and that ' s a big personal lesson for me is , slow down .
