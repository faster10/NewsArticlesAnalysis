1 : 41 PM ET Investigators confirm a reality TV star they want to question in connection with the murder of swimsuit beauty Jasmine Fiore may be heading for the border . A car and empty boat trailer belonging to Ryan Jenkins was discovered at a marina in Washington State , a few miles from the Canadian border . Authorities say Jenkins most likely walked across the border to British Columbia . LAPD wants to question Jenkins as a person of interest in Fiore ' s death because he was one of the last people to see her , reported her missing hours before the model ' s body was found , then took off . Jenkins has a criminal domestic violence record and was best known for his appearance on VH1 ' s " Megan Wants a Millionaire " . In light of the investigation , VH1 has shut down airing any more new episodes . ( From Stacey Newman , Nancy Grace Producer )
