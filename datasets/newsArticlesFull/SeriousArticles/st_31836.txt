Harris : For me , writing books is about the progression of the characters as they change to meet circumstances on their way to the climax of the book . Games seem to have a more clearly cut goal and to require little change on the part of the character you ' re maneuvering through the stages of the game . Since I have discovered I ' m really linear , the one step forward , one step back structure of games was at first very frustrating you don ' t keep going forward but are having to go back to get this item or that item . Perhaps it ' s more like real life in that respect !
