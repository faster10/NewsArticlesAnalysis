It isn t just the shift in emphasis that I applaud , but the language itself . The extreme , pathological language that usually surrounds autism is almost totally absent from Clinton s proposal . The word epidemic doesn t even occur once . Disease only occurs in reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Oftentimes , autism is portrayed as a sort of tumor ? an unpleasant , discrete growth that can be separated from its host and destroyed . The thing is , autism doesn t work that way , and Clinton s proposal doesn t act like it does . She doesn t talk about combating autism . Instead , she provides concrete ways to improve the lives of autistic Americans . I am delighted .
