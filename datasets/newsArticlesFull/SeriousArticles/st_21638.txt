The northeast monsoon normally brings in copious amounts of rainfall in Rayalaseema , south coastal AP and Tamil Nadu . But this year it is rather more active thanks to the formation of a series of troughs and low pressure in the Bay of Bengal . Many places in Chittoor , Kadapa and Nellore districts recorded 200 mm of rainfall within a short span of time , leading to flooding of lowlying areas and bringing dry streams and rivers to life . Chittoor district received 158 per cent , Kadapa 131 per cent and Kurnool 203 per cent excess rainfall so far this season . Even Anantapur district , where desertification has already set in thanks to prolonged dry spells , has recorded 47 per cent excess rainfall so far this season . This is something unprecedented .
