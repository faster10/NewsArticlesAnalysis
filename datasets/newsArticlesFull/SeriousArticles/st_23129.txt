This battle is not over as many representatives of the G77 and China served notice there would be very contested negotiations in Paris to prevent a cover up masked as a coronation . And yet , many seasoned delegates from governments and NGOs told me they fear that President Obama will recreate his power play at the 2009 Copenhagen COP where he came in at the last minute and pushed through a draft agreement that undermined all the work that others had done and undermined what was left of the Kyoto agreements . In their view , President Obama shifted the burden from the U . S . and the E . U . to China and India .
