The first thing to keep in mind , and virtually everyone agrees about this , is that single payer healthcare would save a lot of money and resources that currently goes into administering the private health insurance system . Most of the time people view saving money and saving resources as a good thing , but if you own an insurance company or if you own a pharmaceutical company where you are charging monopolistic prices for things , saving money means lowering your income , ' said Gerald Friedman , Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst . Professor Friedman estimates a single payer healthcare system would save 600 billion in its first year alone . " I go out and people like me go around and say ' look at all the money we saved . ' But , if you want to understand the opposition to single payer healthcare , you have to understand that the money saved is 600 billion of income going to people , a lot of it is going to very rich people with a lot of friends and that is why a lot of misinformation goes out because people have a lot of interest and money riding on preventing single payer healthcare from becoming a reality .
