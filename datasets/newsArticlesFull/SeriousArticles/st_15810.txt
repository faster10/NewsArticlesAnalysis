A lot of people were surprised when the Fox Business moderators on Tuesday night s GOP debate failed to ask Marco Rubio a question about immigration . It s not as if the topic was off limits . ? The most contentious exchange of the night was between Donald Trump and John Kasich on the subject of mass deportation . Both Bush and Cruz jumped on the topic even though they weren t asked . Marco Rubio , however , played dead during the whole thing , obviously hoping that nobody would address him directly so he could avoid having to explain some horrible mistakes from a past life .
