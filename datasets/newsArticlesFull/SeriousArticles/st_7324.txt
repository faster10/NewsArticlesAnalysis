Support of Trump ' s statement , or that of any person who wants to stymie religious persons from citizenship or worship , should be viewed as an affront to religious freedom . Trump ostensibly has evangelical support throughout the country . If Christians genuinely care about the freedom of religion , they should champion the right of Muslims to freely worship throughout America . Any assault on the freedom for Muslims to worship according to their tradition is an assault on the freedom of religion itself .
