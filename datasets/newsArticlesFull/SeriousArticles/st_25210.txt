The first , called ? Mission Innovation , is a pact among 20 governments , including the United States , to double their spending on research and development of clean energy technologies by 2020 .

The United States alone will ramp up its annual spending from 5 billion to 10 billion . Also on board are China , India , Brazil , Indonesia , and Saudi Arabia , among others ? countries that have historically come into the climate talks with a very different agenda than their wealthier counterparts .
