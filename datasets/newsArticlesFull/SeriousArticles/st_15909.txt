It is the photographers that I keep thinking about as I have spent my own hours and days with the book . To be a Life staff photographer meant that you were among the best in the world . Professional news photographers , even the most highly regarded of them , find themselves in tenuous times today it is expensive to have them on staff and to send them places to do their work . There is always going to be someone with a camera around to snap a close to good enough image and sell it inexpensively or give it away .
