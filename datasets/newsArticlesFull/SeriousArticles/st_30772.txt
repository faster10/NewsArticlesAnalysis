It has become clear over time ? and was made abundantly clear in yesterday s hearing ? that the temporary consulate in Benghazi was not a very important outpost . It didn t even have the facilities to handle secret cables and you have to wonder if its very existence was a figleaf for the CIA annex across the street ? which may have been the real nexus of the Benghazi operation . If that s the case , the CIA had an equal , perhaps even greater , responsibility than State for the security of the compound . But David Petraeus , who was then Director of the CIA , hasn t been called by this sham committee . ( And it should be noted that CIA plays a far more risky game overseas than State does it often requires the subterfuge of innocence ? hence , less security ? for its facilities . )
