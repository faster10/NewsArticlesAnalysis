National Journal s Fournier : Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder conceded Monday that his administration s handling of the Flint water crisis is a stain on his legacy , reflects poorly on his leadership , and is aptly compared to President Bush s mishandling of Hurricane Katrina . It s a disaster , he said when asked about the comparison some critics have made to the 2005 natural disaster in New Orleans that became a symbol of government mismanagement ? city , state , and federal . It s clearly a negative on what we ve accomplished since I ve been governor .
