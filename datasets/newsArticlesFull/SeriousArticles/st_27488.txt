Of course , that does not change the fact that Clinton is facing real sexism , both from random Sanders fans on Twitter and from conservatives . What is so frustrating about the political discussion is that that ' s where it often stops , constantly lifting off from the concrete world of policy ? how would either candidate improve the lives of hard up Americans ? ? and into meta discussions about which conversations among media elites have sexist or classist undertones . From there , add some purely personal resentments , and you ' ve got a recipe for going around in an endless and unpleasant circle .
