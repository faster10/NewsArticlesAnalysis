In 2007 , I authored bipartisan legislation , along with Senators Richard Durbin , Richard Lugar , Joseph Biden , Dianne Feinstein and Kerry , that directed the intelligence community to perform a National Intelligence Estimate of the threats of climate change . When the chairman of the National Intelligence Council testified about their assessment in 2008 , he stated that climate change will have wide ranging implications for U . S . national security interests . Senator John Warner authored similar legislation at the time , which I supported , directing the Department of Defense to identify and act on the threats of climate change .
