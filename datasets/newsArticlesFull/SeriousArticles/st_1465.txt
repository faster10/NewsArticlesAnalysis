Whatever the fans took from another Golden State blowout , it ' s better than the speculation such play inspires . Will they win 72 ?

In increasing numbers , kids want to be like Steph . If the Warriors keep blitzing history in this fashion , those kids will , as adults , relate over how " amazing " this all was to witness .
