At first , I was surprised , then skeptical , but soon I saw the reasonableness of the conclusion . Mr Gore , at 67 , can still credibly run . He still has a household name , tremendous political and government experience including eight years as vice president , and he won the popular election in the 2000 presidential election by a half million votes . ( He was denied the presidency by a technicality , through the Electoral College . Anyone remember " hanging chads " ? ) Since then he has devoted himself to a number of important causes , mainly around climate change . Gore ' s 2006 film , An Inconvenient Truth , has arguably done more to galvanize action on the environment than anything since Rachel Carson ' s 1962 book , A Silent Spring . With the COP21 climate change agreement in Paris two weeks ago , the world is entering a new phase of concerted action , which Mr Gore understands better than any of the current candidates in either party .
