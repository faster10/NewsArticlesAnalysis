This " bump " can have a dramatic impact on the ranking of a class . For example , the gap between USC ( 3 . 57 stars per commit ) and Washington State ( 2 . 72 stars per commit ) should be significantly larger . The Trojans have just one three star " unrated " player on its commit list , while the Cougars have just one player ( out of 18 commits ) that carries a true national ranking of any kind . That isn ' t to say 17 of Washington State ' s commitments are no star recruits , it just means that the scouting talent gap between its 13 three star commits and USC ' s six is quite substantial . ?
