' The last couple of months have been the first time I ' ve started to worry about Test cricket , ' he said after Melbourne ' s last practice session ahead of Sunday ' s match . ' Kids have got no interest in Test cricket . Look at how they are filling these stadiums for Big Bash cricket . They are all kids and you speak to them at the end of a game and you say " would you come to a Test match ? " And they say " no " ! None of the kids want to block . They want to switch hit , they want to hit over extra cover , they want to slog a six first ball . It ' s sad but that ' s the way of the world . '
