CHRIS CHRISTIE BLAMES HIS SPOKESMAN FOR MISQUOTE ABOUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD . Denying that he ever donated money to Planned Parenthood , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie said Tuesday that he is certain that a quote of him saying he did donate to the group in 1994 is a misquote . Listen , this is a quote from 21 years ago . I m convinced it was a misquote , Christie told the Washington Post in an interview Tuesday . The only problem with Christie blaming the journalist for getting the story wrong is that the journalist to blame for the alleged misquote now works for him , ABC s JORDYN PHELPS notes . Brian Murray , who wrote the 1994 story while working as a journalist for the Star Ledger , now works as the governor s press spokesman . http : abcn . ws 1RKAvxP
