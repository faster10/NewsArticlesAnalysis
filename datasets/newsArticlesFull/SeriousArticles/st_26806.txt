Pittman : We ' re No . 1 in all media . Just our radio ( stations ) reach 239 million people a month . But when people call you an evil empire , what they ' re saying is , you ' re not doing anything new and exciting . And I think the opposite side of having a big platform to play with is you can do great stuff . We try to be very attuned to what ' s important to our listeners , and we have an obligation to help our listeners and help our communities . And we view part of our job is to connect the music to the fans . That ' s what radio does .
