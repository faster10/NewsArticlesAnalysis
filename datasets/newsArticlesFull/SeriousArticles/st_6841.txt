2 . Steelers at Bengals , Sunday , 1 : 00 , O U 49 . 5 : I expect the under in division games . Last time they played , Cincy won 16 10 , though that was the first game back for Ben Roethlisberger ( 34 ) . Pittsburgh scored 30 vs . the Browns a couple of weeks ago . Last year , the Steelers game in the division averaged just over 50 points as a total . So my suspicion in not confirmed at least in recent Pittsburgh history . Martavis Bryant ( 27 ) is a fascinating player who stretches for the football for a big man better than any receiver I can remember since Randy Moss . You have to worry about DeAngelo Williams ( 28 ) hitting a wall at age 32 and with already as many 20 carry games this year ( four ) as he had between 2009 and 2014 . I do not trust Jeremy Hill ( 16 ) if this game turns into a shootout , which has more of a Gio Bernard ( 17 ) feel to it . ?
