Maybe that s part of why I admire them . I am also not cool , and I also definitely care what people think . Since I spend time with many people who feel strongly about music ? people who are perfectly nice , I hasten to add ? I have long kept my Coldplay fandom quiet . But when we would discuss our favorite albums , I would feel as though I was living a lie as I avoided mentioning A Rush of Blood to the Head and Mylo Xyloto . In the weeks after a new Coldplay release , the dreaded question What are you listening to these days ? would send me into a panic . I would rush to think of a cooler band ? read : literally any other band ? to name drop . The issue has continued well into my adult life . First date ? Don t mention Coldplay . Moving in with new roommates ? Don t leave your iTunes on shuffle there is a very real risk of blasting Fix You . And while I plastered posters of most of my favorite musicians on my walls , the Parachutes era picture of Martin and company staring wistfully into the distance stayed at my parents house .
