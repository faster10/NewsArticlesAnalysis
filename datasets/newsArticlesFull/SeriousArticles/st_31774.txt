Politics and policy are connected : Too often these days , politics is a dirty word . Television shows like " Scandal , " " Homeland " and " House of Cards " all present politics as a power game replete with maneuvering and manipulation . ( Sometimes life actually imitates art . Last week the House of Representatives took a " House of Cards " style vote . When a bill looked like it was going to face defeat , the House Republicans pulled the bill from the floor and members went back to their offices , waiting to hear what would come next . While they waited , leaders from both parties sneakily brought the bill back to the floor for a quick vote . The bill passed as most members sat in their office having no idea what was taking place . )
