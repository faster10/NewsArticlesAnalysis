SANGER : Well , it ' s certainly more immediate in that the North Koreans have conducted three nuclear tests . They ' ve got the missile capability . We don ' t know that they have the ability to take a nuclear weapon and shrink it down and put it on a missile . We also haven ' t been able to confirm , although we ' ve all heard the same reports , that the Iranians were at the test the North Korean test . But even if they weren ' t at it and I suspect it probably would have been difficult for them to send some prominent Iranians there , even if they weren ' t at it , they look at the North Korean model , and what do they see ? We had a succession of presidents from George H . W . Bush through President Clinton and George Bush saying that they would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea . Well , after three tests , we ' ve tolerated a nuclear North Korea . The North Koreans have been quite successful in showing that they are just irrational enough that nobody wants to go deal with them while they ' ve got a nuclear weapon . And when they look out at the world , just as when the Iranians look out at the world , and they say , where are the places where the United States has participated in an invasion ? Well , in Iraq 10 years ago this week , a place that turned out not to have any nuclear weapons . And in Libya , a country that gave up its nuclear weapons and tried to have some kind of accommodation with the West . If you ' re Iranian , if you ' re North Korean , and you look at that , you say to yourself , giving up the weapons , even after all of these negotiations , may not be the best approach .
