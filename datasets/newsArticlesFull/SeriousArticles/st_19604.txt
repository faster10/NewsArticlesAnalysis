Currently , Curry averages a wisp under 30 points per game on 68 . 2 percent true shooting . For historical perspective , Michael Jordan ' s highest true shooting mark was 61 . 4 percent , back in 1989 . In short , Curry is scoring at Jordan ' s rate but far more efficiently . Keep in mind , the league average in true shooting was identical then to what it is now . You can quibble with why this is so and complain about how " soft " the modern NBA is , but you can ' t argue with the basic , crazy fact that Curry is scoring more efficiently than MJ ever did .
