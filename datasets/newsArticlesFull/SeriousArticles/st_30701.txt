The growth of the movement to fight back fossil fuel expansion is and has been astonishing to watch . In Australia , groups along the Reef have united to take fossil fuel companies to Court , the Lock the Gate movement has taken on the cashed up power of coal and gas violating our precious farmland and water resources , indigenous communities have fought back mining communities desecrating their sacred sites and individuals and institutions have moved hundreds of millions of their dollars out of fossil fuel investments . This movement will only continue to grow , creating an increasingly toxic atmosphere for any politician or investor planning to dig new coal or drill new gas out of the ground .
