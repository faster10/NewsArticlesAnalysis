If China and others are becoming weaker , they will take action to make their currencies weaker . And that ' s what ' s been happening during the last year as China has lost its growth stride . The goal : To have a cheap currency , so China ' s products are cheap in the world and knock out competitors ' products ? including those from the U . S . In the past year , as other countries have struggled with weak economies , their currencies have become weak ? a benefit to them as they sell globally . And the U . S . dollar , in turn , has become stronger . That ' s made U . S . products expensive in a global economy , and so potential buyers overseas have cut back on U . S . products and bought cheaper ones from other countries . Also , to compete , U . S . companies have had to cut prices , a move that might help attract customers but hurts profits .
