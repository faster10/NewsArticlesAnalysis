Unfortunately , Gareth Edwards ' " Godzilla " feels like two movies Scotch taped together . In one , Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who ' s racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies , Aaron Taylor Johnson is his estranged soldier son , and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind ' s hubris . In the other , mammoth CG beasts knock the snot out of one another . Only one of these movies is any good . Thankfully , it ' s the monster one .
