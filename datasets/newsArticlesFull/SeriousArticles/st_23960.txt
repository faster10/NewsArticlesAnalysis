Instead of judging the choices women make , we should rejoice in the fact that we have the ability to make these choices at all . I believe that true feminism does not lie in having to prove that we can be both doting mothers and high powered career professionals at the same time and do both 100 well 100 of the time . We can ' t . No one can . Anyone who says differently is lying or not facing reality . The beauty of what the feminist movement has brought today ' s women is that these choices are available to us .
