What s happened here is Mr Trump has made the mistake of believing his success was really about the voters making it about him , when it was the other way around . See , Mr Trump had all the same chutzpah and brashness when he was talking about China and trade policy , but almost nobody cared . It wasn t until he connected with the illegal immigration issue that then his alpha male personality became a hit on the campaign trail . Mr Trump , the ultimate 1 percenter , suddenly became a man of the people because he was willing to listen to everyday Americans fed up with the lawless , open borders scheming of their elites .
