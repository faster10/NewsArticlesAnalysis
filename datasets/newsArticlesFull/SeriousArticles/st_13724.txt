Numbers don t paint the complete picture with the 5 foot 11 inch , 198 pound Beckham , though . For someone with 150 career NFL catches , for 2 , 064 yards and 19 touchdowns , he s best known for a single grab nearly a year ago against the Cowboys , when he snared a deep ball from Eli Manning using only his right hand ? three fingers , really ? as it was sailing past him . Arm outstretched , Beckham was nearly completely horizontal when the ball hit his hand , pulling it back into his midsection as he fell into the end zone for a 43 yard touchdown .
