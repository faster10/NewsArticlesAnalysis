This entire fiasco reveals a couple of thing about American politics and the media today . First , it shows how childish the entire Republican field has become , and how tough questions are no longer permitted in GOP circles . It displays how easy Republicans really have it , when all a candidate has to do when confronted about his abysmal voting record or challenged with a question on his divisiveness is to shout that the liberal media is out to get him ( Hillary Clinton does not have this luxury when every other question is about her emails ? after all , the MSM is her super PAC ) .
