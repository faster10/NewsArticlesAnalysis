" This team is blessed , " Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett said . " I think this team has been through a lot of things and when you been through these situations you come out ahead . I think we got lucky today . . . . I think our defense is better than any over the past four years . We ' re better because the team has changed a lot but we are still succeeding . When you do that you are better because you have a lot of interchanging parts and people may be missing , but you can come out and play that kind of defense , it shows you are getting better and better .
