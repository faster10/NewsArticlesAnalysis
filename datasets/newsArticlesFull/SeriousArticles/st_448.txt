Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with . He is also , one of the loyalest and most supportive people I ve ever met in the film industry . He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post Potter People create perceptions of actors based on the parts they played so it might surprise some people to learn that contrary to some of the sterner ( or downright scary ) characters he played , Alan was extremely kind , generous , self deprecating and funny . And certain things obviously became even funnier when delivered in his unmistakable double bass .
