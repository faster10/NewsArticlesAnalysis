If Cook and the Michigan State offense can have success against Iowa s secondary and grab an early lead , the ? pressure will be on ? Beathard and an Iowa offense that lacks in big play scoring . It would also mean ? less pressure on the Spartans to have success on the ground against Iowa s run defense , which ranks second in the Big Ten ( 110 yards per game ) . Cook will no doubt look towards senior wide receiver ? Aaron Burbridge , who leads the conference in yards ( 1 , 158 ) , and has seven touchdowns .
