The selection committee jumped the Tar Heels from 14th to 10th , but that leaves little doubt that victories over two FCS schools ( North Carolina A T and Delaware ) are more of an albatross around North Carolina ' s neck than a loss to Texas is for Oklahoma . Ohio State isn ' t playing this week , and so the teams ranked behind them in most polls and I ' m specifically talking about Michigan State , Stanford , and North Carolina have an opportunity to rise in the polls where Ohio State does not . But Stanford has played a much tougher schedule than Ohio State and if they beat USC , they will also have a conference title . Everyone was waiting all year long for Ohio State to start to try , but maybe it ' s Michigan State that was just going through the motions for a long stretch against the Purdues and Rutgers of the world before flipping the switch . The Spartans only loss was the result of a blown call on a freak play in week 9 against a weak Nebraska team , and they can count victories over Oregon , Michigan and Ohio State as feathers in their war helmets .
