The country s changing demographics and the GOP stoking the resentment of white voters : ? This is the point that ? Paul Krugman makes in his column today : After GOP politicians have warned voters that President Obama is coming after their health care , that he s radically changing the America they know , and that he doesn t believe the country is exceptional , Trump has trumped this rhetoric . So along comes Donald Trump , saying bluntly the things establishment candidates try to convey in coded , deniable hints , and sounding as if he really means them . And he shoots to the top of the polls . Shocking , yes , but hardly surprising , Krugman writes . Remember , this country is gone through some dramatic cultural changes , and as we wrote just after the Supreme Court decision that legalized same sex marriage , don t be surprised if there is a cultural backlash of some sort . We got a taste of it in Houston last month , when the campaign on an equal rights ordinance got turned into a referendum on bathrooms .
