Bhutto was a legend and a role model for all men and women alike . She was inspirational not just to Pakistanis , but inspirational to us all through out the world . It is saddening ( with tears in my eyes and sorrow in my heart ) to see such a legend become a part of the blaze beset by the terrorists . Terrorists have no religion or political affiliations . They only have motives driven by greed and power . I certainly hope that the terrorist behind this are brought to justice and I am sure that General Musharraf will do his best to do so as he has always done in the interest of Pakistan .
