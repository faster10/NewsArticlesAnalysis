The two have known each other since the 10th grade , but never take each other for granted . They ' re warm , responsive , and fun loving , with lots of shared rituals and cutesy little private games . Out to dinner with their best friends ( Ari Graynor and Eric Christian Olsen ) , they talk about what they ' re going to order by lapsing into showbiz World War II Chuhmin accents ( clearly a favorite routine of theirs ) , which allows them to tweak each other ' s foibles like who ' s going to do more mooching off the other ' s plate while keeping the interaction light .
