S Landon Collins and Brandon Meriweather ? ? ? Wade wasn ' t the only one in the secondary to struggle . The Giants safeties were out of position with regularity throughout the contest , and Meriweather was close to invisible . He had one tackle in the contest . Collins , meanwhile , bit on the flea flicker touchdown to Willie Snead ? in the first half and struggled in coverage . And somebody ( either Collins or Meriweather ) badly blew a coverage on Marques Colston ' s touchdown too . The middle of the field was completely vacated on the play and nobody was within 15 yards of Colston . ?
