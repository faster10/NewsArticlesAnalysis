Huckabee got personal when asked whether social welfare programs in the United States were creating a culture of dependency . Having grown up poor , I know a little something about it , Huckabee , a former governor of Arkansas , said . Nobody who is poor wants to be . That ' s a nonsense statement . And I hear it all the time . Huckabee has made his opposition to cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits a major tenet of his campaign . Those are not entitlements , and that s not welfare , Huckabee said of social security and Medicare benefits . That ' s an earned benefit , and by gosh , you paid for it , and if the government screwed it up , you shouldn ' t have to pay the penalty because of an incompetent government .
