Further afield , there ' s the vast , but staid , Deutsches Museum on its own island in the middle of the River Iser , while to the west of the city is Olympic park . It ' s home to the Tollwood summer and winter festivals , but year round you can get a great view from the tower of the Olympic Stadium of the city and the former home to the city ' s two football clubs . The Allianz Arena , a huge swirl of a stadium that opened in 2005 , is now the home of Bayern and lowly 1860 Munich . Football fans can visit the stadium with daily tours .
