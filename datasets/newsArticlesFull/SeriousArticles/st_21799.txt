Like Christmas and the presidential campaign , the Oscar race a misnomer , suggesting speed goes on too damn long . This is true even in a year when the nominees are more exciting than usual , perhaps even justifying the oft made claim that the Academy has become younger and less stodgy . " American Hustle " is a comedy " Her " a delicate love story between a man and a computer program " The Wolf of Wall Street " raucous and controversial , " Nebraska " bleak . ( Of course , we have been shocked before . Remember " Midnight Cowboy . " )
