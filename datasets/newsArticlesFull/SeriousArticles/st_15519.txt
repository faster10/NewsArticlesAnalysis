My husband had left for work , and our 4 year old son began to cry with fright . I stumbled out of bed in my nightclothes to the family living area , terrified and confused . Two armed men were coming upstairs from our basement , having searched it without permission , and others were demanding that we tell them the location of my ex husband , with whom I had not lived for several years . As I had reported to the immigration service on my daughters ' citizenship applications , I had been remarried for four years .
