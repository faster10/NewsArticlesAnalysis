Once accepted into the flight program , a rigorous training period began . For primary training , Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio ( from the beginning ) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear , Arizona , near Phoenix . The training is geared toward a multi crew pilot license , or MPL , recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization . The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers . Countries that don ' t have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license .
