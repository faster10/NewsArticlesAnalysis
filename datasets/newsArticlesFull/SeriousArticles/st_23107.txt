Oklahoma City is one of five teams in the West along with the Warriors , Spurs , Clippers and Rockets that I think can win a championship . But I picked the Thunder to come out of the conference because I watched a healthy Kevin Durant show no signs in the preseason of lingering effects from the foot injury that cut last season short . This team has been expertly built by GM Sam Presti . The Thunder has a true post presence for the first time in the Durant Russell Westbrook in Enes Kanter and is two deep at virtually every position . Billy Donovan has looked comfortable on the sideline in the preseason and Durant ( for now ) seems to be handling what will be season long speculation about his future pretty well . I don t know if you can say this team is as talented as the 12 Finals team , but it is deeper and more experienced than that one , for sure .
