He continued to play at a high level through the 1970s , leading the NFL in passing in 1977 and helping Miami reach the playoffs in 1978 and 79 . But during the fifth game of the 80 season , after Griese had completed 21 0f 37 passes for 272 yards and two TDs against the Baltimore Colts , a hard tackle by Mike Ozdowski tore up his shoulder . The future Hall of Famer decided to call it a career at 35 and move to the broadcast booth .
