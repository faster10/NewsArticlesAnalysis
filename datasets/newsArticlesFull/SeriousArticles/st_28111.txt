Within seconds , within minutes of this attack , you had multiple left wing Democrats , whether they were senators or Hillary Clinton , out there talking about gun control as if somehow it would have done anything to prevent this attack , and there s no consequences for them having been wrong on it , Mr Rubio said . This is a terror attack , and these individuals were plotting to kill as many people as possible ? not just with guns , but with pipe bombs ? and we need to understand this crisis for what it is . We are at war with radical jihadists .
