When I rode the No . 7 train to Citi Field last Sunday , I was one of the few women in a train car packed with Hasidic Jews . My knees were in full view , but I shielded my face behind a pair of shades and a copy of Christopher Hitchens ' atheist bible , " God Is Not Great , " held conspicuously aloft . Toward the end of our shared journey , when it had become clear that the only people left on the train were headed to the same event , I looked up from my book , removed the sunglasses and asked the men sitting across from me if they were there to protest the Internet or the abuse .
