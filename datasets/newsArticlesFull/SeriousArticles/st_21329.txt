One could point to instances in which TV was the harbinger of a more just , equal society . Star Trek featured a landmark interracial kiss between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols in the late 1960s on NBC primetime . Sitcoms like Family Matters , Martin and The Cosby Show transmitted black culture across the country , into the homes of people who might not have ever met a black family otherwise . But TV can also be used to reinforce stereotypes just as often . NBC s short lived sitcom Outsourced got nuked by critics for its reliance on cliched characterizations of Indian people working in a call center . And every time a person of color pops up on an otherwise white show to play a criminal or cannon fodder for the bad guy , it further cements the idea that brown and black people are crooks or extraneous .
