Before the start of the bottom of the fourth inning of tonight s World Series Game 1 , a rare electronics failure caused both the primary and backup generators inside the FOX Sports production compound to lose power . The issue was immediately addressed , although it resulted in the audience missing one at bat during the time needed to switch to carriage of Major League Baseball s international feed , powered by a different generator on site . The on field delay was due to replay capability being lost in both team s clubhouses . We apologize for the interruption in tonight s coverage and are working to ensure that the remainder of the World Series is broadcast without incident .
