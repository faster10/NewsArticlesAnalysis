The Hollywood Foreign Press Association , like the Globes themselves , is a total mess . Their official membership roster is listed at " about 90 " journalists , as if they couldn ' t be bothered to count how many people vote on the awards every year . And they can ' t even get the details of their flagship awards ceremony right . The website ' s trivia page says that the oldest male actor to win a Golden Globe was Henry Fonda , then 76 , for On Golden Pond in 1982 . That ' s totally wrong 82 year old Christopher Plummer is the oldest male actor to take home a Globe , for 2011 ' s Beginners .
