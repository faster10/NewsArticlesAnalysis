After Denney was denied the chance to donate , he asked some of his friends to help him demonstrate outside the blood drive . They produced signs to raise awareness about the ban and distributed educational material . They also escorted people to the drive , because they wanted people to continue to donate . " A lot of people in the Bible Belt assume you have AIDS if you are a gay man , " he said . " We wanted them to understand that is not the case . We are banned based on an outdated policy . When people questioned us , I told them about how I always heard that people who donate blood are heroes . Gay men want to be heroes , too . "
