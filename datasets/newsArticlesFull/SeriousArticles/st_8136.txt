For me , it was the euphoria of survival , of having Life that ultimately saved me from feeling hatred , bitterness or indeed to seek revenge for my loss . I was Alive and I was still " Gill " and yes , although there was a significant part of my body missing , somehow my understanding of life grew . It was witnessing and indeed being a recipient of the brilliance of humanity that also shaped my " new " life and there was no better sign of this absolute brilliance than in my hospital wristband . It chillingly read " One Unknown Estimated Female . " I remember vividly reading those words again and again and each time they revealed a deeper sense of humanity and what was important . That tag said to me that people actually put their own lives at risk in trying to save mine , trying to save as many as they could . To them , it didn ' t matter who I was , whether I had a religion , if I was rich or poor , if my skin was dark or fair , indeed if I was male or female all that mattered was that I was a precious human life .
