The event at Las Vegas Motor Speedway marked the end of our IndyCar season and was to have determined the season champion . As a side story , Dan was entered in the Go Daddy 5 million challenge , which if he could win the race from starting last could have won 2 . 5 million for him and 2 . 5 million for a fan . It was a challenge that garnered much media attention , and Dan had spent the past month or so heavily promoting the event and describing how excited he was to take part in this challenge .
