Refusing to accept our nation s original sin , African Americans bound by the chains of slavery broke free and headed north , and many others who knew slavery was antithetical to our country s conception of human rights and dignity fought to bring their moral imagination to life . When Jim Crow mocked the advances made by the 13th Amendment , a new generation of men and women galvanized and organized with the same force of faith as their enslaved ancestors . Our Nation s young people still echo the call for equality , bringing attention to disparities that continue to plague our society in ways that mirror the non violent tactics of the civil rights movement while adapting to modern times . Let us also not forget those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could make our voices heard by exercising our right to vote . Even in the face of legal challenges , every eligible voter should not take for granted what is our right to shape our democracy .
