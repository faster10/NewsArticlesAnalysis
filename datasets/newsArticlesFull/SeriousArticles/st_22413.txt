These results were presented at the recent NASA International Astrobiology Science Conference . The scientists will continue to study new generations , waiting to see if the protein will follow its historical path or whether it will adopt via a novel path altogether . ' We think that this process will allow us to address several longstanding questions in evolutionary and molecular biology , ' said Ka ar .
