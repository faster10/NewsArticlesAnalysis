The ugly beast of race baiting and power hoarding will not easily die , at least not without a vitriolic fight . In the not so distant future , we can expect that diverse whites and reverse whites will be at odds . Gracists must be present to step into the divide and integrate them both . Reverse whites who want to go back to the way things were will still write letters applauding fear mongering . White interest groups may subversively advocate for sustaining institutional structures that perpetuate inequality . The fear of loss of racial dominance may give birth to a growing number of whites feeling cultural disequilibrium . But diversity is here to stay .
