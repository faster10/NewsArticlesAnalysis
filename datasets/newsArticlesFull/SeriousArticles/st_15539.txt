Smith has only been in three playoff games , however , tossing a total of 114 passes over two games with the San Francisco 49ers in 2011 and one game with the Chiefs in 2013 . Evidently , that s not enough to qualify for the list of top playoff QBs in the history of the league . Yet Smith s 108 . 6 QB rating in those three games tops Starr ( 104 . 8 ) , Warner ( 102 . 8 ) , Rodgers ( 101 . 0 ) , Brees ( 100 . 7 ) , Wilson ( 97 . 8 ) ? and Montana ( 95 . 6 ) ? all quarterbacks that led their teams to at least one Super Bowl title during their careers .
