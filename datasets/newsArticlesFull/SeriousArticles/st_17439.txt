Laura Keefner of Great Barrington , Massachusetts My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of 9 11 and their families and our country . That horrific day lives in my mind and I will never forget . A flag hangs outside my house every day , and I hope the rest of America displays the flag this day and every day . This is your country , and people flock here every day because of all the USA has to offer . I am proud to be an American and I wish the country could go back to the days after 9 11 when we were so united and proud of our country . Now there is so much bickering between political parties and the American people . God bless all the victims of 9 11 , all policemen , emergency workers , firefighters and our military . They are my true heroes .
