The everyone is more or less accepted line is almost as bad as the racist to whites bit . Sure , in ? professional acting circles , overt racism is probably hard to find . But that doesn t mean that actors of color ( okay , that term sounds bureaucratic but there s no better one ) don t face special difficulties . Young aspiring actors of color are more likely to come from neighborhoods with public schools that have cut ? arts education , and ? less likely to be able to rely on a network of family and school friends already in the business . Professionals still face incredible barriers inside ? the film industry over the kinds of roles they are offered , or even allowed ? to audition for . Not to mention everyday racism ? when ? you try to hail a cab and fail , being ? respected by your ? peers doesn t help .
