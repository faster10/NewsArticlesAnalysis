Rivera had to wait a long time to become a head coach . During his years as a successful defensive coordinator in Chicago and San Diego , The Charlotte Observer recently reported that he interviewed for but did not get eight head coaching jobs . Offers instead went to others , including quick flameouts such as Cam Cameron in Miami , Scott Linehan in St . Louis and Bobby Petrino in Atlanta . Mike Tomlin and Mike McCarthy are the only two head coaches who beat out Rivera for a job offer and still hold that position .
