A consolation of sorts for Sharapova , but you suspect it won ' t mean that much . And a 180km h ace , followed by a punishing forehand shows she ' s in a hurry to wrap it up . 30 15 . A slightly longer rallly ends in Williams hitting it long , and Sharapova says ' come on ' ! A winner from the Russian draws a hege cheer from the crowd and suddenly it ' s 30 40 . She ' s still fighting . Williams makes it deuce , but then a powerful rally ends with a touch too much power from Williams , putting the ball long . Deuce again , though , and another break point is lost . Sharapova scampers across the court , but can only hit long . Williams has the chance to win the match , which she does cooly . A fine win from Williams .
