In what might have been one of the strangest plays this season , Cracraft got an almost assist when he received a pass from Falk but failed to control the ball completely , sending it flying near the goal line in the second overtime . Lewis , who was in the right place at the right time , grabbed the ball and found the end zone , giving the Cougars the go ahead score against Oregon . On the ensuing play the Ducks failed to score as Washington State ' s defense again showed how it ' s one of the most improved units in the Pac 12 , forcing Jeff Lockie to throw a Hail Mary from 4th and 9 at the 24 yard line . It was a huge win for Washington State , but any loss that Oregon got this season was one notch in Stanford s belt in returning to the title game .
