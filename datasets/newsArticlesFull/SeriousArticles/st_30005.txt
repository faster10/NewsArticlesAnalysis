It perhaps wasn t Kelly s best night on TV that s impossible to quantify but it was indisputably her finest . One observation has been made so often that it has maybe lost its true meaning or context , but even in 2016 , to be a woman on television remains a difficult and not unperilous proposition . Barbara Walters may have beaten the path , and knocked down anything or anyone who got in her way . But that doesn t mean the path was necessarily cleared for all those who came after . Kelly had to fight her own battle Thursday night . She did . And how . Maybe it was her best night after all too .
