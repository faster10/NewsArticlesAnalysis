The safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad . At his 2014 Independence Day speech , Modi remarked how the Indian people ' s heads " hang in shame " with each report of rape . The sad reality is that Modi will probably make the same comment at this year ' s speech . As I ' ve written previously , India has let its women down for centuries : They rank 134th in the world for economic opportunities , 126th for education and 141st for health . How can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power ?
