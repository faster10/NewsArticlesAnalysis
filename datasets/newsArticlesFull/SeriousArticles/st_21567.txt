Contrary to what you might have heard , there s no luck involved . The Dubs are destroying opponents by an average of 15 . 4 points per game , and 16 . 7 points per 100 possessions . They have the game s best shooter and player in Stephen Curry , its best offense , a top 5 defense , and the league s deepest roster . They ' ve uncorked a five man lineup Draymond Green , Harrison Barnes , Andre Iguodala , Klay Thompson and Curry that is basically unstoppable , posting a 69 . 9 net rating in 64 minutes . Surely , it ' s a small sample size , but that s still ridiculous .
