I was trying to describe them to somebody . It ' s kind of like there ' s the Marx Brothers and National Lampoon . . . this group chaos thing . It ' s pretty exciting to see that brand of anarchy and self expression adding up to so much . Jay Z , actually , was really interested in them . He said to me that he , you know , Roc Nation , wanted to sign them and they went down the road discussing it , but ultimately Odd Future didn ' t want to be signed . They wanted to be self reliant , self contained .
