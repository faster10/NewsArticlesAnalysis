Well , two months later , let ' s do the math : So far , Putin ' s Syrian adventure has resulted in a Russian civilian airliner carrying 224 people being blown up , apparently by pro Islamic State militants in Sinai . Turkey shot down a Russian bomber after it strayed into Turkish territory . And then Syrian rebels killed one of the pilots as he parachuted to earth and one of the Russian marines sent to rescue him . Many of the anti Assad rebels in that area are ethnic Turkmens , with strong cultural ties to Turkey Turkey was not amused by Putin bombing Turkmen villages inside Syria , because it weakens Turkey ' s ability to shape Syria ' s future .
