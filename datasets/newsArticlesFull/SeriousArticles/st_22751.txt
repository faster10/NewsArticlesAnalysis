One of the issues with the Dudley development is that it is an impediment to densification of that area , says Matt Bruenig , a researcher of poverty , inequality , and welfare systems and a former Boston resident . Lots of people would like to live in Boston and you have these big swaths of land in a prime part that just have single family homes . That doesn t solve the housing affordability problems in aggregate , it just moves it elsewhere in the city . There is a myopia in community land trust advocacy where they talk about how successful it is for the people it helps , but don t consider if that is at the expense of others .
