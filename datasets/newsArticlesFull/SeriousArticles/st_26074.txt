Matthews : When I was a kid growing up in New York , I was pretty unaware of racism . I think when we ' re young before we lose our innocence we ' re sort of unaware of the more flawed qualities of each other . And when I moved to South Africa and I spent my teen years there ( under apartheid ) , I became acutely aware of racism because it was institutionalized , even though I was on the favored side of the line . But when I moved back to America , I was suddenly so overwhelmed by how present ( it is ) .
