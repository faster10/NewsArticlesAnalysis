" The Dickey Wicker Amendment unambiguously prohibits the use of federal funds for all research in which a human embryo is destroyed , " said the ruling by Lamberth , who was nominated to the federal bench by then President Ronald Reagan in 1987 . " It is not limited to prohibit federal funding of only the ' piece of research ' in which an embryo is destroyed . Thus , if ESC embryonic stem cell research is research in which an embryo is destroyed , the guidelines , by funding ESC research , violate the Dickey Wicker Amendment . "
