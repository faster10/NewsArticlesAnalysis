For any given politician , the implications of these four reasons are straightforward . Overestimating the threat is better than underestimating it . Doing something about the threat is better than doing nothing . Doing something that is explicitly reactive is better than being proactive . ( If you ' re proactive and you ' re wrong , you ' ve wasted money . If you ' re proactive and you ' re right but no longer in power , whoever is in power is going to get the credit for what you did . ) Visible is better than invisible . Creating something new is better than fixing something old .
