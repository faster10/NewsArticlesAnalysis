No other country spends so much of its time choosing its top level political leadership . The British and the Australians usually get the job done in less than six weeks . The French , as a rule , take no more than three . Canada ' s longest campaign ever , in 1926 , lasted just 74 days . And no other people pour such vast buckets of money into their electioneering as the Americans some 6 billion in the current round . Perpetual presidential politicking is as American as apple pie and a darn sight more expensive .
