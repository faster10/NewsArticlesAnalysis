That won ' t be easy , though . That ' s in part because no insurance plan sticks around forever . Plans change from year to year , premiums change from year to year , coverage changes from year to year , and deductibles , copays , and co insurance change from year to year . They always have . It has never been the case that you could be guaranteed that your plan would exist as it does today for as long as you would like . I ' ve had plans I ' ve liked canceled many times in my 10 years working at my current job .
