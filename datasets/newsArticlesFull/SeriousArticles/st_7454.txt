Don ' t assume that friends and family will remember to avoid reaction causing foods after you ' ve told them about your child ' s allergy . They don ' t live with your child ' s food allergy every single day and aren ' t in the habit of checking every label every time . You may need to remind them every once in a while , and in the meantime , teach your child that when they ' re unsure about a food , they need to say , " No , thank you ! " until everyone is used to the food allergy diagnosis .
