Former Falcons coach Mike Smith , who interviewed Monday , would have been the do no harm choice . Everyone likes Mike Smith . He ' s well respected . He had great success in Atlanta , knows how to run a meeting room and hire a staff . Since he couldn ' t finish the job with the Falcons , he ' d likely have come with something to prove , which would have been a bonus . But a vote for Smith would have been a vote for comfortable competence . He was probably the least likely to turn this thing into a total mess .
