E . coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of people and animals , but some strains can cause illness and in some cases , death . Infections start when a person swallows tiny amounts of human or animal feces , often from swimming in a lake , petting an animal , or eating food prepared by people who did not wash their hands after using the restroom . The strain of the E . coli found in the Washington and Oregon cases is the most commonly associated with outbreaks in food . Many people affected with that strain , the Shiga toxin producing E . coli , may not seek health care , so the number of people made ill by the outbreak is likely more than identified .
