In 1979 , Arthur McDuffie , a black Marine Corps veteran and insurance salesman , was killed after a high speed chase . The police said he had died from the crash of his motorcycle . But the coroner discovered multiple blunt force wounds inconsistent with a crash . A police investigation found that the officers had pulled McDuffie from the bike , handcuffed him and took turns beating him with nightsticks and flashlights until he was motionless . The officers then gouged the road with tire tracks and drove over the motorcycle so that there would appear to have been a crash . The officers were acquitted . The verdict set off rioting in Miami in May 1980 that left 18 people dead and more than 1 , 000 arrested .
