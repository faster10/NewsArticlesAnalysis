This is an incredibly pleasurable scandal . First , it ' s a classic downfall story , replete with powerful warriors and vengeful females there ' s something satisfying about familiar myths like this playing out in actual life . This scandal also has so much narrative complexity : It ' s a cautionary tale about unintended consequences and people not foreseeing the effects of their actions ( Paula Broadwell ' s e mails , Jill Kelley contacting her FBI pal , not to mention the affair itself , though these days that ' s obviously not so newsworthy on its own ) .
