The government , led by a Shi ' ite Prime Minister , Haider al Abadi , has said Ramadi would be handed over to local police and a Sunni tribal force once it was secured , a measure aimed at winning over Sunnis to resist Islamic State . But questions still remained over just how much of Ramadi , which Iraqi forces were forced to abandon in May , was under government control and just what was left of the city for civilians to return to . This loss of Ramadi in May was a huge blow to the Iraqi forces . . .
