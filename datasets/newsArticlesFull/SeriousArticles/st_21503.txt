The situation is made worse by the nature of the Olympic sponsorship deals , which dictate the Games ' experience for children far beyond the Olympic Park . The exclusive rights that McDonald ' s , Coca Cola and Cadbury ' s have for branded food and soft drink products at the Games blocks brands and manufacturers which might offer healthier alternatives . Meanwhile , licensing agreements restrict the promotional use of the Olympic mascots Wenlock and Mandeville and thus access to their five 15 year old target audience to these same official sponsors . Hence all the food tie ins with the Olympic mascots are for chocolate and sweets .
