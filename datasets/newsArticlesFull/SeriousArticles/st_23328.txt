I can now report that Dan Brown has produced a silly , but interesting and provocative book , delving into biologist Paul Ehrlich ' s old " Population Bomb " ideas , synthetic biology , dual use research , human genome alteration and even hypothetical germ line mutation of people . Perhaps Brown has grown bored with only castigating Catholicism , for he now chucks his aspersions on science . Of course it ' s not realistic or accurate science , given the author ' s penchant for mixing Dante ' s 14th century poem " Inferno " with 21st century gene sequencing .
