Only thing bigger than a Bama fan s ego ? The team s mascot , Big Al the elephant . But let s take a look at that : No one knows why Bama s mascot is what it is . According to the school s athletics website , its origins are ? rooted in the gigantic size of the 1930 , 10 0 Tide team , but what does an elephant really have to do with Crimson Tide ? Not nearly enough to justify the time it took to research it . ( And don ' t give me " War Eagle " that ' s no mascot , but it is a more impressive story ? than the two I previously linked to . ) Listen , ' Bama , Stanford called , and it wanted its nonsensical mascot back .
