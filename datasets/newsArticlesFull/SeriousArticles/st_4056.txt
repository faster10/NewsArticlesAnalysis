Safe advice . GOP leaders are telling candidates not to criticize Trump in case he wins . It ' s the same approach the presidential candidates took when Trump entered the race , and it made them look weak against the alpha male Trump . If a candidate is running for the U . S . Senate , he should be all in . Fight for the seat like it is all you have and everything you want . Never hedge your bets . Go for the win because second place is a loser . Follow your conscious , not what the political establishment is telling you to do . That ' s what I would tell them .
