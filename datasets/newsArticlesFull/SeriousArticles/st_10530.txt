At present , the leadership of Palestine is pursuing a makeshift policy that circumvents the status quo . The Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , has said that Palestine has plans to join 63 international organisations and conventions . This it is now able to do , having , in 2012 , won recognition from the UN General Assembly ( UNGA ) as a non member observer state . Recently , it joined the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . This means that Palestine , if it chooses , can file charges for war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israel . ( They would take years before coming to trial . )
