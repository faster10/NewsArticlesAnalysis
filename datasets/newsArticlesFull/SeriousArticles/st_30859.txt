" St . Louis is a fabulous city in a fabulous state , and certainly they ' re an NFL city , it ' s just that Stan Kroenke is in an exceptional situation and he has great sports interests and great willingness to put serious resources toward his enthusiasm , " Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said . " Those are called angels in the NFL . He will be such a face of that franchise , and what he ' s done just by the sheer fact that he ' s willing to commit several billion , not just the cost of the stadium , but the cost of the whole development around it . And it ' s not on paper . It ' s not options . This is the real deal . That really ruled the day in the NFL , and it should rule the day . "
