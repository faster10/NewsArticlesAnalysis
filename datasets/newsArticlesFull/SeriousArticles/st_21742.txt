The prevailing conditions could lead to Delhi ' s very own " Great Smog " . The original Great Smog was the infamous air pollution that London experienced in December 1952 . Doctors in the capital are explaining the current fall in Delhi ' s air quality in terms of the British occurrence , warning that as then , a huge number of lives could be affected , especially of people who have pre existing respiratory conditions . The burning of crop stubble in the states neighbouring Delhi is producing an effect similar to the Great Smog ' s to add to the capital ' s vehicular pollution , explained Dr A B Dey , professor and head of geriatric medicine at AIIMS . He added , " It will turn acute if urgent measures are not taken . " Dey ' s caution cannot be taken lightly because an estimated 4 , 000 people succumbed to respiratory ailments exacerbated by the 1952 smog , which had also forced the English authorities to shut down industrial units and schools and to issue public advisories on places to avoid . While no such drastic action is being contemplated in Delhi , doctors admitted that patients are themselves preferring to stay indoors or leaving the city for a spell .
