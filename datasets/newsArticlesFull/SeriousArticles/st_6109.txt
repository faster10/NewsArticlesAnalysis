In the evening , when Henry climbs into his big brother ' s bed to cuddle and read before bedtime , I might ask him if he knows that he was born in that bed , his grandmother ' s bed and a bed that had welcomed two other generations of my family a century ago . And as my boys fall asleep , it ' s to the sound of my off key rendition of lullabies she made up and used to sing to me , songs I hadn ' t heard or thought of in years but which began to ring in my ears after her death . And of course we keep photos of her around the house her house , actually , since my brother and my family and I moved back in following her death .
