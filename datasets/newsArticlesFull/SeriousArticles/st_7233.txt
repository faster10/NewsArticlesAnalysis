Cardinals Panthers has the biggest game total of conference title week at 48 points , with host Carolina favored by three . The Panthers ' team total is 25 . 5 . . . . Cam Newton is on fire over his last ten games , going 195 of 302 passing ( 64 . 6 ) for 2 , 475 yards ( 8 . 20 YPA ) and a 25 : 2 TD to INT ratio with six additional rushing scores . Carolina is averaging 34 points per game during that stretch . The Panthers ' offense plays faster at home , where they haven ' t lost since November 16 of 2014 . Playoffs included , Carolina has won 12 straight games at Bank of America Stadium . Arizona plays aggressive , largely stingy defense , but the Panthers have consistently shown the ability to dominate the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball and their quarterback is playing at a career best clip . I like the Panthers to win this game with Cam as the offensive centerpiece . Under both James Bettcher and Todd Bowles , Arizona ' s man coverage defense has historically struggled versus dual threat quarterbacks . The Cardinals allowed the overall QB6 fantasy performance to Russell Wilson in Week 17 , and a top 12 finish to Wilson in Week 10 . In 2014 , Colin Kaepernick finished as the QB12 and QB4 in his two meetings with Arizona , while Wilson dropped QB9 and QB1 weeks on Bowles ' group . . . . The Cards have shown small sample run defense leakiness recently , yielding 310 yards on 61 carries ( 5 . 08 YPC ) to enemy backs in their last three games . Arizona coughed up big runs to Eddie Lacy in the Divisional Round and a 17 carry , 102 yard effort to Christine Michael in Week 17 . The Cardinals ' run defense backslide has coincided with year ending injuries to slot CB Tyrann Mathieu ( ACL ) , OLB Alex Okafor ( toe ) , and DE Cory Redding ( ankle ) . Jonathan Stewart hung a 24 123 1 rushing line on the Cardinals in last year ' s playoff date and is a good bet for 20 more workmanlike touches in this rematch .
