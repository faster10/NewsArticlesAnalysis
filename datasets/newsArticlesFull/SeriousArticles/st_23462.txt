This October , as we mark this important occasion , I am proud to launch the inaugural " The Kennedy Forum , " an annual event that will serve as a vehicle to honor President Kennedy ' s efforts , celebrate the progress made in the past half century , and rededicate the entire mental health community to further progress . We have to eradicate the stigma of mental illness once and for all , and treat mental illness equal to other physical illnesses , so that all Americans can lead dignified lives and share in the benefits of our society .
