There was quite a bit of marijuana news in the past week , beginning with Gallup announcing that support for outright legalization is now at 58 percent of all Americans the highest it has ever been . Pause , so you can make a " How high is it ? " type of joke . . . . Kidding aside , that ' s a pretty astounding amount of the country that wants our current marijuana laws to go the way of Prohibition . Sooner or later the politicians will notice this trend , and stop being weaselly about " supporting medical marijuana " and just come out for full legalization .
