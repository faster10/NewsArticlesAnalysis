It was a gutsy play , especially since a good throw would have ended the game . Hosmer had an interesting series . He made a critical error in Game 1 and another in the sixth inning on Sunday that led to a run his play in the field was very shaky for a two time defending Gold Glover . And yet , he redeemed himself in both games ( he had the game winning sac fly in the series opener ) , including a run scoring double to start the ninth inning madness . He only hit . 190 in the series ( three singles and the aforementioned double ) but drove in a team high six runs .
