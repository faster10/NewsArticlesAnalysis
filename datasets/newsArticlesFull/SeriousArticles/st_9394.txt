PRESIDENT OBAMA : Laughs . I do . And obviously , I spoke about this at the State of the Union . I am very proud of what we ' ve gotten done over these last seven years , and I am excited about what we can do this last year . A singular regret for me is the fact that our body politic has become more polarized , the language , the spirit has become meaner than when I came in . And , you know , some of it just has to do with some long term trends that have accelerated in terms of how the media has balkanized , gerrymandering , you know , super PACS . But my bet ? and I may end up being wrong about this ? my bet is that the candidate who can project hope still is the candidate who the American people , over the long term , will gravitate towards . And early on in these ? in a campaign season , defining yourself by what you ' re not is the fastest way to consolidate a base .
