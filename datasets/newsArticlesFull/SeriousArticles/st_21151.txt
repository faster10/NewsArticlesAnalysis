We refer to this as the world ' s first reality comic book , because it has real people , starting with me . But it ' s still very much a superhero story . Also , like " The Avengers , " we also have " The Titanic 10 . " This is 10 superheroes living in today ' s world , faced with the same problems that you and I are faced with , and suddenly something happens that has never happened before in any superhero story . I am incredibly proud of this and you ' ll be hearing a lot more , because it ' s the type of thing when people see it they ' ll say , " Of course , why didn ' t I think of that ! " If that doesn ' t whet your appetite , I quit !
