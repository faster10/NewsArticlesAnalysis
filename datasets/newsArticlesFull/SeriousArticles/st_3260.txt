In present usage , progressive is largely a synonym for liberal that came into use after Ronald Reagan and the wide belief that liberal was a dirty word . To that point , centrist Democrats like Bill Clinton adopted the term to distinguish themselves from the traditional left and appeal to middle class and suburban voters . But left and left liberal Democrats also embraced the term , so that by the George W . Bush administration , progressive largely meant a Democrat who wasn t tied to centrist and conservative wings of the party , and who held liberal views or a generally liberal voting record .
