The government has also come under criticism , mostly from abroad , for failing to stem violence against the Muslim Rohingya minority , who are also denied citizenship . Some Buddhist monks formed a group to channel the anti Muslim sentiment into a political force that has already successfully lobbied for laws restricting the Muslim community .

The party and its leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , have also disappointed admirers by failing to stand up for Muslims ' rights .
