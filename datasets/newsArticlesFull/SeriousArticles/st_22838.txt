The KC rotation is not a strength . It ' s not bad , necessarily , but as pennant winners go , it ' s not especially impressive . As well , the Mets have an impressive offense as presently constructed . Yoenis Cespedes joined them at the deadline , Conforto saw regular duty , David Wright and Travis d ' Arnaud returned from injury . As a result , the Mets had one of the best offenses in baseball down the stretch . Given all that , Kansas City ' s bullpen is probably going to be leaned on heavily . Yes , the Royals are down one Greg Holland , but the pen ' s still in fine shape . Wade Davis is in the first order of shutdown relievers , and Kelvin Herrera and Ryan Madson have been durable and effective setup men . None of them were used particularly heavily in the ALCS , so they could be primed for ramped up duty against the Mets .
