Today , North Korea s regime relies on a drip feed of Chinese aid . If Beijing were to sever this lifeline , then Kim s pretensions would be crushed like an irritating ant . When you measure North Korea against the main dimensions of national power , the comparison with an ant does not seem absurd . China s economy is more than 300 times bigger than North Korea s its population , meanwhile , is about 50 times greater . After seven decades of ruin at the hands of the Kim dynasty , North Korea s entire national output is less than ? 20 billion ( Dh107 . 1 billion ) or the budget of one middle sized Whitehall department . The spending plans of the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills in 2016 are worth almost as much as the North Korean economy .
