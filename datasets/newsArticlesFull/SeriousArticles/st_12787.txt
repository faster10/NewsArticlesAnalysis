Moreover , many scientists believe that runaway global warming could occur much more quickly , because the rising temperature caused by CO2 could release massive amounts of methane ( CH4 ) , which is , during its first 20 years , 86 times more powerful than CO2 . Warmer weather induces this release from carbon that has been stored in methane hydrates , in which enormous amounts of carbon four times as much as that emitted from fossil fuels since 1850 has been frozen in the Arctic ' s permafrost . And yet now the Arctic ' s temperature is warmer than it had been for 120 , 000 years in other words , more than 10 times longer than civilization has existed .
