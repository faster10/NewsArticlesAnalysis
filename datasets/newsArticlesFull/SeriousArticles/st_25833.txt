Until Trump began his accelerated rise , Walker and Rubio were leading this group , but both have fallen since . Walker , of course , has left the race , falling from 12 . 8 to 1 . 8 before departing , a drop of 86 , while Rubio ? who regained a lot of ground in September , but inched down this past month ? has fallen from 11 . 3 to 8 . 4 , a decline of only 26 ? which makes him hot stuff in the eyes of the pundit class . The contradictory combination of big donor money and rabble rousing little guy rhetoric defined Tea Party populism , but Trump has happily eaten it for lunch . There is no Ted Cruz strategy for softening the blow to be found here . Which is why the pundits are right for once ? it actually does make sense to talk about Rubio as an establishment candidate . For all his years of flirting with various outsider poses , there s just not a lot of traction for him there .
