The Supreme Court court accepted Kiobel v . Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations . The justices indicated in February that they might question not just the application of the statute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it applies to any human rights violations , even by individuals , that take place outside the United States . They ordered the case to be re argued on exactly that question .
