There s been even more bluster than usual from the Sanders campaign , this time in an effort to disqualify Hillary Clinton s historic victory in Monday night s Iowa caucus , the post opens . Disparaging good news for Hillary Clinton has become a pattern for the Sanders camp . If you support someone else ? You re dismissed as part of the establishment , unless of course they want to claim your support in ads anyways . If a process doesn t go their way ? It s invalid or flawed or they blame the Iowans who ran it . "
