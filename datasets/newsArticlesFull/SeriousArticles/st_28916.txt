For Carolina , they ' re as odd of a duck as you ' ll get in a present day defensive preparation week . Oddball motions , goofy formations , stretches of plodding play followed by some of the most explosive action you ' ll see in today ' s game . ? They test the patience of opposing defenses and adherence to the fundamentals of run fits in a defensive front as much any offense in the league . They lull you to sleep with piles of benign 3 yard runs until you slip . Then they swallow half the field in a single run .
