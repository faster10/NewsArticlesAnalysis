The Takeaway : Even with the improvement , trade will probably be a small negative for fourth quarter economic growth . Weak global demand and an appreciating U . S . dollar have combined to drive down exports , a scenario that s been playing out in the trade numbers for months . Imports are also beginning to soften , posting their third straight decline in November . While that s probably reflective of companies holding back on orders as they attempt to better align their inventories with sales , it may also indicate domestic demand more broadly is taking a step down . Several economists said the drag from net trade may be similar to that in the third quarter , when it shaved about 0 . 3 percentage point from growth .
