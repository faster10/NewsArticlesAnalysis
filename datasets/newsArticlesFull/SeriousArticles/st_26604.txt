The BJP s victory in the Lok Sabha election of 2014 was the result of a strategy that concentrated single mindedly on building up Narendra Modi as a national leader who could salvage India from what the media projected as the mess created by the Congress Party during the previous three or four years . That regime was marred by corruption scandals and a pervasive sense that Manmohan Singh had failed to rein in corrupt ministers and allies . Modi , by contrast , hero of hardline Hindu extremists , man with a vision for India s development ( and so on ) , could be packaged and sold to the Indian electorate in all of those multiple guises . And that is exactly what they did , sell Mr Modi to India , calling on vast resources to fight a campaign made up by a blitzkrieg of mammoth election rallies , huge sums paid to the media for coverage , publicity and news , the strong and visible backing of the country s best known industrial leaders , and massive grassroots mobilisation by RSS cadre . The message was simple : Congress was corrupt and couldn t be trusted in fact , Congress had misruled India for the past sixty plus years .
