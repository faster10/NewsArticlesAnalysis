Honestly though you can make a case for any of the 12 teams in the playoffs . The NFL is unique in that it is only sports league that delivers all of its games ? regular season and playoffs ? on free , over the air television , which the league noted at the end of a press release it issued this week . My postseason predictions , which will be posted shortly , have Cincinnati falling to the Steelers this weekend . So did the Broncos and Panthers . It will be a defensive battle for whoever the Panthers draw in the divisional and conference rounds , and if they can shutdown Cam Newton then its game over in my books . And they only won one before getting knocked out in the divisional round . We thought it was coming apart at the seams before the season even started with the Robert Griffin III fiasco . Baltimore in 2012 shows up , but well over half of their comparables lost the playoff opener .
