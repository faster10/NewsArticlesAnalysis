" I ' ve got this part down , " Bush said of the New Hampshire town hall circuit as his bus rolled to an event in the town of Raymond . " I feel comfortable in settings like that . Where it ' s give and take . Where there ' s questions asked . I could probably shorten my answers . I could be more concise . But the so called debate is more of a performance . It ' s not a debate like you answer questions . It gives you an opportunity to say whatever you want and I ' ve got to train myself to say what ' s on my mind and not just answer the questions . "
