The idea that the weapon matters emerges in studies of robberies and assaults . When committed with a gun , these crimes are far more likely to result in the victim ' s death than are similar violent crimes committed without a gun . For example , the likelihood that a victim will die when robbed by a firearm wielding attacker is three times as high as when the victim faces an attacker bearing a knife and 10 times as high as when the attacker has another type of weapon . For victims injured in an assault , the likelihood of death is also greater when a gun is involved , especially in cases of domestic violence .
