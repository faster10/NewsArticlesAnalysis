It s no secret that the tech industry is weighted wildly toward the white , male , straight , cisgender and privileged , and Zuckerberg in particular is aware of the urgent drumbeats in tech and business around improving diversity and changing the ratio ( see Facebook s 2015 diversity stats ) . Zuckerberg s COO Sheryl Sandberg s Lean In has been a major driver of this discussion , particularly with respect to gender equality . Chan and her husband will now both be in an amazing position to show leadership on making gender equality a reality in the tech sector and beyond . That is part of changing the world for your child as well .
