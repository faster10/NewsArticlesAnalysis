Dan Wetzel , Yahoo ! Sports : " This entire thing feels surreal , or as surreal as a Manning making a Super Bowl really can . This is Peyton ' s fourth , to go along with youngest brother Eli ' s two . Peyton is seeking to equal Eli . Many of those felt inevitable . This one is borrowed time and a borrowed dream and no one wants to miss out on a moment they weren ' t sure would come again . There was Peyton in the locker room with his own youngest son , Marshall , who was running around with a new box of Legos and then passing the time by drawing on the white board . Peyton would soon grab his hand and walk with him to the podium of a packed news conference , trying to share it with his boy . For so many years Manning would need to do everything for his team to win , play to near perfection . The playoffs were always a struggle . The Patriots were always a foil . Here in Denver though , where he landed four seasons ago after a neck injury that left many to wonder if he had anything left , he is just a piece to the puzzle . In some ways this victory over New England could be his most satisfying one yet . No , it ' s not as meaningful as winning a Super Bowl , but there is something about being the underdog , of beating the Patriots when he isn ' t at his best , of winning what is likely the last of he and Tom Brady ' s 17 meetings . The final tally would be Brady , 11 6 , but Manning would have won the last three in the AFC championship game , denying New England of three more Super Bowl appearances . "
