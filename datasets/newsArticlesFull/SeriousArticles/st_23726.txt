Lesbian , gay and bisexual youth experience significantly increased risk for suicide than their heterosexual peers . In fact , as cited by the Trevor Project , a nonprofit organization that provides LGBT youth with crisis intervention and suicide prevention services , LGB youth are four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to attempt suicide , and their attempts are four to six times more likely to result in injuries that require medical attention . Moreover , LGB youth from highly unsupportive families ( like the kinds that would be drawn to conversion therapy ) are more than eight times more likely to have attempted suicide as those from more accepting and supportive households .
