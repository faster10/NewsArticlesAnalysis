And then we all met together at the New Directors New Films film festival at MoMA ( New York ' s Museum of Modern Art ) last year . First time we were all together . So much around at that time because I had not been in the same room together with them since I walked out of the studio ( 13 years ago , recording the " Celebrity Skin " album ) . Nothing had changed in terms of waiting for Courtney , and that was the situation that night . Good to see everyone , good to stand together . Eric ( Erlandson ) and Courtney gifted us with the publishing of the music for the documentary we could not have made it without that music .
