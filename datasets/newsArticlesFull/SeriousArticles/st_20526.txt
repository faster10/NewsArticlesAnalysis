Seyfried , her doe eyes framed with a cute bob a la Anna Karina or even more apropos , Faye Dunaway in " Bonnie and Clyde , " does her level best with what she ' s given , but her " rich girl with a rebellious streak " isn ' t as well developed a character as it could be . It ' s never really clear if Sylvia ' s transition from slightly rebellious rich girl to full on criminal is due to her belief in Salas ' Robin Hood esque cause or to her having the hots for him . I suspect it ' s both , but the former aspect isn ' t really fleshed out .
