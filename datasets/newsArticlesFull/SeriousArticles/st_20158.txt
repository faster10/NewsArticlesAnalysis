Likewise , in the past divided government has not meant dysfunction . America accomplished the Marshall Plan and the National Highway System under divided government during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations . The achievements of the Reagan era came with liberal Democrat Tip O ' Neill at the helm of the House of Representatives . The two men disagreed deeply on political philosophy , but they had the capacity to disagree agreeably , sit together and tell stories at the end of the day . ( And not incidentally , Reagan and O ' Neill were able to form a bipartisan commission to help fix social security in the 1980s by requiring both parties to jump in together ) . Even Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike , achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus .
