Martin Scorsese ' s The Wolf of Wall Street takes a decent bite out of the box office with 13 . 4 million , bringing the total for Martin Scorsese ' s coke fueled tale of stock pushing sybarites to 63 . 3 million . There ' s a very good chance Marty ' s latest will surpass Hugo ' s disappointing total domestic take of 73 . 9 million , showing Americans prefer their Scorsese to be decidedly un family friendly . Meanwhile , David O . Russell ' s American Hustle , which features more than a wink to Marty ' s signature aesthetic , is nipping at The Wolf ' s back paws . It rounds out the list with 13 . 2 million , as Sony ' s critically acclaimed ensemble dissembles its way to 88 . 7 million .
