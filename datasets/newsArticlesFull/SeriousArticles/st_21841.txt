The Panthers ' Super Bowl hopes start with the league ' s front runner to win Most Valuable Player honors . Already a prolific runner in his first four NFL seasons , Newton came into his own as a passer this year despite losing his top target from a year ago ( wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin ) to a season ending knee injury last August during training camp . Newton posted career highs in quarterback rating ( 99 . 4 ) and touchdowns ( 35 ) while reducing his interceptions to a career low 10 . He also matured as a team leader and helped carry the Panthers to an NFL best 14 0 record before Carolina suffered its first loss .
