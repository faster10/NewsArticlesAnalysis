The Jets certainly will double cover Beckham at times , but Bowles said it isn ' t possible to double cover him the entire game . They will no doubt play some zone defense , as well . But in those times when Beckham gets single coverage , who will draw the assignment ? It could be No . 2 cornerback Antonio Cromartie , or perhaps slot corner Buster Skrine , who Bowles said could be moved to the outside . Or the Jets could turn to Darrin Walls , who took over for Williams against Miami , or possibly former No . 1 pick Dee Milliner ( though Milliner has yet to play a single defensive snap this season ) .
