The Redskins tackling issues seemed like a week to week problem but after 11 games , it is more of a season long hinderance . For the fifth time in six weeks , the Redskins have allowed an opposing rusher to gain more than 100 yards . Jonathan Stewart rushed for 102 on Sunday and the Panthers finished with 142 yards as a team . They ve allowed 1 , 048 rushing yards in the last six games ? a stunning average of 174 . 6 per game . The Redskins corrected one issue in that they didn t give up the explosive play . The Panthers longest run was for 15 yards . However , the Redskins constantly allowed Stewart to get chunk yards right through the gut of the defense . Tackles were often missed at the line of scrimmage or a few yards away . On one play to the outside , Stewart slipped away from defensive end Ricky Jean Francois , cornerback Chris Culliver and safety Jeron Johnson en route to a nine yard gain . It s hard to stop anybody when a defense allows that to happen .
