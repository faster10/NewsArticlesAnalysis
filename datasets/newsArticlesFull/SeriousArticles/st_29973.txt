What does the Paris attack tell us about ISIS ? ISIS captured the world s attention when it surged across Iraq from Syria in 2014 , capturing large parts of the country . But in its various incarnations ( al Qaida in Iraq , the Islamic State of Iraq , the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , and so on ) it has been around since 2004 , if not before . For more than a decade it has focused first and foremost on its immediate theater of operations , waging a guerrilla and at times conventional war against the Iraqi and Syrian governments , the moderate Syrian opposition , local Kurdish groups , and in particular local Muslims whom it deemed enemies , whether they were religious minorities or individuals suspected of collaborating with enemy governments . Shia Muslims were particularly hated , and Syrian President Bashar Assad s allies like the Lebanese Hezbollah and the Iranian government are constantly vilified . It often perpetrated terrorist attacks , but these were usually in the context of the broader war , such as attacking police stations . It also launched attacks on Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and other neighboring states to punish them for backing ISIS s enemies and to excite potential supporters attracted to the group s sectarian and jihadist messages . Although rhetoric against the West was often bloodcurdling , in practice ISIS confined itself to trying to incite so called Lone Wolves while focusing its resources elsewhere .
