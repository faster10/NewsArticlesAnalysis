The doc will tell the story of the Nirvana singer's life using home movies, artwork, photography, journals, demos, personal archives, family archives and songbooks. The film features dozens of Nirvana songs and performances as well as previously unheard Cobain originals."I started work on this project eight years ago," said director Brett Morgen ("The Kid Stays in the Picture"). "Like most people, when I started, I figured there would be limited amounts of fresh material to unearth. However, once I stepped into Kurt's archive, I discovered over 200 hours of unreleased music and audio, a vast array of art projects (oil paintings, sculptures), countless hours of never-before-seen home movies, and over 4000 pages of writings that together help paint an intimate portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself to the media."The documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.
