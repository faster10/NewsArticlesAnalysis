According to a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine , as many as 98 , 000 Americans were dying every year because of medical mistakes . Today , exact figures are hard to come by because states don ' t abide by the same reporting guidelines , and few cases gain as much attention as that of Rory Staunton , the 12 year old boy who died of septic shock this spring after being sent home from a New York hospital . But a reasonable estimate is that medical mistakes now kill around 200 , 000 Americans every year . That would make them one of the leading causes of death in the United States . Why have these mistakes been so hard to prevent ?
