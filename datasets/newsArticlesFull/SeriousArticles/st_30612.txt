The Royals are already carrying two backup outfielders in speedster Jarrod Dyson and Paulo Orlando . Gore , while he ' s been on the Royals ' postseason roster the past two years , has just six major plate appearances and has only been used in the postseason as a pinch runner . So the Royals do lose that second pinch running option behind Dyson , although Orlando and Mondesi both have plus speed as well . Mondesi is also a better candidate than Gore to be double switched into the game when the series shifts to New York .
