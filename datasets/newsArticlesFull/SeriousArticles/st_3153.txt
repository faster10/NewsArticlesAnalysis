NEW ORLEANS The New York Giants lost a game to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in which their quarterback , Eli Manning , threw six touchdown passes and no interceptions . A regulation game in which they had a positive turnover differential , committed half has many penalties as their opponent did and held a seven point lead in the final minute . It takes a special kind of defense to lose a game like that , but the Giants ' defense is riddled with holes and very often doesn ' t look as though it knows what it ' s supposed to do .
