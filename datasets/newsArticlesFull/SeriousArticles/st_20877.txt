Ten or fifteen years ago , the emphasis was on tech demos such as Honda ' s ASIMO robot being able to walking up stairs and on uneven surfaces . " There weren ' t necessarily well defined use case scenarios for those applications . It was focused on what ' s now technologically possible , not what ' s technologically meaningful , " he said . This year , the shift to what is meaningful will be especially pronounced at CES . It will be more apparent how technology fits into people ' s lives , for example the Mimo baby monitor , which senses babies ' movements and health and can report its findings to parents . A lot of this action is coming from startups there will be 500 of them from 29 countries at CES 2016 , up from about 375 last year .
