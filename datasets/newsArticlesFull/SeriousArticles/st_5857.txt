Many Facebook customers surely think of Facebook as a communications network , just like their telephone company . If one of those customers telephones a friend to say , " I really liked the new Batman movie , " that customer would likely assume that the information contained in the phone call is his or her personal business . That customer would probably think that the phone company is entitled to payment for carrying the message . That customer would also hold the view that the phone company was not entitled to eavesdrop upon the message and sell advertisers the information , " Jim or Julie liked the new Batman movie . "
