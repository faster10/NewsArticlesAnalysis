Casagrande : You can ' t swim away immediately because then you ' re acting like prey and they ' re like , oh , cool . That ' s something I ' m gonna eat . The best thing that I ' ve found to do sounds counterintuitive , but you swim right at them . You always keep eye contact , and you swim directly at the shark , and that seems to trigger a defense mechanism . Now they ' re like , wait a second , everything in the ocean swims away from me aside from orcas , which are known to occasionally kill white sharks . Everyone says punch a shark in the nose : the problem with that is that water refracts and magnifies things , so if you go to punch a shark in the nose and you think its nose is right here , it ' s not , it ' s back here , and as you follow through , your hand goes straight into its mouth . Their eyes and their gills are the most sensitive things . But the reality is , if you don ' t act like prey , they won ' t treat you like prey . You don ' t want to swim away while they ' re watching you . As they swim away , you swim away , and try to get back on the boat , open up a Red Bull , say , ' Oh , that was fun , ' and downplay it .
