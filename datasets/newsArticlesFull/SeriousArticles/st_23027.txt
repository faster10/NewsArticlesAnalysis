This is no metaphor . Moas was founded by the Catrambone clan in 2014 ? after Regina , her husband Chris , and her daughter Maria Luisa , decided to do something about the growing numbers of migrants dying as they tried to sail from Libya to Italy . Having made a small fortune in the insurance business , the Catrambones bought a boat , hired a crew , and set to work in the waters north of Libya . As European governments dithered over whether to continue with their rescue missions , and as record numbers of people drowned , the Catrambone family got on with the job of saving lives .
