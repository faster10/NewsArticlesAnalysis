Eleven years after Hewitt made his memorable run to the final , Nick Kyrgios has assumed the mantle as Australia s great men s title hope but he too hoped to see the veteran s 51st and possibly last match at Melbourne Park . Definitely . He s playing another Aussie . It s always going to be a little bit fun to watch , Kyrgios said . If I ve got time , I might duck out there and watch a little bit of it . Lleyton , it s his last ever tournament . He s going to be determined to give absolutely everything in the tank .
