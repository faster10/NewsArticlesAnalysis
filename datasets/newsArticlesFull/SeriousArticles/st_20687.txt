Probably the one certainty that you can take from Sunday night ' s ceremony came when Sylvester Stallone ' s name was read as the supporting actor winner . The standing ovation that followed felt real and heartfelt , not obligatory as many of these expressions of approval do . Quentin Tarantino could barely contain himself . Will Smith looked like he had won the Powerball jackpot . And if Stallone got the order of his thank you list backward ? go with the filmmaker responsible for putting you on the stage first , then family , then the agent ? the sight of him on stage packed a nostalgic thrill .
