The second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher ' s bra , which was cut from her body after her slaying . Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito ' s DNA is present on the metal clasp . The clasp was identified on an investigatory video on November 2 , 2007 , when Kercher ' s body was found . But the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated .
