Baker sells the idea by basically saying that corporations wouldn t be able to play the tax avoidance game ? there is no way for a corporation to escape its liability . The plan certainly raises other questions . It wouldn t , for instance , deal with one major reason for declining corporate tax revenues ? the rise of pass throughs , which don t face the double level of taxation that corporations do . Plus , good luck convincing Republicans to allow the government to be a major ( if nonvoting ) shareholder of American corporations . ( For whatever it s worth , Baker grapples with some of those questions on his Twitter feed : http : bit . ly 22YD3xG . )
