What ' s neat , even if you may dislike the Royals , is because we ' re here in this state , surely you know at least one person who ' s a Royals fan . It ' s neat when it ' s personal , and you know that a team ' s title provides unadulterated joy to someone you care about ? ? even if you don ' t care about their team . As St . Louisans , you know that feeling that they had this morning ? ? when you wake up the day after a World Series championship and it hits you , that wasn ' t a dream , this is real .
