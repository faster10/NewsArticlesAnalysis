Dec 31 , 2015 Arlington , TX , USA Michigan State Spartans wide receiver R . J . Shelton ( 12 ) is unable to make a catch while defended by Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Reggie Ragland ( 19 ) and defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick ( 29 ) during the second quarter in the 2015 CFP semifinal at the Cotton Bowl at AT T Stadium . We do have a couple of wrinkles in our plan of attack , but a lot of it is going to be what we ve done all season . We just kept winning games and were the last undefeated team left at the end , Jordan said .
