Captain Khan was killed just north of Baghdad on June 8 , 2004 . A car approached the gates of the base he was tasked with protecting . As soldiers under Khan ' s command prepared to inspect the vehicle , his father told us , Captain Khan screamed for his men to " hit the dirt " and walked towards it himself and demanded the driver stop . Inside the car were two suicide bombers and a large amount of explosives . As the car reached the gate , the bomb was detonated , killing Khan and wounding 10 U . S . soldiers . His father believes many more men might have died without Khan ' s warning . Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart , two of the military ' s highest honors .
