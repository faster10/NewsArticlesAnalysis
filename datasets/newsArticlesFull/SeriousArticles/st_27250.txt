Machu Picchu is open year round , but October to April is the rainy season , and therefore it has the fewest visitors . The inconvenience of rain is offset by the lack to tourists , and it is worth considering . Avoid holidays if you can , as Machu Picchu and everything surrounding it is packed . Once at Aguas Calientes ( hotel tip : check in at The Inkaterra ) , to avoid the crowds and witness one of the most spectacular sunrises in the world , take the first bus from Aguas Calientes , which leaves at 5 : 30 a . m . It ' s worth it .
