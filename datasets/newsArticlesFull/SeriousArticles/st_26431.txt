Speaking to TOI on the eve of Netaji ' s 119th birth anniversary , Netaji ' s grandnephews Chandra Bose and Abhijit Ray said they were certain that the files would prove the Taihoku air crash a lie and expose a continued attempt by successive Congress governments to distort history and suppress facts . " There has always been a belief that Netaji spread news on the air crash as a diversionary tactic to escape being captured by Allied forces . This will also bury the controversy over the ashes preserved at Renkoji temple , " said Ray . Bose added : " The Congress will find it difficult to explain its actions . It will become amply clear why it has been blocking the demand for declassification . The Narendra Modi government ' s decision to declassify the files marks a significant shift in the central government ' s policy towards Netaji and raises hopes of a complete unfolding of the mystery . But we don ' t expect the mystery to be solved on Saturday . "
