So with only the rarest exceptions , they don ' t do that . They nod knowingly at whatever you say , and promise they ' re going to get right on it . They say , " It ' s great to be back at the state fair ! " when they ' d actually rather be playing golf . When asked why they ' re running for some office , they don ' t say , " Because I think this would be an interesting job , and one day I ' d like to be president " instead , they go with , " Because I care so deeply about the future of our nation . " When a politician comes along who lets the mask slip now and then ? admitting that it ' s hard , or that she ' s tired , or that some parts of the job actually aren ' t much fun ? then we treat them like they ' re some kind of pathetic freak who shouldn ' t be let anywhere near the reins of power .
