ABOUT THE VIKINGS ( 11 5 ) : Minnesota fell into a 21 0 hole in last month ' s meeting and was forced to abandon the run , leaving NFL leading rusher Adrian Peterson grousing about his role after receiving only eight carries for 18 yards . Expect that number of rushing attempts to increase dramatically as the Vikings look to alleviate pressure on second year quarterback Teddy Bridgewater , who was sacked four times and held to 118 yards by the Seahawks . Minnesota ' s defense was ravaged by injury in the first meeting but has permitted only 43 points during the three game winning streak and allowed 18 . 9 points per contest .
