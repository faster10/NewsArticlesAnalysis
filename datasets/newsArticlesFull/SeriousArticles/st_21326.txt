Bain Capital is a private equity firm . It acts principally by forming investment partnerships such as Bain Capital Partners VI to buy and sell operating companies . When Bain was headed by Romney , it invested in numerous distressed companies and attempted to turn them around and then sell them at a profit . These deals were financed by highly leveraged junk bonds . Excessive leverage by investment banks and others led to the 2008 financial meltdown from which we have yet to recover , but many investors reaped large profits from these leveraged deals .
