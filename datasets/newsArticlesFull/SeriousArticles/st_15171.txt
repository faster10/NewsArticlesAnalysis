This is a franchise that seems separate from its stars . Chris Pine , who plays Captain Kirk , for example , has not proven to be a box office draw on his own . Again , this opening weekend isn ' t bad , but it ' s interesting to think about why it couldn ' t live up to early estimates especially considering the runaway success of " Iron Man 3 . " Perhaps four years is too big of a gap between films . There was a three year gap between " Iron Man 2 " and " Iron Man 3 , " but releasing " The Avengers " during the hiatus was likely important for keeping the character present .
