The too many candidates problem made both Republican debates prior to this one a drag to watch at times , especially compared to the livelier Democratic debate that had more discussion in no small part because five people are easier to manage than 10 . During the first two debates , the unwieldy number of people ? 10 in the main debate , 7 in the undercard debate ? was unavoidable . Low polling for candidates not named Donald Trump was the norm , and so the only way to be fair was to give everyone a shot at getting their voice heard .
