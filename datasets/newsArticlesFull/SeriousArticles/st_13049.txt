The reality is much tamer . Obama ' s modest steps , which the president detailed in a tearful speech Tuesday morning , will force nearly everyone engaged in selling firearms ? including online sellers and small scale vendors at gun shows ? to become licensed federal gun dealers . That in turn will require them to conduct background checks on their customers to ensure that they are not barred from buying firearms because of felony convictions , domestic violence issues , drug addiction or other factors that Congress has said make people ineligible to own a gun . Under Obama ' s executive orders , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives is finalizing new rules that would make it harder for people to avoid a background check by buying a gun in the name of a trust or corporation .
