ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : It may be physically and practically impossible to have a debate with Donald Trump that isn ' t about Donald Trump , and the likelihood of a Trump headline increases with the emergence of a new front running target . But the topics and timing of this debate could provide some interesting action a few feet away from center stage . In a debate focused on the economy , the three senators who will be on the main stage are fired up in opposition to a spending bill their GOP colleagues on Capitol Hill helped negotiate . Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz in particular seem primed for breakout moments . Meanwhile , things are heating up in the establishment lane , with Jeb Bush and John Kasich sharpening their focus and their language coming in to Boulder both have records to tout on the economy , too . The realization that Trump is vulnerable , with Ben Carson ' s support soft , could spark a new dynamic in the race . Who can be the most outsider of the alternatives to the pure outsiders ?
