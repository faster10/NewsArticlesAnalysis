This meeting of minds and convergence of interests is not good news for the future of Islam or the future of Western democracy or the future of the human species . Personally , I m not interested in the left liberal tendency to use this for partisan political purposes : There are more important things at stake here than winning the next election , and in any event this issue feels like a lose lose for everyone . It s definitely not good news for those who want to resist both militant Islam and right wing bigotry , as witness the political gymnastics performed in recent days by French President Fran ? ois Hollande and Hillary Clinton and even Bernie Sanders .
