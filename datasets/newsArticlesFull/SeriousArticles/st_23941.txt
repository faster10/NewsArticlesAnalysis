The majority of my friends are college educated , married with children and own their own homes with disposable income who would love to spend their dollars on a night out watching characters that tell stories they can relate to . The industry is mystified when a black movie that doesn ' t involve violence generates a huge profit . They ignore the fact that people of color are starving for more realistic portrayals of their lives and will come out in droves to see their beloved actors play full fledged , multi dimensional , flawed characters filled with internal challenges .
