In order to guarantee that this debate will be the thoroughly enjoyable experience for the candidates that we all want it to be , I plan to allow all 15 candidates to debate on the stage at the same time and not to cut off candidates if they exceed their time limits . I pledge to hold the overall debate length to 30 minutes , including opening and closing statements , in order to minimize time for gaffes and unscripted remarks . To avoid unhelpful reactions from the audience , I promise to have no audience . I will pipe in artificial applause of precisely the same pre agreed length and decibel level for all candidates after all answers .
