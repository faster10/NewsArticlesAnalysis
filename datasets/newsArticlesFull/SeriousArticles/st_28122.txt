In a news item published on July 14 , 2015 , in a German newspaper in English , The Local , in 2014 , 340 , 000 bikes were stolen in Germany . Under the title Bike theft spinning out of control across Germany , the same news item mentioned that around 23 , 000 more bikes were stolen in 2014 than in 2013 . Was this also done by foreigners ? These stolen bikes are resold and bought in Germany not by foreigners but by Germans themselves . Buying a stolen bike is a crime and the thief may spend up to 10 years in prison , in accordance with Section 243 of German Criminal Law . Even then the stealing and buying of such bicycles takes place . A German uses three locks ( one for the front tyre , one for the back tyre and one for the main frame of the bicycle ) to secure a bicycle and commonly takes the seat along with him or her . Despite that the bicycle is stolen . Such is the resilient habit of stealing in German society .
