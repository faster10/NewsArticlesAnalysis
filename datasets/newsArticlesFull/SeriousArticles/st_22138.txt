" I live in Camp Pendleton , CA . And as I was raking the volleyball court at the barracks I found a dead rabbit ( fully grown ) . As I continued raking I found a small hole with 4 tiny tiny rabbits in it . I grabbed a box put a few old shirts into it and picked up the bunnies . I researched how to raise them and what to feed them . I made a nice box for them to live in a and bottle fed them until I could wean them to eat the local foods . After a couple months I brought them to a wildlife rescue because they were starting to jump out of their box . It was a lot of hard work but I loved the bunnies . . . . "
