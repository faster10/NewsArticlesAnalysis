Weir remembers shows where he would see the guitars move like " snakes " and the musical notes were visible . He admits sometimes the band would have to " flee " when it all got to be too much . But when it came to the Deadheads who would later follow the iconic band around from show to show , Weir says he wasn ' t entirely comfortable with that .
