Atlanta could have tried to avoid the ice . If officials knew ice was coming ( and they should have , the weather forecasts were not highly guarded state secrets ) , they should have canceled schools and encouraged people to stay home . The risk is you cancel school and it only rains , or the storm changes course . Officials who cancel school , only to see the weather improve , look bad , are considered " fraidy cats , " will be mocked by talking heads and Monday morning quarterbacks , and more importantly will have a harder time making the right decision the next time .
