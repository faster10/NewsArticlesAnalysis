Paul ' s supporters may face their own temptation after this cycle as well . Having failed to generate as much excitement as previous Paulite runs , they may worry that they need to return to the more stern , radical , and abstract libertarianism of think tanks like the Mises Institute . Or perhaps they may just give up on practical electoral politics altogether , having concluded that the American people have been too corrupted for the cause of liberty . Or they may be tempted by more radical voices on the populist right . I believe each of these courses would be a mistake .
