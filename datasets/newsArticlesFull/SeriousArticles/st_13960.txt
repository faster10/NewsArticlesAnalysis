This might be the final game of Peyton Manning s career . When he shook hands with New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick , he said it might be his last rodeo , so if the Panthers beat the Broncos next weekend , it might send Manning out of the NFL with a loss . Cornerback Josh Norman said that he respects Manning completely , and if he intercepts a Manning pass in the Super Bowl , he will take the time to bow to the master . Panthers fullback Mike Tolbert put it best , saying , We don t really care if this is his last game , Tolbert said . He s played what ? 18 , 19 years ? He s had enough , you know what I m saying ? It s our turn .
