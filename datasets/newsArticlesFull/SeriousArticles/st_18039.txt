Yes , the Republicans party has moved far outside of the mainstream on many of these issues . For instance I am struck by the fact that almost every country in the world recognises climate change as a problem , that is it man made and we need to take action about it . India . . Russia , China every country . The Republican Party is the only party in the world , in a democratic system , that does think that climate change is a problem . Similarly , the idea of monitoring a particular religious group is not only abhorrent , but against the founding principles . Our country has always given refuge to people persecuted for their religious beliefs . So it is totally wrong to do that . So most Americans think is wrong . But as I said , Mr Trump may be speaking for a majority of the Republicans , but to be fair , not all Republicans believe in what he is saying .
