Trying to save the talks from collapse , Kerry tried to downplay Syrian fears by explaining himself saying that the cabinet of national unity , which he mentioned explicitly 3 4 times in his meeting with Hijab , rather than a TGB , needs to happen with mutual consent .

He also said that he didn t threaten to withdraw political and military support , but that he couldn t guarantee its continuation if the talks at Geneva were to fail .
