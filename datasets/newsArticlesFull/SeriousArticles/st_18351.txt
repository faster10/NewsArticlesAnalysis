SAUNDERS : I THINK IT ' S A COMBINATION OF TWO GREAT MODELS . PFIZER HAS VERY DEEP AND STRONG CAPABILITIES IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH , WE HAVE LIMITED CAPABILITY THERE ' S , SO WE TURNED TO AN OPEN SCIENCE MODEL . WE HAVE THIS PHILOSOPHY OF BEING HUMBLE ENOUGH TO REALIZE WE DON ' T HAVE THE BEST IDEAS , BUT BOLD ENOUGH TO ACT ON THEM . I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL SURVIVE AS A PART OF THE CULTURE AS WE MELD THESE CULTURES TOGETHER . HAVING A BUDGET OF 9 BILLION TO SPEND ON ADVANCING OUR PIPELINES , LOOKING FOR CURES AND TREATMENTS , I THINK THAT ' S REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT PATIENTS AND BUILD VERY STRONG CATEGORY AND THERAPEUTIC LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE ENTIRE RANGE OF OUR PORTFOLIO .
