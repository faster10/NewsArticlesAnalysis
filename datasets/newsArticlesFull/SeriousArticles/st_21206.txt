Referee Ed Guns Hochuli has been assigned this match . The Broncos have exceeded expectations in their games Hochuli s worked since 2008 ( 6 0 ) , and the Patriots are just 3 4 in Hochuli games since 2010 . Home teams have covered under Hochuli s oversight at a 71 percent clip ( higher than the league average ) ? and underdogs have covered at 59 percent when Hochuli s wearing the white cap . These readings reflect most recent sustained samples ( thanks , to Bet Labs Sports ) . All this may not bother New England , but it appears of legitimate historical interest .
