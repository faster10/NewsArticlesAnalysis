Remember that Cruz s Christianity is not the namby pamby Christ is Love kind , but a particularly militant strain of Baptism . Cruz has , thus , won the endorsement of Kansas based doomsday preacher Mike Bickle , founder of IHOP ( not that IHOP , the International House of Prayer ) . Bickle has declared Jews hellbound unless they convert to Christianity , called Adolf Hitler a de facto agent of the Lord , worries Oprah Winfrey might be the forerunner of the Antichrist , and assessed same sex marriage as rooted in the depths of hell . Bickle , not surprisingly , judges Cruz to be the one who who will first be faithful to honor God s Word and who will work to defend religious liberty .
