I wanted to have a slogan that addressed some of the particulars of that city council race . My opponent didn ' t have any experience with city issues . So I wanted to talk to the specifics of who my opponents were , and the needs of my constituents . So we developed the phrase " Flannigan Can Fix It , " which makes way more sense with the name Flannigan than it does with Jeb , frankly . I workshopped it with a friend of mine who does local TV and film work . And the video was one component of it . In the video you see all the hammer graphics . We went back and put the hammers on all of our road signs and yard signs and started integrating that , frankly , not unlike what Jeb Bush is doing , rolling the slogan out halfway through . Except when we were doing it , we weren ' t trailing in the polls .
