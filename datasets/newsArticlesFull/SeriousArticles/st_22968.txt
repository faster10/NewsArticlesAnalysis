WILL TONIGHT BE CARLY ' S MOMENT ? Will tonight ' s debate offer another breakout moment for Carly Fiorina ? Her strong performance in the two previous debates have helped catapult the former Hewlett Packard CEO from her status as a barely registering candidate to a viable contender for the Republican nomination , JORDYN PHELPS notes . But after a surge in the poll numbers following last month ' s debate , Fiorina ' s numbers have slipped from their initial post debate peak . As she walks on to the debate stage tonight , Fiorina is in need of another boost . Despite the high stakes of the debate for her candidacy , Fiorina isn ' t cramming last minute like a student for a big test . Instead , Fiorina ' s campaign press secretary says relaxation and focus are the keys to her prep at this point . " Carly has been preparing for the debate by doing what she has done before the other debates playing solitaire on her phone to stay relaxed and focused and having lunch with her husband , " campaign press secretary Anna Epstein told ABC News . The candidate also hosted a live Facebook Q A on Monday as part of her prep . " Actually answering questions from voters is one of the most important pieces of debate prep for us , " Epstein said .
