As a pilot , I m well aware of the ease with which positional errors can be made . Looking at the Turkish map , if the incursion took place , it was for a mere matter of seconds , and could easily have been the result of a very minor navigational error that in normal circumstances would make no difference whatsoever . I wish when I m flying my navigation was so accurate as to be within a mile or two of my intended waypoint it s very easy to stray a mile north or south of your intended track for a whole variety of reasons . The Turkish air force will be as aware of this as I am .
