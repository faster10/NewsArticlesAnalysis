What on earth persuaded Tony Blair to go to print with a piece in which he said there was no one quite like Bowie ? Of course , yes , in the manner of the modern world , he needed to interpose himself in someone else s story . Bowie was , according to the former First Lord of the Treasury , unfailingly polite when he went to Chequers for dinner , at which Blair was genuinely star struck . Alastair Campbell confirmed in a tweet that the only other time he d seen Blair so awed was when he met Barbra Streisand . ?
