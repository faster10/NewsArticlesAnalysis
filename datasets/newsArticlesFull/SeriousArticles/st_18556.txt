FROM THE IOWA CAUCUS BUREAU with ABC s JOSH HASKELL : When Donald Trump s helicopter flew over the Iowa State Fair back in August as other candidates like Hillary Clinton and Rick Santorum looked up in the sky , the billionaire businessman was letting everyone know his plans to run a campaign his way . Four days from the Iowa Caucuses and still the frontrunner , that philosophy couldn t be more accurate as Trump is holding his own campaign event in Des Moines tonight at the same time as the GOP debate he s skipping . Let them have their debate and see how they do with the ratings . I told them , give money to the wounded warriors , give money to the veterans , Trump said in Marshalltown Tuesday night . Even though Donald Trump won t be at the debate , he s sure to be a theme and it will be interesting to see whether this latest controversy impacts Iowan s opinions of him ? Trump s offended Iowans a few times on the campaign trail as of late telling them they aren t good at picking winners , but his popularity has remained steady in the state since before his visit to the fair last summer .
