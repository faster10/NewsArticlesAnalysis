Geography plays a major role in Dubai ' s rebound . The UAE ' s largest trading partners are China and India . Indians are the second largest investors in the all important property market ( behind Emiratis ) they flock here as the most convenient meeting point for far flung diaspora families . Like anyone else , they also enjoy functioning infrastructure hence the saying that Dubai is India ' s best run city . ( If only Dubai were still administered by the British Raj , when its currency was the rupee . )
