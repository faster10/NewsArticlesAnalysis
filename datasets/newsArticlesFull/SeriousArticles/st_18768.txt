Aleksandar Vucic : It is actually the third summit in a row that is taking place here in Belgrade and we are very satisfied because of that fact . I ' m really jubilant to see 16 prime ministers in our country , in Belgrade . It means that Belgrade once again became a very open , connected city . Many people from all over the world would associate Serbia with some past times , with the wars , and some terrible times not only for Serbia but for the whole region . I dare to say today that Serbia is renewing its energy , Serbia is once again a very open society and a very open place for all our guests .
