Let ' s match up Herman Cain vs Bob Dole . Like George H . W . Bush , Dole was a war hero , a member of the Kansas House of Representatives , elected to the U . S . House of Representatives , became a senator , was selected as a vice presidential running mate , and chaired the Republican National Committee . He later went on to serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Senate majority leader , and Senate minority leader . Herman can ' t even make an edible pizza . Republican or not you have to admit , that stuff was pretty bad .
