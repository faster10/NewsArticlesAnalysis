After almost two terms , there are many things that Obama could ? and should ? have done , but did not . Contrary to what many right wingers still ( incredibly ) believe , Obama was never a leftist or socialist or even democratic socialist , and since entering office in 2009 , he has governed like a centrist , preserving the status quo and keeping special interests relatively happy . ( Many forget that some of Obama s biggest contributors were Goldman Sachs , Microsoft , JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup . ) True , following ? two years of having majority control of both the Senate and House at the beginning of his term , Republicans have made governing increasingly difficult , and Obama would have no doubt accomplished more had he had support from Congress . But there is little reason to think that his administration would have been overwhelmingly ? progressive .
