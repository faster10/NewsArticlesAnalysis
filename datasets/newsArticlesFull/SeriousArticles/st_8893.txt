The Patriots answered all those injury questions on their first drive . Brady orchestrated an 11 play , 80 yard drive that was all passes . Brady , nursing an injured ankle , looked like his usual January self and favorite targets Julian Edelman ( foot ) and Rob Gronkowski ( knee , back ) showed no signs that they were dealing with injuries . Edelman had two catches on the drive and Gronkowski had three , including the 8 yard touchdown . Brady , playing in his record 30th postseason game , was 8 for 11 for 80 yards and the touchdown pass on the drive .
