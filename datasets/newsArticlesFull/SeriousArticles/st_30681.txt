When the grass roots campaign to elect him an all star captain began , Scott had a very un Trump response . He urged fans not to vote for him , saying there were more deserving players . His humility only inspired the fans to rally around him all the more . When it became clear he was going to win , Scott said he was pressured by the league to turn the honor down . In a moving article for the Players Tribune , Scott recalls : They didn t mince words ? This is not a game for you , John ? but I understood all the same . Honestly , on some level , I agreed . . . . One of the reasons I ve made it as long as I have in the league is because I specifically know I m not an All Star .
