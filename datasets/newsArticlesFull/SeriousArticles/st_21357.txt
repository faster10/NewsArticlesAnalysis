9to5Mac reports that Apple may be planning to offer additional in store repairs that go well beyond the iPhone 5 s screen . Note that my phone ' s glass was cracked , but the underlying area and componentry was unfazed . Had those parts been distressed , I assume my only option would have been full phone replacement . 9to5Mac ' s sources say Apple is rolling out " special machinery " to allow the stores to replace and calibrate the touchscreens on the iPhone 5s and 5c , and that the cost for such replacement would be 149 .
