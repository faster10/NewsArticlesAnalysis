TR : Clinton was on the board of Walmart for years . Walmart is the most notorious , anti labor , anti worker corporation in the US , the largest employer in the US , violently anti union . And Clinton was never against that agenda whatsoever . She did accept 600 , 000 in direct speaking fees from Goldman Sachs . And it is not even including the campaign contributions she received from Wall Street firms . You have to tag her for the fact that she supported NAFTA and the WTO , and the GATT and all these free trade agreements that were playing into the hands of transnational corporations . There is no doubt that she is a big corporatist . There s no doubt , Bernie Sanders has his faults particularly on foreign policy , militarism and imperialism , but Bernie Sanders is definitely not by American standards in hands of the corporations .
