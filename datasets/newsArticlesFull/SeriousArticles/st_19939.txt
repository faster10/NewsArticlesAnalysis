At the turn of the 20th century , Carnegie created a 10 million free pension fund to help professors retire . The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , which was set up to administer the fund , determined that only " full time " faculty would qualify for pensions , which they defined as teaching 12 " credit units , " with each unit equal to one hour of faculty student contact time per week , over a 15 week semester . While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload , the credit hour quickly morphed into much more . The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning , but the temptation of an easy to understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist . It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier .
