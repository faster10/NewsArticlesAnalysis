NBC s Meet the Press says the poll results for the two races are within a threshold known as the margin of error . Margin of error is an amount , or in this case a percentage , that is allowed for miscalculation or change of circumstances , which means that any of the primary races could go to one of the top contenders , especially in Iowa between Cruz and Trump and Clinton and Sanders . Unnamed sources ( take it for what it s worth ) tell Fox News the Federal Bureau of Investigation is considering whether the possible intermixing of Clinton Foundation work and her work as secretary of state might have violated anti corruption laws . Sanders is using the latest polling data to undercut Clinton s arguments on his lack of electability .
