This story is a classic example of the failure to reconcile different interests within a democratic society . Nobody involved was technically wrong . The secularist campaigners were right to say that the nativity displays should be open to everyone because they were on public land . Their Christian opponents were right to insist that anything erected to celebrate Christmas ought to give some priority to celebrating Christmas . And the council was right that , in the absence of consensus , it was better to allow no displays at all . The tragedy being that Gaylor ' s campaign ended up destroying a perfectly wonderful tradition in the name of fairness . And that hardly seems fair .
