So there we have it , here we are , the country is turned upside down . A defeat of the left compared with 2010 the improvement in the post bombings popularity of the president was not able to save it . A disappointment for the Republicans , despite the activism and the extreme speeches of a former president of the republic , which did not galvanize them . The environmentalists , symbolic of the extreme left , are lagging behind . And a fact from which we cannot escape much longer : how can a true democracy accept that it has a party supported by 30 percent of the electorate , and only two deputies in the National Assembly ? A harrowing revision is imposing itself on our representative system , and it isn ' t cause for celebration .
