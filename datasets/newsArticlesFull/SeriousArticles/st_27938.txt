The momentum that comes from an early victory is huge , and I believe that Bernie s campaign is in position to take advantage of that momentum . We have strong campaigns on the ground in Nevada and South Carolina , and we have been on radio in Nevada since November and on TV in Nevada since late December We have also been on radio in South Carolina since November . So I think we can compete and win in a number of states , like Massachusetts , Colorado , Minnesota and Vermont on March 1st and elsewhere as we move into big battlegrounds like Michigan , Illinois and Ohio .
