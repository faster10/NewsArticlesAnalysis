On a deeper level , though , Holt s rude treatment of O Malley is symbolic of the fundamentally distorted way we approach major political races today . It exposes the degree to which our political primaries have been rigged ? sometimes by design , sometimes by default ? to favor candidates whom political and media leaders decide in advance ought to be taken seriously . Even when voters rebel against this by supporting candidates who are despised by their own parties establishments ( Trump and Cruz among Republicans , Sanders among Democrats ) , they are still shackled by a horse race mentality which holds that only candidates who poll well and or are regarded as predetermined frontrunners ( Jeb Bush among Republicans , Clinton among Democrats ) should be taken seriously . As a result , it makes no difference whether a political party has more than a dozen candidates or only three ? if a candidate isn t generally regarded as having a realistic chance of winning , they aren t put in a position where they could reverse their fortunes , thereby rendering the prejudgment into a self fulfilling prophecy .
