Federer himself had a glorious 2015 . He didn ' t win any slams but he re won hearts that already belonged to him and wowed fans with quality tennis . He did defeat Djokovic at Cincinnati Masters , but Grand Slams are a different beast . And he came so close at his favourite surface , the Wimbledon . The manner in which he dispatched Murray in the semi final , gave people not just hope ( that ? ? ? s always there ) , but ( I daresay ) a belief that he could upset Djokovic . But that didn ' t happen .
