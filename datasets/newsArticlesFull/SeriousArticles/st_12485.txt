Spielberg : The 13th Amendment was critical to Lincoln , because he knew that if the war ended , this would never get through . The South couldn ' t live without slavery . They might cease hostilities , but Lincoln always believed that unless we abolish slavery before this war ends , the end of this war will just be a momentary pause between this war and the next war . So he knew he had to get this thing done , but he didn ' t have the votes . That ' s at the heart of our movie , this fight to get the votes , to do the right thing .
