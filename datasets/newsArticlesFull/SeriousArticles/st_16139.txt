Liz Cook of Plainville , Massachusetts One of our first " encounters " with Steve Irwin was through a Wiggles video that my children own . He had such an unusually bright spirit . We watched a special last night that included his trip to Belize and it was amazing to see how he fired my children ' s imagination and enthusiasm for the animals he encountered on his trip ! They could not believe he didn ' t take it personally when he was injured by the iguana he was chasing ! He is one of those rare souls that make it almost impossible to believe he is really gone . . . so vivid , so warm , so BIG in spirit . Our best to his family on this sad anniversary .
