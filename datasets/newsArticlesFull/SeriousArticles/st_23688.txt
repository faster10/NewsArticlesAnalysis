After a slow start , trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half , the Warriors made a run in the third to cut the lead to three after three quarters . Milwaukee , bringing high effort all night , leaned on Monroe and Michael Carter Williams ( 17 points , five assists ) late to extend its lead back to double digits . Stephen Curry struggled at times from the floor , shooting an uncharacteristic 2 ? 8 from three , and despite his fourth quarter efforts , Golden State could never claw all the way back .
