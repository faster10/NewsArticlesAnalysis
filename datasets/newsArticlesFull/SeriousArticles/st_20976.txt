Japan has a symbolic emperor and a parliament , and citizens do not directly elect their leader . There are no primaries party leaders choose candidates . Since the campaign season is so short , they often look for candidates who will have good name recognition . This is why the less powerful Upper House of the Diet often hosts a cast of minor celebrities including TV anchors , talk show commentators and even a handful of pro wrestlers . The most colorful of these was Atsushi Onita , who didn ' t shy from mentioning his signature " thunder fire powerbomb " move in the Diet .
