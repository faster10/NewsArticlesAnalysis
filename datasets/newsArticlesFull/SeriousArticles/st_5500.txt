SVdR : There is an international association called the Environmental Design Research Association which kind of grew out of POE . I started it together with this English woman called Clare Cooper Marcus who was teaching at Berkeley University of California . She did an evaluation of public housing projects . And at the same time a fellow called Oscar Newman wrote a book called " Defensible Space " , which was an attack on what was then the standard Corbu Le Corbusier , high rise public housing which turned out to actually dynamite a number of projects in this country in Chicago , St Louis .
