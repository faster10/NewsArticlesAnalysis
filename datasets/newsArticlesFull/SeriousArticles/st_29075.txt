Over 40 percent of new HIV infections in our country occur among black people , making them eight times more likely than white people to become infected . Rates are highest amongst young Black men who have sex with men , and transgender people of color . And yet , black individuals are disproportionately denied access to health care due to the refusal of 20 states to expand Medicaid eligibility , as part of the Affordable Care Act . This is health care that could test , treat and prevent HIV infection if only we valued enough the lives that are most hurt .
