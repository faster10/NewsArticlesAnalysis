The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana , South Africa , died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete armed workers striking for higher wages . The shootings came after deaths earlier in the week , including those of two police officers who were hacked to death . The violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the " Easterns " area of the Marikana mine . Tensions have been high in part because of the presence of competing trade unions , the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union ( AMCU ) and the National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) .
