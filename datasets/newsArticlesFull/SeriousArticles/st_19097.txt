One reason to panic : The Cowboys have just three days of prep work before playing the undefeated Carolina Panthers . It would be nice to have a full week to get ready for Cam Newton and a Panthers defense that entered today ranked No . 10 in the league . The Cowboys did not fare so well on Thanksgiving last year , losing 33 10 to the Philadelphia Eagles . Romo , who did not take a pain killing injection before that game , did not have a touchdown pass and was picked off twice . After a two month absence it will be interesting to see how Romo bounces back with two games in five days .
