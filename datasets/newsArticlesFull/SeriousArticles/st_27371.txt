Russian officials said the revelation that the aircraft broke up in midair did not necessarily mean a bomb had caused the tragedy . News agency Interfax reported that Russia s transport safety watchdog , Rostransnadzor , had ordered Kogalymavia to ground its fleet of Airbus A321s until the cause of the disaster had been established . An official from Kogalymavia said it was discussing the timing of the safety checks and would take its Airbus A321 planes out of active use one by one without disrupting its flight schedule .
