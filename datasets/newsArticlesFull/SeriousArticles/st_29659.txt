Despite the NLD ' s past electoral wins in 1988 and in the 2012 by election , Myanmar ' s political landscape has significantly changed , and the outcome of November 8 will not be solely based on the NLD ' s past track record . Aside from the possibility of electioneering by the ruling party , the NLD has lost some of its shine due to lack of transparency on policies , top down , hierarchical decision making that has stifled party members ' voices and the development of new leaders , and perceived silence on issues impacting Myanmar ' s ethnic and religious communities , particularly the country ' s Muslim population . Rising Buddhist nationalism and growing influence of ethnic based parties will impact their win as well .
