The first and most noteworthy change is a new rule stating that new members will be eligible to vote for nominees for a period of 10 years , after which their eligibility will be renewed as long as they have been active in movies during that time . After three 10 year terms ? or if they have been nominated for an Oscar ? members will receive lifetime voting rights . These criteria will be applied retroactively to current members going forward . If a member has not been active in movies in the past decade , he or she will transition to emeritus status and will no longer be eligible to vote for nominees .
