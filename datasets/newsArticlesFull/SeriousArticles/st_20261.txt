The State Department and White House insist that Kerry means nothing by his word choice . There is no change in our longstanding policy : we believe Assad has lost all legitimacy to rule and support a political transition that reflects the will of the Syrian people , says a senior Administration official .

Largely Sunni Syria has been oppressed by the Shia Assad family for more than 60 years . I hope that s what Kerry is signaling .
