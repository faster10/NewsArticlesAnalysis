This new James Bond adventure is slick , but rather dull and by the numbers . Teens ? and it s fine for most of them ? may be carried along by the sheer designer sleekness of it . The one new thing that works is the emergence of gadget genius Q ( Ben Whishaw ) as a bigger character . Only two scenes of violence push the PG 13 envelope , and the requisite sexual trysts are never explicit . In a prologue , Bond , a . k . a . 007 ( Daniel Craig ) , tracks and kills a bad guy in Mexico City . Cut to London , where his boss , M ( Ralph Fiennes ) , grounds him for going rogue and tells him that a new intelligence czar , C , plans to ashcan the double O licensed to kill program and join other intelligence agencies in a massive world surveillance cartel . This idea doesn t smell right to M or to Bond . With clues from the bad guy he killed in Mexico , Bond visits a dying villain from his past , tracks the man s daughter ? she falls for Bond , of course ? and uncovers a massive conspiracy , the brainchild of a smiley creep named Oberhauser ( Christoph Waltz ) .
