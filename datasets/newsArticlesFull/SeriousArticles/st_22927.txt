The Google issue , described by the shadow chancellor in the same edition ( These mate s rates from Osborne let Google off the hook ) , is the latest example of a stream of multinationals openly refusing to pay their due taxes , making a mockery of the democratically derived tax system . The other issue which refuses to lie down is TTIP , the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , by which a multinational could use its enormous wealth in the courts to batter down a state s imposition of tax , health and safety regulation and anti trust laws . This why John McDonnell s call for nation states to stand together is so apposite . As the EU is the largest trading bloc in the world , its seems obvious to insist to the present neoliberal administration in Brussels that the EU should itself take this stand against the multinationals . For that , Britain needs to be firmly in Europe and leading this battle , otherwise we face a future where democracy and nation states have disappeared and we are merely customers fought over by enormous corporations .
