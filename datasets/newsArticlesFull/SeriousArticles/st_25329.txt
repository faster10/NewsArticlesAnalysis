The 28 year old Murray had his share of distractions in Australia . His wife , Kim , is due to have their first child in February and stayed in Britain . Kim ' s father , Nigel Sears , traveled to Australia as coach for Ana Ivanovic , and had to be rushed to hospital by ambulance while Murray was on court in his third round match . Nigel Sears spent a night in a nearby hospital last weekend but was well enough to return home , which meant Murray could stay in Australia and try to refocus on winning the title .
