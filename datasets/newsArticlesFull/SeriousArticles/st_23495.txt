It was about 12 : 30 a . m . when Chris Rock stepped up to the podium to induct the Red Hot Chili Peppers . " A lot of people are upset that Axl didn ' t come tonight , " he said . " But let ' s face it . Even if he was coming tonight , he wouldn ' t be here by now . Where the f is Axl ? " He went on to explain that he first saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers when he tried to see Grandmaster Flash in Philadelphia , but walked into the wrong club . " My friends and I were like , ' What the f is this s ? There ' s a lot of white people in here , ' " Rock said . " They came out and I couldn ' t understand a f word they said , and they had socks on their d ! I had never been to a white show before , so I thought all white groups put socks on their d . Years later , they ' re one of the biggest groups in the world and getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . They have black ties on their d tonight . "
