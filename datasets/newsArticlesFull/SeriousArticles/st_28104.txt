First of all , let ' s realize that these countries haven ' t actually experienced democracy . They don ' t have the tradition which the central European countries had had at least a little of . That makes it harder . But of course it requires creation of a whole institutional system . Perhaps more important than whether we have a one or two chamber parliament , more important than the institutional aspect is the political culture a certain spirit of the institutions , I would say . That ' s a problem still until today , even here , even though it has been 20 years since our big political change .
