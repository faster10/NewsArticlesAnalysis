Ultimately , getting back to that Shane Rick dynamic that was evidenced in season one and two , Morgan ' s clearly embraced this humanist approach , and in the attack at Alexandria he really made some decisions that clearly have endangered the group , there ' s no doubt about it . Those Wolves that attacked Rick , would they have been there had Morgan not let them go ? Carol certainly wouldn ' t have let them go , she would ' ve straight up murdered them , and not even thought twice about it . I think to some degree Morgan ' s been there and back , so he ' s going through some of what Rick did , but we haven ' t seen the last of his evolution , for sure .
