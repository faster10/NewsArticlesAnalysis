It s worth dwelling a bit on that phrase during our lives , for with it , Zuckerberg and Chan place themselves at the forefront of an important development in the philanthropic sector : the Giving While Living movement . It s not exactly new : more than a century ago , in his Gospel of Wealth , the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie sought to steer millionaires away from the charitable bequest toward warm blooded inter vivos giving . Only in this way could they assume active stewardship over the disbursement of their fortunes , applying the knowledge , expertise and temperament that gained them their piles toward the difficult task of giving them away . This idea has once again come into vogue , but with a significant new twist . The tech and finance booms have allowed individuals to accumulate enormous sums of money at a startlingly young age . So there is even more giving and even more living to do than ever before .
