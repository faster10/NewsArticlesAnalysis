If our politicians won t come clean about the parlous juncture at which we find ourselves , we have to . ? We must regain confidence in , and appreciation for , our Enlightenment and Western values ? reason , equal rights for all ( regardless of race , gender , sexual orientation , or faith ) , and consensus based decisions and the rule of law established not by ancient texts , but by elected legislatures operating under the aegis of a secular constitution . ? The societies the West has built , ? as imperfect as they are , ? offer such grand prospects for human happiness and prosperity that they are drawing millions ? from less fortunate lands , millions who may have little understanding of what makes these societies work . ? We cannot betray those seekers of a better ( that is , more secular ) life among them , especially women and children , by jettisoning our values under pressure from accommodationists , who often attack straight thinkers as politically incorrect .
