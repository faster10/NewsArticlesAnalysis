When I heard last month that the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board , headquartered in Abuja , had indicated that it would be unable to issue certification for " Half of a Yellow Sun " in time for the film ' s release date , I naturally assumed , at first , that what we were faced with was nothing more sinister than another instance of the typical , if frustrating , culture of wilful incompetence that we ' d grappled with during the making of the film while shooting the film in Nigeria two years ago , there were times when we felt ensnared in impenetrable jungles of red tape , when we would be given the go head by one arm of the government only to find our path blocked by the other arm .
