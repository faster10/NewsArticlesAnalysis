I entered Gaza on November 5 to help an American delegation there until the morning of November 11 . My intention was to help the delegation and then have two full days with my family after the delegates left . But with tensions ratcheting up , my family in Gaza was fearful the Rafah crossing with Egypt would be closed and I would be stuck . To leave my extended family in such dangerous circumstances and return to my husband and three children in Canada was heartrending . But now it is worse . To see American made Israeli fighter jets pounding Gaza just days after my departure is agony .
