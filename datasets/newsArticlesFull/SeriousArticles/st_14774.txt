The climate talks , now in their 21st year , have a tradition of so called side events that take place in parallel to the official bureaucratic wrangling and give an opportunity for nongovernmental organizations , religious groups , universities , and small groups of countries to have access to the delegates and inform pressure the negotiations . The French government had previously designated a neutral area within the Le Bourget complex open to the general public called Climate Generations , which may now be closed . If that happens , it would severely limit the chances that delegates would be confronted by protesters , such as an activist blockade that had been in the works . It could also curtail some access to the talks by journalists . One journalist , with the South African Broadcasting Corporation , reported on Twitter that he , along with more than 1000 other journalists , was denied accreditation due to capacity concerns .
