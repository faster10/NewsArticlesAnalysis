In his forthcoming book Start up Rising , veteran tech entrepreneur Chris Schroeder points out that Dubai is effectively the commercial capital for companies looking to gain access to about 300 million Arab consumers . According to Standard Chartered Bank , the UAE itself has the highest rate of mobile penetration in the world , with 176 phones per 100 people . Smart phone penetration is expected to grow to 50 in Egypt in the next five years . Schroeder argues that Western VCs need to be greater risk takers , the way UAE based ones already are . Abraaj , the largest private equity fund in the Middle East , has investments in 43 countries from Peru to Pakistan . Only at conferences in Dubai does one find billboards advertising Pakistan as " vibrant , " and find investors talking about the " huge opportunities " there .
