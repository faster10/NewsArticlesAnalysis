When I was a senior in college , I was selected to be the executive officer and chief geologist of Crew 99 at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah . Much like the astronauts on the International Space Station learn to live and work in space , the Mars Society ' s MDRS outpost teaches us how to live , work and solve problems on Mars . My crew consisted of five other students from across the country and we lived at a Martian analogue station for two weeks . We learned how to conduct daily missions , maintain our habitat , take quick showers and utilize recycled water systems .
