Hill says his fearlessness in speaking out against white supremacy and the nation ' s neglect for black lives has been molded by the influential work of many black leaders but it is men like Malcolm X who inspire him most . " He brought me to God . He taught me that books could change , and save , my life . He modeled discipline like I ' d never seen before , " he said . Hill ' s unflinching commitment to making sure black lives matter is a mission he upholds every day and he says that if we are to achieve a better future , the movement must go on . " We must continue to organize , " he said . " We must continue to stretch our radical imaginations in ways that embolden us to resist the divisive forces of late capitalism , homophobia , patriarchy , ableism , and much more . I believe that we will win . " ?
