Out of the five films he has directed so far , not one single Hispanic actor was cast in a key role . Even the recent English language movies of our own Hispanic directors such as Alfonso Cuar n and Guillermo del Toro are scarce of Hispanic actors . Why is that ? The only answer I can gather is there are not enough bankable Hispanic thespians to choose from , to carry a movie across all cultural demographics . Why hasn ' t Michelle Rodriguez gotten her first lead role yet ? Will Gina Rodriguez be the next major Latina star since Jennifer Lopez ?
