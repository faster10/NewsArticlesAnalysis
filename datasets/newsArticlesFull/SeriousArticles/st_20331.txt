It ' s hard not to be envious of what the Golden State Warriors have going . They were dominant last season , kept most of their pieces from that title winning team , and have come back even more driven and overpowering this season . On top of all that talent and execution of their brilliant system on both sides of the ball , the Warriors don ' t seem to get injured anymore . While most teams fans pundits seem to make the excuse or observation that the Warriors don ' t have injuries , they just waltz right past the infirmary without any reason to stop off .
