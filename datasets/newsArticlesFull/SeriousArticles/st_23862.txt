In a statement released by London based attorneys , Maksim Bakiev said , " I have been forced into exile in fear for my life . The interim government in Kyrgyzstan accuses me of new crimes every day . The charges are bogus , to divert attention from their own crimes . They accuse me before there has been any opportunity for an investigation . Clearly they seek to try to make me a scapegoat for the chaos in the country . I view events in my homeland with horror and pray for an end to the violence . "
