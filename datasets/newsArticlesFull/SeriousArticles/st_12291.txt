DRINK AND EAT : Venice is known for its mouth watering food and elegant drinking establishments . Harry ' s Bar once a drinking hole for the likes of Ernest Hemingway and Charlie Chaplin remains a popular haunt for celebrities and the art crowd , as does the bar at the chic Bauer hotel , which becomes inundated at Biennale time . If you want to get away for an evening , a water taxi trip will take you to Burano and the restaurant Da Romano , one of Philippe Starck ' s favorites , and an excellent purveyor of delicious fresh seafood .
