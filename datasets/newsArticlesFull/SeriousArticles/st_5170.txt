Though Smart is out for this contest , the Celtics now have Amir Johnson to help clog the paint . Maybe they will get a sliver of ? D from former Warrior David Lee , who will be fired up to face off against his old team after being moved in a salary dump before the season . ? And there s a reason Jae Crowder received a five year deal after last season , with the C s hoping he can make life hard on players like Green . He ll have to be at the top of his game on both sides of the ball if the C s want a chance to claim a victory Friday night .
