Back when I was caught up in my own eating disorder as a teen , I used to stare at my thighs in the mirror , wishing they could be as thin as those of models in the pictures I tore out of magazines . There were no hashtags like thighgap , which have turned appearance related fixations into searchable universes with neverending streams of photos and " thinspirational " text . I wanted desperately to be liked , but there were no " likes " or " hearts " for me log on to watch and tally . The point is that the obsessions , compulsions and comparisons that drive eating disorders are nothing new . Social media have just amplified them . But it also has the potential to amplify solutions . We need to figure out how we can most effectively use it to promote media literacy , self acceptance , support , recovery and body image activism .
