Asked why they have not placed orders for flowers , sweets and firecrackers unlike 2010 assembly election when the party had an alliance with BJP , the JD ( U ) legislator said , " The situation was different that time . We placed orders on the day election concluded because there was wave in favour of JD ( U ) BJP alliance . Everyone , even a kid , knew that we will win and there was no confusion at all . This time situation is different and the result can swing either way . There is no need to waste money by placing order . "
