So Kenia found a landowner near where she lives who would allow her to experiment on a small , 100 square meter ( 1 , 100 square foot ) plot . The other farmers teased her when she transplanted her seedlings individually in rows , spaced farther apart , instead of in clumps of four or five , which would allow them to grow stronger roots and better resist pests and diseases . Several weeks later , a heavy rain flattened the rice growing near Kenia ' s plot , but hers survived . By the end of October , Kenia was expecting a strong harvest , and there is suddenly a lot of interest in SRI in her community . There is now a pilot project to teach 135 farmers the SRI system .
