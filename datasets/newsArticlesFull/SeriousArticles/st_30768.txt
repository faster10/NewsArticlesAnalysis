Grief doesn t confine itself to the space immediately following the event . It also doesn t , by the way , move in neat , linear stages . It zigzags all over the place . It punts you instantly back into your routines and obligations and at times makes you feel grateful they are there to distract you . And then , long after the casseroles have stopped appearing at your doorstep , it randomly kicks you in the stomach when you hear a snippet of a song or smell the whiff of a remembered fragrance .
