I had woken up as an undecided voter , and I would go to sleep as one , too , but in between , I saw that Clinton and Sanders are appealing to two diametrically opposed impulses in Democratic voters . Clinton s campaign is based on fear ? fear that Republicans will return to power and undo all the progress Obama has made since 2009 , just as they undid everything her husband achieved in the 1990s . Sanders , on the other hand , is running on hope ? hope for what he calls a political revolution that will take power out of the hands of billionaires and restore it to the middle class .
