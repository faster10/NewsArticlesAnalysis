KUHN : Well , basically , China is saying that it will not take any violation of its sovereignty lightly . It has a different interpretation of international law than the U . S . It does not welcome military ships close to its shoreline . It does welcome civilian ships . What the U . S . is trying to send is , first of all , a legal message that China s claims to waters around the islands are invalid and that U . S . military and civilian ships have a right to be there and also a political message . And that is that the U . S . intends to do what it has been doing since the end of World War II to maintain order in the Asian Pacific , including freedom of navigation in the area . And what will be interesting to see is if the U . S . goes on to conduct more similar operations but around islands that are claimed by other countries in the area , such as Vietnam and the Philippines .
