Fourth set : Djokovic 6 1 , 6 2 , 3 6 , 1 0 Federer ( denotes server ) : I believe that it s not actually raining yet in Melbourne , so Federer probably won t be happy about the tournament organisers taking the precautionary measure of closing the roof . Yet the delay seems to have disrupted Djokovic s rhythm once play is resumed and he s quickly down 0 30 on his serve . But Federer lets him off the hook with three careless returns , each of them finding the net . Who put that there , he wonders . Djokovic holds to 30 , without having to work too hard . That was sloppy from Federer and he may live to regret it .
