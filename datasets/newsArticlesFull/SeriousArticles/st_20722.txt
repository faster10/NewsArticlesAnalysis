The prime minister is vulnerable because he had previously talked as if he could deliver a brake which he could unilaterally pull on behalf of Blighty , whereas it is now plain that the rest of Europe will have a say on whether Britain faces a genuine emergency or not . So he has got a battle of spin on his hands . But even if he can prevail in that there are also deeper problems of principle with the Cameron plan on tax credits , which bode ill for Britain s future as an outward looking nation in Europe . For the whole idea that Britain s social security system has been overwhelmed by migration is built atop a one sided arithmetic which takes obsessive note of the tax credits that EU immigrants claim , but then disregards the substantial taxes they pay . It entirely ignores the reality that EU migrants are younger and healthier than the average adult , and therefore represent an important part of the solution to the deepest pressures on a welfare state in an ageing society . And it shows complete disdain for the real needs of successful integration .
