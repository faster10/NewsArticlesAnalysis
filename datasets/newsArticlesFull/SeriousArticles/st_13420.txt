Don t let his folksy charm fool you , Florida s head coach is up to something when he gets all self deprecating like he did on Sunday night when he said that the best thing that ever happened to Alabama s offense was him leaving for Colorado State . He s lying . McElwain is a heck of a coach . What he s doing is basically a rope a dope . He wants low expectations . He needs his team to feel like the underdog . It s easier that way . Besides , who knows better what Alabama is about to do than him ? For four years , he was Saban s offensive coordinator . With that kind of inside knowledge , he s a dangerous man , even if his offense isn t exactly filled with world beaters .
