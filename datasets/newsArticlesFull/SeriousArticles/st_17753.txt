No question the Big Ten has proved a deeper conference than most expected this season . Ohio State and Michigan State were expected to be very good , Wisconsin about where it is , but never would I have predicted seeing Iowa in the Top 10 , Michigan in the Top 15 and Northwestern in the Top 25 in November . The bottom tier of the conference ? Purdue , Maryland , Rutgers , Minnesota ? is most responsible for dragging down the conference s overall reputation , but have you seen this year s SEC East ? Not even the staunchest SEC apologist could argue that division is any better than the Big Ten West .
