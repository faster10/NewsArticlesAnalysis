Germany is still chugging along at a respectable growth rate of 1 . 3 , despite fears that it might be hit badly by the slowdown in China . Italy is showing some signs of life , with 0 . 9 growth forecast for this year , and 1 . 6 for 2016 , according to Istat , the national statistical agency . France was flat in the second quarter , but returned to growth in the third and should manage to expand . The Spanish recovery is sustaining itself , and Ireland is booming .
