GOP efforts to shame Trump into submission and preferably into leaving the race are ill conceived . As recent polling has suggested and as has been evident for months now Trump has his finger on the pulse of a broad swath of the GOP electorate , and those voters appear to be hunkering down in defense of their man . The less educated core of Trump voters today as has been true for decades resent being labeled as uneducated bigots , particularly by GOP establishment elites who for fifty years have leveraged their votes to achieve political success , but have offered little or nothing in return except for a stout defense of the second amendment and other social issues .
