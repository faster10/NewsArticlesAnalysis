Consider these additional points . Most Syrian refugees are fleeing not ISIS , but bombardment by the Assad regime ? that ISIS is striving to overthrow . A poll conducted a year ago ? found ? that 13 percent of Syrian refugees in the Middle East had a positive or somewhat positive opinion of ISIS . This should not be surprising . A renowned ? 2013 Pew Research Center survey ? that canvassed much of the Islamic world disclosed the extremely illiberal views ( on apostasy , women s rights and Sharia , among other things ) prevalent across the Middle East in particular it did not include Syria , of course , but there is no reason to believe that that country would have offered results much different from those of its neighbors .
