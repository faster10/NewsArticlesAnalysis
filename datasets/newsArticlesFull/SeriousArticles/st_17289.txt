My other concern about the Sanders campaign is that its focus on impossible goals might backfire . Effecting change is not about making really big promises and posturing about how you re more socialist than thou . It s about organizing , lobbying , working with others and , yes , compromising . It s about running for and winning offices on the local and state level . It s not a top down thing , but a bottom up process . I worry that even if Sanders wins the presidency , the cold reality that we re not getting single payer will disillusion all the people he s got worked up . If he wants a revolution , he might do better actually working with supporters on how to organize and effect change .
