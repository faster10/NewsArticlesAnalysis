" The Peanuts Movie is more of a string of small episodes than a cohesive plot , with some sections working far better than others . Charlie Brown toiling with a Tolstoi book report is a hoot , as is an extended sequence in which the whole school mistakenly thinks he ' s a genius . While Snoopy and his feathered friend Woodstock are adorable , the Walter Mitty esque action scenes in which the imaginative pooch pursues the mysterious Red Baron get tiresome with great speed . There is far too little of Lucy van Pelt as tyke psychiatrist for my taste , but I was heartened to hear that Peppermint Patty still calls Charlie Brown ' Chuck ' and Marcie still calls Peppermint Patty ' Sir ' .
