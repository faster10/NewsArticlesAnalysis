The problem is that this is true for ? everyone ? who dives into the scrum of policymaking . Sens . Ted ? Kennedy and Paul Wellstone were luminaries of the Democratic left , with long time liberal voting ? records . They also ? following the then consensus of the Democratic Party ? backed the crime bill , and Wellstone supported ? the Defense of Marriage Act . ? Under the Sanders rubric , they aren t progressives . But this kind of compromise is inevitable when you have attainable goals and voters with interests you have to satisfy if you want to keep or expand your influence and advance your priorities . The irony is that Sanders understands this , hence his position on guns ? a compromise meant to satisfy rural voters and give him space to pursue his ideological interests . ( On that note , Sanders also backed the crime bill ahead of a close election for his at large House seat . ) This isn t a knock against the senator , just a recognition that he , like Clinton , is a politician . And that he , like Clinton , will move and bend when necessary .
