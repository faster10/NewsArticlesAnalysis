In India , the government has already issued advisories asking people to avoid travelling to countries , where Zika cases have been reported . International airports have been instructed to put up signs asking incoming passengers to report conditions like fever , body rash , joint pains and conjunctivitis the usual symptoms of Zika infection within two weeks of travel . Besides , the health ministry has set up a technical committee to keep close tabs on the global Zika scenario and evolve a plan of action to stem breeding of Aedes mosquitoes . The report of this panel and implementation of its recommendations must be swift . Zika is not as deadly as Ebola , but the consequences of its infection are no less disquieting , especially in the case of expectant mothers . It is linked to microcephaly a condition in which babies are born with unusually small heads and damaged brains . Over 3 , 700 cases of this abnormality have already been reported from Brazil . If this virus comes to India , the count of babies with such defects would be mind boggling .
