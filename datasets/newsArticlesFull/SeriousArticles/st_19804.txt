We have a criminal justice system which is broken . Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth including China , disproportionately African American and Latino ? Sanders said during the debate . Who is satisfied that 61 of African American young people are either unemployed or underemployed ? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEOs of Wall Street companies that destroyed our economy has no police records ? We need to take a very hard look at our criminal justice system , investing in jobs and education , not in jail and incarceration .
