Stiller narrates the movie , takes no time at all to declare his Ohio town the best place in the universe and proudly introduces himself as the manager of a certain warehouse store that I won ' t name here ( but which must have swallowed up half the budget , judging by the constant name checking ) . Then , weirdly , the movie ditches the focus on Evan ( Stiller ) and stays with the store ' s night shift security guard , a guy called Antonio who ' s celebrating becoming a U . S . citizen by helping himself to a little vodka and " Wild Things " on a dozen high definition TV screens at once .
