The establishment s best hope , Marco Rubio , who s actively trying to make his mark on foreign policy and national security , had nothing more damning to say than that Trump s call for banning all Muslims is a distraction . If you look at the statements he made this week , obviously I think he made them partially to recapture the limelight after having lost it , he said . But Trump never lost the limelight he owns it . And that he s planning to spend 2m a week on such messages in Iowa and New Hampshire , is just the latest , surest , sign of that .
