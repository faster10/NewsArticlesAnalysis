There are lots of different ways to make money on a blog , from virtual tip jars to product reviews , but the most popular is through running ads . In the past , I ' ve recruited sponsors directly for a niche blog I used to write , but I currently use an advertising program on my personal blog that basically takes care of everything so all I have to do is post regularly and collect my check at the end of the month . Free money for writing about my cats and boyfriend and favorite TV shows ! What could be easier ? There are a host of ad programs open to anyone , so do your research to find one that ' s right for you .
