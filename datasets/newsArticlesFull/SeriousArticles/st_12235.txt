For the record , the Affordable Care Act was based on " Romneycare , " the market based health insurance reform that Republican Mitt Romney put in place when he was governor of Massachusetts . The ACA , like Romneycare , prohibits insurance companies from excluding patients due to preexisting conditions , requires all individuals to buy insurance ( since otherwise only the sick would sign up for coverage and the system would quickly become insolvent ) and offers subsidies to middle class and low income families to make higher quality coverage affordable .
