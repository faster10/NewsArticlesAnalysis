1 . ' La Strada ' ( Federico Fellini , 1954 ) " Absolutely wonderful film with Giulietta Masina and Anthony Quinn . She was tiny and had an almost clown like face , like a female Charlie Chaplin . It ' s about a loose couple of traveling circus performers who go around Italy juggling in the street . It ' s also one of the greatest tragic love stories ever filmed . Quinn ' s character doesn ' t realize how important his partner is in life and work until it ' s too late . ' The magic of cinema ' is a phrase thrown around too much , but this film shows just how magical it can be . "
