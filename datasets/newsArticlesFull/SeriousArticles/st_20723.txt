Withdrawing tax credits from one part of a company s workforce , the less socially integrated part , will deliberately impoverish them compared to their colleagues , and thus cut them adrift . If restricting the credits would reduce the overall flow of arrivals then it would at least be a coherent policy . But Whitehall s own economic advisers have cast doubt on whether it will materially affect the numbers , and a new higher minimum wage will exert an augmented economic pull , even as the benefits are withdrawn . So don t expect much of an effect on the numbers , but the effect on how migrants mix could be profound . Without the credits their colleagues rely on , migrant workers may do even more overtime , live in even more cramped homes , and have less disposable income to mix with their British colleagues .
