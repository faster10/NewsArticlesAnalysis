When you slow down and watch Thursday night ' s play slowly in high definition , you can see Detroit Lions defensive end Devin Taylor ' s right hand graze the helmet of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers . Taylor ' s hand then slipped down to Rodgers ' right shoulder on what would have been the final play of the game . The resulting twist was not violent , and not all officials would have judged it the same way . But the NFL rulebook says no player can " grasp and control , twist , turn , push or pull the face mask of an opponent in any direction , " and that ' s what appeared to have happened in live action .
