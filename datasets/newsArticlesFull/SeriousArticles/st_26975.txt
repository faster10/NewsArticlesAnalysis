A Mayo Clinic study , announced in January 2008 , details an unprecedented method to predict brain aging disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , called ALS or Lou Gehrig ' s disease , and Parkinson ' s disease . Investigators identified several gene mutations that predicted which people are at high risk for ALS and Parkinson ' s , which afflicts a million Americans . People with one set of genetic mutations were 2 , 000 times more likely than normal to develop ALS . Those with the other set are 400 times more likely than normal to suffer from Parkinson ' s disease . Researchers say this approach may be used to predict other complex diseases such as Alzheimer ' s , strokes , diabetes and cancer . They say , for example , if a test is developed that predicts someone is at high risk for diabetes , that person can change his or her behavior through exercise and diet to prevent the disease .
