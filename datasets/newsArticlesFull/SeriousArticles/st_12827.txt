Most of the film unfolds in January 1865 , shortly after Lincoln ' s reelection , when he knows that the North is going to win the Civil War . The real battle for him now is the fight against slavery . Three commissioners from the Confederacy head up to Washington City , and Lincoln is confident that he could have their surrender within a week . But before that can happen , he is driven to pass the 13th Amendment , which would outlaw slavery . The Democrats hate the amendment , and even Lincoln ' s liberal Republican comrades want him to delay the vote . Only Lincoln grasps the stakes : that once the Civil War is over , the amendment won ' t pass it will be blocked by the Southern states . Winning the war could prove a Pyrrhic victory . Only by threading the amendment through the eye of a legislative needle can he alter the course of history .
