The video is from a function of Muslims in Bihar on July 23 , 2005 , when Lalu was a Union minister . Wearing a skullcap , he is heard saying : Bilkul aapko insaaf mile , aapko nyay mile , aapka haq apko mile isme Lalu Yadav aapke saath kadama kadam jab Lok Sabha khulta hai , usme bhi Dalit Muslim wala jo prastava gaya hai , usko zor lagake aur usko hum bolenge ki agar Samvidhan mein sansodan laane ki zaroorat hai , provide karne ki zaroorat hai , iska provision karao ( You must get justice , get your rights . Lalu will always be with you on this . When the Lok Sabha sits next , we will push all proposals for Muslim Dalits . We will ask for an amendment to the Constitution , if needed ) .
