Mike Tanier , Bleacher Report : " Peyton Manning still looks like a cross between late career Johnny Unitas and Father Time . Sunday ' s 23 16 win over the Steelers wasn ' t exactly an offensive tour de force . The Broncos converted three of 15 third downs and scored their lone touchdown with three minutes left in the game . The Broncos scored their first six points of the game thanks to a long punt return and a shanked Steelers punt . Their next three points came on a 51 yard Brandon McManus field goal that looked like something out of a Mario Golf video game . Manning completed 21 of 37 passes for 222 yards , looking rickety while taking shots and missing receivers for most of the afternoon . I don ' t have to spell out for you what that could mean for , sigh , Brady Manning XVII , which is a thing that is actually happening . "
