George Lucas : I ' ve seen some presentations of , you know , live orchestras with " Star Wars " clips , and that sort of thing . But this is so much more than that it ' s so much more emotional , because what they ' ve done is taken the emotional content of the score . . . one is obviously the Imperial March , one is obviously romantic . . . and then they ' ve cut all the pictures around that from all the movies , so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music , and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various Imperial shenanigans that were going on over the Imperial March .
