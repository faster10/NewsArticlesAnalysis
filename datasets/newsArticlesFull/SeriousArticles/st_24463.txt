Just follow your dreams and be patient . You will always have ups and downs in your life and your career but just stay positive and go for it . Just do what you love . My dream was always to win a grand slam and my second dream was to be No1 . My first dream I have done already and the next one will be No1 . Serena is still the best player in the world . She wins most every tournament she is playing in . This is so far away for me . I will try not to think about it but , if the day came ? some day ? when I am No1 , then great .
