No doubt Trump released his Muslim travel ban plans in order to derail Ted Cruz s big moment . That doesn t make him some criminal mastermind , though . Timing newsworthy campaign announcements to undermine your opponent is a standard move , something nearly all politicians try to do and any campaign adviser worth his salt will tell you to do . ( Remember how John McCain timed the announcement of Sarah Palin as his running mate the day after Barack Obama s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention , a move clearly designed to knock Obama s triumphant speech out of the headlines ? ) The timing aspect is only interesting because the campaign announcement itself is obnoxious and bigoted and is guaranteed to cause another round of wondering if Trump is officially a fascist yet .
