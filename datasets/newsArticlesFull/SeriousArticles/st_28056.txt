When a stroke paralyzed the right side of my grandfather ' s body , my grandmother couldn ' t care for him all on her own . She hired Mrs Sun , a home care worker , who helped my grandfather bathe , get dressed and meet his basic daily needs . Because of the important support and care Mrs Sun provided , my grandparents were able to live together at home for four more years . While I want to describe Mrs Sun as a saint for what she did for my grandfather , she is also a worker , a worker who deserves to be paid fairly .
