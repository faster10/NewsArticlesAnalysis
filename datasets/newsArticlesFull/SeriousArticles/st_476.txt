An archway on a planter straddles the Flint River in downtown Flint , Mich . , on Tuesday , Jan . 26 , 2016 . From its founding , Flint ' s fortunes essentially were entwined with a single industry . First it was the fur trade , which shifted to lumber , which gave way to the horse carriages that led to it being called Vehicle City . It was a fitting moniker for its next , most important role , as a powerhouse of auto manufacturing and the original home of General Motors . ( AP Photo Carlos Osorio )
