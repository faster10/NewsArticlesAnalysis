McDermitt : In the audition they ' re very secretive they won ' t tell you the character name . The character they had me reading had a mohawk . I got so excited that I might have a mohawk . Then when I found out it was a mullet , I was like this is the only haircut I could get better . To be able to go on TV and be instantly recognizable as this guy representing so many lost souls in our country . I don ' t think we ' ve had a good mullet on TV since Uncle Jesse from " Full House , " so I ' m glad to bring it back .
