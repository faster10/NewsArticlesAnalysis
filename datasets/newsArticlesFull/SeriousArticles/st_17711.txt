WC : The director Bernardo Britto reached out to me . He ' d been interested in me for the role and then I did a comedy show and he came and we grabbed a drink afterward . Getting to hear how passionate he was about this film made me much more interested in reading the script and also getting to talk to him and realizing , " Okay , yeah , he ' s a nice guy and we get along . " Those are the things you would hope for in a situation like making a film , that you ' re surrounded by people that you enjoy being around because , yeah , you ' re going to spend 12 plus hours with them a day . You better like ' em .
