I had the opportunity to interview Saban just after he was hired at LSU in 2000 . I remember him telling me a story about his time at Michigan State ? ? although in true Saban fashion he was scant on some details . He told me one of his players got into legal trouble and the coach was facing intense pressure from the media and fans to kick that player off the team . But Saban pushed back . He said he knew if the player lost his scholarship , his path in his life would have been bleak . But if he stayed on the team , he could earn his degree and have a chance .
