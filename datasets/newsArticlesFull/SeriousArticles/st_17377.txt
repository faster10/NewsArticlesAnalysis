It s also important to point out that these films are not happening in a vacuum . No longer are there years in Irish cinema where there might be one or two you d bother to go to . Some of my highlights of last year s cinema trips were to Irish films The Queen of Ireland , Older ? Than Ireland , The Lobster , Song Of ? The Sea . And let s not forget other excellent Irish films in recent years Frank , One Million Dubliners , ? Glassland , Showrunners , Noble , The Stag , The Irish Pub , I Used to Live Here , Jump , What Richard Did , Grabbers , Good Vibrations , ? The Summit , and others .
