At the time of the accident , Tompkins was traveling with a group that included a few of his best friends : Yvon Chouinard , the founder of Patagonia Rick Ridgeway , a member of the first American team to summit K2 , the world s second tallest peak and Lorenzo Alvarez , owner of the adventure travel outfitter , Bio Bio Expeditions . Tompkins and Chouinard first explored the region together 50 years ago . A documentary of their 1968 first ascent of Fitz Roy , Patagonia s signature mountain , can be seen today as the secret origin myth ? or , perhaps , the Zapruder film ? of the 289 billion outdoor retailing industry .
