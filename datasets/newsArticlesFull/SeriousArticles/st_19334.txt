The Cardinals and Arians were the media darlings of the season . Carson Palmer has an elite arm , but he s not a winner . Arians is an elite offensive coordinator , but not a coach ( splitting Palmer out at receiver and running the wildcat down by 17 ? ) . Patrick Peterson is a very good corner , but always gets torched when the game is on the line . These guys get a pass over and over in the media . Hell , not just a pass : they get accolades that they hardly deserve . They always start strong and the media buys in . But down the stretch where it counts , they re still the same old Cardinals .
