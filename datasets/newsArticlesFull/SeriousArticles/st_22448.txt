Which gets to a broader , more important point . Minority voters ? and black Americans in particular ? are the firewall for Clinton s candidacy and the Democratic establishment writ large . As long as Clinton holds her lead with black Democrats , she s tough ( if not impossible ) to beat in delegate rich states like New York , New Jersey , Illinois , Ohio , and Texas . Even with momentum from wins in Iowa and New Hampshire , it s hard to see how Sanders overcomes Clinton s massive advantage with this part of the party s electorate . That s not to say he won t excel as an insurgent candidate , but that ? barring a seismic shift among black Democrats , as well as Latinos ? his coalition won t overcome her coalition .
