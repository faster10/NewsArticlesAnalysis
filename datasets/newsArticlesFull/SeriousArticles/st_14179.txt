However , on Friday Cameron said the proposed mechanism was still not good enough . The brake can only be applied in an emergency and not automatically as proposed by Cameron . UK campaigners for quitting the EU will denounce the scheme as a sham and Conservative backbench resistance to the idea may grow , complicating Cameron s sales pitch that he has secured a good deal . Cameron still has to take his emergency request to Brussels . Many details are not clear : how would a council green light work ? Could a government veto an emergency brake request ? Would a decision be taken by majority vote ? How do you measure an emergency ? What are the criteria for deciding that EU immigration into another EU country is putting excessive stress on national social and welfare systems ? How quickly could the brake be activated and for how long ?
