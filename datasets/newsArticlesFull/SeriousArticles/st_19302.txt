Until the stadium is built , the Rams will play at the Memorial Coliseum in downtown Los Angeles , a stadium that was their home from 1946 1979 when they moved to nearby Anaheim after failing to secure a stadium renovation . Reports said the Coliseum has given the league permission to host a second team for the next three seasons . Both the Raiders and Chargers have played in the Coliseum in their histories . It was the Raiders home for 13 seasons in the 1980s and 1990s and the Chargers played there in 1960 , the franchise s first season , before moving to San Diego .
