Muslim homegrown terrorists may draw the attention of a nation still traumatized by 9 11 , but such plots are no more numerous or serious than those perpetrated by other domestic terrorists in the United States .

It risks leaving us vulnerable to attacks from other sorts of violent idealogues and promotes a hurtful " and pointless " tension between Muslim Americans and other Americans .
