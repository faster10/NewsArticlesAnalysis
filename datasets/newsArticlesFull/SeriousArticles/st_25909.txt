Perez , the catcher who made the final out of last year s World Series , was named the MVP . He singled to lead off the 12th and his pinch runner , Jarrod Dyson , scored the winning run . For the series , he was 8 for 22 ( . 364 ) with two RBIs and three runs scored . He wasn t an obvious choice , but that was only because this title was such a team effort . ? The Royals , in assembling their roster , seemed to zig while the rest of baseball zagged , emphasizing contact and speed over power . Their starting pitchers are not dominant , but there are no weak links and their bullpen is versatile and extremely effective . Closer Wade Davis made three appearances in the series and didn t allow a run , striking out eight over four innings . Perez , like many of the Royals , is a great fastball hitter who can foul off two strike pitches and eventually make contact and often deliver a hit . He lacks the speed of many of his teammates , but they picked up the slack against the Mets , stealing bases at every opportunity . It seemed like every walk or single was a virtual double . They stole seven bases in the series , including four in the decisive game .
