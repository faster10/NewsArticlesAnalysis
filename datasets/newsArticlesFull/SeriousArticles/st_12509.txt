" We shot it on this other stage , " Bays said . " We built this big train station set you saw in the season finale . We didn ' t have any extras . Everyone else you saw walking around there is the ' How I Met Your Mother ' writers ( and crew ) . It was a family affair . No strangers or outsiders were a part of it . We locked it down . We made everybody ( who ) was there not that we don ' t trust our cast and crew sign confidentiality agreements . We were terrified for a month and a half . Every day we were terrified that it would get out , but it didn ' t and that was great . "
