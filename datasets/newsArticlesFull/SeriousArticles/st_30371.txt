The worst idea : It is one thing for the federal government to intervene in early public education because the system is so deeply in need of reform . But it is another thing entirely to follow the president ' s notion that the federal government should begin regulating colleges and universities to ensure they are providing good education at affordable prices . Yes , schools must keep tighter control over tuition increases and provide more online courses at cheaper prices , but the last thing we need is for Washington to inject itself deeply into higher education . America has the best colleges and universities in the world they are a crown jewel . If they ain ' t broke , Washington shouldn ' t try to fix them .
