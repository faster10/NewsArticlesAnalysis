When I went to bed last night , at 11 : 30 , it was 6 million . So , between 11 : 30 eastern time last night and 8 o ' clock eastern time this morning , another 400 , 000 people watched that video . The fact is that that tells you more than any poll . It tells you more than any focus group . The American people are concerned about their husbands , their wives , their brothers , their sisters , their sons and their daughters . And we ' ve gotta do everything we can to stop the killing and the value of life in our country . " Washington Examiner
