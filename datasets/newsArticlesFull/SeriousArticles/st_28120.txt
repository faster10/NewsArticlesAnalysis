Anyone who has visited Cologne bears witness to the fact that CCTV cameras are in place in abundance in both the train station and the city centre . At the time of the incident , neither was there an electricity blackout nor were fireworks taking place in the dark . The damage was done but where is the evidence ? Interviews of women ( who claim that they were the victims ) have been aired . They have even given lurid details of the happening . What stops them from identifying the culprits ? One month has passed since the incident took place but where is the progress on the case ?
