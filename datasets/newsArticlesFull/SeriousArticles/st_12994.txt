" This idea that you can kind of render someone who claims to be a Muslim outside the faith sets a very risky precedent " , Hamid says . Islam spread in Europe the exact same ways . While , yes , a few European Muslims are refugees , and a few are recent immigrants , many more are indigenous , and have been Muslim for longer than many Protestants have been Protestant . If one belongs , why doesn ' t the other belong ? If you are curious about the concept , I urge people to go to a Mosque and ask questions . Pray for the Catholics and the Muslims , pray for the misled and misguided , the abused and forgotten , pray for the ignorant and the wise , pray for the angry and the apathetic , pray for the ones no one else will . When we let hate brew more hate , there is no room left for peace . The one prior was against Jews .
