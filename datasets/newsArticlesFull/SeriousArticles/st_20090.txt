New York Post ' s Kyle Smith notes , " Within five minutes you ' ll guess why Cusack , not overly encumbered with big film roles these days , didn ' t return for the sequel : The script is monotonous , meandering and witless , frantically ramming together middle school non ideas such as a guy being forced to rape another guy on a reality show , or a guy ' s testicles projectile exploding into the faces of two other guys , or a guy being shot in both the head and the man parts . . . . The smart plotting of the first film is completely gone . "
