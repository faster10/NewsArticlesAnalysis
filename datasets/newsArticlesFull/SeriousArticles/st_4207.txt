Well , he s doing better . And I ll tell you , interestingly , he was very nice to me when he first ran and then he got very nasty and then he became very nice again . So , right now I like him . I think he s doing pretty well . In terms of the establishment , he seems to be doing a little better than the others right now , based on a poll , Trump said , turning his attention to the next poll from the first primary state set for release later Wednesday . I think the big poll comes out tonight at 6 , the WMUR poll with CNN , it comes out at 6 , so I m looking forward to seeing that poll . That s a very comprehensive poll of New Hampshire . But we ve been winning New Hampshire by a lot . I think he maybe could be in second place or third place right now .
