Few will long lament the departure of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary . He was a weak choice for the job , seen as a comfortable one for President Barack Obama , a former senator he knew who was unlikely to ruffle feathers or be as challenging to work with as his stronger predecessors , Robert Gates or Leon Panetta . But if Obama thinks that pushing out Hagel will be seen as the housecleaning that many have recommended for his spluttering national security process , he is likely to be very disappointed .
