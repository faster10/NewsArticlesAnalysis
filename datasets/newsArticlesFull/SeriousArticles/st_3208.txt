If this election is about how we re going to fight to get nothing done , then I don t want anything ? I don t want any part of it . I don t want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people are literally in decline in their lives . That is not my motivation . I ve got a lot of really cool things that I could do other than sit around , being miserable , listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them . That is a joke . Elect Trump if you want that .
