Despite all the problems created by America ' s private health care market , we do have versions of big government , socialized insurance . They ' re called Medicare and Medicaid . They are far more efficient than private insurance , and Medicare recipients in particular love their coverage . It ' s no accident that in every election , Republicans who fought against the creation of Medicare and would love to privatize it try to pretend to voters that they ' re the program ' s greatest defenders . The champions of free market capitalism decide they can ' t get elected without supporting a single payer insurance program .
