Yet in one vital way , the movie feels very contemporary . When Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 , spearheading the civil rights era before it had a name , he was subjected , on and off the field , to a degree of racial antagonism that could almost be called terrorism . For all its wholesomely uplifting , message movie design , 42 makes that struggle look every bit as brutal and scary as it was . Robinson ' s fellow Dodgers , many of them Southern boys , welcome him to the team by signing a petition to have him kicked off . He ' s booed from the stands , pitchers take open delight in beaning him , and in one scene , when he ' s up at bat , the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies ( Alan Tudyk ) heckles him from the sidelines by calling him the N word for five unrelenting minutes . The way that scene goes on and on is scathingly powerful , as Jackie can barely keep himself from coming apart . Boseman , a graceful and handsome actor with a deep inner fire , gives Robinson a stare that ' s penetrating and guarded at the same time . A lot of the film ' s drama is reading that face the intelligence and masked outrage . Jackie isn ' t allowed to fight back against any of the viciousness ( if he did , it would look to mainstream America like he was the troublemaker ) , yet swallowing it eats up his spirit . How does he cope ?
