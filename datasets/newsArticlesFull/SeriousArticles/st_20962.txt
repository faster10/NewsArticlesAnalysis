The Trump question isn t just one for the candidates , either . Fox News moderators Megyn Kelly , Bret Baier , and Chris Wallace will need to decide how much time they want to devote to a candidate who has declared war on them . The trio did a great job at the first GOP debate way back in August ? but their tough , fair questions had the opposite result of what many expected : As opposed to taking Trump down , that debate ( and the ensuing Trumpian spin ) only built him up . I doubt Kelly needs any more advice on how to handle the former reality television star , but if I were behind the Fox News desk in Des Moines , I d wait at least a round or two before mentioning Trump s name . You can t pretend the GOP front runner doesn t exist . But you don t need to give him top billing in a show he s refusing to take part in .
