According to statistics from Women In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation , as of September 2011 , there were 214 , 098 women serving on active duty in the military . While that might sound like a large number , these women make up only 14 . 6 of all active duty service personnel . In the Marine Corps , women make up just a little more than 6 . The Pentagon says women have been barred from roughly 237 , 000 positions , and they will now start looking to qualified women to fill these roles . This is long overdue .
