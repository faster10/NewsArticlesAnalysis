Among other groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS is Jund al Khalifa ( Soldiers of the Caliphate ) , a terrorist group operating in Algeria . Previously , the group was part of al Qaeda ' s North African branch , al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , until the group split from AQIM because it was " deviating from the true path . " And just 10 days after proclaiming its allegiance to ISIS , Jund al Khalifa beheaded Herve Gourdel , a 55 year old French hiker they had taken hostage . ( Beheading Western hostages is , of course , one of ISIS ' signature tactics ) .
