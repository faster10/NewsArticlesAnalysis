Executives around the league and people have told me , that the Bulls are very determined to add a talented wing player . Tony Snell has been given a lot of opportunities , and he hasn ' t established himself , and I ' ve been told that the Bulls are open to . . . whether it ' s Joakim Noah , Taj Gibson . . . maybe not both of them , but either of them if there ' s a deal out there that they can bring in the best possible wing player available , they ' re open to it . That ' s a direction they ' re going to go in . They need more shooting . . . to shape this team towards more of an offensive minded group .
