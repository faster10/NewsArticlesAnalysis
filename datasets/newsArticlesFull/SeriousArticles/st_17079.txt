For middle aged men , I always suspected that part of the appeal of Tony Soprano was the archetype he provided that fat men , who eat and drink and smoke too much , can be recognized as central figures rather than side characters . Overburdened with work and the weight that comes with too many good times under his belt , Tony was the patriarch who demanded respect and ultimately received it . He was oversexed and had what might be described as Old World notions of fidelity , despite his appearance , because " power is the ultimate aphrodisiac " and yes , I just quoted Henry Kissinger in a column about Tony Soprano .
