Ezra Klein : " To be less generous ? but perhaps more accurate ? this is a document that lets Sanders say he has a plan , but doesn ' t answer the most important questions about how his plan would work , or what it would mean for most Americans . Sanders is detailed and specific in response to the three main attacks Clinton has launched , but is vague or unrealistic on virtually every other issue . The result is that he answers Clinton ' s criticisms while raising much more profound questions about his own ideas . "
