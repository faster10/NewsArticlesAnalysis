What kind of sisterhood insists that an attitude of " this works here and will therefore work over there " is the way forward ? Is there no nuance to be found , if the objective is to free women of the patriarchy that governs their lives ? It is naive and somewhat foolish at best , and at worst dangerous and stupid . It is looking at a health problem and deciding that their prescription is the only drug that will clear up the rash , when locally sourced medicines may work just as well , if not better . At the very least , work with organizations already at the coalface day after day , collaborate with and listen to them . If the aim is genuinely to make a fairer society , not to merely impose benevolent condescension , it ' s a necessary step .
