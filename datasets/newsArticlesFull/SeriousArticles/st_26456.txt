" I want everyone in our whole country to know that Joe united us , " said Diane Farley , a Penn State alumna and current university employee . " And I don ' t want anyone to point fingers at anyone anymore , and I want them to know that State College is a place that cares , because Joe cared , and there ' s just been a lot of confusion in the past six weeks . . . We ' re all on this Earth together . We ' re all going to go out eventually , like Joe , and we need to be a little bit more loving and caring with each other . "
