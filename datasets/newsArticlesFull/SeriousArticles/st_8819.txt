All of this helps explain how and why ? the forces of respectability in Wisconsin ? the police officers , private investigators , prosecutors ? lined up against the Avery family with such ease , such speed . In their eyes the Avery family wasn t respectable . They were Jukes , Kallikaks , poor whites , hereditary losers . In this very white corner of the state , with no people of color to treat as second class citizens , the degenerate whites would do just as well . I m not saying prejudice against poor whites is anywhere near as virulent or damaging as racism against people of color . But it came from the same bad science , crackpot scientists , and inane theories . And it lingers ? sometimes invisibly , sometimes making itself clear as it did in Manitowoc County .
