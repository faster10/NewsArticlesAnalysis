National Review s gambit is unlikely to change that dynamic in the near term . Trump , after all , has survived similar Republican in Name Only attacks before ? from Fox News this summer , Jeb Bush this fall , and Ted Cruz this winter . There s no evidence that most Trump fans share those concerns ? and some evidence that when confronted with Trump s past party apostasy , they actually like their man more . As focus groups and polls have shown , you just can t convince a Donald Trump supporter not to support Donald Trump . I doubt a bunch of essays is going to change that .
