You know we ' re 10 days out until Iowa , because the political attacks on both sides have picked up . But what ' s happening in the Republican race is akin to the final scene in " Reservoir Dogs " or " True Romance , " where everyone has their weapons pointed at each other and , well , a lot of people are going to die . Think about it : Donald Trump has his gun pointed at Ted Cruz in the form of a new TV ad attacking Cruz for being " pro amnesty " Cruz is pointing his own gun back at Trump for supporting " eminent domain " National Review ' s gun is directed at Trump in its " Against Trump " edition the Republican National Committee already fired back by disinviting the magazine from co hosting an upcoming debate Jeb Bush ' s Super PAC , according to one estimate , has already unloaded 20 million in negative TV ads against Marco Rubio , though the Super PAC disputes that actual figure and Team Rubio already fired its weapon at Chris Christie . Now someone will survive Steve Buscemi ' s Mr Pink or Christian Slater ' s Clarence but it ' s going to be a bloody mess .
