This was always a possibility , the Chiefs being shown as undermanned and losing ? 27 20 , in this case in the divisional round ? but this is not the kind of heartbreaking , self esteem challenging playoff loss Chiefs fans have sadly grown to know so well . They lost a playoff game to a better team , on the road . They missed some chances that could have made it closer , perhaps even turned the outcome , but they would ve needed to play a near perfect game and that s no way to go through the playoffs .
