Boulware ran to the outside while Green let Howard run by him , sitting in the middle of the field with no one to cover . Behind him , Tankersley turned inside but didn t immediately move inside , indicating he expected safety help from Green . That created a huge opening that allowed Coker to easily make the throw and Howard the run . It is difficult to know for sure if it was Tankersley or Green , but the latter turned and pointed deep as the former stumbled before turning to give chase as if to say , Help !
