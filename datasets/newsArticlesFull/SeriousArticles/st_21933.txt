President Barack Obama has proposed a comprehensive plan that will create good jobs while rebuilding America ' s infrastructure for the 21st century . In the president ' s plan , a portion of the costs will be offset by reducing the tax deductible exemptions for well off families , taxing hedge fund manager income as income rather than discounted capital gains , closing loopholes that give government handouts to the oil and gas industry and taxing corporate jets with the same depreciation schedule as personal jets . For crying out loud , why not ? Why we should continue to let working Americans suffer while helping the super rich get richer ?
