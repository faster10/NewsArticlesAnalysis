Murray s wife , Kim , has not travelled with him to Australia . Commercial airliners discourage women from flying beyond the sixth month of pregnancy , and Murray has not ruled out the possibility of flying home mid ? tournament if the baby is born early . Whether he sticks to this plan in the event of booking a place in his fifth Melbourne final , of course , remains to be seen . At least the anxieties about his impending parenthood are beginning to recede . I m not nervous . A few weeks ago I was , but now I m excited . A lot of friends around my age , 28 , are having kids . It s only four to five weeks away , maximum , and I have that to look forward to as soon as I m back from here .
