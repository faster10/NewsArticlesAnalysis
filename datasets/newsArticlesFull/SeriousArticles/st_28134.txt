He is truly two footed for that reason alone English football should treasure him . But he is also clearly capable of playing in different positions , and he can adapt midway through a game . Those qualities are not readily available in most players and it takes me back to the Champions League final of 2005 when Gerrard ended up at right back . The very best not only play different positions , they excel in those positions as well . Lallana still has to prove he can do it , as Gerrard did , in a major final , but he proved it in a massive game on Sunday .
