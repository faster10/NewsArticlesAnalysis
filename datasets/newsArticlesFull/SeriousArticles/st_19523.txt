Dozens of backbenchers are leaning towards voting with the government but they are likely to come under some pressure from local Momentum groups and some constituency parties not to back war as they make up their minds over the weekend . It is extremely difficult to predict how many will end up supporting Cameron , but the final number voting for military action could end up anywhere from about 15 to half the party , depending on the decisions of key figures such as Benn , the shadow defence secretary , Maria Eagle , and the deputy leader , Tom Watson , as well as whether they are given a free vote . Chris Leslie , the former shadow chancellor , has been clear that he will back the government because of the UN resolution calling for action .
