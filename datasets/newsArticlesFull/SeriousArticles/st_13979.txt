The second half of the movie goes on a bit , with too many rote combat scenes . Yet the director , Neil Burger ( the fanciful craftsman who made " Limitless " and " The Illusionist " ) , keeps you invested , staging a rise of the savior heroine plot so that it seems less ritualistic than it does in the Hunger Games films . It helps that the drill sergeant , named Four , is played by Theo James , who ' s like an unflaky James Franco with a surly hint of T shirt era Brando he brings off the neat trick of playing a hardass who is also a heartthrob . And it ' s nice to watch Kate Winslet go full ice blood fascist as the Erudite leader who makes a scarily smart case for a society rooted in the fine art of control . In many ways , she sounds similar to a movie executive , so I ' m glad to see the launch of a dystopian franchise in which individuality , as embodied by Shailene Woodley , looks like it could mean something beyond hiply propping up the status quo . Grade : B
