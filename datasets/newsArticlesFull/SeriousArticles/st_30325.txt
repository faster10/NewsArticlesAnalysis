Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James has signed a lifetime deal with Nike , believed to be the first deal of its sort in the company ' s 44 year history . " We can confirm that we have agreed to a lifetime relationship with LeBron that provides significant value to our business , brand , and shareholders , " Nike said in a statement . " We have already built a strong LeBron business over the past 12 years , and we see the potential for this to continue to grow throughout his playing career and beyond . " The company did not say how much the deal is worth , but a source told ESPN it soars above the 300 million , 10 year deal Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant signed with Nike last summer . In 2003 , Nike signed its first deal with James on the eve of the NBA lottery ? a 90 million deal for seven years . James says he ' s " grateful " for Nike and " everyone over there " who " just believed in a skinny 18 year old kid from Akron , Ohio , and I ' m happy to be a part of such a great company . "
