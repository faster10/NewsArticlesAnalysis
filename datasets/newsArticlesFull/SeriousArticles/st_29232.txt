To a prosecutor , a hung jury could be a signal that a case is still winnable , or that , having put on their best case , they couldn ' t convince a jury of the defendant ' s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . If the prosecutors have taken the time to polish and focus their witnesses ' testimony , or reframe opening and closing arguments , or adjust the presentation of evidence ( and they will certainly do all of these things ) , then they may get a different result . Perhaps the real message the hung jury sent was " try harder . "
