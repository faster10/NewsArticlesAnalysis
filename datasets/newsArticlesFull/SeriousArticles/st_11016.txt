I think he knows where our football team is , tight end Jason Witten said . I think for all of us , we have that approach that it s a one game season . It s about taking care of the next opponent .

For all of us we have to get prepared on a short week . You have to be able to get the soreness out from Sunday and get ready to go for Thursday .
