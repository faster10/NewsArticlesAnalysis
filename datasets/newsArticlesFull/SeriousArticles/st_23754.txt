I have nothing against weddings nothing ' s better than a celebration of love and if my husband and I decide to get married " for real , " I ' m sure we ' ll have an epic one . But the government certificate thing has always made me indignant , especially nowadays when the health insurance crisis looms large . Why should one be able to have health insurance more easily because they happen to be heterosexual ? Or , for that matter , if they believe in the institution of marriage enough to support it ?
