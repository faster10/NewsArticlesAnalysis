I was lucky though . My parents managed to create a microcosm of relative normalcy in our home . They traveled on occasional business trips to the West and smuggled banned books by Vaclav Havel , Alexander Solzhenitsyn or George Orwell back to Czechoslovakia , an act that could have landed them in prison . I listened to Voice of America on the radio with my father every morning and evening quietly , so the neighbors couldn ' t hear us and report us . On my 15th birthday I got my first wristwatch and a translation of the inauguration speech of John F . Kennedy .
