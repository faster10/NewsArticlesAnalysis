The GOP should take note : According to a study of the 2012 election I published in Political Research Quarterly , one of the largest factors affecting the Latino vote in favor of Obama was Mitt Romney s comments that illegal immigrants should self deport . In my research , using a large , historic range of survey data from 1960 to 2006 I also found that when faced with discrimination , such as Trump s comments , Latino identity is embraced at higher rates and results in greater political action .
