There ' s a glimpse of that alleged awkwardness in Edward Klein ' s new book about Obama . In " The Amateur : Barack Obama in the White House " Klein writes , Oprah Winfrey arrives at the White House for an interview and is shocked to find that she has to join the queue at security like everyone else . She even has to talk to staff who make only 75 , 000 a year ( yes , Klein lists that as a complaint ) , and Oprah is humiliated when Michelle Obama fails to treat her as an equal . Clearly the wife of the leader of the free world needs to learn a little humility .
