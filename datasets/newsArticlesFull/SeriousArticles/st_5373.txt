Bullies don ' t like " different . " I used to get asked a lot of questions , and a lot of the time , I would be too embarrassed to tell them about my Tourette ' s , or I just didn ' t want to , because it ' s a long story . So they start imitating my tics or just think I was trying to freak them out or be the class clown . I remember putting on a fake smile and trying to act like I was laughing at them instead of them laughing at me . They would copy me , and it would really hurt . That ' s how the bullying started .
