REALITY : The presidential election between the incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers ' Party ( PT ) and her two main opponents , A cio Neves of the Social Democratic Party ( PSDB ) and Eduardo Campos of the Socialist Party ( PSB ) will kick into full gear after the final on July 13 . President Rousseff would like a successful , well organized Cup to bolster her re election chances , although she probably does not need the Brazilian team to do well in order to win . Candidates Neves and Campos could benefit from a perception that the Cup did not go well , but they probably will not be able to make too much of this in the campaign , as they both helped to organize it in their home states .
