That s what I call selling out for his team and teammates . The ultimate sacrifice . Not sure I d play with a serious broken arm , but one can appreciate his commitment . Think about ham and eggs . The chicken is involved , but the pig is committed . While not potential death for him , his desire to play in the biggest day of his professional football career and believe he can play at the highest level is to be admired . He can rest and heal up after the game , and with his level of commitment that just could be as s Super Bowl champion .
