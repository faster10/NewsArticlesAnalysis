Kimberling : My editor and I did kick around alternative titles for a while . The problem was that other titles ( such as " Audubon , Indiana " ) seemed to restrict the book ' s scope somehow and that the snapping turtle in the book has symbolic value . In the end , it was a case of , well , it can ' t be called anything else , can it ? " Snapper " is a digressive , meandering book that invites readers to make connections and interpret things as they will . A more descriptive title ( say , " Birding in Indiana " ) wouldn ' t do that justice . Also , " Snapper " is a snappy title .
