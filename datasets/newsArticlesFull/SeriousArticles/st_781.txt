Best of both worlds , I ' d like to see Jackman return as Wolverine but just once more , maybe twice . One more big X Men movie , and then an Avengers crossover that could pit him opposite Downey ' s Iron Man . Let those two actors ride off into the sunset together . A four film commitment on movies of this magnitude , on the other hand , has a way of stretching over another decade , and Jackman is too talented an actor to have 20 years of his prime dominated by a cartoon character , no matter how iconic .
