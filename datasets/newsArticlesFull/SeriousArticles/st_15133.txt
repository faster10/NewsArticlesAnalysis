When I was a boy living in Kabul , I had a different experience . A different political environment meant women were respected their intelligence and accomplishments greatly valued . My mother was a teacher and school administrator . She was known on campus for her confidence and effective leadership . My aunt was a professor at Kabul University . She inspired young men and women to be creative and poetic , furthering Afghanistan ' s rich cultural and artistic legacy . My cousin was a physician . Men and women alike relied on her skill , strength and kindness .
