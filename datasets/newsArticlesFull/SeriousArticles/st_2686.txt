Even before Schengen came along , you could drive through Europe with hardly any checks at all . Given the amount of commerce and travel , that would be extremely difficult to change now . Then you have the likely number of weapons being trafficked , we re talking about a very small number into France per year , no more than a few hundred . So imagine a car carrying 5 or 10 Kalashnikovs , what is the chance of that car being searched on way into France ? You d be better off playing the lottery .
