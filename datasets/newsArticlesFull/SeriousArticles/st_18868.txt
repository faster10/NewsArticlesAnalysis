What happens at receiver ? The Redskins will have two receivers entering the final year of their contracts in Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson . Garcon ' s cap hit will increase from 9 . 7 million this year to 10 . 2 million in 2016 . Jackson ' s stays the same at 9 . 25 million . But there ' s not much reason to do anything with them . The Redskins like Garcon a lot and Jackson continues to provide big plays . One reason Cousins has shined of late is because of the receivers . If they got rid of Garcon and to date this is not on the table they ' d have to pay a replacement similar to what he ' ll make this year . Extending him might not lower his cap figure this season , but Washington is a place he ' d like to stay .
