Scott Raab , the author of The Whore of Akron , acknowledged that LeBron ? the titular whore ? was no mass murderer . But his hatred ran deep and long . When commemorating LeBron James Hater Day for Deadspin in 2010 , Raab described even pre Decision James as essentially a self centered jerk who cared nothing about the fans who adored him in short , that he is just another pro athlete whose stunted adolescence would last his lifetime . Raab cited James decision to wear a Yankees cap to Indians games and the team s poor play at the end of the 2009 10 Eastern Conference Finals , neither of which are definitive indicators of jerkitude .
