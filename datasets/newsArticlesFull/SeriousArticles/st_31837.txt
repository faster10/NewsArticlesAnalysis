Harris : I ' m certain digital will permanently alter the publishing industry . I hope that books will not completely go by the wayside , but I fear they will . I love to hold a book in my hands , but I can ' t deny it ' s much more convenient and green to have all my books on one device and to be able to take that device with me when I travel , instead of bulky and heavy books . For that time alone , eBooks are worth it . And the same thinking applies to all the other uses . Portable is the way the world is going .
