There is another difference . Current profit margins of A shares are 19 . 6 percent higher than their average since 2006 ( a full business cycle ) , whereas those of H shares are only 7 . 2 percent higher . This suggests that China s feared slowdown has already meaningfully compressed the profitability of H shares , but not yet the profitability of A shares . And when earnings are normalized to reflect cyclically adjusted profit margins , A shares jump to a 17 . 5 P E , whereas H shares barely budge to a 10 . 1 P E .
