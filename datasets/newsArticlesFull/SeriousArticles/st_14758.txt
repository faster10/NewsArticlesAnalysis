The super power brand in politics is now also being franchised in Asia where the fight between China and India is on to win this race . This trend has also reached the Middle East . Saudi Arabia and Iran have always competed and contested on religious views , political philosophies and oil economics . The Saudis traditionally have played caddy boys to American politics and Iran has preferred tilting towards the Russians due to its revolutionary leader s bias towards anti capitalism . However , Obama Rouhani politics have shaken the regional balance and that , coupled with the oil price consistent crash , will make the new round of power struggle in the region a very important factor in the future of the new world order . This new world order has seen a shift of power by the super power from a pure reliance on the House of Saud to a more balanced tilt towards the house of the Ayatollahs . This tilt needs to be understood by all countries and very careful foreign policy postures need to be adopted .
