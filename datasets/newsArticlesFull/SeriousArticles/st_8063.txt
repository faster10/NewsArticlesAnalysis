Since September , quarterback Jake Coker seemed an efficient afterthought , a senior and first year starter who , as a three year part timer , went 3 for 5 passing in 2012 , 18 for 36 in 2013 and 38 for 59 in 2014 . He went 25 for 30 on Thursday night , with such excellence that it grew clear that Henry and the defense served another role in 2015 : They gave Coker and teammates time to mend flaws , especially after Alabama looked at a messy 43 37 loss to Ole Miss on Sept . 19 and resolved to ride Henry from there .
