Marion is outspoken about her Catholic worldview , in a country where that is strange for any politician even the FN ' s official line is that it is a defender not of Christian values , but of French la ? cit against Muslim influence . Marion is unapologetic about her stance on social issues : She opposes abortion , even as the FN has softened its ( never very hard ) stance on the issue , and has stated forthrightly that if elected to head her region , she would cut off funding to Planned Parenthood ( Marine disavowed those comments ) .
