LEANING ON LACY : Aaron Rodgers completed less than half his passes in his past two games against Minnesota and Chicago . He averaged 207 yards passing with a total of three touchdowns and one interception . Eddie Lacy , meanwhile , has gotten into a groove . Lacy has 205 yards rushing on 39 carries after running for just 308 yards on 83 carries over his first eight games of the season . " You ' re probably going to see him get the ball a number of times , trying to control that line of scrimmage , " Lions coach Jim Caldwell said , adding Lacy runs behind a good line . " He creates problems for you . He ' s tough to handle . He wears your defense down . " A groin injury kept him out of the lineup last month against Detroit , which held James Starks to 42 yards on 15 carries .
