Zarif went on to stress that this attack was officially condemned and that the perpetrators will be prosecuted . However , he unsurprisingly didn ' t dwell much into how this attack was allowed to happen in the first place under a regime which otherwise wouldn ' t allow a mosquito to freely move without permission ! Zarif also dwelled on how Saudi Arabia ' s defense expenditure is far greater than Iran ' s yet he failed to recognize that this is a natural result of Tehran meddling with the region left , right and center . At the end of the day , Saudi Arabia would also prefer to spend more of its money on development however with Houthi missiles coming in from the south and Iran bragging from the north about becoming an empire and occupying Arab cities , what else could Riyadh have done ?
