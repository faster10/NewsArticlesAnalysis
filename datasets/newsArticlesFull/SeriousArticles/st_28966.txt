' The suggestion that Mr King could not proceed further because my shareholding and proxies would have blocked his bid is a nonsense . For a bid to be rejected it has to be received first . I can only conclude Mr King ' s phantom bid was designed as a vehicle for self promotion of some kind . Unfortunately the consequences of his inaccurate and ill advised statement serves further to destabilise the club and upsets the fan base at this very sensitive time . I have grown tired of Mr King ' s antics . '
