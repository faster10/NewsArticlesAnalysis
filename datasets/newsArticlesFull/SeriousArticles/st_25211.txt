This is not the first time a bunch of tech tycoons have gotten excited about renewable energy . With help from government subsidies , Silicon Valley fueled ? a cleantech boom ? between about 2007 and 2012 , which led to a few big hits ? think Tesla and SolarCity ? but a lot of high profile busts ( like Solyndra ) . Two of the investors in Gates coalition , John Doerr and Vinod Khosla , were among the principal figures in that first boom and bust . The lesson they took away is not that clean tech is a waste of money . The lesson is that it s foolish to expect the sort of instant mega returns on capital that Silicon Valley investors can get from , say , social media startups .
