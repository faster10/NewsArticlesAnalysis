NdP : The goal is to make each ride 15 20 rand ( less than 2 ) per ride , irrespective of distance traveled . We want a Mellowcab ride to be way , way cheaper than traditional taxis . Normal taxis in South Africa are 8Rand per kilometer in a flagged ride , plus 15 rand for " flag fall . " I recently took a 15 kilometer taxi ride north of Cape Town , and it cost 370 rand ( 33 ) . We want Mellowcab to be much cheaper for the passenger and for the operator too . Passengers will be able to pay cash or through an app .
