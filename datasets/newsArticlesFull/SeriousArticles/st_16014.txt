In the Democrats ' caucus , voters break into groups that publicly declare their allegiance to a candidate . If the number of members of any group fails to pass a 15 per cent viability threshhold , they can either choose not to participate or join a rival candidate ' s group often leading to intense lobbying of those in the smaller groups . Once the groups are determined , the number of votes for each candidate is calculated by a complex formula based on a county by county analysis of Democratic performance in the most recent governor and presidential elections . This determines the number of delegates for each candidate that will be sent to the Democratic National Convention .
