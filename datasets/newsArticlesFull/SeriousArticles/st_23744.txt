Another movie that caught our attention this year was ? Bridge of Spies . While we ' re incredibly happy that Mark Rylance is getting the recognition he deserves , we ' re still surprised about ? director Steven Spielberg ' s exclusion . If you ' re going to give a nomination for Best Picture why isn ' t the director getting any love ? Anybody having flashbacks to ? Argo and ? Ben Affleck Maggie Smith , star of ? Lady in the Van , managed to secure a Golden Globes nomination but somehow fell short of the Oscars . We ' ll just have to wait and see more of her sass some other time .
