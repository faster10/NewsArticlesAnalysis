Life on Mars : If there ' s life on Mars , even if it ' s microbial , should we be allowed to spread to the planet , potentially risking its extinction ? I find this question strange as Chris McKay put it : " We commit microbial genocide every time we wash our hands " . We engineer and farm the complex life around us as systematically and as cheaply as possible . Billions of people eat the carcasses of organisms that were thinking and breathing only days before . Why , all of a sudden , should Martian microbes be given such sanctity ? It should certainly be studied , but it shouldn ' t prevent our spreading .
