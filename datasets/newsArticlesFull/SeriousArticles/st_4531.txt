A myth prevails that America ' s bond with Israel flows from " shared democratic values " and response to the Holocaust . In fact , Washington only started providing Israel with significant military assistance and diplomatic impunity after the 1967 War , when Israel seized pivotal territory from Egypt and Syria , two Soviet allies opposed to American regional dominance . For the remainder of and after the Cold War , U . S . officials calculated that ensuring Israel ' s military superiority over its neighbors helped America pursue hegemony over the Middle East , even as occupying millions more Palestinians clearly made Israel less democratic . ( The U . S . government ' s own demographic data show that the number of Arabs under Israeli control in " Green Line " Israel , Gaza , the Golan Heights , East Jerusalem and the West Bank exceeds that of Israeli Jews , making the Israeli state a minority regime for the people it governs ) .
