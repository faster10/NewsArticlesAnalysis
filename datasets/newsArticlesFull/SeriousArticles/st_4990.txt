Many hotels have taken their suite offerings to ( literally ) new heights . London ' s Corinthia Hotel , for instance , houses the 5 , 000 square foot Royal Penthouse , which contains its own spa treatment pod and a striking spiral staircase ( among other luxe touches ) and is the largest two bedroom hotel residence in that city . The chic Arts Suite at the design driven Hotel Arts Barcelona offers guests special extras , such as helicopter transport to lunch at one of Spain ' s Michelin starred restaurants , or electric Smart cars to drive around town .
