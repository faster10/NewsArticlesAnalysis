What ' s the point of all this ? Maybe , just maybe , all the " narratives " coming out of the news media are perfectly worthwhile if you ' re looking to entertain yourself with discussion of the campaign , or if you ' re looking to speculate harmlessly about what might happen in upcoming primaries . But in the end , just like the Iowa caucus itself , they mean almost nothing . We get worked up over Iowa because it ' s first , and it ' s true that it has the power to winnow the race down , as candidates who already knew they were done finally have a justification to pull out , as Martin O ' Malley and Mike Huckabee did Monday night , and other Republican candidates may do soon .
