Keep it safe : Don ' t even think of thawing your turkey at room temperature or in a sink full of warm water . That ' s courting danger , since the outer layers of the turkey will be in the " danger zone " ( between 40 and 140 degrees , the temperatures at which bacteria multiply rapidly ) while the inside still is thawing . Use the quick thaw method described above . Store your turkey in its original packaging , breast side up , on a tray on the lowest shelf of your refrigerator . Don ' t put foods that will be consumed raw ( like lettuce ) underneath the thawing turkey .
