" Most evangelicals understand the difference between the peaceful Muslims and those who are violently waging war against us , because we ' re a people on mission . We have Muslim neighbors and Muslim friends , and we understand how to love them , treat them with dignity , even as we disagree and have those conversations , " Moore said . " The evangelicals I know are people who believe that everyone is made in the image of God , and so people even if they hold unpopular religious views aren ' t to be treated as political footballs . They ' re to be treated as human beings , and treated with respect and dignity . "
