2 . Third year Patriots guard Josh Kline deserves credit for developing from undrafted 2013 free agent out of Kent State to core contributor worthy of a two year contract extension with a maximum value of 4 . 9 million that he signed last week . But like almost everything , there s a story behind the story that has been critical to his growth , and he relayed to me that he owes a debt of gratitude to assistant coach Brian Daboll . It was Daboll , who had just joined the Patriots staff in January of 2013 after being let go in Kansas City , who personally worked out Kline at Kent State before the draft , called him after the draft to entice him to sign , and then spent the 13 season working behind the scenes with him and fellow rookies Chris Barker and Braxston Cave as then offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia s right hand man . Daboll is now the Patriots tight ends coach and his experience ( e . g . four years as an offensive coordinator ) and body of work is a reflection of the team s overall strong coaching staff .
