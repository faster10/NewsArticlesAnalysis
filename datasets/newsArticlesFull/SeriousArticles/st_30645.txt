Last week , Abdella Ahmad Tounisi was arrested at O ' Hare Airport because the FBI believed he was on his way to Syria to join a terrorist organization . Tounisi reportedly thought he was in contact with a recruiter for a jihadist militant group , but it was actually an FBI agent . I would love to see the FBI ' s anti terrorism resources used in that matter to stop would be gang members from flooding the streets of the country ' s third largest city . Maybe Cornelius German , the boy found dead down the street from Obama ' s house , would still be alive .
