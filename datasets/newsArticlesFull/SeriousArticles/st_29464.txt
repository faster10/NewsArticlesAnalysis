Boston : Criminals are going to do what they want to do . We have to accept that . We can make all the laws that we want , but it ' s not going to stop people from breaking them . We have laws to prevent that from happening . Just as keeping drugs out of peoples ' hands doesn ' t solve the drug war , gun control is not going to keep guns out of peoples ' hands . The majority of crime is committed with illegally acquired weapons in the first place . What we can do is remove the restriction levels for law abiding citizens who want to defend themselves . This idea of a gun free zone has never stopped a shooting . People never walk up to a school and say , ' This is a gun free zone , so I ' m going to go shoot somewhere else . ' It ' s never happened .
