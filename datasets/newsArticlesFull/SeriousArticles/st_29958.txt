In the short term the Government says the plan is to degrade Isis s capacity so that it can no longer present a significant terrorist threat to the UK or an existential threat to Iraq and Syria . In the longer term ministers claim this will make it easier to broker a ceasefire between moderate opposition forces and the Assad regime along with peace talks and a new transitional Government in Damascus that has broad support from the opposing group in the country . This new Government would then be in a position ? with Western support ? to retake all the territory held by Isis and dismantle the organisation . Mr Cameron claimed that Iranian and Russia involvement in tentative peace talks made such a resolution more likely .
