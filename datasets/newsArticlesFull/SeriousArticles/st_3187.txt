The Congress party , in its objection to the proposed design of GST , has raised three important concerns . The first and the most important is the levy of 1 tax on inter state transactions in goods and services . There is merit in the argument and , hopefully , the government will accede to this , as this is against the very grain of the destination based GST . It will violate the principle of common market and result in inequitable export of tax burden from the rich states to consumers in less advanced states . Furthermore , it will bring in enormous complications in both law and administration when dealing with inter state transactions in services and e commerce .
