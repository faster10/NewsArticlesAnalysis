It is the business of both fashion and its models to represent fantasy , and even plus size versions are regularly digitally altered . Like their smaller peers , these models also have their skin smoothed , their waists and thighs whittled and their many human imperfections , from cellulite to flyaways , fully erased long before their image ever hits the side of a bus or the page of a magazine . Even plus size models are still perfectly proportional and almost impossibly beautiful . They still present an aspirational standard that is unattainable if only because the resulting image doesn ' t resemble the real life model .
