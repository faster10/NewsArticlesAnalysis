The 76ers held the No . 1 pick that season , but drafted Allen Iverson while Bryant slid all the way to 13th . John Lucas , the coach who invited Bryant to those informal workouts was fired before the draft , but Downer ? who has struggled to find the separation between Bryant and Michael Jordan ? still believes someone within the organization should ' ve been able to recognize the talent . " Kobe was 10 minutes away from any Sixers person that could ' ve come and watched him . I ' m not saying that drafting Iverson was a big mistake , that ' s another Hall of Famer . That worked out , " Downer said . " The bottom line is , they could ' ve drafted him right there , No . 1 . Imagine that story . There ' d be a statue right now , outside Wells Fargo Center . "
