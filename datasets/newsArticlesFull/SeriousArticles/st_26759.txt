It doesn t help , I suppose , that Seydoux and Bond don t have much physical chemistry , and the Spectre script gives them none of the crackle that surged between Bond and Vesper in Casino Royale . When the pair fall into bed after a bruising battle on that same train , it feels like they re fulfilling the requirements of their genre rather than being genuinely drawn together . And while telling someone you love him while he s having needles driven into his skull might be merciful but ineffective , ? that s not the same thing as Madeleine s profession feeling ? true .
