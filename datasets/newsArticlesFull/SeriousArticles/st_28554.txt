Obama is so adamant about protecting the image of Islam that he bends over backward to remind us that there is no conclusive evidence that the murderous Islamic couple were acting on behalf of the Islamic State . Then a megalomaniac strongman steps forward , and he starts screaming about travel bans and deportation , and offering promises to keep all of us safe , which to some and I think actually to many more than those of us in this body seem to understand , to some will sound much better than not being protected at all .
