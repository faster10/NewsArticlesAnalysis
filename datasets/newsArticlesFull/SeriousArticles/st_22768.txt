And that raises a question . If you can t stop ideas from crossing borders ? if you can t surveil every node of every network , peer into every soul , and know in advance who s becoming radicalized ? then you have to look for some other , more material transaction to monitor or control . The most obvious such transaction is the acquisition of weaponry . In the ideal world of the National Rifle Association ? a world in which guns are freely available and our sole method of regulating their use is through mental health treatment , or sometimes through criminal background checks ? anyone with a clean record can buy all the guns and ammo he wants , without raising any alarms . Including Syed Farook .
