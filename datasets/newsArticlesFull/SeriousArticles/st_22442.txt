" It ' s not spooky . If anything it ' s just a very quick and hard transition from there being so many people like on Saturday , we had 4 , 200 people in attendance . Then to go from that to just the security staff it ' s a big staff , but it ' s also an enormous museum . So you can walk around for long periods of time without seeing absolutely anyone . I wouldn ' t call it scary . I would say it is a different kind of experience , maybe a little bit spooky , but nothing to keep me in my room at night . "
