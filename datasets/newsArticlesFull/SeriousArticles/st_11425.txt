Anyone who argues the Occupy movement isn ' t " clear about its demands " should talk with Tasha Glasgow . Washington ' s hands are tied by Wall Street and won ' t budge to create jobs , force the banks to adjust mortgages and cutour monstrous inequality . So it ' s up to we , the people , taking empty homes from banks that have already taken too much from all of us and giving them to hardworking and needy families . In doing so , the Occupy movement is not only creating opportunity for more and more Americans but also creating a home for the 99 in a political and economic system that has far too often kicked us all to the curb .
