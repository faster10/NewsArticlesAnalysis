I think it s fun to give the fan base something to cheer about , said Cousins , who was here in 2012 but will make his first playoff start . I felt like the last couple of years they were dying to cheer for us and we just didn t give them enough to get behind . So I love the thought of giving our fans something to get behind , something to be proud of and we take great pride in our ability on Sunday afternoon to give them something to cheer about . We ll be very disappointed if we don t . I expect it to be a great environment and just adding those towels and the phrase can only help galvanize our fan base and create a spirit of belief and intensity in that stadium , which is what we are looking for .
