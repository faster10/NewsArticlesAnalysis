Rihanna sings differently on ANTI . Alternatively , Rihanna sings exactly how she has always sung , but the lack of production allows listeners to hear what a delightful edge her vocals have . If we heard Erykah Badu ghost sang Love On The Brain , we may be convinced . On Higher , she sounds like her throat might rip in two , which pairs well with the song s subject matter ? ? as she pleads with ? an ex to just come over and let her try to make it right . The effect allows nuance . While there s nothing wrong with an overwrought power pop ballad , there s a different sadness afforded by to the dejected vocal shrugs of songs like Close To You .
