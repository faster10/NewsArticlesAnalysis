Carney : The truth is we would do it more , but the networks , especially the broadcast networks , are not always willing to say yes . The threshold question is , you know , is it of national significance on a major issue something that the president feels the American people need to hear about ? Matters of military force are the most obvious circumstances that merit a primetime address . There are also issues around significant domestic legislation , or national issues . He did a national speech launching health care reform that was primetime . It ' s not a well you can go back to that often , though , because it requires the networks to give the time . I remember when I was there , we asked for time once and the networks shot us down , which was very frustrating . ( The White House requested primetime real estate in April to tout health care enrollment numbers . ) We did a little research , and there was a pretty good case to be made that the reluctance to give time has increased over the years . The ask we made might have been granted in past presidencies . But that ' s just the nature of the business . I don ' t think it ' s going to change .
