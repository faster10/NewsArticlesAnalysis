The Europeans have been working on an airline passenger name record system for about eight years . It would give authorities access to names , credit card details , travel itineraries and more . The EU has a system for exchanging passenger data with the U . S . , Australia and Canada , but the 28 nations are unable to agree on one among themselves , mostly due to privacy concerns . Draft legislation has been held up in the European Parliament since April 2012 . In the face of the impasse , Belgium ' s prime minister affirmed on Thursday that his country would push ahead on such a system on its own . Britain also has its own system , and other countries are developing them .
