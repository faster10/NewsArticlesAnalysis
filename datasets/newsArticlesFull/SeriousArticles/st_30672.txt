Yes , Sanders ' candidacy stands aloof from the Democratic Party ( how could it not he ' s an independent , not a Democrat ) . But he ' s not promising voters that he ' ll take a torch to party headquarters . Instead , he ' s telling voters that they don ' t have to settle for a preservative presidency . A transformative presidency is possible , as long as the mass movement he gathers is sufficient to the task of running roughshod over the obvious obstacle : a Republican Party that ' s well entrenched in the legislative houses .
