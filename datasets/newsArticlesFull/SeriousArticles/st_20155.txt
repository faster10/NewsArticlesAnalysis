What ' s doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change some 2 . 5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of 1 . 2 trillion in deficit reduction . President Obama and Speaker John Boehner and 35 senators have encouraged the super committee to go bigger to 4 trillion in deficit and debt reduction the amount almost achieved by so called grand bargain that failed to materialize in August . Bipartisan committees like Bowles Simpson and the Gang of Six as well as a plan proposed by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan also set out different paths to a 4 trillion savings , bringing us to a more sound fiscal footing .
