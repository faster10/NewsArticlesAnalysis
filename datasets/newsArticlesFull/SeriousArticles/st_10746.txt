Why To Watch : If the Seahawks are going get back to being a powerhouse and remain the big dogs in the NFC West , then that run will have to start here . They have a very small margin of error now with their slow start and , with a pedestrian 4 3 record within the conference right now , divisional losses could prove crushing . Falling three games behind the Cardinals in mid November would likely expunge their chances at retaining the division crown . It ' s also about time for the Seahawks to re establish their dominance at home . They ' ve dropped one already and they got lucky as hell to survive the lowly Lions in another and this is the first of three straight games at home . Both teams are fresh and relatively healthy coming off the bye together and this is the closest things we have to a playoff vibe type game on the schedule this week .
