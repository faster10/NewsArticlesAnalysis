US Secretary of State John Kerry confirms that Iran has complied with the deal and that the US will lift nuclear related sanctions . President Hassan Rouhani has said a landmark nuclear deal has satisfied all parties except the extremists . He said the deal , which lifts economic sanctions in exchange for a limitation of Iran s nuclear ambitions , opened new windows for engagement with the world . Under pragmatic President Rouhani , Iran has come onto centre stage whereas Saudi Arabia has felt betrayed by the US and the west , and is now facing isolation . It formed a 34 country alliance allegedly against terrorism but the objective seems to be to show that Saudi Arabia enjoys considerable influence in the region . Saudi Arabia was unhappy with the US over refusal to lend air support to Syrian rebels and also for striking a nuclear deal with Iran . But for the US there were other considerations also .
