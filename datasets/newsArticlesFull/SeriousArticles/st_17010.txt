Chinese jitters have caught on with trading coming to a halt on Thursday with the 7 circuit breaker being breached again in the current week . Officially there is a 15 minutes break if shares move by 5 while it gets suspended for a day if it goes past 7 . Given the size of the Chinese economy , being the second largest in the world , and the fact that it has been the guiding force for the movement of the world economy it is not surprising that the world stock markets got spooked sequentially . And judging by the way things are moving , it is unlikely that there will be some sanity any time soon . Just where is the problem ?
