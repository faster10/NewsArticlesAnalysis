In reviewing the album , USA Today ' s Edna Gundersen gave it 3 stars out of 4 , saying , " On ' The Marshall Mathers LP 2 , ' he recaptures the original release ' s wild , clever , emotional brilliance in a flurry of caustic , brazenly honest , rapid fire rhymes and aggressive beats . So what ' s the problem ? Once the bravest visionary in rap ' s underworld , Eminem spends much of ' MMLP2 ' gazing into the past , reworking early tricks and wading in nostalgia rather than forging a fresh path . "
