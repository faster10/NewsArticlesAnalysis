" Michelle and her sons , one of whom was born a few weeks after Gordon was killed , are entitled to recover only the loss of the income Gordon would have earned , minus any income taxes , and minus whatever amounts it is determined he would consume himself . Once that figure is established , an economist would be employed to estimate the present day value of those future losses . As the law stands , that final number is all that BP has to pay Michelle and her sons .
