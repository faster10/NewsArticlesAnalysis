The Alaska Legislature has a history of bucking the Transportation Security Administration . Earlier this year , state Rep . Sharon Cissna , a breast cancer survivor , famously chose to catch a small plane from Seattle to Canada and ride a ferry to Juneau rather then submit to either the full body imager or the pat down . After that incident , the state legislature overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling on the TSA to reconsider its use of pat down searches and urging the U . S . Congress to " exercise greater oversight " of the TSA .
