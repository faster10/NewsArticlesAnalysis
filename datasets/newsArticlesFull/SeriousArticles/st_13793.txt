For starters , by trying to protect Asians from racism , the court issued a disturbingly racist decision based on the fact that these were , in fact , Asians who intended their band name to invoke their ethnicity . But , if a Sicilian ( like me ) were to seek to register the same exact name , with no such intent , I would enjoy that privilege . This isn ' t quite Korematsu v . United States ( the decision that authorized putting Asians in internment camps ) , but the decision is quite unprincipled .
