But increased attention to Trump ' s most recent gambit for veterans has renewed scrutiny of his record . A public relations manager for the Wounded Warrior Project told NBC News on Thursday that they were " not aware of any fundraising efforts on our behalf with Mr Donald Trump . " Last month , when Trump faced a similar stand off with a network ( CNN ) over whether to appear at a debate , he demanded that the network donate 5 million in ad revenue to wounded veterans or he wouldn ' t show up . Ultimately , Trump appeared at the December 15 debate , and there is no record of any donation being made . " I don ' t want to take the chance of hurting my campaign , " he told The Washington Post at the time .
