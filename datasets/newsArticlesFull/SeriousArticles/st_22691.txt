Paul had his one moment when he tagged Trump for not understanding that China is outside the TPP . He came up on the losing end repeatedly on national security as Trump , Rubio and Cruz also voiced support for adequately funding the military . ? Fiorina started slowly , mostly reciting general criticism of big government . She came into her own , however , on foreign policy , giving voice to a tough on Putin policy . ? Kasich likewise had some shining moments , belittling the pie in the sky tax plans , Trump s plan to round up millions and Cruz s willingness to let a big bank fail . What he lacks is a strong , compelling delivery and an affirmative message to excite Republicans .
