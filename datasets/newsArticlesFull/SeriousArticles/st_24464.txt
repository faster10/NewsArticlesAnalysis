Zakaria : I don ' t know if I would quibble with it that much . . . . The problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic , you can ' t declare war against a tactic . But in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world , we needed to track their money . I have no problem with any of that . . . the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent , and if you think he ' s 25 feet tall vs . five feet tall , that ' s important . That ' s a huge misdiagnosis of the problem . . .
