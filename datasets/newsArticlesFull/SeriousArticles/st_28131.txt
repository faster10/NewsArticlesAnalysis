So then , while one can certainly call Sanders a Democrat , one can just as easily call him a social democrat , which is what the Scandinavian countries are widely labeled . When it comes to policies for promoting worker ownership , he is very much a democratic socialist , while on the subject of foreign affairs , it is fair to call Sanders a Democrat ? ? though he is one of the less hawkish Democrats ( compared to , say , Hillary Clinton ) . And , of course , Sanders is not a socialist but if we re being completely honest , the Senator never claimed to be a socialist during this campaign ? you can thank the media , which has no time for technicalities , for that misunderstanding .
