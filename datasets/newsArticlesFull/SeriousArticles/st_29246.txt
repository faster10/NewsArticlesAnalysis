" I think that the smartphone and tablet market is cannibalizing the dedicated handheld market , especially for non core gamers , " said Michael Pachter , videogame analyst for Wedbush Morgan Securities .

I think that limits the attractiveness of dedicated handheld gaming devices and limits their market share . "
