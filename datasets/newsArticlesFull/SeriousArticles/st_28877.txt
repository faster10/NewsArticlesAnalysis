According to the synopsis , there is trouble inside and outside the gate . That seems like a direct hint at the horde making its way towards the community , however , the Alexandrians could have more on their plate . We already know that Morgan is holding one of the Wolves in a cell , but it s unclear if any more of them are hiding out ? or if there is a traitor in the group . And viewers can t forget about the dead bodies lining the streets . If the dead were not stabbed in the head then Alexandria could be dealing with walkers already within their walls .
