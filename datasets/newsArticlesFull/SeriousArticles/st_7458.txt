Two sites that offer great referrals are the American Society of Home Inspectors ' website at ASHI . com and the National Institute of Building Inspectors at NIBI . com . NIBI requires that its inspectors carry errors and omissions liability insurance , which means they accept responsibility for any oversight . You also want someone who is certified by the Council of American Building Officials ( CABO ) , which means they are current on all building codes . Spend some additional money when buying a house and get an inspection . It ' s worth it . And before you sign a contract with a home builder , make sure you inspect the contract .
