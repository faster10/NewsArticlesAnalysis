MARCO RUBIO : This economy looks nothing like the economy of 15 years ago , doesn ' t look anything like the economy of five years ago . And it ' s not just that it looks different . The structure of the economy is different , but the pace of change is faster than ever . There ' s a statistic I always use . It took the telephone , which is an extraordinary invention it took the telephone 75 years for a hundred million people to use it . It took Candy Crush one year to reach a hundred million people as users . That ' s how fast things are changing .
