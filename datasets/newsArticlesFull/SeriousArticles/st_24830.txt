My Center on Budget colleagues describe one payfor that isn ' t so great : the repeal of an Affordable Care Act provision designed to increase enrollment in health plans offered by large firms . The measure had yet to be implemented , but the result of the repeal will mean fewer people with employer sponsored coverage . That saves some money that they ' ll use for this deal . Yes , it ' s robbing Peter of his health coverage to provide Paul with an offset , but this was to be a relatively minor piece of the ACA . In fact , there ' s an argument that some who would ' ve gotten employer coverage out of this requirement may well end up with better coverage from the exchanges .
