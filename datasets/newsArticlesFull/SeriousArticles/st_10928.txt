The Playstation 4 currently runs for 350 , and reached 300 over the 2015 holiday shopping season . This resulted in 5 . 7 million consoles sold between the end of November and the New Year to bring the total number of consoles sold to 35 . 9 million , according to a Sony press release . That gives Sony an affordable and broad base to work with when the PlayStation VR launches later in 2016 . Already owning a PlayStation 4 will make purchasing Sony s virtual reality headset a likelier occurrence .
