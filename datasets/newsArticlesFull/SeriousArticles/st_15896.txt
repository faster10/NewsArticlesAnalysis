The attack at San Bernardino , California on 2 December killing 14 persons and wounding another 21 has further heated up the debate in the US on the threat of terrorism posed by radicalized Muslims . Initially , the US authorities were unsure of the motives behind this senseless and brutal massacre of innocent civilians by Syed RizwanFarook and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , both of whom were killed in a shootout with the police . Later , however , it was revealed that Tashfeen Malik had pledged allegiance to IS on the Facebook and IS subsequently claimed that the San Bernardino massacre was committed by its followers . The US investigators , therefore , now believe that the massacre may have been inspired by IS but they remain of the view that it was not connected toany terrorist network plan . Still , the Republican presidential candidates have hyped their rhetoric on the threat of Islamic terrorism . Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey claimed that the US was facing the next world war . Senator Ted Cruz joined in by stressing that the enemies of the US were at war with it . Jeb Bush described the looming threat as Islamic terrorism that wants to destroy our way of life , wants to attack our freedom . He added , They have declared war on us . And we need to declare war on them .
