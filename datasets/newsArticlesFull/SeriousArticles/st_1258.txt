Zhang booked her place by battling past injured and tearful 15th seed Madison Keys . She had lost all 14 of her previous Grand Slam matches before this year ' s tournament and was mulling retirement , but she has now won four in a row after beating the American 3 6 , 6 3 , 6 3 .

She gamely carried on but was clearly in pain , with tears on court . " Bad luck Madison . She was injured and I ' m very lucky today , " said Zhang . " It was so difficult to concentrate because I could see she was in pain . "
