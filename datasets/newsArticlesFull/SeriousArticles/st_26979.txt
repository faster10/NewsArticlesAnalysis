In fact , when you factor in the locale , the opponent , the defense that was being played and the moment that it came in , I m not sure I can remember the last time that I ve seen a more impressive individual performance than this . Bill Self has led Kansas to 11 straight Big 12 regular season titles and he s lost nine times in Phog Allen Fieldhouse . Scott Drew , who has built a good basketball program at Baylor out of the rubble that was left by Dave Bliss , has ? lost nine times at Phog Allen in his 12 year tenure with the Bears . Oklahoma hasn t won in Phog Allen in Hield s lifetime .
