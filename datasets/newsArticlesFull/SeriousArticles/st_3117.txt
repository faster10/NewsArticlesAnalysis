Ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain . A sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome , he makes an excellent intellectual and smart ass sparring partner for Stark , but when he first appears , he ' s still on training wheels . However , he does recruit Pietro and Wanda to his cause , an easy matter since Stark killed their parents . He ' s not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the Avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying .
