Hansen , who works as a cranberry grower in Wisconsin , started researching her son ' s illness . She found an online chat group with other parents who were discussing medical cannabis , and decided to try one of the commercially available cannabidiol products . But it was difficult .

" They won ' t even prescribe it because there are too many loopholes and too much work , " Hansen says .
