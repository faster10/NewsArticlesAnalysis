Satisfying Iranian needs while sidelining Assad could be more complicated . Tehran is fully aware that there is no Syrian constituency for its tutelage or for national subordination to Hezbollah none beyond the family and its entourage . Perhaps the transitional governing body could go slow in loosening the Iranian Hezbollah grip on Syria . But there is potential hazard in the West signing up for something that could extend or even perpetuate Iran ' s ability to support its terrorist murder incorporated in Lebanon from a safe haven in Syria . Ideally though not likely anytime soon , unfortunately detente between Israel and Iran would enable Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and his Hezbollah leadership team to retire to Qom , leaving the movement ' s Lebanese cadres free to focus on purely Lebanese politics and interests .
