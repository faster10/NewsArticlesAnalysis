Johnson s price hasn t yet caught up with the size of his role as the Cardinals new starting running back , and while Andre Ellington s Week 14 status might influence the play , a 4 , 300 price tag that s 27th among backs expected to be active makes Johnson well worth either your RB2 or flex spot . Yes , the Vikings have ranked better than average in preventing running back scoring from a seasonal angle , but whittle that to the past three weeks , and they ve allowed 100 plus yards rushing in three games in a row , and a 23 . 3 point score to Thomas Rawls a week ago .
