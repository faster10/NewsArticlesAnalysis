I neither adore nor abhor Fenway , but I believe its time has come and gone . I have seen the Yankees , Tigers , Giants , Orioles , White Sox and others erect fine new ballyards for future generations to enjoy . They have done so over the objections of every stubborn cuss who insists that his or her grandkids and great grandkids must attend the old park just because I did and , oh , I love it so . Come on . Let the kids of April 20 , 2022 , and 2032 and 2102 have a pristine , up to the minute place to watch the Sox , a place to create memories of their own .
