It s unlikely that Rock , who unlike Lee and Smith has been contracted to do a job , could walk away from a performance he s been preparing for without serious consequences . Nor would a more widespread boycott likely even register on Hollywood s already white as the default radar . But when you look back to just a few months ago , when the Emmys honored men and women for telling stories that aren t all just about white people , it seems increasingly ridiculous that the film industry can t get its act together to do similar . And even though he ll likely stay on and be an entertaining ? host , Rock s presence on Oscar night won t do anything to change the number of major awards people who aren t white will win . Because it doesn t change how few were nominated in the first place .
