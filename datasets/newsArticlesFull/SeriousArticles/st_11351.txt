With only three picks separating them in the 2014 draft , it is probably inevitable that Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater ( the 32nd pick ) and Raiders quarterback Derek Carr ( 36th ) will draw comparisons over the course of their careers , and to this point they are the shining stars of that quarterback class . ( The two selected ahead of them , Johnny Manziel and Blake Bortles , have not been as successful . ) Bridgewater has the Vikings , who have won four straight for the first time since 2012 , in a position to win the N . F . C . North , while Carr is having a Pro Bowl season statistically , and a wild card playoff berth is not an impossibility for Oakland .
