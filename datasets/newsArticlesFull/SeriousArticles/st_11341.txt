The rules of Go are deceptively simple and no luck is involved . Two players ? one black , one white ? ? start with an empty board by placing one of their pieces or stones on a position , from where it does not move . The winner is the first to fill more than half the board with their stones . It is possible to take an opponent s stone by completely surrounding it with your stones . Children and adults can easily play against each other and a handicap system allows players of different strengths to play with a 50 per cent chance of winning .
