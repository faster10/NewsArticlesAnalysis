" This organization is very much committed to a normalization of our membership to represent both the industry and the country as a whole , " Boone Isaacs told the Los Angeles Times last June when the new class was announced . " For a little bit here we had a quota system , a limit of membership . We thought we were missing out on talented folks that come from all different areas . We lifted that and we have seen an increase in gender , color , age , nationality , all goals we set for ourselves , to be more representative of our audience . "
