The Allstate Sugar Bowl is guaranteed the Big 12 champ , but since No . 3 Oklahoma is in the semifinal , the Sugar Bowl would get the team that finishes second in the Big 12 standings . Right now , Oklahoma State and TCU are tied for second , a half game ahead of Baylor , in the Big 12 . The Cowboys would own the tiebreaker by virtue of their head to head win over the Frogs . The Sugar Bowl is also guaranteed the SEC champ , but since Alabama is in the semifinals , the Sugar Bowl would invite the next highest ranked SEC team , No . 13 Ole Miss .
