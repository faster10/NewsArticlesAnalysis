Although hindered last week after practice caused inflammation in his left knee , Roethlisberger remains excited to take the field on Sunday . He insisted that the aching in his knee that caused him to sit against Kansas City wasn t extreme . I think it was more just a pain , an inflammation setback , Roethlisberger said . I don t think it was a negative injury , or more of an injury type of setback . It was just putting an extra heavy load on it and pay for it just with achiness , inflammation and things like that . Roethlisberger continued , saying that he was disappointed that he wasn t able to play but that the doctors reassured him he hadn t hurt the MCL or bone bruise , but had overused the leg during practice . Once I got through the initial shock of worrying that something happened , then I was fine with it .
