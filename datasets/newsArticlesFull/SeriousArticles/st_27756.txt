Saudi Arabia is not alone in the region in justifying executions and due process violations as moves to stem terrorism Iraq executed 177 people in 2013 , many on terrorism charges and a ten year high , and Iran executed over 800 people in 2015 . While promises made at summits might be quickly forgotten , mass executions , systematic discrimination and the suppression and ultimate beheading of opposition figures is still unlikely to make Saudis or anyone else more secure . Protecting human rights remains part and parcel of countering terror . If Saudi Arabia really wants to lead the counter terror campaign , it should be giving those preaching peace a place of prominence , not a sword to the neck .
