Hello , I have a question regarding the mandatory USSID 18 training . The training states the following : ( U ) The Hierarchy of Governing Authorities and Documents is displayed from the highest authority to the lowest authority as follows : U . S . ConstitutionFederal Statutes Presidential Executive Orders ( EO ) Department of Defense ( DoD ) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) RegulationsNSA CSS Directives and Policies USSIDs SID Management Directives and Policies Office Policies I ' m not entirely certain , but this does not seem correct , as it seems to imply Executive Orders have the same precedence as law . My understanding is that EOs may be superceded by federal statute , but EOs may not override statute . Am I incorrect in this ? Between EOs and laws , which have precedence ? Similarly , between DOD and ODNI regulations , which has greater precedence ? Could you please clarify ? Thank you very much , Ed
