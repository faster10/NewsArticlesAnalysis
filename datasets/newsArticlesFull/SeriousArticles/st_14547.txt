That ' s a smaller decline than what " The Twilight Saga : New Moon " experienced during the same weekend two years ago it fell 64 percent . Nevertheless , " Breaking Dawn Part 1 " is still trailing the past two Twilight movies . The fourth entry in the romantic supernatural series has so far grossed a stellar 247 . 3 million in 17 days . By comparison , " New Moon " had earned 255 . 4 million by this point , while " The Twilight Saga : Eclipse " had collected 255 . 8 million . This will ultimately be a moot point when " Breaking Dawn Part 2 " comes out next November and likely destroys all of the franchise ' s records .
