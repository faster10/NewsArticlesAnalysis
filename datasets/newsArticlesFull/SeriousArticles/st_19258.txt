According to the BBC BuzzFeed probe , 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 ? including at least one grand slam champion ? were allowed to continue playing in the past decade despite being flagged to the sport s anti corruption unit because of suspicious betting patterns surrounding their matches . The ATP strongly insisted that all evidence was followed up and , as acknowledged by all concerned , suspicious betting patterns do not necessarily lead to evidence of wrongdoing . But the biggest problem is that we will never know how to judge progress . Instead critics fear the TIU has gone after low hanging fruit rather than embarking on the painstaking , difficult to prove and tortuous detective work required to prove the less obviously open and shut cases .
