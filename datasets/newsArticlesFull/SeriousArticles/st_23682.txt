When it was over , the win did a good job of showcasing what Romo means to the franchise . He is resilient in a way others aren ' t . He leads like others won ' t . And his ability to improvise and adapt erases mistakes like others can ' t . You needed only a few plays to see it . There was a left handed pass out of the end zone that avoided a safety . There was a reverse pivot on third and long that turned another sack into a completion for a first down . There were many running lanes that remained open for a few seconds longer , if only because Miami ' s safeties couldn ' t afford to cheat against the run .
