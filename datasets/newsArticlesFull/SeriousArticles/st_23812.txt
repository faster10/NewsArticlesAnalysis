Imagine that you were accused of doing something you did not do 12 years ago . You have a staff and your staff figured out a way to make it go away . Good , you might say . I didn ' t do it and it deserves to go away . You then put the issue out of your mind . Then 12 years later , the allegations re emerge . It ' s not unnatural that you start to remember more facts . Some details come back to you . Some don ' t . That ' s the way the human mind works . It ' s not the way political minds work .
