After his strong debate performances , after the endorsements he ' s picked up and after Jeb Bush ' s weakened position , Marco Rubio looks to be the Republican frontrunner at least in the " establishment " bracket of the GOP race . And there ' s the emerging perception that , if the early contests started tomorrow , Rubio would be the odds on favorite to win the Republican nomination . But here ' s what gives us a little pause : Is he built to win in either Iowa or New Hampshire ? Remember , in this modern political era , every GOP nominee has won EITHER Iowa or New Hampshire . Right now , he ' s standing in third place in public polling in both states behind both Trump and Carson . Here was the view of Rubio ' s Iowa presence a month ago : " I ' ve seen other campaigns be much more active and much more aggressive , " Polk County Republican Party chairman Will Rogers told NBC ' s Danny Freeman and Vaughn Hillyard . " After the debate , people realized he is presidential . But I just don ' t fully know or understand what the Rubio strategy is for Iowa . " And when it comes to New Hampshire , consider that the recent GOP winners there have either had geographical ties ( Romney ) or appeal with independents ( McCain , Buchanan ) .
