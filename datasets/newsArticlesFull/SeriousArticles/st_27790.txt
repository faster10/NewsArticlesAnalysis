In a subsequent episode , fans were in an uproar about Ned Stark killing a direwolf ( Sansa ' s direwolf Lady was punished in place of Arya ' s Nymeria , since she had been forced to run off after attacking Joffrey ) . " In the scene right before that , you saw ( Joffrey ' s guard ) the Hound riding in with the butcher ' s boy ( Micah ) on his horse . He had just killed this little innocent kid , and no one was upset at that , " Coster Waldau said . " But then this mystical creature was killed , and that was crossing a line . That was shocking for people : ' How could they kill an innocent animal ? ' " ( Were fans more upset that Robb ' s direwolf Grey Wind was killed in his kennel than his men at their table ? )
