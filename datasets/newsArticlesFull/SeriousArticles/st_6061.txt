HAPPENING TODAY TED CRUZ TO ANNOUNCE ' 2ND AMENDMENT COALITION ' AT IOWA GUN RANGE . At Crossroads Shooting Sports in Johnstown , Iowa , a used paper target is pinned to the wall with Ted Cruz ' s signature on it and a note that says " The fight for Liberty never ends ! " Cruz visited the gun range back in June , just three days after the Charleston church shooting . Today , the Senator returns to the same Iowa gun range for a " 2nd Amendment " campaign event days after another mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , ABC ' s JOSH HASKELL notes . " He ' ll absolutely make note of what happened . But , he is not going to back down or try to glaze over the importance of standing for our 2nd Amendment rights , " Catherine Frazier , Cruz ' s national press secretary , told ABC News . " It ' s an appropriate conversation to have in the wake of this shooting with liberals coming right out of the gate calling for more gun control and policies that would dilute our 2nd Amendment rights . " At the Iowa campaign event , in a state where the Texas Senator has seen momentum as of late in a dead heat with Donald Trump in last week ' s Quinnipiac University poll Cruz will unveil his " 2nd Amendment coalition . " The coalition is made up of over 24 , 000 members from across the country , 1 , 000 of whom live in the four early primary states . http : abcn . ws 1ToV69u
