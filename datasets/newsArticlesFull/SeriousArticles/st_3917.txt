Willems : That ' s a tough question . Besides dumb luck , I ' m not sure . I do have a couple of rules that I place for myself in my books . The first is a mantra , which is : Always think of your audience , but never think for your audience . What that means is to leave it open to interpretation . I ' m not telling things , I ' m asking questions . And I ' m asking questions that I don ' t necessarily have the answers to . The other formal thing that I do is that I make sure that the characters in my books in this ( ' That Is Not a Good Idea ! ' ) case , the chicks in particular are characters that a 4 or a 5 year old can draw : infringe on my copyright with great ease . So a lot of my design work is reductive . I make drawings , then I try to take as many lines out , so that it ' s at its easiest to copy .
