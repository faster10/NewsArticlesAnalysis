' We are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem , ' said Dr Raftery . ' If we had started the prevention programmes five years ago , we would have been saying , " We need to get it down from five concussions per 1 , 000 hours . Now we know it ' s going to be at least 10 . 5 if not more and I think we ' ll see another increase . We are getting far better compliance around concussion but we don ' t believe we have finished this process . We ' ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area . If there ' s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we ' ll investigate it . '
