The distinctions between the two teams lineups are perhaps even more dramatic than those between their rotations . The Mets rely on homers ( ninth in the majors ) the Royals did not ( 24th in the majors ) . The Royals high contact approach , which made both walks and strikeouts rarities , led to a high average ( third in the majors ) the Mets willingness to trade strikeouts for power and walks led to a poor average ( 28th in the majors ) . The Royals ran a lot ( fifth most steals in the majors , fifth best success rate ) the Mets remained largely stationary ( second fewest steals in the majors ) .
