What to do about Tamba Hali and Derrick Johnson ? Each player needs a new contract if he is to return next season . The two linebackers are among the longest serving Chiefs , Johnson arriving as a first round pick in 2005 and Hali coming as Kansas City s top pick the following year . There s a sentimental attachment to each player , but the Chiefs need to decide this on what s best in a football sense . Each played well this season and the Chiefs could conceivably squeeze one more productive season from both players . But Johnson will be 34 at this time next year , Hali 33 . The Chiefs , who drafted Dee Ford in the first round in 2014 to be Hali s eventual successor and Ramik Wilson in the fourth round in 2015 to eventually replace Johnson , have planned for this day and they may decide it s best to move on from one or both .
