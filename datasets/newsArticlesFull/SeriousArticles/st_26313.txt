Scripted by a team that included Schulz s son and grandson , The Peanuts Movie is scrupulously faithful to the original characters : Charlie Brown is still a perpetual loser Lucy a melodramatic , bossy big sister Linus the voice of wisdom Snoopy the reckless dreamer masquerading as a common pet . ( It s so faithful , in fact , that those of us who grew up with Peanuts will recognize much of the recycled dialogue . ) Director Steve Martino ( Ice Age : Continental Drift ) pays attention to the details , and some of the visuals feel creative yet true to Schulz s vision ? particularly Snoopy s lush , ongoing dream saga as a World War I flying ace .
