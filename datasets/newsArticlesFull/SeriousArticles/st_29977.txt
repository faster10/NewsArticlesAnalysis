Will the United States be next ? Picking where terrorists will strike next is usually a fool s game : Terrorists have their grand designs , but they are also highly opportunistic , and much depends on the skill of the intelligence and police services that oppose them . Attacks a decade ago in London , Madrid , and elsewhere were followed by warnings of imminent doom for Europe , but this did not materialize . The United States has seen few attacks since 9 11 . Part of this is because the United States has made massive investments in counterterrorism , and the FBI and intelligence services have focused on the Islamic State since it declared itself . We could say the same about France ? that jihadists wanted to hit France was no surprise , and French intelligence was on alert ? so knowledge and preparation alone are not enough of a solution . But the United States historically has not had a large and restive Muslim population that is hostile to the government : quite the opposite . In addition , far more French Muslims have gone to fight in Syria than have U . S . Muslims . So while both have a problem , America s is far smaller , and it would be a mistake to extrapolate directly from France s experience to that of America .
