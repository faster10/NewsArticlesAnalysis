Left unspoken is what happens if North Carolina has an ACC title and a win over the team the committee has ranked No . 1 every week since the start of November ? Does that jump North Carolina over Ohio State and Stanford ? Could Clemson lose and stay in the top four with potentially a better resume than Ohio State and North Carolina ? In that scenario , would the Tigers need No . 2 Alabama to lose to Florida and knock out the SEC ? Long said it ' s possible Clemson could lose and stay in the top four , but I don ' t know all the other factors that would play into it .
