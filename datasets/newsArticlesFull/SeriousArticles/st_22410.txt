( HA ) : Is there is excess oil to be put on the market ? I am not sure there is more oil . I think all countries at the moment are pumping their capacity , if we are talking in real terms . If we are just telling the market there is some excess if something happens , then that is another situation . In my opinion everyone is at full speed , enjoying high prices , but there is no excess capacity immediately . Maybe there is 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 extra with one of the producers , but no more than that .
