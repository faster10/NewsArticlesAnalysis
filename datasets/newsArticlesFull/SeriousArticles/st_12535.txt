FCC s uncollected fines : The Federal Communications Commission has yet to collect more than 100 million in fines it has announced against companies in the past two years , Politico writes . That has sparked criticism from members of Congress who say the agency is chasing headlines but not following through on enforcement . The outstanding cash includes about 100 million in penalties proposed in 2013 against nearly a dozen companies accused of defrauding the FCC s Lifeline low income phone subsidy program , as well as 35 million against a Chinese company for allegedly selling illegal wireless jamming equipment in June 2014 .
