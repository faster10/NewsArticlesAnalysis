I think this idea of brutal violence as some kind of sophisticated signaling device strikes me as highly unlikely . Far more likely is that this is a pretty thuggish regime that is consolidating power by creating external threats and enemies , but we probably should be open to any signs that they do want to have negotiation . I myself doubt that this is the moment that they want to do anything . They know that that door is open the president has a very capable emissary , Stephen Bosworth , who is his envoy on this topic , very well versed in this issue , former ambassador to South Korea , and my sense is that the North Koreans have not reached out to him .
