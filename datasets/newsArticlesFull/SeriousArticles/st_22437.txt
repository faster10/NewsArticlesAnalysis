Wind sculpted dunes , a sparkling blue freshwater lake , and a historic lighthouse all await visitors here . Set aside a day for roaming the path at William M . Tugman State Park , which circles Eel Lake and its many inlets , and expect a few wildlife encounters along the way . The nearby Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area contains the largest coastal sand piles in North America and offers an array of arduous hiking opportunities . Travelers looking for a more laid back excursion , however , can make their way to Umpqua Lighthouse State Park for relaxing walks and a glimpse of the 65 foot tower known for its distinctive red and white flash .
