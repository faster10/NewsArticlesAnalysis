Katherine Wise , a spokeswoman for Paxton , told TIME that the attorney general s office will continue to pursue a lawsuit against both the federal government and the International Rescue Committee , a non profit that works to resettle refugees , to determine whether federal authorities are complying with the requirements under the 1980 Refugee Act . The state argues that the law requires federal authorities to regularly consult with , and provide information to , state and local officials in advance of resettling refugees in those localities .
