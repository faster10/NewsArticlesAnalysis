Matthew Stafford at Rams : Stafford has had two of his best three fantasy performances of the season in the Lions past three games and is averaging over 24 fantasy points per game in that span . On paper , this doesn t look like a great spot for Stafford and the Lions offense as a whole , but the St . Louis defense has been decimated by injuries and has proven rather mediocre of late . The Rams just lost top edge rusher RE Robert Quinn ( back ) and SS T . J . McDonald ( shoulder ) to I . R . on Wednesday . In addition to those two , WLB Alec Ogletree ( leg ) has been sorely missed since going down early in the season , and starting CBs Janoris Jenkins ( concussion ) and Trumaine Johnson ( thigh ) are hurt and may not play . The Rams haven t been pressuring the quarterback , aside from All World DT Aaron Donald , as he s the only player on the roster earning his paycheck each week . In a dome with the Rams defense decimated and St . Louis giving up on its season , this is an underrated spot for Stafford . Be sure to add him where available before he gets the Saints in Week 15 .
