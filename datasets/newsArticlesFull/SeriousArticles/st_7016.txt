I think maybe , Roethlisberger said . I guess that s weird to say , maybe yes and no . I think that defenses and other teams are very aware of injuries . I know that when we re playing against a certain defender and we know , say a defensive back has an ankle injury , we don t necessarily target him to say , Ok , how can we hurt him ? But , we know that maybe he can t cut as well or can t run as well . So , maybe some players do aim for injuries , I would hope that people would respect the game and the players enough that they wouldn t do that , but I guess you never know .
