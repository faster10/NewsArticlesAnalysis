The mere fact that Republicans are even making the attempt to exercise control over what questions they get is pretty wimpy , when you think about it . After all , a part of the job of being president is occasionally holding press conferences . So what are any of these guys going to do if they become president ? Demand pre approval of any question asked ? Is that really what Americans want from their leader ? Some sort of veto power over the press ? It ' s mind boggling when you really think about the implications of Republican candidates trying to tyrannically exert control over the free press , in fact . If any of them are elected president , they are going to like it or not have to take questions from journalists , some of them openly hostile to their agenda . But they ' re wimping out on doing so during their primary campaign .
