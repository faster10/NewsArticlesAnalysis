The Patriots can ' t run the ball . They don ' t even try . That ' s fine against most defenses , but the Broncos are the best in the NFL against the pass . They also led the NFL with 52 sacks . If you allow that front seven to rush the quarterback with no real fear of the run , that could be a problem . It could lead to some turnovers as well . That ' s how the Broncos can win : Keep the score close with a great defensive performance , win the turnover battle and pull out the victory at the end .
