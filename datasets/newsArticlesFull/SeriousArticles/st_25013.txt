I was born at time when more than a few sadly misguided black folk openly supported a black caste system based on skin color and hair texture and length the closer to white , the better . Although few openly promote such a system today , vestiges of that thinking remain . The ranges of skin color and hair type among black folk are from deep , rich blue black to can ' t tell you from a white person and hair can be short and coarse nappy to coarse and long to straight and long and all in between .
