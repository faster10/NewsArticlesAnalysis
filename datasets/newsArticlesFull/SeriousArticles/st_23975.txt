( JA ) : My ethos is that it is an art form . If your character is going to take a beating , then you do too . For example , the book scene where Matt picks up a book and rams it into my throat , smashing me into the cabinet the book was squishy but the core was solid . We messed around to see if I could hold the book and make it look like he was hitting me . In the end I said , " Matt , just do it . What is the worst that can happen . " And he was like , " Are you sure ? " So we go for it and we hit the cabinet so hard the doors come off . Everyone was worried . But when we looked at the playback we knew we got it .
