In painting Cruz as a supporter of legal status for undocumented immigrants , " the Rubio campaign is spinning , " said Mark Krikorian , an immigration activist who was working to scuttle the 2013 bill . " My sense is Cruz ' s amendment was clearly intended as a poison pill for the Democrats . It was a legislative tactic . . . You often introduce measures you hope will be poison pills if you ' re trying to kill a piece of legislation . Now , it didn ' t work in the end but it was a perfectly plausible attempt . I might ' ve voted for it myself it I was in the Senate , to try and kill the bill . "
