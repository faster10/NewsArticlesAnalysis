So that ' s where this has landed . Hardy has spent one training camp and two regular season games with the Cowboys . He ' s got three sacks and eight tackles . The team hasn ' t won a game with him on the field yet . But he ' s been given this monumental gift : He can say stupid things and argue with Dez Bryant and even manhandle the special teams coach . Why ? Because he ' s a leader ? Because he earned it ? Has Jones seriously set the bar this low for Hardy ? Does he need him so badly that he can ' t even admonish a player for putting his hands on a coach in the middle of a game ? What if that were Garrett ? Would it be OK then ? And what does all of this say to the rest of the team ?
