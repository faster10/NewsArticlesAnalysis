When you look at the people he s been around , it s amazing , he said . Whether you like him or not , I love listening to Bill Walton Luke s father on television . He knows so much . And Bill Walton is in the Hall of Fame . Then he s been around John Wooden , Hall of Fame . Larry Bird Bill s teammate in Boston , Hall of Fame . Kevin McHale also Boston Hall of Fame . Kobe Bryant , Hall of Fame . Phil Jackson , Hall of Fame . His college coach was Lute Olson who is also in the Hall of Fame . Think of all those guys he was around just as a little kid .
