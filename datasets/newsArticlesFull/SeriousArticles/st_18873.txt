There are a lot of very obvious metaphors in this section with Eastman , such as the cell , which has a door that was never really locked . Morgan is in a prison of his own devising . Even when he discovers that he can get out of the cell , he chooses to stay in there instead of on the couch . When Eastman opens the door for him , he slams it shut . Eastman also cuts the point off of Morgan s spear and turns it into the blunted staff we ve seen him carrying since his return to Alexandria . He has dismantled Morgan s method of murder .
