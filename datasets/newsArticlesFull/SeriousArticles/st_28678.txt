Darwyn Cooke : I ' ve always been a big fan of crime fiction . When I was young I started reading a lot of the classics like Raymond Chandler , James M . Cain , Dashiell Hammett , Cornell Woolrich I could go on and on . At that time the Parker novels were out of print , but I happened to see the Lee Marvin film " Point Blank , " which is one of my favorite movies , and realized later that it came from the Parker books . So I started haunting secondhand book shops and picking up the Parker novels and just completely fell in love with them . I thought they were the perfect crime novels , at least for me . So it ' s been kind of a 30 year love affair with the books .
