Cruz has been playing the long game with Trump to perfection since the real estate tycoon jumped into the race this summer , traveling to Trump Tower to pay his respects in July , inviting the Donald to his anti Iran deal rally in September , and recently suggesting he d want Trump working in his administration . Through it all , Cruz has kept one eye on the GOP front runner s legion of angry fans , positioning himself as one half step closer to sanity than the blustery billionaire . Cruz s hope is that when Trump fades , he ll be the most obvious fallback plan for Donald s supporters ? while looking ever so slightly more electable to a GOP establishment that will be relieved to have woken up from its Trump sized nightmare . ( Cruz appears to have found success using a similar strategy with Carson and his evangelical supporters . )
