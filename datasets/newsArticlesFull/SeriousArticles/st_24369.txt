Gahan : I think some of that stuff comes from the way I used my voice . I go to a very visual place when I ' m singing . It ' s very cinematic and I get this feeling of space . I love when music does that . I listened to David Bowie a lot when I was a teenager . The place that he seemed to be singing from is the place that I wanted to go to . I didn ' t know if that place really existed , but I believed it did . I tried to capture that same magic again on this record . It ' s a place you go to when you listen , where you just feel a sense of belonging . Or , not feeling a sense of belonging and that being OK .
