The idea that moderators should have some sympathy with the GOP or even be GOP primary voters , as some candidates have suggested , is deeply misguided . An ideal moderator should understand and grill the participants on the differences between the candidates and the issues of interest to Republican voters that , however , does not require the moderator be a Republican . There is , we should acknowledge , a shortage of mainstream media figures who actually understand conservatives and don t operate based on negative stereotypes , but that goes to a larger problem of ideological homogeneity in the mainstream media . The point here is that having a stake in the debate s outcome is precisely what the GOP should avoid . The GOP should not seek to replace liberal antagonists with conservatives likely to show favoritism toward one or more contenders .
