Advantage TBD the turnover battle : Ole Miss was the only team to beat Alabama this season , and they needed five turnovers and 24 points off turnovers to win by just six points . Even the Tide ' s closest wins have all been way closer than Nick Saban would like because turnovers . if Florida is going to hang around and have a shot to win in the fourth quarter the Gators will likely need at least one turnover ( probably two ) and short enough fields so Treon Harris isn ' t tasked with stringing together long drives that may or may not end with converted field goals .
