At the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he ' s just in the process of getting himself together and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well established language of support shirkers . The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he ' s too poor to pay his child ' s support . If he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments .
