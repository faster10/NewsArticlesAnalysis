And that brings us to tonight ' s episode . We watched as Morgan stumbled upon a cabin in the woods , occupied by Eastman ( played rather beautifully by John Carroll Lynch ) , while still in the depths of his madness . Slowly , Eastman was able to get through to Morgan , bringing him back to something resembling sanity while imparting upon him the study of Aikido and a hesitance to take any life , regardless of circumstances . Naturally , Eastman fell prey to a walker bite before episode ' s end because this is The Walking Dead and anyone who isn ' t an indiscriminate killing machine never survives for very long .
