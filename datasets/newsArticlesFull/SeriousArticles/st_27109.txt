It appears likely or probable that in 2014 and 2015 we have seen a slight upsurge in urban crime ( feeding Republican paranoia ) along with an obvious wave of mass shootings , largely but not exclusively carried out by the stereotypical white male loners ( and thereby feeding liberal outrage ) . Every gun murder should be viewed as a preventable tragedy , of course , and every mass shooting stands as a profound indictment of our national obsession with violent fantasy and our narcissistic tendency to confuse spectacle and reality . Our murder rate remains three to four times higher than those found in generally similar multicultural democracies like Britain , Canada or France , and I m not saying that should be viewed as an acceptable standard .
