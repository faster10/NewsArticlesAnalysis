Dreamworks Animation ' s " Puss in Boots " was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from 3 D screens , and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters . On paper , that number sounds good and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster but the result comes with a " Real Steel " ish caveat . " Puss in Boots " cost 130 million to produce , and it earned Dreamworks ' third worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only " Flushed Away " and " Antz , " which started with 18 . 8 million and 17 . 2 million , respectively . The 3 D " Shrek " spinoff , cost as much as Dreamworks ' " Megamind , " which opened in early November 2010 , but that film began with 46 million , and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a 148 . 4 million total .
