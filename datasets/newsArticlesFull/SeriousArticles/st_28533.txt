The 2015 Royals didn t strike out a lot , featuring the lowest strikeout rate in the majors during the regular season by a wide margin ( 15 . 9 percent the next closest team were the Oakland A s , at 18 . 1 percent ) . The Royals ' two strike success in the World Series was just a continuation of that regular season ability . While the Royals deserve a lot of credit for the quality of their at bats ( the ability to foul balls off contributed to their success ) , Mets pitchers also showed a detrimental tendency when the count was in their favor ? they threw too many pitches in the strike zone .
