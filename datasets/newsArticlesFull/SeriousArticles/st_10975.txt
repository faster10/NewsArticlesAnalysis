Jolie : I always hate speculation on the news , so I don ' t want to be somebody who speculates . Um but I think it ' s clear , I think , I think you know a displaced unstable population is you know is a very what happens in Iraq , and how Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East . And a big part of what is going to affect how it settles is how these people are returned and settled into their homes into their community and brought back together and whether they can live together and what their communities look like , so it does have broad implications .
