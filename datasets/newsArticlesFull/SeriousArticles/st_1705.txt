When it comes to sports , there are a few pretty obvious no nos . For instance : Never challenge Usain Bolt to a foot race , never pick a fight with Ronda Rousey and never take on Michael Jordan at any age in a game of one on one . And , of course , never , ever poke the bear that is the Bill Belichick led New England Patriots . John Elway seems to get that , but it appears the rest of the Denver Broncos missed the memo , trash talking Tom Brady Co . ? leading up to Sunday ' s AFC Championship Game .
