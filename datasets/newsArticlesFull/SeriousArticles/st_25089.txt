There isn t much else of any substance in Trump s agenda beyond making America great again and having so many victories they ll be coming out of our ears , ? so it s difficult to say where else they might differ . But it s fair to say that any campaign between the two of them would be very , very ugly . One can imagine Trump raging about Bloomberg being a liberal and ? a soda Stalinist , not to mention ? some dark insinuations about the former mayor s ? religion . ( He made them about ? Ben Carson ? and ? Ted Cruz s , after all . ) Who knows how Bloomberg would respond ? All we know is that he has an immense war chest and is willing to use it .
