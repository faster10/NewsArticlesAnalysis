The whole tone of the movie is spontaneous , rolling , experiential . It ' s got some laugh out loud lines , especially when the two jump into the politics of Sadie ' s middle school , or when Pete is dealing with the business he owns , a struggling boutique music label devoted to the white guy indie rockers he grew up with and still thinks are cool . The joke is no one else does not even Graham Parker ( playing a version of himself ) , Pete ' s latest relic legend , who knows his records won ' t sell .
