3 . Sell the stuff you no longer want : When I moved to New York from Chicago a year ago to be with my long distance boyfriend , I used the opportunity to unload all the crap I no longer wanted or needed . I sold furniture , home goods , clothes , accessories , and my car ( no need for one in Manhattan ! ) . In addition to hosting a yard sale where I made about 200 bucks for candles , pots and pans and old Halloween costumes , I used out of Craigslist and eBay , both before my move and after I arrived when I realized I still needed to unload quite a bit to fit into my boyfriend ' s one bedroom apartment .
