For candidates whose appeal is not based on solid political rationale , but on a heady mix of emotion and patriotism , the shock of discovering that emotions change , and that fans can go as quickly as they come , can be hard to accept . When populists go sour , they blame the system , the media , and sometimes even the voters . Who can forget Farage s attack on the audience during a general election debate ? When candidates build a personality cult around their candidacy , they are susceptible to bitterness when the candidacy falters . When personality politics starts to falter , maybe it just becomes unbearably personal .
