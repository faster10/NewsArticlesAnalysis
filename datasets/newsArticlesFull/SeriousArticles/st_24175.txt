I spent a decade running neuroscience experiments to understand why humans are , much of the time , moral . We expect others to be honest , trustworthy , and kind and are outraged when they are not . As I report in my recent book The Moral Molecule : The Source of Love and Prosperity , my experiments showed that a then largely ignored brain chemical in humans , oxytocin , motivates moral behaviors . Oxytocin does this by producing the feeling of empathy : When we are emotionally connected to others we tend to treat them well . My studies showed this was true even between complete strangers .
