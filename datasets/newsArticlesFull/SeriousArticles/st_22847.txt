Perhaps , for example , negotiations could configure and install a transitional governing body created on the basis of mutual consent , exercising full executive power , and excluding regime ( family and entourage ) figures for the sake of peace and national unity while permitting Assad to retain , until national elections , the presidential title and all immunities ( perhaps extended indefinitely on an emeritus basis ) pertaining thereto . Assad could then repair ( perhaps in the company of Republican Guard elements ) to the presidential compound in Latakia , where he could be free ultimately to trade in his legal immunities for a run in internationally supervised national elections . Who knows ? The prospect of a quarter million wrongful death lawsuits and a referral to the International Criminal Court might not dampen his enthusiasm for a political campaign even one in which most voters would have experienced displacement and other grave indignities at his hands .
