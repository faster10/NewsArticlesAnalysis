Don t undersell that part , right ? " Stevens said . " Those guys can make shots that other people can t make at a very consistent rate . For Curry to be shooting 46 percent from 3 is a joke for how tough some of his shots are , and just tells you how great of a shooter he is and how good he is with the ball , because his shots are all challenged . Everybody goes through the game plan with the idea of trying to make it as tough as possible on both he and Klay Thompson . And they still make really tough shots . So it starts with that . Their defense is great . They get you on back cuts because you re worried about the guards . They just have a lot of weapons . That s for sure . "
