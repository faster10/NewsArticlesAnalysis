Dubai has also become a crucial outpost for China , with more than 2 , 000 Chinese companies registered in the UAE . While many have visited the sprawling Dragon Mart complex where low cost Chinese goods are sold wholesale , an estimated 180 , 000 Chinese people reside in the country , including senior figures for state run banks who negotiate joint investment opportunities in Africa with Western companies . The Dubai International Financial Center ( DIFC ) is their neutral meeting ground , offering a one stop shop for legal , financial , accounting and other services . The UAE also wisely plays a neutral game of multi alignment with the superpowers : major arms deals with the U . S . , massive energy exports to China , and billions in investment from Europe . Whether or not China is able to avoid the " Malacca trap " by building pipeline and railways across Central Asia to the Middle East , it will still need Dubai as its hub for its growing reach into the Middle East and Africa .
