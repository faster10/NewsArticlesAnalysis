Cooke : The first thing I do is create a working script out of a copy of the novel . I read " The Score " six or seven times , and as I ' m passing through it , I ' m making notes , highlighting scenes , maybe breaking a chapter down , writing down a visual cue , cutting out things that are extraneous . Then I sit down and start laying it out visually . I ' m able to follow the novel very much like a script . I never type a script for Parker . I end up handwriting in pencil onto the art board right out of the novel . At that point , I start combing over it again . I ' ll start playing with scenes , maybe if I shuffle the order I get a more unexpected result . The process leading up to me sitting down at the art board can be as long as a year . Then I sit down at the table and it ' s about a four month process . When I work on Parker , that ' s all I do . I just immerse myself in it .
