Parker resting : San Antonio point guard Tony Parker is sitting out Friday ' s game , getting the night off to rest . The 33 year old has played in all of the Spurs ' first 23 games , and his absence tonight against the Los Angeles Lakers likely means big minutes for Patty Mills ( 3 , 600 0n DraftKings ) . Mills is a great bargain at this salary and should have plenty of opportunity to accumulate stats against L . A ' s porous 29th ranked defense . Other Spurs backups are also worth looking out for in a game where San Antonio is favored by 14 . 5 Ray McCallum ( 3 , 000 ) and Kyle Anderson ( 3 , 200 ) are two young players with a chance to get more run if the game gets out of hand .
