So , why didn ' t these women appear on Romney ' s radar screen until after the organizers of MassGap supplied the now derided binders ? Perhaps the administration held the common view that women suitable for leadership positions are exceptional or rare . Maybe they thought that women have so many competing obligations that they would not be available for high level political jobs . Maybe the Romney inner circle recruited only from its own male dominated ranks . Whatever the reasons , women ' s full integration into the workforce was an afterthought .
