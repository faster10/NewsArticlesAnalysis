A state legislator just a few years before he began running for president . A one term U . S . senator even less engaged than Obama , who never held a meeting of the the important subcommittee he chaired . A personable person of color with the difference being that his actual constituency , Cuban Americans , is a very small and atypical minority of Latinos . And his origin story is false . His family didn ' t flee Castro ' s Cuba , as Rubio long claimed , they moved to Miami years before the Communist revolution .
