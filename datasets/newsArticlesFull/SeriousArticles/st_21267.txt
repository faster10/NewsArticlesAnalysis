Many people will have heard of Hope , a young female black rhino that was brutally wounded by poachers . This was the second operation to try to save this animal s life . Some poachers use a dart gun and tranquilize the animal so as not have to fire a shot that would be heard . They then hack their face off while the animal is paralysed . Local communities saw her stumbling through the bush and then alerted the authorities . Thanks to Dr William Fowlds and his team , Hope survived and is making a speedy recovery .
