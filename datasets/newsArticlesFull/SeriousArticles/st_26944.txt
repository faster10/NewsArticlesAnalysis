The law of war exists specifically to restrain brutality in war , protect innocent civilians from direct attack and minimize suffering . It prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and using them as human shields , requires humane treatment of the wounded or detained personnel , obligates parties to respect and protect medical aid providers , mandates efforts to facilitate delivery of humanitarian relief , and imposes criminal responsibility on those who disregard these obligations . These basic and essential protections apply during any armed conflict .
