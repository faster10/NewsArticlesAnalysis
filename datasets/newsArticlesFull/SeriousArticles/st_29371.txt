Sean McDermott : The Panthers are headed for their fourth straight year as a top 10 defense . The defensive coordinator deserves much of the credit . McDermott ' s ability to create schemes to pressure the quarterback with whoever is on the field has been key . This defense is not predicated on one player , as McDermott proved earlier this season when the Panthers went 3 0 without Pro Bowl middle linebacker Luke Kuechly . The unit has 24 sacks in its seven games without end Charles Johnson , who is returning this week from injured reserve . Last year was a challenge early , after Hardy was placed on the commissioner ' s exempt list prior to the third game . McDermott had spent the entire offseason and training camp preparing with Hardy and ultimately needed three players to replace all that Hardy could do . But McDermott eventually found the right mix and his defense rocketed to 10th in the league by season ' s end after being as low as 28th . Look for McDermott to be among the prospects for a head coaching job after this season .
