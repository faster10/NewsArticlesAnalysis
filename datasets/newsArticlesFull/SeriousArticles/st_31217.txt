The difference between the two candidates is self evident Christie has governed as an unapologetic centrist Republican with a no nonsense focus on fighting for fiscal discipline rather than an obsession with social conservatism . He has built cross aisle coalitions , even on controversial policy proposals , and reached out beyond the base . He puts problem solving ahead of partisanship or ideology . In other words , Christie is pretty much the opposite of Cuccinelli , and that ' s why he is winning in an otherwise ugly year for Republicans .
