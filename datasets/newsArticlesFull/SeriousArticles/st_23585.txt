Part of the challenge is that , although large companies clearly want to help , they have to navigate complicated priorities that distinguish them from governments , such as shareholders , profits , brands and market forces . Just as importantly , these high profile companies could face real safety risks . When Twitter shut down ISIS affiliated accounts last year , for example , a prominent ISIS supporter called for the assassination of Twitter employees . Given recent attacks in Paris and Sydney , these kinds of threats are chilling . The Obama administration will therefore need to figure out how to help companies navigate the inherent risks of the private sector countering violent extremism .
