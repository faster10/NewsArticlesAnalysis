Briggs reiterated Sanders s LGBT rights cred , which includes voting against don t ask , don t tell and the Defense of Marriage Act in the 1990s as well as supporting civil unions in Vermont in 2000 . I have had occasion in my life to defend marriage , to stand up for marriage , to believe in the hard work and challenge of marriage . Bernie Sanders , while he may have voted correctly , he has not been a leader , he has not been at the center of any of these debates . Sanders has long opposed anti gay laws , signing a Gay Pride Day proclamation in 1983 when he was mayor of Burlington , Vermont .
