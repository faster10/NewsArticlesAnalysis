? Sack by Josh Norman for loss of 14 : The Seahawks had scored touchdowns on each of their first two possessions of the second half to make it 31 14 . Early in the third possession Seattle had stunned Carolina with a converted fake punt , so even a field goal would pull Seattle to within two scores , applying further pressure on the Panthers . But on second and 10 at the Carolina 43 , with 1 : 51 left in the third quarter , the reeling Panthers played a conservative coverage with two safeties deep and no credible threat of a blitz . Seattle went to an empty backfield with the three receivers to Wilson s left and two to his right requiring linebacker Kuechly to align favoring the three receiver side . With Doug Baldwin in the slot opposite Kuechly , Wilson understandably chose his concept on the two receiver side : Baldwin down the middle between the safeties , and Marshawn Lynch aligned wide and running a shallow in route . Wilson had a high low read on the overhang defender , Pro Bowler Thomas Davis , aligned over Baldwin . When Davis retreated deep , Wilson from a clean pocket should have quickly whistled the ball to Lynch , who was separating from cornerback Norman in zone coverage . Instead , Wilson reacted to pass pressure that really wasn t there and he commenced his Fran Tarkenton scramble routine which has been so fruitful for the Seahawks . With no one in his zone , Norman reflexively rushed the quarterback and quickly hogtied Wilson to create third and 24 and force a punt two plays later .
