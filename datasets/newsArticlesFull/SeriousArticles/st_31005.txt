We are not the Israelis . We do not live in an environment of threat and insecurity , one in which our citizens serve in the military and that service is inextricably linked to our culture , values and perception of the world . We do not face existential threats . Nor is our political establishment conditioned to accept asymmetrical trades with terrorists that can reach such proportions as the prisoner deal with Hamas for kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilead Shalit , who was traded for 1 , 027 Palestinian prisoners . But we claim to be a moral nation with values and principles that coexist alongside our interests .
