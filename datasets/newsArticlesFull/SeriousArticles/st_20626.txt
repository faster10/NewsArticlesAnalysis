On balance , the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and over the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the FOMC s goal of maximum employment . However , less progress has been made on the second leg of our dual mandate ? price stability ? as inflation continues to run below the FOMC s longer run objective of 2 . Overall consumer price inflation ? as measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures ? was only 0 . 25 over the 12 months ending in October . However , this number largely reflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that , in turn , has pushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products . Because food and energy prices are volatile , it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those two categories ? known as core inflation ? which is typically a better indicator of future overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation . But core inflation ? which ran at 1 . 25 over the 12 months ending in October ? is also well below our 2 objective , partly reflecting the appreciation of the U . S . dollar . The stronger dollar has pushed down the prices of imported goods , placing temporary downward pressure on core inflation . The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect effects in holding down the prices of non energy items in core inflation , as producers passed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy related costs . Taking account of these effects , which may be holding down core inflation by around 0 . 25 to 0 . 5 percentage point , it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States has been running in the vicinity of 1 . 5 to 1 . 75 .
