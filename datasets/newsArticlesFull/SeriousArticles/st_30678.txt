Hultsfred , according to National Geographic , plows through 150 , 000 loose cubic yards of pine saw dust every single day . This in addition to the spruce trees thrown into massive wood chippers , that combine with the saw dust and a vile glue like mixture containing synthetic urea to make the particle board . The factory churns out so much of the stuff that a giant dryer capable of holding 45 tons of the saw dust wood chip mixture refills every hour before sucking all the moisture out of the former trees at a temperature of 840 degrees Fahrenheit , National Geographic reported .
