Wolf Hall has secured three nominations ( including the biggie , best TV Movie or miniseries ) but otherwise our homegrown shows seem to have been neglected . Peter Kosminsky s take on Hilary Mantel s doorstop of a novel and its sequel Bring Up the Bodies was rich and textured , indeed everything that Downton Abbey ( a Golden Globe favourite in the past ) was not . The sole nomination for Froggatt would indicate that the US has finally fallen out of love with Julian Fellowes s high class soap . A nomination for Idris Elba for Luther does , arguably , feel as if it s more to do with the weight and charisma of its star than any critical approval for Neil Cross s dark and disturbing storylines .
