It ' s terrible what happened to Laquan McDonald , getting shot down by police . It ' s a shame the black community doesn ' t protest more when all these young children are killed . Tyshawn Lee , 9 , was shot in the head . Kyrian Knox , 2 , was cut up and thrown into the Garfield Park lagoon . If people in the black community got angry with all these young teenagers and children getting killed , maybe it would help stop the crime and violence . Chicago would be a better place to live . Unfortunately , the community only seems to get worked up when a police officer is involved . What Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke did to McDonald is 100 percent wrong , but the black community has to get more involved .
