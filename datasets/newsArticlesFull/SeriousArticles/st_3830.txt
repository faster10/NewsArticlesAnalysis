Tonight s debate is likely going to be a slugfest between Tump , Carson and Bush with the rest trying desperately to make some kind of an impression . But I would keep my eyes on the Senators from Texas and Florida . In the unlikely event that Republican voters realize that they actually have to nominate something other than a sideshow act , these are the two freshest acts in the game . Their politics and policies may be appallingly out of step with the majority of the country but the juxtaposition with the older Sanders and Clinton on the other side could be a powerful symbolic image . And after what Trump and Carson and the rest of the clown car have done these last few months , the Republican image needs all the help it can get .
