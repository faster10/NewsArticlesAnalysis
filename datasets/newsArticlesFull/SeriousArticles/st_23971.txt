Unfortunately , there have been reports of senior citizens being placed in " observation status " and having received hefty bills from hospitals because of it . There was even a class action lawsuit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services alleging that hospitals use " observation status " to punish seniors by making them responsible for more of their bill .
