Tawil , a U . S . citizen and a Palestinian Muslim originally from Jerusalem , is confident that Trump s comments and advertising will not damage Islam s place in the broader Cedar Rapids community . He cites strong relationship with law enforcement and local political leaders , his role as a community chaplain , and his prayers that have opened Cedar Rapids City Council meetings . Interfaith engagement has also expanded since the 1990s . We are part of the fabric , Tawil says . I don t know what they want , what end results Mr Trump is asking for ? Concentration camps ? That is why the community will not back them up .
