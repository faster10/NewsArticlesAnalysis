In 2016 , against a Republican like Trump or Cruz , they will probably side with the Democratic candidate , whether it s Clinton or Sanders . But Bloomberg complicates things . He governed New York as a business friendly , socially liberal mayor , interested in gun control , public health , and public safety . And while he reached out to minority communities ? winning 50 percent of black New Yorkers in his 2005 mayoral re election race ? he also resisted pressure from minority communities to end programs like stop and frisk . His final election victory reflected this : Bloomberg won 67 percent of whites , including 59 percent of white Democrats and 70 percent of white independents . Blacks , on the other hand , supported his opponent 76 percent to 23 percent , and Latinos rejected him 55 percent to 43 percent .
