Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney raises his arms after winning the Orange Bowl NCAA college football semifinal playoff game against Oklahoma , Thursday , Dec . 31 , 2015 , in Miami Gardens , Fla . As a team , the Tigers recorded nine tackles for loss in Thursday ' s game , including five sacks . Watson , who was named the game ' s offensive MVP , passed for one touchdown and ran for another . Ridley had eight receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns , and it was his 50 yard reception in the second quarter that set up the first touchdown of the game that really cleared the plumbing for Alabama ' s offense . The Tigers ' only national championship came in 1981 , and only this season did we learn via Swinney that " Clemsoning " aka Clemson finding freaky ways to lose is no longer a thing . We knew we had to close it out , and when you ' ve got Deshaun and Wayne back there running like they can , it makes our job easier .
