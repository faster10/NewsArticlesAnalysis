As for Caine and Ramping , there will surely be calls for their heads over the next few days , and that s not fair either . Rampling is close to 70 and Caine in his 80s . They were raised in a different reality . How different are they than most other members of their generation ? ( April Reign , who started the OscarsSoWhite movement , has called Caine s comments disappointing , which will be one of the milder reactions . ) We ll all be out of step with something if we live long enough . Then again , the ? average age of Academy voters , who are also overwhelmingly white and male , is 63 ? and calls to revamp Academy membership reflect an awareness of what those statistics ? can mean .
