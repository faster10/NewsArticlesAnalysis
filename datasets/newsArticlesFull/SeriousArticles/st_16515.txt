Zakaria : Not in the short term . These are understandable choices America has to make . The entire industrialized world is facing very similar budget deficits . We have probably five years to try to bring our budget into some kind of manageable situation . And if we can ' t do it within five years , it suggests two things . One is that the trends at that point become so deep that fixing them at that point becomes very difficult . And the second thing is that it becomes a signal to the world that we really cannot get control of our budget . And at that point , I do think that America ' s reputation , its credibility , its ability to borrow vast amounts of money all will come into jeopardy .
