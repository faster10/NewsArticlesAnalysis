It ' s important to clarify exactly what happened to start the fourth , because Butler didn ' t sit for the full 12 2 run . A David Lee lay up at the 9 : 15 mark gave the Celtics an 8 2 start , after which the Bulls called a timeout to slow the momentum and get Butler and Pau Gasol back in the game . The Bulls then allowed the Celtics to score the next four points until Butler made a jumper with 6 : 07 remaining to make it 87 79 . In other words , Butler sat while the Celtics built a substantial lead but needed more than three minutes to make a direct impact on the game .
