St . Louis Rams at Cincinnati Bengals : After three straight primetime games , the Bengals are back to their usual 1 p . m . ET kickoff time , with few eyes and little expectations . We know this team performs best under those conditions . Perhaps those two losses were the best thing that could happen to Cincinnati . A little pressure is off , Andy Dalton can just go about his business , and the fan base can take a second to catch its breath . I can t see the Bengals losing a third straight game .
