A main reason for Saudi Arabia acting unilaterally is its disappointment that the US reached an agreement with Iran over Tehran ' s nuclear programme . Again this looks naive : close alliance with the US is the prime reason why the Saudi monarchy has survived nationalist and socialist challengers since the 1930s . Aside from the Saudis ' money and close alliance with the US , leaders in the Middle East have always doubted that the Saudi state has much operational capacity . This is true of all the big oil producers , whatever their ideological make up . Experience shows that vast oil wealth encourages autocracy , whether it is in Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Libya or Kuwait , but it also produces states that are weaker than they look , with incapable administrations and dysfunctional armies .
