The Patriots were without a touchdown until the fourth quarter , when Brady hit Julian Edelman on a 7 yard pass , then ran it in from 5 yards for another touchdown . But a 2 point conversion try to make it a one score deficit failed , as did the ensuing onside kick . On Sunday , it s back to Denver , for another AFC title game , and another shot at reaching the Super Bowl . The road hasn t been all that kind to the Patriots during the postseason , with an overall franchise record of 6 9 . Then again , with Brady and Belichick , they ve rarely had to leave home and make a trip .
