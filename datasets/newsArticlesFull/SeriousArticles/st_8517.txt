The Real Clear Politics polling average shows that the GOP field has split into three parts . The obvious separation at the top puts Donald Trump and Ben Carson far ahead of the rest of the field . Those two outsiders together account for 49 . 2 percent , making each of them the frontrunners by double digits over their nearest competitors . The next tier belongs to Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz , the two first term senators who have distanced themselves from the rest of the pack at 11 . 8 percent and 9 . 6 percent , respectively . Their strong performances in an otherwise dreadful CNBC debate last month gave the pair a boost that has eluded others in the field .
