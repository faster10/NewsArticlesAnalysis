Nevertheless , on a postcard perfect Sunday morning five days ago when my local gurdwara , or house of worship , was attacked by an apparent white supremacist , I was very much a Sikh , doing whatever I could . After the shooting , my Irish American husband David and I rushed to Oak Creek and joined the group of Sikh men and women standing in the parking lot of a bowling alley across a boulevard from police vehicles surrounding the temple . We held hands , offered presence and solidarity . Only three commandments are given to Sikhs : work hard , share with your neighbors , take the name of the lord . Only the last two were possible on that day .
