To be honest , after covering 32 Super Bowls , these big fan festivals ( even with rad zip lines ) are not something that gets my adrenaline pumping . But if you are a big NFL fan , you will definitely enjoy Super Bowl City . My one tip would be to visit Super Bowl City sometime before Wednesday or Thursday , when out of town fans will start to arrive in large numbers . On the other hand , if you just want a taste of the Super Bowl hype and hoopla and don ' t want to fight the traffic , there ' s enough stuff going on in Santa Clara and San Jose that ' s also free .
