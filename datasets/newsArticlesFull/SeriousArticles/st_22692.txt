Olivier Rousteing : Pierre Balmain has always been a big designer like Christian Dior or Monsieur Saint Laurent , and when I had this opportunity to take ( on ) the house I just felt so flattered . . . it was an honor for me . And at the same time I wanted to bring back the archives because Pierre Balmain was known for the Jolie Madame silhouette , amazing tailoring and the most incredible embroideries , but I wanted to twist it with my edge , my generation . And I was excited to express all these feelings all my culture I had today with all the past of the house which is so huge and so interesting and impressive .
