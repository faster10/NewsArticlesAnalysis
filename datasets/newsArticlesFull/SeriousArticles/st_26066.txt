Dolls are built on the notion of fantasy . They are not true to life but even less true , by nature of their technical limitations , than cartoons , which benefit from animation that ' s often so precise as to appear real . As toys , dolls take on many of the characteristics that the child playing with them chooses to impart . Part of parenting is to help children explore the many options that life offers , to tap into the vast reaches of their imagination , but also to know the difference between what ' s fiction and fantasy and what ' s reality .
