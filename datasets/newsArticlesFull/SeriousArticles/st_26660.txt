Pizza : Don ' t leave Chicago without trying some of the famous deep dish pizza . I was rushing to make my flight , but fortunately Giordano ' s ( various locations throughout the city ) accepts take out orders half an hour in advance , even in the morning . Since there was a huge line for dinner the night before , in the morning I ended up ordering ahead and then eating half of it right there at the restaurant while my colleagues unhurriedly ordered at the table . Before their food came , I ran to get a taxi to the airport with pizza box in hand .
