It ' s an attack that goes straight after the PLC ( programmable logic control ) software of an industrial machine , which is effectively the brain of the unit . It uses four zero day exploits in one package , with a zero day exploit being an undiscovered flaw in a piece of software it ' s the time between the hackers finding a hole in the system and when the developers patch it .
