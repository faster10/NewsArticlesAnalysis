Minutes later , The Huffington Post and scores of other outlets began reporting ? that Donald Trump , who ' s leading the race to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016 , wanted to stop all Muslims from entering the U . S . I started getting little news alerts on my phone , ? explaining that Trump was ? characterizing all Muslims ( more than 1 . 5 billion of us ) as " people that believe only in Jihad , and have no sense of reason or respect for human life . " Each ping was a reminder that someone with a lot of money and a lot of popular support would like to keep me from returning to my friends and my life . I wondered whether I would trigger Trump ' s " Muslim " alert . Would my name do me in ? The country I was born in ? My aversion to bacon ? Perhaps we could negotiate if I mentioned that I quite like chorizo ?
