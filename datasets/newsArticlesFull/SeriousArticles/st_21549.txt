Nick Saban can smile ! A real smile . A smile that didn t appear to hurt his face or his soul ! Amazing . Even he must be able to acknowledge the accomplishment that was his fifth career national title at two different schools . Saban trails only Bear Bryant s six titles all time now . But not to disparage Bryant in any way ? partly because doing so risks me being assassinated by a Bama fan ? but Saban s mark is more impressive considering the era in which he has accomplished it . Bryant s championships of the 60s and 70s came when there were fewer programs competing at a high level .
