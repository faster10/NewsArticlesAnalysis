MJ : It depends on what team I m coaching . If I m coaching a team that has the ability to post up , I m going to take advantage of the size in the post . We re going to force them to defend on the block and we re going to force them to play big if I have a big man that can post up . Defensively , you have to pay attention to detail . The way they hurt you is Steph Curry open shots , Klay ? Thompson open shots , missed assignments in transition , missed assignments in halfcourt defense . You have to stick to principles and understand the gameplan and have gameplan discipline . Their spurts kill you . Three threes and that s nine points on the board . Those guys have proven they will make these shots . So you have to be disciplined enough to put together 48 minutes of basketball . Make them defend and then try to disrupt them at times . But they re a great basketball team . You can do all those things and still lose to them .
