The Warriors were without starters Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut , the Raptors got one of All Star point guard Kyle Lowry ' s best ever scoring nights , and the hosts looked to have the momentum heading into the final few minutes against a group in the midst of its longest road trip of the season . No one could blame the Warriors for falling under such circumstances .
