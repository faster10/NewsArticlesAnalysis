Since the parties separated , A M ' s defense has taken a step forward and LSU ' s has taken a step back . After being in the bottom 30 in the country in yards per game allowed , the Aggies are 49th nationally this season , 47th in yards per play and tied for 34th in scoring defense . LSU , under new defensive coordinator Kevin Steele , is 35th in yards allowed per game , 50th in yards per play , and 58th in scoring defense , a far cry from where Chavis typically had LSU ' s defenses ranked in his time there .
