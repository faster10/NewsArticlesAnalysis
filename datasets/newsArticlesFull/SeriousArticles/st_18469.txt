If I was the Chipotle CEO , I would be having my food safety team in my office yesterday asking , What happened and what do we need to do to make sure this doesn t happen again , said Marler , who represents nearly 50 Chipotle customers who say they were sickened in the August food safety incidents in Minnesota and California . I guarantee the cost of any change they need to make to make their food supply safer pales in comparison to the losses they have had in just last 24 hours on their stock price .
