The first president born west of the Mississippi River was Iowa native Herbert Hoover . The 31st president of the United States left Iowa for Oregon to live with relatives after both his parents passed away in his youth . Hoover , however , never forgot his Iowa roots . As he described , I prefer to think of Iowa as I saw it through the eyes of a 10 year old boy . Those were ? eyes filled with the wonders of Iowa s streams and woods . They saw days filled with adventure with participation in good and comforting things . Hoover lived most of his life outside the two room house he was born in West Branch , but wanted his first home to be his final resting place . When he died in 1964 thousands of people lined the streets from Cedar Rapids to West Branch for his funeral procession . Today , the house and gravesite are a National Historic Site . ?
