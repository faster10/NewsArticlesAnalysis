Russell : Statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal . Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations . Ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants ? Abortion without any women ? Marriage rights without any LGBTQ people ? We knew it ' s crazy to start another media platform , but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase . Sometimes you just need to interrupt !
