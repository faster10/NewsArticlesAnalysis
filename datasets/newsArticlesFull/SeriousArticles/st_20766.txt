Crais : It was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing . You should have seen my office . I have these huge black foam boards on the wall , and tacked to them , I have these white punch cards with my story ideas , scenes and notes . I kept juggling these cards and amending them , making little scrawls on them . Notions came to me , things changed , and I literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards , trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as I could make them .
