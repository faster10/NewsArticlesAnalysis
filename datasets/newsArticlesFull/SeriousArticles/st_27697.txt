Foreign policy : The biggest challenge going forward for President Obama will likely be foreign policy . Nuclear negotiations with Iran , sanctions on Russia and ISIS will all be issues that expected new Senate committee heads like Bob Corker , R Tennessee , and John McCain , R Arizona , will be champing at the bit to challenge President Obama on . Of course , most of these issues can be managed tactfully by the President if he decides to act swiftly as opposed to simply bickering with the opposition . A final deal developed with Iran and the U . N . Security Council can be signed , sealed and delivered by the November 24 deadline if the president acts fast enough . Any tougher sanctions bills coming out of Congress in 2015 would look foolish when the President has already negotiated a deal . McCain will be calling for boots on the ground to fight ISIS , and while that is something President Obama has stood against , the reality is that sending " security " support to the Middle East could assuage some of McCain ' s blood lust and curry favor with other hawks over the next two years .
