Never before has the channel between Ellesmere Island and Greenland been this ice free in mid summer it ' s usually blocked with ice until August . Over the past week we ' ve placed GPS trackers and time lapse cameras on and around the Petermann Glacier , in anticipation of it losing a piece of ice around 100 square kilometers in size . Massive cracks are spearing across the " tongue " of this enormous floating ice shelf ( 16km wide and 80km long ) heralding one of the biggest glacier calvings ever recorded in the northern hemisphere .
