As Christie sees his stature increase in the GOP race ? in terms of his New Hampshire poll numbers and the attention he s getting from rival Super PACs ? it s worth examining the state of the Rubio campaign four weeks out until Iowa . We wrote yesterday how Rubio has a path to success in the early states ( the GOP establishment rallies around him , GOP voters care more about electability and a contrast with Hillary Clinton than anything else ) . But right now , that establishment cavalry hasn t arrived ? it screams volumes that Rubio hasn t released his 4th quarter fundraising totals . ( You would have thought that Rubio s impressive debate performances , plus Bush s sinking chances , would have produced a stellar fundraising haul . ) And while four weeks is a very long time in politics , GOP voters seem ( for now ) transfixed on Trump and Cruz . Don t get us wrong : Rubio still has a good shot at winning the Republican nomination . But that shot doesn t seem as easy to make as it looked a month ago . And it becomes harder when you have to fight a two front war ? against the establishment in New Hampshire and ? against Cruz in Iowa .
