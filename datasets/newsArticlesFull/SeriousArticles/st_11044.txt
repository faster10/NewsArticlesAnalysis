The other side of that argument , though , is naturally that Kelly is responsible for some of those very choices . He inherited Vick and Foles , and Barkley was only an afterthought during his first draft , but Kelly had a meaningful role in signing Sanchez as a backup and was the guy in charge when the Eagles traded Foles as part of a lose lose challenge trade for Bradford . You can understand Kelly ' s logic to some extent both Sanchez and Bradford were athletically gifted quarterbacks with significant pedigrees who had failed to live up to expectations during their first stops around the league but neither has managed to work out in a meaningful way in Philly .
