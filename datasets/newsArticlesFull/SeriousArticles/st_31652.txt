French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe : " With him , we lose a great European conscience and France loses a friend . The French have not forgotten the meeting between the dissident and his companions with President Mitterand in Prague on December 9 , 1988 . They have not forgotten the courage and the force of conviction of the herald of human rights . They remain very attached to the legacy of the poet president , a man of letters who became a statesman , an author of the most beautiful pages in the history of democracy . "
