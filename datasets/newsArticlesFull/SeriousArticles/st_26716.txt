Sallis : I ' m a hundred plus pages into a novel about Driver seven years further along , when the mob shows up , apparently to kill him . After that , back to reworking the draft of " Others of My Kind , " about a woman abducted as a child and kept in a box under her abductor ' s bed , and who is now one of the world ' s good people . A brief portion of this appeared in my friend Patrick Millikin ' s anthology Phoenix Noir . Oh and a lot of playing festivals and coffee houses with my band , Three Legged Dog .
