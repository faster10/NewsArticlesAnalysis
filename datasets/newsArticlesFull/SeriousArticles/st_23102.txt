I love Miami s starting lineup . Love it . My trepidation about ranking the Heat higher is that I just don t know what they are going to get from the bench . Gerald Green had a fantastic preseason , looking more like the budding star from Phoenix in 13 14 than the bricklayer he was with the Suns last season . And rookie Justise Winslow looks ready to play right away . From Chris Bosh s lung , to Dwyane Wade s knees to Luol Deng s , well , everything , the Heat starters badly need the support of a strong second unit . If it gets help , Miami could blow away my expectations .
