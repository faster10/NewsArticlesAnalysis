To put how prolific a pop artist Rihanna is in context , Madonna released her debut album aged 25 . When Rihanna was 25 , she was seven albums in . Between her debut in 2005 and Unapologetic in 2012 , Rihanna has only gone without an annual album once , with 2008 being a fallow year . Fast forward to 2016 , the longest wait Rihanna s Navy has had to endure before she dropped a record , and in the run up to Anti , there were three promising tracks , American Oxygen , FourFiveSeconds ? and the brilliant Bitch Better Have My Money . None make the cut here .
