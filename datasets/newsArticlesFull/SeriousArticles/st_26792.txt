Carolina Panthers fans are the most fair weather fans you ll ever find . Most of them only know a handful of players on the roster and bail on the team at the first sign of any struggles . I ve been a Cowboys fan for 30 years and I live just outside of Charlotte . The Redskins used to be the team that was shown on television in the Carolinas until the Panthers came along , therefore there are lots of Redskins fans in our area . If the Panthers were an AFC team they would have more support in the Carolinas . But the fact is , Redskins and Cowboys fans around here don t want to support another NFC team . There are lots of Steeler fans in the Carolinas too and they are more supportive of the Panthers because they only meet the Panthers once every four years .
