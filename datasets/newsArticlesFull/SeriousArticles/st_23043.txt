In this illustration of the early solar system , the dashed white line represents the snow line the transition from the hotter inner solar system , where water ice is not stable ( brown ) to the outer Solar system , where water ice is stable ( blue ) . Two possible ways that the inner solar system received water are : water molecules sticking to dust grains inside the ' snow line ' ( as shown in the inset ) and carbonaceous chondrite material flung into the inner solar system by the effect of gravity from protoJupiter . With either scenario , water must accrete to the inner planets within the first ca . 10 million years of solar system formation .
