Something similar actually happened in 2013 , when Ben Affleck was snubbed in the director s race even though ? Argo ? had scored seven nominations . The oversight became a Hollywood cause celebre , and ? many believed the outrage over Affleck s omission actually buoyed Argo s chances and paved the way for its Best Picture win . There s a chance that Scott could do the same for The Martian . Scott has worked for decades , directed classic films of every genre , and is much admired by the current generation of leading actors . He has never won an Oscar a lot of voters would like to give him one . ?
