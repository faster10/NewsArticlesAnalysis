Japan ' s biggest outdoor festival takes its name from Mt . Fuji , the site of the first festival in 1997 . Fuji Rock has been set amongst the cool forested mountains of the Naeba ski resort for the past ten years gondolas and hilly trails transport people from stage to stage , and the streams and forests between them are the reason why Fuji Rock has been called the most beautiful festival in the world . It ' s not just about the scenery , though over 100 , 000 people will trek through the mountains to see headliners Franz Ferdinand , The Killers , and Weezer .
