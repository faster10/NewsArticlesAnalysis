Let s go back to speed and distance , basic stuff we all remember from school . At cruise speed , a jet fighter of any kind is likely to travel at around 800 1000 kmh , that s more than 10 miles or 16 km per minute . This means , as we ve established , if warnings were issued five minutes before the missile was launched , the threat aircraft would have been more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the border . At that distance it would have been impossible to tell where the SU24 would have been in 5 minute s time , especially considering that the Russian plane was , by the Turkish radar data , actually moving away from , or at least parallel to , the Turkish border .
