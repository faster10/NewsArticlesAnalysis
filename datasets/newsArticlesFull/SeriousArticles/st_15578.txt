Pour one out for broadcast : For the first time ever , no broadcast show is nominated for comedy musical series , which boasts four streaming shows and two HBO shows . While it ' s cool to see the Globes embrace streaming in such a big way , there are very deserving network comedies that could ' ve should ' ve been nominated , like Black ish , Fresh Off the Boat , The Goldbergs , The Last Man on Earth and The Grinder ( at least Rob Lowe got in for the latter , but we must know : Has Dean Sanderson won any Globes ? ) If it weren ' t for Empire on the drama side , there would be no broadcast shows up for the top series prizes . The drama category , however , already went through this broadcast less threshold four years ago .
