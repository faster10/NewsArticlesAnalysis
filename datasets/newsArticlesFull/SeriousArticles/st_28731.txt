All of your devices will communicate with each other . Where one drops off another will pick up . Your self driving car will share push notifications from your smartphone , turn it over to your Google Glass when you park and start walking , and then a smart home can take over when you walk through your front door . ( Thanks to GPS on your phone and car , the house knew exactly when you were arriving and turned on your favorite TV show . ) Streams of data from all these devices will be collected in one place where a company like Google will analyze it and learn about you over time , programming hardware and software to meet your unique needs .
