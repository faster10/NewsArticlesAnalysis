Not only was Manning not throwing it well , but he wasn t making good decisions either . His interception into the middle went to Vernon Davis , who was tightly covered by two Chiefs . His third interception went right to linebacker Josh Mauga . Manning hasn t thrown the ball great since his neck surgeries , but still put together an unbelievable second act of his career by knowing where to go with the ball and running the offense to perfection . That still shows up at times , but it s mixed in with an unnerving amount of mistakes . When Manning badly underthrew a pass down the sideline that was picked off by Ron Parker , Kubiak finally had to get him out of the game .
