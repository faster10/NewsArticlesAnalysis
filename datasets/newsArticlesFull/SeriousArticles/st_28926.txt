LaMarcus Aldridge , in particular , struggled to keep up with the pace . The four time All Star and most important acquisition of the offseason went just 2 for 9 for five points with just three rebounds in 25 minutes . Aldridge had the worst plus minus ( 20 ) of anyone in the game , and he did not ease the concerns about how he ' d fare defensively when Golden State went small . It would be grossly unfair to pin a blowout like this on Aldridge alone , but it was a discouraging performance from a player who has generally fit in extremely well in San Antonio .
