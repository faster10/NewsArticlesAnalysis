We live in a culture and a country now where people win elections by promising to cut government spending so our votes mean we are also responsible for our bad roads and failing schools and decaying infrastructure .

Thousands of children will have their development affected by lead poisoning because a corner cutter did not want to pay a 100 daily bill for a city ' s water and because wretched pipelines have never been replaced .
