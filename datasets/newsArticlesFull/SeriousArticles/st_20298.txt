This new production of the A . R . Gurney play , directed with a winking eye and a buoyant heart by Daniel Sullivan , casts Matthew Broderick as Greg , a man who has grown fed up with his work and perhaps a little itchy in his marriage . There ' s never any question that Greg and Kate love each other , but they seem to want different things at this juncture in their lives . Kate , an ambitious teacher played by a wonderfully wry Julie White feels newly liberated in their empty nest , and is eager to move forward in her career .
