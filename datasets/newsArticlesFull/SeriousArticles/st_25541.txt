The cause of this tragic increase seems very clear : The city s new water source ? the Flint River ? has enough chloride in it to corrode the lead pipes that compose the aging , local water distribution system , thus releasing the toxic metal into the community . With good reason , Flint is now being used as a wake up call to prevent lead exposures by updating America s aging water systems . The best solution would be to replace our lead lines systematically and proactively , not just one crisis beset city at a time , writes Chris Sellers for the Conversation . Until we do so , it s a safe bet that more Flints lie on our horizon .
