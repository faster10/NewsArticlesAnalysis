And finally , some ( mostly bad ) news from the Secret Service . The non bad part : they ' ve given Trump the code name " Mogul , " which is kind of amusing ( he got to pick it from a list of " M words , " apparently , so it ' s anyone ' s guess what else was on that list ) . What is not amusing , however , is the news that a Secret Service agent has been arrested for " sending obscene images and texts to someone he thought was a young Delaware girl , sometimes doing it while on duty at the White House . . . . Lee Robert Moore sent naked photos of himself to the undercover officer and asked to meet in person to have sex , according to the complaint . " This is a guy who worked gate security for the White House , deciding who to allow into the grounds . What is wrong with this agency ? It ' s seen several changes in leadership , and still seems to be nothing more than a fraternity of sex obsessed morons . Story after story emerges , and still the culture doesn ' t seem to change .
