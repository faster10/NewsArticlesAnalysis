Minor league home run king Mike Hessman says he is retiring as a player and will pursue a career as a coach . Hessman became the career home run leader for US based minor leagues in August when he hit a grand slam to pass Buzz Arlett with his 433d homer . The 37 year old Hessman is often compared with Crash Davis , Kevin Costner s character in the movie Bull Durham , and perhaps fittingly , Hessman s slam was his last home run . Hessman was a 15th round pick by the Atlanta Braves in 1996 and spent 19 seasons in the minors . He also played in 109 big league games spanning three teams and five seasons , last appearing in the majors in 2010 .
