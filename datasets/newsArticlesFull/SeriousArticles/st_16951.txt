The Packers need to hold onto the ball . Last time against Arizona , Green Bay turned it over a season high four times . Six times this year the Packers have turned it over two or more times and they are 2 4 in those games ( three of those times Green Bay had an even or positive turnover differential and was 2 1 ) . Defensively , the Cardinals had a streak of nine consecutive games forcing at least one turnover snapped against Seattle . At the end of the stretch Arizona had caused 11 turnovers in three games . So the Cardinals are more than capable of turning the game around on one play . Offensively , Arizona went four straight games with no turnovers , but have had five in its last two games .
