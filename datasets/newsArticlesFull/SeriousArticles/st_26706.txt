You know , I went to the school of life . I ' m not particularly smart in terms of education . I ' m a smart lady , though ? I like learning about things , and I make decisions based on knowledge rather than on a whim . But sometimes I feel a bit out of my depth , and I blame that on where I ' m from ? and , you know , it ' s not that . I ' m very proud that I ' m from Tottenham . I don ' t live there anymore , and I don ' t go back that often , but I ' m very proud that I ' m from there . It ' s completely made me who I am , and I think it ' s one of the reasons that I ' ve managed to hold on to myself and keep myself together . We ' re very humble in Tottenham .
