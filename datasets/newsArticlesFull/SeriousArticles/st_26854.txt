These revenue increases fund tens of billions of relative giveaways over the next five years . This is as tax and spend a move as they come ? as long as we keep the emphasis on relative . There are still big cuts to be made in spending on public services , but they are not as big as they looked a few months ago ( see the chart below ) . One might discern a pattern here : remember how Osborne aimed for a surplus of more than ? 20bn in last year s Autumn Statement , which was later revised down to about ? 10bn ? The strategy is psychologically acute : paint the scariest picture you can , than carry out something slightly less painful , and even the strongest fiscal consolidation on record will come as a relative relief .
