The Royals were easily the best offense in baseball when it comes to making contact and avoiding strikeouts . In a related matter , they enjoyed quite a bit of success against hard , radar gun popping fastballs . In fact , they were baseball ' s best against the hard stuff . In the World Series , they ' ll be facing a Mets rotation that ' s filled with guys who sit mid 90s , at least . So the Royals will need to flash this rare skill of theirs against the fire balling likes of Matt Harvey , Jacob deGrom , Noah Syndergaard , and Steven Matz .
