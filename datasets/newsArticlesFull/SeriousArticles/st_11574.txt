Start fast : Carolina has outscored its past five opponents 111 17 in the first half . That includes a 31 0 blitzkrieg of Seattle in last week s divisional playoff game . The Panthers ranked second during the regular season with an average of 6 . 6 points in the first quarter . That number goes up to 7 . 7 in home games . The fast start typically means quarterback Cam Newton and the no huddle offense are in rhythm , which is important . Fast starts are a big reason the Panthers have lost only one game . Slow starts have been a pattern for the Cardinals in their three losses . They scored a combined 25 points in those games . They were outscored 30 6 by Seattle in their regular season finale . It s important for Carolina to take advantage of the home field crowd and get momentum from the start to force Carson Palmer into playing catch up .
