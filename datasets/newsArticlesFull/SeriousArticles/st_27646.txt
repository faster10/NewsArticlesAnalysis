Halley did not live to measure the next transit of Venus , in 1761 , but others mounted worldwide expeditions that did the trick . The best measurements of that transit were made by Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason , of Mason Dixon line fame . Today , we can measure interplanetary distances far more accurately than the transit method allows , though amateurs can still contribute their measurements using an app from Astronomers Without Borders . As for the specialness of the transit , well , it ' s rarer than passages of Mr Halley ' s famous comet .
