One tradition that my clan adopted from our hometown of Maracaibo , Venezuela in fact , it ' s common in several Latin American countries is to wear a new pair of yellow underpants on New Year ' s Eve and into the following day . It ' s supposed to bring good luck . My husband , who is American , was amused to hear of this custom when I told him about it back in 2006 . Later that same day , he came home with two pairs of underwear : Mine were simply yellow , but he could find only a pair of SpongeBob Square pants boxers for himself . Two pairs of lucky underwear now top our holiday shopping lists every year . Natalia Gustafson , Baton Rouge , Louisiana
