While this tale might be wagging a bit too far into believability territory for some , and the casting may stretch it too far not to snap into offensive for others , it should be noted that wild , inventive casting of show business legends is nothing new . Todd Haynes 2007 biopic of Bob Dylan , I m Not There , employed six actors to play the folk hero who went electric . Along with Heath Ledger , Christian Bale , Richard Gere , and Ben Whishaw , vignettes feature Cate Blanchett and a Marcus Carl Franklin , an African American actor who was eleven at the time , to play Bob Dylan .
