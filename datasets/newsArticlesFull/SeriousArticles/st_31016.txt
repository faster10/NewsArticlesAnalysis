The great US talk show Dinah ! was required lunchtime viewing for a generation of mums , the halt , the lame , the unemployed and college waggers throughout the 1970s , and I hotfooted it home from school to catch the classic 1977 episode with guest stars David Bowie and Iggy Pop . Their appearance was listed in the TV pages of the Listener . It seemed too good to be true . Watching it now , on YouTube , it still seems like some kind of hoax these two degenerates on a show dedicated to family entertainment and American blandness .
