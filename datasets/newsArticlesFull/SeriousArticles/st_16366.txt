So does that make her a hypocrite ? Not necessarily . While coming to the aid of banks probably was ? and would be ? the right thing to do , admitting it ahead of time is never smart . Think of it this way , if banks know that the President will come to their aid once they get in trouble ? because she said so on national television ? they don t have much incentive to be careful with other people s hard earned money . It s a concept that economists call moral hazard , and always a tricky problem for politicians to navigate . In other words , while voters generally should demand that politicians tell the truth , sometimes a little guile works too .
