" What ' s going to affect our production budget is the money we raise on Kickstarter , minus the fulfillment , and that ' s going to affect very specific things . Like , if the money stopped now , I know that we would probably be faking Neptune , Calif . , probably somewhere like Baton Rouge , La . , and it won ' t quite look right . We ' ll do our best to make Baton Rouge look like Southern California , but it won ' t be quite the same . We ' re going to need to make some more money . Shooting in Southern California is more expensive than shooting in Louisiana , and I want to shoot in Southern California the movie will look better . The thing is , we ' re totally prepared to shoot it somewhere else , but man , suddenly I ' ll have palm trees in shots and Veronica will be walking along a sandy beach and it will affect the way the movie looks .
