NBC s refusal to drop Trump has put us in the position of dropping 5 , 000 of cold hard cash to anyone who will yell out Trump is a racist during the live broadcast of Saturday Night Live , Santiago Cejudo , an organizer with the group , said in a statement . We re hoping the 5 , 000 will help people on set or in the studio audience find the bravery to speak out loudly and help focus the national conversation on that we need to deport racism , not people . It s 2016 , and Trump needs to hear that you can t win the White House without the brown vote .
