Most famously , studies by Stanley Milgram at Yale University in the 1960s found that ordinary people were willing to give what they believed were fatal electric shocks to their partners in a bogus " memory experiment " simply because a researcher in a white lab coat told them to . The people supposedly getting shocked ( who were working with Milgram and not being hurt at all ) hollered and pleaded for the shocks to stop , which distressed many of the people administering them , but they kept at it . In fact , roughly two thirds of the participants kept giving shocks until they had reached the highest voltage level possible , a percentage far higher than Milgram or any of his colleagues anticipated .
