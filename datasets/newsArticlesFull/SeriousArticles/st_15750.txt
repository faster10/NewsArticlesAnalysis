The reader has to keep in mind that the book is set in the Cold War and the race for space , with evil Russians represented by Bond s old enemy SMERSH . The chief fiend this time around is a Korean known as Jason Sin who uses a pack of lethal playing cards offering assorted forms of nasty death as his means of executing offenders . He tries to bury Bond alive and the reader is treated to all the grisly moments of suffocating on dirt . Sin wants to blow up Manhattan with a bomb carrying train , not so much because of his political bias as to revenge himself on Americans who killed too many Koreans during the war over there . Americans don t come out too well in terms of space efficiency . There is a Colonel Blimpish quality to some of the staff and there is a nice irony in the fact that the CIA expresses its gratitude to Bond in the shape of a suite at the Plaza .
