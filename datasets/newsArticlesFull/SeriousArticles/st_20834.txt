Kamal Gianchandani , CEO of PVR Pictures , however , shares a more positive view of the matter , " We can ' t share the occupancy figures and the revenue of the Oscar nominated films , but , of course , it has been encouraging . Even this year , we will be screening films that have scored an Oscar nomination closer to the awards ceremony , which will take place next month . Last year , the Oscar nominated films were screened at PVR cinemas as a part of our annual Oscar film festival . This year , the screenings will begin in the last week of January and the Oscar nominated films will be screened over the next few months . The revenue from Hollywood movies has gone up substantially , making NCR a significant market . "
