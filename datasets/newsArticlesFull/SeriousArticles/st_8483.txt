An array of monsters from R . L . Stine s scary funny Goosebumps books comes to life in this mildly imaginative trifle , with Stine himself ( played by Jack Black ) as a character , and teen romance as the backdrop . Kids 10 and older will probably be amused , but for some younger viewers , the sight of those monsters on a big screen may be too much : The Werewolf of Fever Swamp , the nasty garden gnomes , the giant praying mantis and Slappy the evil ventriloquist s dummy all bare tooth and claw , chase the teen protagonists and threaten the town . Zach has recently lost his dad . He and his mom move to a Delaware town where she ll be the vice principal at his new school . Hannah , the cute girl next door , befriends Zach , although her secretive dad ( Black ) warns him off . Overhearing a scream in Hannah s house , Zach and his nerdy pal , Champ , go to investigate . Hannah s fine , but they find a bookcase full of original , locked R . L . Stine manuscripts . One gets opened , out pops the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena and we re off . ( 98 minutes )
