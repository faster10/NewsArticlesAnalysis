One could argue that the shallowness of Fitzgerald ' s glamorous strivers is precisely the novel ' s point . The " abortive sorrows and short winded elations " to which Fitzgerald refers in the opening quote account to most , if not all , of America ' s transient aspirations , practically from the country ' s inception . Moreover , theirs is the kind of shallowness upon which we can repeatedly project not just our own apprehensions of desire but those of everyone we know and will come to know throughout our lives .
