A lot of people were pulling for " Star Wars : The Force Awakens " to enter the Best Picture race . Despite it becoming the highest grossing film in domestic box office history , it was overlooked . The same goes for " Inside Out " and " Straight Outta Compton , " top 20 films at the box office in 2015 . A good number of people have seen " The Martian " and " Mad Max : Fury Road . " But the Oscars ceremony could benefit from more popular , and still great films . How many people have seen " Brooklyn " anyway ?
