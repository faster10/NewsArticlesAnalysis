The 18th Vine historic district was the center for black culture and life in Kansas City from the late 1800s 1960s . It was the hub of activity for homeowners , business , jazz music , and baseball enthusiast . Just outside of the district stands the Paseo YMCA building , which was built as a black YMCA in 1914 . It served as temporary home for baseball players , railroad workers , and others making the transition to big city life in the Midwest . It was here that the Negro National League was founded in 1920 . Although the district and the YMCA building were becoming blighted by the 1980s , they were recognized on the National Register of Historic Places .
