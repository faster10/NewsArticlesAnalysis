Hamilton Grange , New York . Many of the Park Service ' s most popular monuments are dedicated to familiar figures of American history . Abraham Lincoln ' s three memorials alone attracted over six million visitors in 2010 a far cry from the New York City home of Alexander Hamilton , which received only around fifteen thousand visitors a year before closing for renovations in 2006 . Hamilton Grange was reopened in September and is now accepting visitors and at no charge . If Hamilton holds no interest for you , try another of the lesser visited memorials dedicated to important Americans : the Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site in Brookline , Massachusetts , celebrates the life of the renowned landscape architect the Flat Rock , North Carolina Carl Sandburg Home remembers the storied career of the quintessentially American poet and in Washington D . C . , the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House stands in remembrance of the early , determined civil rights activist and educator .
