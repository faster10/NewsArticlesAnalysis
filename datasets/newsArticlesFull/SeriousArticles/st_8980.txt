One of the keys to the Bengals success this year is that they ve had an incredible stretch ( six weeks ) without any serious injuries . Only safety George Iloka missed Cincinnati s game against the Chiefs due to an ankle injury and sat slot cornerback Leon Hall ( back ) when they beat the Buffalo Bills before their week off . Expect the Bengals to be at full strength again . The Steelers have faced teams with stopping power on defense , but both Pat Sims and Brandon Thomson would love nothing more that to get to Ben Roethlisberger should he truly start as Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin inferred he would on Monday .
