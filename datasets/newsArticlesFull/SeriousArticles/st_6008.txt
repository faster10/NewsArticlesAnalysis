Since the 1930s . To develop the polio vaccine , scientists infected fetal kidney cells with the virus in Petri dishes , then used the weakened virus in those cells to teach the immune system how to repel the virus ? a development that earned its creators the 1954 Nobel Prize in medicine . In 1968 , the donation of tissue from aborted fetuses was formally legalized . President Ronald Reagan imposed a five year moratorium on such research , but in 1993 , President Bill Clinton and Congress again authorized the practice . The law imposed several conditions : Abortion providers cannot profit from the distribution of fetal tissue donors must give their signed consent , which can be sought only after they have agreed to the abortion itself and abortion methods cannot be altered to make it easier to extract tissue . The National Institutes of Health spends about 76 million of federal funds on fetal tissue research each year .
