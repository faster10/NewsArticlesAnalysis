2015 is one of those rare and magical years in which the nominees in the Supporting Actress race are older than the men around them . The five women in the supporting category this year have an average age of 53 . 4 , while the Supporting Actor nominees are half a decade younger ? averaging 47 . 8 years of age . That s a huge shift from last year , when only two Supporting Actress hopefuls were over 40 ( Patricia Arquette and Meryl Streep ) and the average nominee was just 40 . 6 years old . In contrast , not a single Supporting Actor was under 40 and the contenders were an average 55 . 6 years old .
