I am tempted to say that women would be less likely to get us into wars . But then I remember Queen Elizabeth I ( if you can ' t , just picture Cate Blanchett in body armor ) , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ( saying to President George H . W . Bush before the Persian Gulf War , " Now , George , don ' t go wobbly on me " ) and Golda Meir , prime minister of Israel during the Yom Kippur War ( ordering revenge for the 1972 Olympics slaying of Israeli athletes ) . Does anyone doubt that gun toting Sarah Palin would be ready to fight anyone , anytime ? Hillary Clinton ?
