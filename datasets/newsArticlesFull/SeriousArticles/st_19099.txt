I couldn ' t help but wonder why it always takes a tragedy to get the world ' s attention . The suffering of millions of students all across America , some of whom are being bullied as badly as Phoebe and who have been crying out for help day after day , semester after semester , should be enough . Why are their voices not heard ? What message are we sending these lonely , frustrated kids : that they might as well suffer in silence , because no one ' s going to take notice unless someone ends up dead ?
