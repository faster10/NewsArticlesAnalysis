So what is Trump talking about ? His campaign did not respond to our request for information , but one of Trump s tweets linked to a story on Prntly . com , a political blog , that ran under the headline Trump successfully pressures Ford to move Mexican plant to Ohio . The article cites CNN Money as its source , but that s not what CNN Money actually reported in August . Rather , the article , which ran under the headline Ford shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio , was about the transfer of some Ford pickup assembly work that was moved from Mexico to Ohio .
