Please let me be clear : In theory , I want to visit you . ( And I hope you visit me , because my fear and loathing of being a houseguest does not , oddly enough , apply to having houseguests . ) After all , I like you so much . I want to coo at your kids , cuddle with your pets , inventory the drugs in your medicine cabinet , and talk into the wee hours . And then I want to go to a hotel , empty the minibar , and write you a thank you note before hanging my breakfast order on the spotless doorknob so the pot of hot , fully caffeinated coffee will be delivered at exactly 6 : 30 a . m .
