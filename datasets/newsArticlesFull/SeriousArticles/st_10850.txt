Another issue is that there could be difficulty enforcing the law even in cases that do qualify . The law applies to people who post photos to " harass or annoy " and the perpetrators must have " intent to cause serious emotional distress . " That could exclude people who post these types of images only for financial gain or other reasons like bragging rights . The sites that make money off of submitted revenge porn might be able to avoid prosecution by claiming they did not know the victims and therefore couldn ' t have intended any harm .
