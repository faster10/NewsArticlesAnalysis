That friction between topicality and nostalgia makes for a gorgeous and dreamlike but ultimately frustrating Bond film . I blame Mendes . He did a great job with Skyfall , juggling modernity and sentiment in a manner befitting the franchise ' s 50th anniversary installment . So potent was the nostalgia high it induced that not only did it become the series ' all time top earner , with 1 . 1 billion in receipts , but no one seemed especially troubled by the fact that in it , the bad guy won . Hey , it had to happen sometime .
