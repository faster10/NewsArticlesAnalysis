It started 30 years ago when hundreds of thousands of Central Americans began immigrating to the United States , many of them illegally . Some ended up in Los Angeles , then the street gang capital of the United States , if not the world . Some of the immigrants ' children grew up and became gang members . They formed two large gangs , Mara Salvatrucha , also known as MS 13 , and 18th Street . The neighborhoods where these gangs were based became active areas for the Los Angeles Police Department ' s homicide division in the 1990s .
