From the carnage , the mayhem and the tears emerge stories of heartbreaking humanity and unexpected tenderness . The quiet voice of a survivor in the Charlie bloodbath to a trauma doctor : Monsieur , s il vous pla ? t , aidez moi . The driver , suddenly carjacked with a gun to his head , thinking to rescue his dog from the back seat of the car . The man who felt like he was coming to life , born again , after getting out of the supermarket alive . Even , at the Dammartin printworks , owner Michel Catalano bandaging the wound of his captor : not because he was forced to but because he offered then doing it again because the injured terrorist said it was too tight . Humanity is a stubborn bugger , not so easily destroyed .
