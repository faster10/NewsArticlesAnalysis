I had a very interesting experience this summer . I remember exactly when it was . It was when I was reading an article by Evan Osnos in the New Yorker about Trump . He happened to be covering the white nationalist movement , basically neo Nazis . Coincidentally , it was right when Donald Trump burst onto the scene , and he wrote about how these guys were embracing Trump , as they never had embraced any Republican candidate before . The feeling I got was that this was the first time in a very long time that I ve read anything about the Republican Party that I couldn t assimilate into my normal categories . That was a very uncanny and uncomfortable feeling for me . I realized that I had to go back to the drawing board and rethink what was going on . This is something that s very new , very strange , and very hard to assimilate into what we thought we knew about how the Republican Party worked .
