How are these strategies working out ? Consider the travails of Rubio , the GOP candidate who on the surface appears to be Trump s most formidable rival . Steeped in the rhetoric of movement conservatism from a young age , Rubio is as sunny and forward looking as Trump is dark and nostalgic . He has championed entrepreneurial capitalism , yet he has also called for modernizing the safety net to ensure that families of modest means are protected from the vicissitudes of a changing economy . Though Rubio is not the only GOP candidate to have addressed the challenges facing working and middle class families , he is by far the best at discussing these issues in a compelling , cogent way . Instead of seeing globalization purely as a threat , Rubio welcomes it as an opportunity . To capitalize on this opportunity , he backs a sweeping overhaul of higher education designed to make it easier for workers to upgrade their skills .
