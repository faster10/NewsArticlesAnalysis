If you read the writings of Paul in 1 Timothy 3 ( New International Version ) , he offers the following instructions : " Here is a trustworthy saying : If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer , he desires a noble task . Now the overseer must be above reproach , the husband of but one wife , temperate , self controlled , respectable , hospitable , able to teach , not given to drunkenness , not violent but gentle , not quarrelsome , not a lover of money . He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect . ( If anyone does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of God ' s church ) . . . He must also have a good reputation with outsiders , so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil ' s trap . "
