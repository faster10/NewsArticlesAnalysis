Former New York state Senate majority leader Dean G . Skelos , 67 , and his son , Adam Skelos , 33 , were found guilty on all eight counts of bribery , extortion , and conspiracy brought against them Friday . According to prosecutors , the elder Skelos used his position to direct consulting payments to his son , ultimately amounting to roughly 300 , 000 . The ruling , coupled with the November conviction of former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver on corruption charges , is a gut punch to the state government in Albany . Both father and son could face up to 130 years in prison when they are sentenced next year .
