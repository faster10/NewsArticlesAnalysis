So who will the real character effect benefit this year ? Interestingly , none of the nominees for Best Actress played screen versions of actual people . But this will make for a very tight race for Best Actor , with Jesse Eisenberg portraying Facebook creator Mark Zuckererg in " The Social Network , " Colin Firth playing a stuttering King George VI in " The King ' s Speech , " and James Franco as Aron Ralston , a mountain climber who has to hack off his own arm in " 127 Hours . " Which of them do you think will win ?
