" When they took it up to Lorne Michaels ? who ' s an amazing guy , he ' s run Saturday Night Live brilliantly for many years and he ' s a friend of mine ? he said , ' Well wait a minute , he ' ll do the skit . Will he do the whole thing ? ' " And he called me and said , ' Will you host Saturday Night Live ? ' and I said , ' It ' s an honor . ' "
