Griff : The " best " or the " most likely ? " If those are indeed the four teams , it seems pretty safe to assume Michigan State would play Clemson or Alabama in the semifinals . As much as I don ' t want to think the ratings would be jiggled for the sake of matchups , I could see the Spartans moving past Oklahoma into that No . 3 spot where they would face a No . 2 Alabama in the Cotton Bowl . It ' s hard to imagine Alabama losing in the semifinals two straight years , so I believe a more advantageous game for Michigan State would be Clemson in the Orange Bowl again , if those are indeed the four teams .
