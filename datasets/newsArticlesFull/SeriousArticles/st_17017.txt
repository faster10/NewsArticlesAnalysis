A closer look at the bigger picture may indicate , however , that in a way , the Russian military intervention may have served to accelerate the efforts to solve the five year conflict , which has so far claimed the lives of at least 250 , 000 Syrians and resulted in the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War . Given the number of state and non state actors and militias involved , the concern was that this conflict ? more militarised than ever ? could spin out of control . Russian air support for the Syrian regime has been countered by increased military support to opposition forces by Turkey and other allies . As a result , the Syrian opposition has been able to undermine Moscow s efforts to impose new realities on the ground . Russia s plans to enable the regime to recapture strategic positions in the northwest of the country and around the capital Damascus have been foiled . The increased use of US made TOW anti tank missiles against regime forces was just a case in point . Instead of creating new realities on the ground , leading to a favourable environment to impose a certain political settlement , the effect of the Russian intervention has been in fact reduced to its original goal of simply preventing the collapse of the regime .
