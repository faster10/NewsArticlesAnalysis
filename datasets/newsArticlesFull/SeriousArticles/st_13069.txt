Get ready for a shootout in Tampa . The Saints have allowed four of the last five quarterbacks they ve faced to put up at least 29 points in standard scoring leagues . We re not talking Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisbeger either . Three of the four were Eli Manning , Marcus Mariota and Kirk Cousins . They ve held exactly one quarterback , Brian Hoyer , below his season average . Winston should have his way with this defense . Same goes for Martin , Evans , Jackson and Seferian Jenkins , all of whom have to be started in standard leagues . The Saints aren t going to sit idly by and let the Buccaneers have all the fun , though . This Tampa Bay defense is 24th in pass DVOA and 31st in coverage , better than only New Orleans . Brees may be a lot better at home , but this should still be a defense he is able to exploit . He did , however , struggle in the teams Week 2 meeting , throwing for just 255 yards , one touchdown and one interception .
