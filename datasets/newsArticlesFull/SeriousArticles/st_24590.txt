It is all too common that Jewish settlements in the West Bank are built on stolen Palestinian land , and all too common that Palestinian farmers are prevented from cultivating and collecting their rightful harvest anywhere near these settlements .

Regardless of what kind of land they are built upon , settlements are illegal under international law and contrary to U . S . policy .
