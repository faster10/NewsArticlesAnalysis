My dad was a member of this country ' s greatest generation . He grew up in The Depression and fought in WWII . There aren ' t many left . George is a member of country music ' s greatest generation . And there are only a handful of those men and women left . Go to their shows , talk to them if you can . Let them know how much you appreciate their music and if you are lucky enough , their friendship . Let them know the impact their singing or songwriting has had on your life . But don ' t do it for their sake , do it for your own .
