For the past four months , Oriental Watch has used the green tea scent in all 12 of its Hong Kong stores . Salesman Ken To can ' t say definitively if the scent has led to a direct increase in sales but he is certain the scent relaxes customers . " We see customers are willing to stay longer at our store , especially in the area close to the machine ( scent diffuser ) . We can have more conversations with them and hopefully , we can make a sale , " says To . " Our staff like it too . We have a stressful job because we ' re dealing with , 1000 to 1 , 000 , 000 watches . So the scent helps lower the tension for the frontline staff . "
