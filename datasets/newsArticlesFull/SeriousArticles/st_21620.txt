It can t be argued that a second ring would give Manning , the all time NFL leader in passing yards and touchdowns , a strong case for being the greatest quarterback of all time . And however illogical it may seem , it also couldn t be argued that a ring would give Manning ? 2015 2016 Manning , that is , who was ranked 34th and dead last in passer rating this season in the NFL ? a legit case for being the worst Super Bowl winning quarterback of all time . The greatest ? and ? the worst . There is nothing more fitting in the social media age when it seems everything has to be one or the other . Peyton Manning could truly be both at the same time .
