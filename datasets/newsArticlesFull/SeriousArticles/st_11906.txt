And he ' s a minority ! I sometimes joke that I ' m half Jewish , because I was raised Catholic . . . and we share " the guilt . " Seriously , we ' ve had an African American in office who at times has been rather centrist , we now see that some Hispanic politicians ( Rubio , Cruz ) are as conservative as they come and Maggie Thatcher didn ' t exactly bestow motherly love so it ' s not about race or gender anymore . . . it ' s about substance . As Kinky Friedman said , " They don ' t make Jews like Jesus anymore ! " And , like Jesus , Bernie is on the side of the average man and woman , not Wall Street .
