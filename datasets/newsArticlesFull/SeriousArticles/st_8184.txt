Modern day racism , however , tends not to fly under the white hood but ? through more subtle , if just as effective means . You don t have politicians yelling segregation forever ! in 21st century America , but you do have politicians pretending that we have a voter fraud problem whose only solution seems to be to make it harder for black people to vote . Open , race based discrimination has been replaced by systems that claim to be color blind but disproportionately affect people of color . The KKK isn t a thing anymore , but we do have police who , while claiming to treat all people equally , end up abusing black citizens more than white ones .
