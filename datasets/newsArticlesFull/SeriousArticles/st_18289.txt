What was billed as the major takedown of the strongest Democratic presidential candidate , however , did not happen as the Republicans had planned . Clinton clearly got the better of the committee members , and provided zero fireworks and zero scandalous revelations . As I had predicted earlier in the week , the focus was all on the questioners , and not Clinton . Very early on , it was obvious that they had no new surprises to reveal , and that for all the noise about emails , there simply was no scandal contained within them . Sidney Blumenthal ? That ' s all you got ? Wow can we the American taxpayers get our money back ? This investigation has dragged on far too long ( so that it could schedule hearings during the presidential campaign ) , and spent far too much money for what we saw on display yesterday .
