I consider myself to be a movie enthusiast . I love movies and I watch a wide range of movies without prejudice . In my opinion , a well written and well acted movie deserves recognition no matter who is in the cast . However , I still feel the sting or challenge when I watch movies and I don ' t see anyone that looks like me . There are many times I have watched a movie and wondered why an actor of color couldn ' t play the role . Black actors seem to have to choose between playing stereotypical characters or being jammed into a role that is changed to accommodate a black person just to attract black moviegoers even if it ' s doesn ' t make sense . But , they rarely have their own character arc or an interesting backstory .
