Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Justice finds that 30 to 35 of female sexual assault survivors were first raped between the ages of 11 to 17 .

A recent study found that 12 . 4 of sexual assaults committed against 13 to 17 year old teens were gang rapes .
