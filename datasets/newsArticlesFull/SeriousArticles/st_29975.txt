But hatred of France goes beyond its counterterrorism prowess . France is also an aggressive actor in the Middle East , joining the U . S . ? led bombing of ISIS and also intervening on its own . In Mali , France was responsible for routing local jihadists who had seized much of the country . At home , France is also proudly secular . As such , its official policies are hostile to public displays of religion like the veiling of women , and satirical magazines like Charlie Hebdo regularly ridicule religion , including Islam . This mix of aggression , critical free speech , and secularism earns France a special place of hatred among the Islamic State and many jihadists .
