What does this mean for privacy rights ? Consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection , or purchase a drone , there is often a public outcry . Is the camera an invasion of privacy ? Where will it be looking ? How will the government use the data ? How long will the data be kept ? Will it be used to track my movements ? At some level , these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches .
