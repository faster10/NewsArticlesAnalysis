Proof came with the reply of the shadow chancellor , John McDonnell . Never an easy gig , and made harder by Osborne s methodical shooting , one by one , of every anticipated Labour fox . But still McDonnell s performance had his party putting its collective head in its hands . A man already lampooned as an unreconstructed communist , he pulled out the notorious Little Red Book and quoted Mao Zedong . True , McDonnell was trying to fire off an ironic rebuke of Osborne s cosy ties to Beijing . But such irony does not work in the bearpit of the Commons nor on television ? and certainly not when delivered by a man who too many believe might quote the sayings of the Chinese dictator in earnest . Suddenly Osborne was not Santa , but a child at Christmas ? handed yet another unexpected gift .
