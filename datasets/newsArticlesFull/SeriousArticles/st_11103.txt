BEST OF THE REST : Marco Rubio s in the third slot , 11 percent , with all others in the single digits in this poll , produced for ABC by ? Langer Research Associates . Rubio appears to have a stand in shot ? he does well as a second choice , selected by 23 percent now vs . 14 percent last month . Ben Carson , for his part , has continued to crater , showing the sometime changeability of voter preferences : he s gone from 22 percent two months ago to 7 percent now , almost precisely swapping places with Cruz . There s essentially no change among lower tier candidates ? 5 percent for Jeb Bush , 4 percent for Chris Christie , 3 percent for Carly Fiorina , 2 percent apiece for John Kasich and Mike Huckabee , 1 percent for Rand Paul and less than that for Rick Santorum . http : abcn . ws 1K85UJq
