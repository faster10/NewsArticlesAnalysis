Mitchell has already announced that the 32 year old Martin will yield minutes this season to youngsters like LaVine and Wiggins , in an effort to accelerate the Wolves ' rebuilding process . It ' ll be interesting to see how the veteran handles a slightly reduced role . Martin , who averaged 20 points per night over 39 games last season , has averaged 18 points per game over an 11 year NBA career . He also might be the only consistent scoring option on Minnesota ' s 2015 16 roster , so it ' ll be interesting to see just how he ' s utilized . Martin , who has 491 NBA starts under his belt , could thrive in a sixth man role , if he embraced it . ? ? ? ? ? ?
