Certainly many of Trump s Republican opponents are making similar promises to primary voters , but Trump is the only candidate who has developed a two pronged political strategy to reinforce his commitment to these causes in the minds of the voters . The first way Trump has accomplished is by promising to personally finance the majority of his general election campaign . Trump is the only Republican candidate in the field ( and in recent memory ) to be able to pledge what could be more than a billion dollars of his own money toward his campaign . This isn t about having enough money to win the election , however . This is all about trust . Because Trump can raise his own cash , he doesn t need special interest groups cash , which means in the minds of many , Trump can t be bought .
