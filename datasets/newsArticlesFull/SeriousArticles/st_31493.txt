Whether one agrees with his decisions or not , it ' s ridiculous to suggest the President is a weak leader . Just ask Osama bin Laden . Or consider that Obama is bombing ISIS , pressing Iraq to fix its broken government , working with NATO to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down and making real progress in curbing Iran ' s nuclear ambitions . And then there are the drone strikes , including one that killed the leader of the militant Islamist group Al Shabaab in Somalia . Feckless ? Hardly .
