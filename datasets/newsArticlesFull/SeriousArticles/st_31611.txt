But Curry , always the rational , level headed guy , isn ' t outraged if you think LeBron James is better . That ' s such a cool thing for the MVP to say , to not get bothered by the idea there ' s a better player than him . It ' s a sign of what makes him so likeable , so popular , so undeniably great that he can be supremely confident in what he does while also not needing to find motivation from the idea of someone or most people believing a once in a generation talent like LeBron might be better .
