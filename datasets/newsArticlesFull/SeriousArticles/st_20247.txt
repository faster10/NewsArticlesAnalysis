Congress wants an 18 cap on tax in the constitutional amendment bill , which the government is opposed to on the ground that this will make the levy inflexible ? any change will then need another alteration in the constitution . The compromise option that the government could look at is to put the cap in GST law that will be moved after the constitutional amendment is approved . The government also has an open mind on the 1 tax proposed on inter state sales , which the Congress wants dropped . There could be more negotiations to arrive at a deal after the contours are thrashed out .
