Griff : Iowa did visit Oregon in the offseason , and both teams do play zone pass coverages . Their base defensive fronts are different ? Iowa a 4 3 that looks like a 5 2 when the linebacker is walked up , and Oregon with a 3 4 ? but both ask their linemen to play a two gap scheme and neither blitzes a great deal . There is indeed something to be said for the effectiveness of a zone pass defense against Connor Cook . The MSU QB will have more time , but will he mentally be able to solve the different looks ?
