Once you ' ve reserved a car ( or truck the beauty of car sharing services is that you can get a big car when you need it , not when you don ' t ) , a pretty neat technology unlocks the doors when you walk near your vehicle ( we won ' t bore you with the details , but if you ' re wondering , it ' s called radio frequency identification ) . When it senses the card on you , the doors unlock , at which point , you ' re on your way . Cars are located all over metro areas ( Zipcar gives you a map to the location of the car you ' ve booked ) .
