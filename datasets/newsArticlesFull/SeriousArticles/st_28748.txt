The second proposed amendment dubbed an emergency brake by the British press , would allow a safeguard mechanism when member countries have an inflow of workers of exceptional magnitude to restrict access to certain welfare benefits for a period of four years . The proposal s language is a little opaque on how sweeping these benefits restrictions could be , because they suggest that the limits should be graduated from an initial complete exclusion , meaning that some benefits might have to kick in sooner than four years . Though this was probably the biggest concession for Prime Minister David Cameron , the proposal is vague enough that the practical affects are not yet clear . For example the proposal does not explain what constitutes exceptional magnitude , or for how many years a country would be able to restrict these benefits to incoming migrants .
