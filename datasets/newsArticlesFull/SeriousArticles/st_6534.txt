Then we get to the deeper , Alice in Wonderland levels of hypocrisy and absurdity . Since we re talking about the Iranians , who are constantly described in the American media as crazy town Muslim zealots : Whose side are they on when it comes to ISIS ? ( And if we asked 100 American voters that question at random , how many of them would get it right ? ) Neither the mullahs in Tehran nor the politicians in Washington are eager to talk about this , but Iran and the United States find themselves in a strategic and military alliance at the moment , in which at least some cooperation is clearly happening behind the scenes . But wait , you say : The Saudis , our beloved allies , well and truly hate the Iranians . So whose side are they on ? Fascinating question , young Jedi . How many zeroes do I need to write on this check before you forget you asked it ?
