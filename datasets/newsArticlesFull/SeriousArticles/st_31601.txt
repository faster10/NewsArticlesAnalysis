Who are those Democratic moderates and conservatives ? Some of them are black American and Latino voters who don t hold conventionally liberal beliefs but support the Democratic Party for a variety of other reasons . And some of them are the shrinking class of working class white Democrats . But some are the suburban whites who help make or break Democrats in national elections in states like Colorado , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . They are college educated and middle class , or even affluent . They hold liberal views on issues like same sex marriage , reproductive health , climate change , and gun control , and support core Democratic programs like Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid ( although they re reluctant to raise taxes to fund new programs ) .
