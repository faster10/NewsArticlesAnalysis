For the more Djokovic achieves , the more resolute he is not to surrender his pre eminence . I don t take anything for granted , he said , after a sixth triumph on the Melbourne Plexicushion that he has annexed as his personal fiefdom . I don t want to allow myself to be in that frame of mind . A person can become too arrogant and think he is a higher being than everybody else . You can get a big slap from karma very soon . I don t want that . There was a curiously low key note in Djokovic s mood . He marked the moment of victory with the briefest of raised fists , in as muted a reaction to an 11th slam as was possible to conceive . Truly , Melbourne had seen more extravagant celebrations at the Kooyong Classic . At least his coach , Boris Becker , had the good grace to weep copiously at the accomplishment .
