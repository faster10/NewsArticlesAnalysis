Of course , a great education isn t all we need in this new economy . We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security . After all , it s not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job , in the same place , with a health and retirement package , for 30 years , are sitting in this chamber . For everyone else , especially folks in their forties and fifties , saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher . Americans understand that at some point in their careers , they may have to retool and retrain . But they shouldn t lose what they ve already worked so hard to build .
