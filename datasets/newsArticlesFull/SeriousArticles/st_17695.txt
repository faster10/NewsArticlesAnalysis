Well , of course , the whole of my intellectual project , which I have been working on for a good , solid 15 years now , has been the rise of a conservative infrastructure that has taken over the Republican Party and turned it into a vehicle for conservative policy . If there s one thing that I thought I knew , it is that basically the ideas and the institutions that were born through the Goldwater movement were a backbone of this conservative takeover of the Republican Party . Donald Trump is perhaps most interesting in his lack of connections to that entire world . The first sign that something very different was happening was when he basically rejected Fox News , threw them over the side , and had no interest in kowtowing to them .
