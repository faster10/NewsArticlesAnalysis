Overall , it wasn ' t the Brady Manning Bowl anyone expected , with just one scoring drive longer than 50 yards , but still , there was something almost refreshing about watching other people do the work . And more importantly for Broncos fans , it proved yet again that Denver can be great even when Manning is not . Whether Manning can be just good enough in Super Bowl 50 to get himself a second ring remains to be seen , but after Sunday , you can rest assured that his defense will at least give him a chance .
