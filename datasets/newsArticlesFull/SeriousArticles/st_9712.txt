Not to take anything away from the Bucks . They were terrific . Better than they ' ve been all season , frankly . We talked about Monroe and Antetokounmpo , who were both superb . O . J . Mayo was also dialed in with 18 points with four 3 pointers and he played spectacular perimeter defense . And the team defense was there all night , which we haven ' t seen much of this season , holding the Warriors to barely 40 percent from the field and a season low six 3 pointers . This was also the first time all year Golden State has scored less than 100 points . The Bucks came to play . Credit the effort .
