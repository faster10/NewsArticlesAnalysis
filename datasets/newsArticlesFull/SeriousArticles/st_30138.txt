Except , of course , there s no actual reason to believe that liberals wanted Cosby to be a rapist , in the same way that conservatives clearly want Bill Clinton to be one . ? Sure , a lot of liberals didn t like Cosby because he is a moral scold who feeds blame the victim narratives about racism , but there really was zero desire on the left to take out Cosby . Most liberals ? myself included ? were really upset at realizing that the evidence against Cosby was both substantive and substantial . But this notion that there are people out there who are actually interested in justice and not just in scoring points against political opponents is clearly more than right wing operatives can wrap their heads around .
