It is proclaimed that the game has started to pass the 64 year old Saban by . Clemson s Dabo Swinney is 18 years his junior . The talk about the former Alabama walk on replacing Saban in Tuscaloosa would have intensified . Saban s loss a year ago was to Urban Meyer , who is 13 years younger . Florida State s Jimbo Fisher , the head coach of the 2013 2014 national champions , is 14 years younger . A botched onside kick attempt in the title game would have been lumped with the Kick Six failure against Auburn in 2013 as evidence Saban just doesn t quite have it anymore . And why can t he develop a top quarterback ? And is he really all that good of a coach , considering is failure with the Miami Dolphins ? And what was he thinking bringing in Lane Kiffin ? Everyone knew that was a dumb move !
