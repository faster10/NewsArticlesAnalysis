We don ' t know for sure what side of the ball the 2015 Big Ten Freshman of the Year will be on the most next season , but we know he will be worth keeping an eye on . Peppers was primarily a defensive player , but his role on offense expanded as the season went on . Whether lining up at quarterback , tailback or receiver he even took a snap or two at fullback against Ohio State Peppers was the center of attention , and he showed game breaking ability with the ball in his hands . The rest of the time ( if he wasn ' t returning punts ) , he was a hard hitting safety , nickel back or corner .
