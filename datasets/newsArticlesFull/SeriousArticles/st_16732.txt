These new induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) " do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " explains the father of human embryonic stem cells James Thomson . Harvard ' s David Scadden agrees that iPSC technology " is absolutely changing the field . " IPSCs " perhaps even eliminate the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells , " says Keisuke Kaji of the University of Edinburgh . IPSCs even caused the man who cloned Dolly the sheep to abandon cloning three years ago because " changing cells from a patient directly into stem cells has got so much more potential . "
