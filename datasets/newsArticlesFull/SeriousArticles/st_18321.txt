In Merkel s case , however , there is little retro or stereotypically maternal about her Mutti ness ? and not just because she has no children of her own , and a husband who stays away from the political press . There s a certain tongue in cheek quality to the nickname , but it s not mocking . After all , her own party has used it to her advantage . Her influence is due to her actions and not her sex . Merkel has managed to isolate the most powerful elements of the maternal ? protection , reliability , care , attention , knowledge ? and leave behind worn stereotypes of old .
