This past fall , in reporting and writing my e book The Bern Identity about Bernie Sanders ' campaign , I looked for close by events to save time and a few travel bucks . The closest rally was ( and still is , to this day ) Manassas , Va . , some four , slapping my face at 1 a . m . in the car hours away . I also watched an undulating crowd of 15 , 000 folks ( with 5 , 000 more shivering outside ) cheer Sanders in Boston , but there hasn ' t been an arena sized event in or around the nation ' s fifth largest city not for Sanders or Trump or Ted Cruz or Hillary Clinton , or anybody .
