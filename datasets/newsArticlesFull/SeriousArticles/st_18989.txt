Bond ( Craig ) , meanwhile , is in hot water because he has gone rogue , again . After a Roman dalliance with the beautiful widow ( Monica Bellucci ) of a man he murdered in Mexico , Bond turns his attention to Madeleine ( ahem ) Swann ( Lea Seydoux , Blue Is the Warmest Color ) , a psychologist ( just what he needs ? ) in Austria and the daughter of international criminal Mr White ( Jesper Christensen ) . The super villain of the piece is the mysterious sadist and crime lord Oberhauser ( Christoph Waltz ) , a Dr Mabuse Professor Moriarty like figure from Bond s childhood . Who Oberhauser is is this film s big secret , which I think every ? body already knows a la Star Trek Into Darkness .
