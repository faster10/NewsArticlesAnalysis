Since there will be no U . S . forces on the ground as target designators or air controllers , being able to see a target from the air will be crucial . So , a column of ISIS trucks or as seen early Friday morning a captured artillery piece firing against Kurdish positions , each make easy acquisition . Against these targets , airpower is nearly invincible . One thinks of the devastation released over two decades ago by U . S . airpower on the " Highway of Death " ( albeit these forces were not attacking , but retreating but the signature is the same ) .
