Prince George ' s christening was held on October 23 at the Chapel Royal at St . James ' s Palace . That location was no coincidence it was where the body of Prince William ' s mother , Princess Diana , lay at rest in the days leading up to her funeral in 1997 . The event also set the stage for the epic portrait of Queen Elizabeth and her three direct heirs , Princes Charles , William and George . It was the first time a reigning Queen and three generations of heirs were photographed together in more than 100 years .
