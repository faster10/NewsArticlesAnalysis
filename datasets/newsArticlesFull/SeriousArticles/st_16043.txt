The investigation , which Chipotle discussed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday , comes on the heels of the new Blue Bell probe . Prosecutors in that case are examining whether company officials did anything illegal in their handling of the outbreak , which shut down Blue Bell s manufacturing facilities and led to all of its products being temporarily removed from stores in 23 states . The investigation comes even after Blue Bell submitted to a program of reporting its progress to the FDA and its products were returned to grocery store shelves .
