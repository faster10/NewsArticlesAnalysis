( SK ) : Oh , I think you can over regulate the sovereign funds . I think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of ' here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity ' . And the concern is if , gee these are going to be important going forward , we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets , but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market to a market outside the United States or Europe for example .
