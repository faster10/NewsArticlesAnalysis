A better politics doesn t mean we have to agree on everything . This is a big country , with different regions and attitudes and interests Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government , and expected us to argue , just as they did , over the size and shape of government , over commerce and foreign relations , over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security . But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens . It doesn t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice , or that our political opponents are unpatriotic . Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise .
