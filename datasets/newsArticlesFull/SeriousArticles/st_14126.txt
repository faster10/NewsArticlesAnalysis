HILLARY KEEPS HANDING OUT THE TAX INCREASES : Hillary Clinton used Monday to roll out a so called fair share surcharge on income over 5 million a year , a proposal meant to go in tandem with and go beyond the Buffett Rule for millionaires . And there was much more where that came from on Tuesday , Brian reports ? proposals to return the estate tax to 2009 parameters , crack down on schemes centered on warm island tax havens and target the wealthy who pile up money in their tax preferred retirement accounts , a la 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney . ( For what it s worth , the current estate tax exemption is just under 11 million for a couple , paired with a 40 percent rate . The 2009 parameters were a 35 percent rate and 7 million exemption for a couple . ) http : politico . pro 1ngoftF
