When Mitt Romney was governor , he worked with a legislature that was 87 Democratic to get things done . And to me , that really meant something : I consider myself a liberal Democrat . For him , it wasn ' t about who you were , it was about the quality of your ideas . That ' s how he improved the economy and balanced the budget , but that ' s not all he accomplished . Gov . Romney also initiated the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship to cover the cost of college at public institutions of higher education in the state for deserving high school students based on academic merit .
