Nicole ( not her real name ) , like thousands of other women , was forced to engage in commercial sex acts against her will . We heard about her when she received support from the Salvation Army STOP IT Program in Illinois , which serves victims who have been harmed by the sex trade . ( The Salvation Army is a denominational member of the National Association of Evangelicals . ) Eventually , Nicole escaped from her trafficker and assisted law enforcement in the prosecution of the crime committed against her .
