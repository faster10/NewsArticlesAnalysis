" Barack ' s got a bee in his bonnet about India the current president does go on a bit about India being , ahem , a threat to American professionals , Indian children studying maths earnestly while the Yankees doodle their days away , the US getting ' Bangalored ' , supposedly losing jobs to harder working Indians . To charge his people into action Barack ' s not above reviving the Injun spectre once again , targeting this time the Punjabi rather than the Shoshone . In contrast , Romney doesn ' t say much anyway and when he does speak , it ' s not about India . Surely that ' s a blessing . Traditionally too , the Republican leadership doesn ' t care overly much about kid stuff like school grades their business is with business , so a Mitt in the White House might mean more dollars for Delhi . But then , there ' s a flip side we may need to learn robot language . "
