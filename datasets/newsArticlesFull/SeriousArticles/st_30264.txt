Roethlisberger ' s targets over the last month : Antonio Brown 56 Martavis Bryant 29 Markus Wheaton 28 Heath Miller 25 Williams 16 Darrius Heyward Bey 6 . . . . Brown ' s history is solid not spectacular against Cincinnati relative to his usual production posting receiving lines of 7 87 0 , 6 47 1 , 7 128 1 , and 9 117 0 in four meetings since Paul Guenther took over as Bengals defensive coordinator . Brown still enters this game with target totals of 17 , 11 , 18 , and 10 over his last four games . Although the matchup is short of ideal against stingy RCB Pacman Jones , Brown is the strongest statistical wideout bet in the Wild Card Round . . . . Bryant ' s paper draw is fantastic versus burnable LCB Dre Kirkpatrick , but the Bengals held him to 49 scoreless yards in Week 14 , while Roethlisberger seems have to lost trust in Bryant , who dropped the fourth most passes ( 11 ) in the league and failed to perform in Weeks 16 and 17 while playing through nagging injuries . Big Ben ' s public airing of frustration with Bryant did sound like a motivational tactic , aggressively calling out an enormously talented but sometimes enigmatic player the Steelers need to make January noise , especially without DeAngelo . Bryant is a classic boom bust DFS play at Cincinnati . . . . Miller may be the sneakiest bet for a big game on Pittsburgh ' s side , particularly if you want to proactively bet against slumping Bryant . While Wheaton runs routes at savvy slot CB Leon Hall , Miller will take on a Cincinnati defense that allowed the second most catches ( 100 ) and fourth most yards ( 1 , 007 ) in the league to tight ends in 2015 . Miller went 10 66 and 10 105 in these teams ' two regular season meetings .
