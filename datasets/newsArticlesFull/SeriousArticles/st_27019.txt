Both Donald Trump and the Islamic State seek a clash of civilizations between the West and the Islamic world ? a 21st ? century crusade . The Islamic State s goal , with each of its terrorist attacks ( which are mostly on other Muslims ) , is to further bring division to the world and destroy the grayzone everywhere . And Trump is playing right into their hands . His rhetoric is saying to each and every Muslim around the world that America and the West are indeed anti Muslim , and that there is no gray zone . It is us or them , the crusaders or the Islamists .
