ALEC is not a new group it predates the Citizens United decision by almost four decades . ALEC brings together corporations , conservative think tanks and Republican legislators to collaborate on model legislation generally introduced through state houses . The voter ID laws at the center of the controversy have passed several state houses and face challenges from the Justice Department for racial bias . An estimated third of African Americans do not hold state registered identification , so would be prevented from voting under these laws .
