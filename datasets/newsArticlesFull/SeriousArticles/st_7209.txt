No wonder the Iranians were so happy : Sanctions were eased , and " Iran was given access to 550 million of its assets that are frozen overseas , " noted Iran Watch . " This is the first tranche of the 4 . 2 billion that Iran has been promised . " The interim deal does not require Iran to dismantle a single centrifuge or stop enriching uranium to 3 . 5 . Tehran has 18 , 000 centrifuges to enrich uranium , and some operate 15 times faster than older models . After years of work and massive financial investment , Iran currently has only enough enriched uranium to run its Bushehr Reactor for three months , notes Valerie Lincy of the Wisconsin Project On Nuclear Arms Control . Yet Iran now has enough enriched uranium to build six or seven nuclear warheads , Lincy adds .
