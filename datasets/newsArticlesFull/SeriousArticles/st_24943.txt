Since we moved to Virginia four years ago , my husband and I have attended the annual National Menorah Lighting on the Ellipse , in Washington , D . C . A military band accompanies three cantors while they give the blessing and sing , and latkes and sufganiyot ( a type of doughnut often enjoyed on Hanukkah ) are served . Afterward we go to our favorite Mediterranean restaurant . I am pregnant with twins due this month , and I can ' t wait to share this tradition with them . Cyndi Alderson , Oak Hill , Virginia
