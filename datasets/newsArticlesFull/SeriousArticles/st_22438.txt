" Peyton would never talk about any of that , " linebacker Todd Davis said . " That ' s not what we see from him . He ' s got too much humility for that . But we all know , we all know the numbers and there isn ' t anybody in this locker room that doesn ' t want to help him set every record that can be set . We ' re all going to look back someday and say we were there . And a game ball from that day , if you can do that , then that ' s even better . You could look at that and it would all come back . "
