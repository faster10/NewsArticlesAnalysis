Yes ! After getting sacked with having to sing second of 12 girls Wednesday night , Erika Van Pelt got her second chance and went all out in her purple bridesmaid shift on Lady Gaga ' s " Edge of Glory . " She kicked ass . In fact , I ' d comment on this performance the same way as Jimmy Iovine commented on her showing from Wednesday : " She has music in her blood , and great restraint something the show needs more of , not less . " Erika didn ' t need to twist this song into a wretched balloon animal of Lady Gaga in order to prove she was the one to bring in as a finalist . Singing it solidly was enough . I ' m not sure it ' ll be enough to keep her in much longer I ' m just glad we ' ll get to hear her voice another time . She does need a big performance next week and better placement .
