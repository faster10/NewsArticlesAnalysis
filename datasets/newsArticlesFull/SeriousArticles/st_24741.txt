One world . The world has gotten to be an angry , scary place . For all of us for any of us . Every year the Super Bowl unites us worldwide on common bonds of sportsmanship , family , and food . There ' s no better venue to spread the spirit of global unity , and I predict many a brand will seize the opportunity . Sure , it ' s an election year in the US but the Super Bowl is a world event . Hopefully brands will choose to promote that which brings us together as opposed to those that tear us apart . I ' m hopeful .
