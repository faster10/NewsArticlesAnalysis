During his visit to Turkey this month , President Obama was asked whether he would follow through on a campaign pledge to recognize what happened to the Armenians nearly a century ago as genocide . Obama said his views had not changed on the subject , but added : " What I want to do is not focus on my views right now but focus on the views of the Turkish and the Armenian people . If they can move forward and deal with a difficult and tragic history , then I think the entire world should encourage them . "
