LAWMAKERS WATCHING EUROPE AS 702 DEBATE HEATS UP ? Lawmakers are paying attention to the privacy debate happening in Europe , according to one committee member who attended Tuesday s classified House Judiciary hearing on FISA s Section 702 . It s interesting that the Europeans seem to be ahead of us on the issue of individual rights when it comes to surveillance , the member said , adding that we could see some kind of legislation before the end of the year . That would give lawmakers time to work on a bill before that controversial online surveillance authority sunsets at the end of 2017 . I hope because we re starting relatively early on the hearings , that we get something done so Congress won t be in crisis management at the end of next year , the member said .
