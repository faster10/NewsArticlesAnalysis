Established in 2005 , the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) is the largest multi national , multi sector CO2 trading system in the world . The ultimate aim of the system is to ensure that EU Member States are compliant with their Kyoto Protocol commitments and to do this the most energy intensive industries are allocated carbon permits by Member States which allow them to emit a certain amount of CO2 . If these companies want to emit more CO2 than their permits allow for , they are able to buy them from more efficient companies with spare permits .
