Several questions arise : Will Trump , even in his absence , be the biggest presence on the debate stage , and the focus of the other candidate s answers , or can they ignore the elephant across town and talk policy ? Just how much further down on people s radar does this push the prelim debate on Fox News at 7 p . m that will feature Carly Fiorina , Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum , and Jim Gilmore in the consciousness of normal voters ? Is this this the last time we ll see many of the candidates ?
