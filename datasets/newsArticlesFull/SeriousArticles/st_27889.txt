Jeff Bezos ( AMZN ) ? alone , for example , got 29 . 5Bn richer this year . ? 29 . 5Bn is more than the ENTIRE GDP of 69 ( out of 200 ) countries on this planet . ? Iceland , for example , has a population of 323 , 000 people and a GDP of 14Bn , Bahamas has 377 , 000 people and a GDP of 9Bn . ? 29 . 5Bn would make 300 , 000 people 98 , 333 richer or it would make 10M people about 10 , 000 richer . ? And this is the problem our failure to redistribute that wealth through taxes means that the middle class , who buy from Bezos , transfer 29 . 5Bn to him and Bezos , who doesn ' t spend 29 . 5Bn a year , simply adds it to his pile of money . ? That money doesn ' t " trickle down " on anyone it is simply taken from the poor and given to the rich over and over again .
