ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : Now that debates over debates have consumed both parties , who wins ? Let s start with who loses : the issues , and any real discussion of them , in the final days before voting starts . On the Republican side , that would seem to benefit the frontrunner , with Donald Trump just starting to see real scrutiny ( and ad spending ) focusing on his previously held liberal positions . Surprise ? it s Trump vowing not to attend the last debate before Iowa . For the Democrats , Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have both , somewhat remarkably , run issue heavy campaigns . But it s really only Clinton who is looking for a new storyline in the closing days before Iowa , hoping to contrast her record with what she sees as an unrealistic vision being put forth by Sanders . Surprise ? it s Clinton who is suddenly pushing for a final Democratic debate , after months of insisting there were plenty scheduled . ( Sanders is now pressing for a slate of four more debates , leveraging Clinton s short term imperative to increase the probability of a race that will last well into the spring . ) Yet , as these fights consume precious pre voting hours , how many races can people point to that really turned on how many debates were or weren t held ?
