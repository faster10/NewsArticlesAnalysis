Want to know what the pro gun crowd thinks about gun violence ? Or I should say , what the pro gun crowd wants everyone else to think about gun violence ? All you gotta do is wait for a mass shooting to occur , then check the Twitter accounts of the so called GOP presidential candidates . I say ' so called ' because the idea that any of this bunch has demonstrated even a sliver of leadership , never mind the slightest attention to facts , makes me wonder how we could remotely imagine one of these clowns sitting in the Oval Office after January 20 , 2017 . Anyway , back to the topic at hand .
