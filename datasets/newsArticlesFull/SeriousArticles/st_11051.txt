In truth , it ' s tough to really judge any head coach without seeing what he can do with a competent quarterback . It ' s also true that we ' re both fans and league decision makers alike really awful at figuring out whether head coaches are any good . Virtually every current top coach , as I ' ve mentioned in the past , was let go ignominiously by a pro team in the past . The Browns ran Bill Belichick out of town . The Patriots dumped Pete Carroll to bring Belichick in years later . The Bears let Ron Rivera go because he wanted to interview with teams . Heck , the Panthers were about to fire Rivera before 2013 . The Steelers forced Bruce Arians into retirement . Even if the Eagles fire Kelly , it wouldn ' t be proof that he ( or his concepts ) don ' t work in the NFL .
