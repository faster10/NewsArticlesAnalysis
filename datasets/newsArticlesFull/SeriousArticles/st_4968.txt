We met with community leaders to discuss Konna ' s most urgent needs , involving all sectors of the community , including the mayor , women ' s groups , local health associations and youth groups . We also visited homes to see firsthand the household level impact of the conflict . Hunger and food insecurity are major concerns in Konna and throughout Mali . Konna ' s market was closed for a month because of instability in the region , cutting off access to food and compromising many people ' s livelihoods . The town ' s school remains closed , but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local NGOs .
