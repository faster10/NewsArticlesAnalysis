Tyrese Gibson : I went out to Comic Con about a year or so ago to promote the film " Death Race . " When I was out there , I really got to know some of the fans and I was just asking questions like , " Look at you , you ' ve got a full on Superman costume on or Batman costume , " and they were just like , " I just love comic books . " It was the first time I was ever exposed to that much selfless passion , to the point to where you don ' t care how silly you may look you don ' t even consider it silly . . . .
