If you have been impoverished by a birth too recent or an education too faddish to know the value of rote learning , you might never been forced to memorize the Gettysburg Address , delivered on this date in 1863 . You might have instead had a computer game in which you imagined how Americans of different stations and views would have felt about the speech or made a diorama with a pipe cleaner Abe Lincoln on a popsicle stick stage or fashioned a stovepipe hat out of recyclables . If that s so , you were ripped off . Everyone ought to know the speech that is the best , briefest encapsulation of the American idea of freedom conceived by the Founders and bought with the lives of more than 1 . 3 million troops at war . The good news is that it is easily remedied . At 278 words , even the most screen addled ought to be able to learn it .
