A good kickout block by the fullback on linebacker K . J . Wright ensured that Bobby Wagner would need to fill the inside gap at the point of attack to keep the run to under 4 yards . Wagner was easily blocked due to his apparent concern for Cam Newton on a bootleg and also slipped on the soggy turf , leaving Earl Thomas to try to keep the gain to less than 10 yards . Responding to a good but not great inside cut by Stewart , the Seahawk safety also succumbed to the turf and could only watch from the ground as the Panthers enjoyed the ultimate tempo setter .
