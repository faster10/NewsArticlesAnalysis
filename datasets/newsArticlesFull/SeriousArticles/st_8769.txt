stealthjunk you are mistaken . evan wasn t cut simply because he wouldn t take a pay cut . he wanted his deal reworked and a raise in 2015 and chose to stay away from the team to try to get that done . the eagles were very smart in cutting a guy in his mid 30s who wanted more money and wasn t that great to begin with . also , the eagles didn t really miss his presence as this story suggests . allen barbre at left guard was basically the same as having mathis would ve been . people like to pretend mathis is a great player , but the facts are he was a journeyman until he was 31 32 years old and then had the best two seasons of his career in a system under chip kelly that allows any OL with some athletic ability get out and block in the open field
