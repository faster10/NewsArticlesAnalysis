If a rule is created to credit interim coaches with wins , it is unlikely that the N . B . A . would go back historically and change old coaching records . That is a key distinction because Don Nelson is currently the career leader in coaching victories with 1 , 335 , but at least 10 of them came when Avery Johnson filled in for him in the 2004 5 season as he worked through some health issues . It is possible that a close examination of Nelson s career , and the career of Lenny Wilkens , who is credited with 1 , 332 wins , could result in a change at the top .
