U . S . Forces Korea ' s official website lists the current Force Protection level as " Bravo , " with some selected measures at a more heightened " Charlie " level . That means they ' ve stepped up patrols of bases , tightened gate security and ordered troops to pay special attention to " designated vulnerable points " both on and off base . But these measures were in place before Kim Jong Il ' s death , along with a recent reinstatement of an overnight curfew for U . S . troops in South Korea .
