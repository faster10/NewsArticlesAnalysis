Survivors ' stories tell us that some victims are sold into trafficking by family members , some lured by attention and promises of glamour by an " older boyfriend , " only to be abused , branded and sold for sex labor trafficking victims are often promised high paying jobs far away from home , only to have their documents taken , their lives and families threatened and horrid working conditions waiting for them with no opportunity for escape . Runaways are often picked up by traffickers within 48 hours of running away from home , and no one is looking to find them . The common thread is that traffickers prey on society ' s most vulnerable .
