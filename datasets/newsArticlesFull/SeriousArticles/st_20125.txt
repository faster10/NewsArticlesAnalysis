Annette Funicello represented an all American ideal of perky , spunky , mid ' 60s sexuality nonthreatening , effervescent , even wholesome . ( She may be the only actress in the history of showbiz to look demurely G rated even while wearing a bikini . Compared to her , even Sally Field in " Gidget " looked hot to trot . ) And while I normally detest the cliche of referring to this or that fallen star as emblematic of " a more innocent age , " Annette serves as a reminder that , sometimes , " cliche " can be shorthand for " undeniable truth .
