Second , the degree of haste with which the Indian side responded is a bit puzzling . I wish Delhi had taken a bit more time to sequence the steps that have led to the resumption . That would have prepared public opinion for it . It was clear that Sushma Swaraj had to go to Pakistan , and even meet the Pakistani establishment . But was an announcement of resumption of dialogue immediately necessary ? I don t know . Similarly , the National Security Advisors ( NSAs ) had a meeting . Was there a case for this set of NSAs to announce they were meeting ?
