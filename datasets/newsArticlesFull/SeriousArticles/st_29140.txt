The Departed , incidentally , seemed mostly to be about one man who was on the run from everyone the good guys as well as the bad guys . Until that man gets shot in the head , out of the blue . It is one of those masterful , magical moments in cinema ? ? when an engrossed viewer is jolted back to reality and pulled right back into the film within moments , because of one cruel twist that no one saw coming when it did . Not really surprising , the fact that the man shot dead in that cruel scene was Leonardo DiCaprio .
