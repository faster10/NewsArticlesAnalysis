Alabama is a seven point favorite because Alabama justifiably gets the benefit of the doubt . Watson has thrown for 3699 yards , thrown only 12 picks , and ran for 1032 yards . Earlier that day , Clemson s Wayne Gallman made 150 on 26 attempts . Luckily for him , star DE Shaq Lawson ( 23 . 5 TFL ) is expected to return from his knee injury . You re looking at a guy who grew up in the state of Alabama , and my dream was to play there . If we were going to have to lose , it would be nice to lose to him .
