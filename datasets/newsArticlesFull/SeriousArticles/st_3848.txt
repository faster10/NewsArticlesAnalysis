The first " Last Exorcism " opened in late August 2010 at 20 . 4 million . Though it only ended up making twice that in its lifetime , with a 1 . 8 million budget , it ' s no wonder CBS Films thought that they might be able to repeat Lionsgate ' s success . So far , " Part II " has made up its 5 million production budget , and surpassed the 3 million that CBS Films spent acquiring it , but considering the poor reviews and similarly bleak CinemaScore , it ' s very unlikely that it will hit the margins of the first film .
