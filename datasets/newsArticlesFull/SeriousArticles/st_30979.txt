Wilson has been one of the best fantasy quarterbacks the past three weeks , with 879 yards passing , 11 touchdowns , zero interceptions and his first rushing score of the year . I expect Wilson to keep those fantasy numbers flowing . He is finally playing like himself and now he gets another fantastic match up against a Ravens defense that has been among the worst at slowing down opposing quarterbacks . Baltimore has given up the eighth most fantasy points to quarterbacks this season . Seattle ' s wide receivers have stepped up in a big way since tight end Jimmy Graham went down , and I would recommend a Wilson Doug Baldwin stack for a combined 10 , 800 in Week 14 .
