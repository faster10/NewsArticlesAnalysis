ADMINISTRATION TO ISSUE NEW SALARY DATA RULES This is begging for a Donald Trump soundbite . Danielle Paquette and Drew Harwell : " President Obama proposed a new rule Friday that would require every large company in America to report employees ' pay based on race and gender , an effort to reduce longstanding pay inequities for women and minorities . The new policy , already drawing criticism from some business leaders , would order companies with at least 100 employees to add salary numbers on a form they already annually submit that reports employees sex , age and job groups . The new pay information would alert the EEOC to companies with significant wage disparities , which could result in hefty fines . During the updated data collection process , officials would not publicly name employers or employees , said Jenny Yang , chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , which published the proposed rule with the Department of Labor . If disciplinary action is taken , however , companies found to write discriminatory paychecks could appear in public record . " WaPo
