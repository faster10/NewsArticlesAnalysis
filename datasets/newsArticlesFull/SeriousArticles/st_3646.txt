As parents , we would never want to put up with discolored , funny smelling , bad tasting water for our kids . Government at all levels is expected to ensure our air is safe to breathe and our water safe to drink . It ' s one of the reasons we pay taxes , and it ' s become part of the social contract . However , in areas where generational poverty and municipal fiscal instability are realities , it is disproportionately poor people of color who bear the health impacts of things like old pipes , corrosive water , lead paint , bad schools , and so many other issues . The fact that the city is poor , is mostly black , and had an unelected town manager making cost cutting decisions regardless of the will of its people paints a grim but not unfamiliar picture .
