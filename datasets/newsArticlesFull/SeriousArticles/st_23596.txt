The lifting of international sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran passed as if it were a non event . The UN Security Council bestowed immediate legitimacy on the move in accordance with the nuclear deal it had stamped with its seal of compliance . Removing the freeze on Iranian assets means Tehran will obtain around 150 billion automatically , and up to 50 billion in promised investments over the next five years . According to experts , this would create growth of up to 5 percent a year , rescuing the Islamic Republic from an economic crisis and enabling it to pursue internal and external projects even amid falling oil prices .
