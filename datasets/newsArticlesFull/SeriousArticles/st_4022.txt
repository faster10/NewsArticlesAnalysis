As a student of sociology and anthropology , the phenomenon of mass shootings was widely discussed among my peers . Colleagues in my cohort had strong opinions about gun laws in the US . While a few staunchly defended the rights granted by the state , many others believed in state intervention and regulation because easy access to deadly weapons was simply unacceptable . However academic discourse has largely been unavailable to the public and unfortunately , the language is often complicated and to put off even a curious non academic person . But since news is how non academics form opinions and try to understand the world , it is imperative that media organisations take better stock of what they report and how they report the news .
