Ben has a tremendous work ethic . I remember the first day I met him . I talked to him at the Indianapolis combine . I was the offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints and he had called me on the phone , was seeking an opportunity just to talk football . He was coaching , I don t recall the school , somewhere up in New York or Connecticut Fairfield and we talked on the phone that evening and then the next day at lunch , when I was coming back from the workouts at the combine , Ben was sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for me . He drove all night just for an opportunity to sit down and talk football .
