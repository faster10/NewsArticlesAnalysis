Yes , I ve said little about policy . Here s the rub : when it comes to policy , Clinton is the candidate most aligned to my political worldview . There s much to admire in her positions on the economy , minimum wage , parental leave , university education , healthcare and climate change . These policies would take the country in a direction many , including this former American , would like to see it go . She d likely be a better foreign policy president than Barack don t do stupid stuff Obama . Her stance on gun control is welcome .
