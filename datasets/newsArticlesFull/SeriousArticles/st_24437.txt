I am a historian of photography and a scholar of visual studies . I have made my living and my reputation by the sharpness with which I can see , remember and recount the details and meaning of photographs . By the time I was asked to make this identification from a set of photographs , I had been practicing this profession for over a quarter of a century . I was used to looking at all kinds of photographs , even mug shots , which are an area of interest for contemporary artists and cultural critics .
