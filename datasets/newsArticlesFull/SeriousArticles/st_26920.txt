But there ' s a wrinkle that makes this case important : the involvement of the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) , which contends that Souza ' s Facebook comments could be protected activity under labor law . Americans don ' t enjoy general free speech protections against infringement by a private employer ( with some limited exceptions , such as certain kinds of whistle blowing ) . But federal labor law does grant union eligible workers the right to engage in " concerted activity " for the purpose of " mutual aid or protection " essentially , to communicate with each other about working conditions and terms of employment . Those same federal laws bar employers from interfering with workers ' efforts to improve their work situations .
