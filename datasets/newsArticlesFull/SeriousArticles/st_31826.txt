Unbeknownst to me at the time , my arrival at the hospital had launched an investigation by Child Protective Services back at my home in Austin . The caseworkers deemed my mother an " unfit parent " and my sister and I were placed under custodianship of the state . My care was left to the doctors and nurses at Children ' s , while my sister was sent to live with our godparents . My mother , herself an alcoholic and anorexic , had literally drunk herself into oblivion ( she was later diagnosed with Wernicke ' s Syndrome , a form of alcohol induced dementia ) .
