Ballack : It ' s always nice if you can be part of the history and well recognized . I mean that ' s what everybody wants , but the most important thing for me is that I ' m happy with myself . When I finish my career I can say I did well , I gave my best , and if a few more caps come it makes me happy . There ' s not really a target , 100 is a big number and hopefully I can reach them soon . What comes after I will see . I ' ve really enjoyed the times I ' ve played for Germany , every game is special for me , so hopefully I can play a few more .
