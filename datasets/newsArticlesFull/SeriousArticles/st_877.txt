So , given all this , why should environmental advocates in Paris keep their champagne corked ? Because one of the biggest favors OPEC ever did them was to lose control of the oil market a decade or so ago and unleash triple digit prices , a powerful incentive for every alternative energy source available , including efficiency gains . And now , with fossil fuels still by far the largest source of energy on the planet , OPEC has awoken already to the deflationary threat posed to its oil reserves which gives it an equally powerful incentive to pump more today rather than wait for tomorrow .
