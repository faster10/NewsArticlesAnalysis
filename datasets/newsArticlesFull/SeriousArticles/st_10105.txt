I am married ( wow ! ) , and my brilliant husband is an absolute sweetheart . I don ' t know any other man who has the self confidence to be pushed away ( sometimes sharply ) , both physically and mentally , as often as he has been . He has been gentle and patient ( and , yes , frequently emotionally depleted ) as we both worked through my need for space , tendency to go so deep into my own world that the real world and everyone in it cease to exist , and sensitivity to touch during the 26 ( soon to be 27 ) years of our marriage .
