The Republican nominee is more likely to emerge bloodied , broke , and behind . A nominating calendar and delegate rules designed to avoid the kind of extended intra party fight that crippled Mitt Romney s general election effort will almost certainly be no match for a fifteen candidate field , a number of whom can make a decent argument that they ll win the prize . The ferociousness and deep pockets of gladiators Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and the possibility that the party establishment will end up intervening with tens of millions of dollars in negative TV spots means a long , gory slog that might not find resolution until after the national convention in Cleveland in mid July . ( Of course , if Trump is ultimately the nomination victor , then broke should not be a factor . )
