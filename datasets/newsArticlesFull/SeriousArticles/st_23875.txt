At length , the terms evened out this night . Murray found his range , limiting Djokovic ' s . For 20 and 30 shots at a time , neither gave the other a glimpse with which to work . Passing shots were rare because there were no passages .

For a time , the Scot was the most dogmatic , also the most bellicose . Would he bluster his way back into this match yet ?
