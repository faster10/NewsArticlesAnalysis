Brooklyn , New York ( VBS . TV ) Colombian tailor Miguel Caballero specializes in making garments that enable the wearer to get shot at point blank range with nary an injury besides , maybe , a bruised ego . At high risk of catching a bullet demographics , such as rappers and politicians all over the world , rely on Miguel ' s handiwork . And , lucky me , when I was recently in Bogota for VBS . TV covering a few stories , I had the chance to visit Miguel ' s shop , learn about his protective clothing , and get shot in the gut by him . Seriously .
