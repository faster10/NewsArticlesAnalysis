I am so proud of the San Bernardino County Sheriff ' s Department , the San Bernardino Police Department and the Redlands Police Department . Their conduct , professionalism and discipline shined so brilliantly when faced with heavily armed shooters in what became a running battle in city streets , and though reeling from eight years of financial crisis and the near inability to keep current with equipment , they demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt their superior teamwork , selflessness and ability to rapidly overwhelm the enemy and render the public safe .
