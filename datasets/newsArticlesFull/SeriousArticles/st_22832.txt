" Having a global hit was amazing , but due to my personal struggles and relationships , I was robbed of the enjoyment of being on the top of a musical high of a career , " it quotes Band as saying . " I dropped everything to fight for my ailing wife , followed by a divorce , which equaled with a substance abuse problem that almost took my life . Coming out of my addiction with yet another struggle is something of a freedom . This second chance and has given me great fodder for our new music . "
