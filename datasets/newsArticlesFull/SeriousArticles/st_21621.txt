Except in 2002 . That year , at age 34 in the twilight of his career ? but five years younger than Manning is now , Johnson was Tampa Bay s starting quarterback . He had a career year , throwing 22 touchdowns to just six interceptions with a 92 . 9 quarterback rating , the third best in the league . Not 34th best . Third best . Those Super Bowl champion Buccaneers were built on the defense that Tony Dungy left behind for Jon Gruden , just as Manning s Broncos will win or lose on the defense John Fox left for Gary Kubiak . But Johnson had far more to do with his team s success than Manning does now . It s not a question of whether Brad Johnson deserves to be in the Hall of Fame along with Manning one day . He doesn t . Johnson had one good season in a career of mediocrity . Manning has had this awful season after a near eternity of excellence . But saying today s Manning is better than 2002 Brad Johnson is no less insane than saying Cooper is the best football Manning . ?
