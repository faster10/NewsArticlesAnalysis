Once negotiated , the whole messy package is presented to Congress for and up or down , take it or leave it vote , no amendments allowed . ? A vote against the deal becomes a vote against the entire business community , if not against the modern era of increasing international trade . ? And the product of that dubious style of lawmaking is is not just unamendable on the floor . ? It s unamendable more or less forever , because any change at a later time violates the ? trade treaty , and invites trade sanctions from ? every other country that signed the deal . It makes a more permanent change in US law than anything short of a constitutional amendment .
