Naturally , this is a topic that elicits differing viewpoints : one side might say the extra rest is beneficial for recharging tired arms and bodies , while the other side might say that rust accumulates with too much down time . Starting pitchers might get to rest elbows and shoulders that already have over 200 innings on them , but a hot hitting team ( as the Mets were in both the NLDS and NLCS ) might cool off with an extended break leading up to the World Series . If you ve watched or heard postseason baseball talking heads , you ve almost surely witnessed both of these arguments being made .
