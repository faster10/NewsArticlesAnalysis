Belichick said the Chiefs dominant 30 0 win over the Texans in the wild card round pretty much followed the script of how Kansas City has been playing . I d say yesterday s was a typical Kansas City game this season ? or the last three quarters of the season , he said . Lot of turnovers on defense , no turnovers on offense , and capitalized on their opponents mistakes and they didn t make many . . ? . ? . The coach also said he didn t see all of the wild , penalty filled Steelers Bengals game from Saturday night but that he talks to his players often about keeping their cool in the heat of battle . We talk to our team quite a bit about things like that , so it s always important , Belichick said .
