WHERE TO STAY Rooms can be hard to come by during Spoleto , so for last minute travelers , we recommend Lodge Alley Inn , a time share that rents its unreserved rooms starting seven days in advance . It ' s an old Masonic temple with choices of a studio or a one or two bedroom condo , all with kitchenettes . From 209 . Alternately , you can stay across the river at the Hampton Inn Charleston Mount Pleasant Patriot ' s Point . It ' s a short drive to downtown over the Arthur Ravenel Jr . Bridge , and the rates are more affordable than those in the city center . From 169 per night .
