Ali , meet DeAnna : For starters , if I had to compare Andi to previous " Bachelorettes , " I ' d say we can expect something along the lines of a mix between Ali Fedotowsky and DeAnna Pappas . Andi is smart , and she seems to have her feet planted firmly on the ground . Most importantly , she ' s also very strong . Honestly , leaving Juan Pablo post fantasy suite is one of the reasons I like her so much . She knows what she wants , or at least what she doesn ' t want , and she ' s not hesitant to act on that .
