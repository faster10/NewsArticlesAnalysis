Some of our goals are to buy a field we would be able to use anytime we want to have an academy where we can help even better the kids who are talented in soccer and would love to become professional players to expand our program and have more girls to have a school with art , painting , music , so when the kids finish the program they have something in their hand and to have a real and solid structure with an adequate administration who will make sure that FONDAPS ' work continues even if I am not here anymore .
