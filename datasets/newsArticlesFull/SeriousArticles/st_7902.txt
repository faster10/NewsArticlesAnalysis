I know that Rehtaeh did nothing to deserve that type of treatment . I know she was not cruel or mean to you name removed . You probably knew nothing about her whatsoever . Did you know she loved to read , would drop everything to help an animal or friend in need ? That she was bright and funny ? Did you know she had two little sisters that she adored ? Did you know that the day she was born she changed my life for the better ? After she was born I spent the next seven years in university and she was my driving force . No , you would not know these things because you never took the time to view her as a person .
