Groundhog Day portrays eloquently the message that it is only when we live in the present moment that we can truly be at peace . Throughout the movie , Phil plans and plots in order to make the one day that he is reliving perfect . He tries in vain to woo the girl , to find happiness in wealth , and to thwart death but to no avail . For it is only when Phil lets go of his need to make life perfect and embraces the present moment for what it is that he is freed from his nightmare and begins to live a new day . Almost inconspicuously and without fanfare , Phil states , " Whatever happens tomorrow , or for the rest of my life , I ' m happy now . . . " A line that breaks him from the chains of living the same day over and over . In our fast paced technology driven world of instant communication , it is more important than ever for us to remember to be present and enjoy the only moment that ever exists the present moment . Let us all take this moment during this season of cold weather when New Year ' s resolutions have faded and the memories of the holiday spirit are perhaps forgotten to find a renewed determination to begin to appreciate and enjoy the present moment . I invite you all to sit down with my family and me and with a bowl of popcorn to enjoy and savor my favorite holiday movie , Groundhog Day . . . again .
