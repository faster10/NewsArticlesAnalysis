Charles Robinson , Yahoo ! Sports : " With a talented roster that is largely set and a salary cap that is showing stretch marks in the near term , ( Miami Dolphins ) owner Stephen Ross can ' t afford to miss on his next coaching hire . Not after a deacde of resets by the team ? from Cam Cameron to Tony Sparano to Joe Philbin . This time , Ross needs the proven commodity . He needs the Super Bowl winner . The quarterback whisperer . The visor . He needs Sean Payton . While there may be other job openings on the horizon with younger quarterbacks or better short term cap situations or better stadiums , none of them have the big stage potential of Miami . None of them are as ready to win in 2016 with the right tweaking . And none of them have an owner with the ear of Bill Parcells , who remains a close friend and adviser to Payton . "
