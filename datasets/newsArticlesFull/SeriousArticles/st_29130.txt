Perhaps I m being paranoid perhaps the opposition to the band isn t as strong as it seems to a self conscious fan ( Pitchfork , for instance , was less harsh in its Ghost Stories review , merely accusing the album of having the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs ) . But this critical vitriol seemed to pervade the public consciousness , at least among people who consider themselves to have discerning musical taste . It didn t help that Coldplay kept getting bigger and bigger when it comes to music , of course , popularity and coolness are diametrically opposed .
