In 1987 I landed a job as a producer of music programs on Czechoslovak Television in the city of Ostrava , earning about 60 a month . I was excited at first . I was working with Czechoslovak rock bands and pop stars . But from the beginning , my enthusiasm was eroded by numerous censors overseeing my work . They were mostly people who had no idea about TV or music , but had studied Marxism Leninism and were employed to watch for " ideologically harmful " content . And in rock ' n ' roll they saw plenty of it .
