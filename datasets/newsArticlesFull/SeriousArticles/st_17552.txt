Bender : What we are using here is electric motors , and there are four of them , which is actually quite unique especially when you compare it to ( technology used by ) amputees . Prosthetics so far have usually had one moving component , and in this case you have in one system four moving components . You have four motors two sitting at the hips and two at the knees and that ' s what you hear . and it ' s driven by a battery pack sitting on the back . In the middle , between the two batteries , is a computer and so that is pretty much it . It ' s an outer frame that pretty much mimics the bone structure . There are 15 sensors in it that almost re create your nerve system . And then there is the computer , which is really the brain of the whole thing .
