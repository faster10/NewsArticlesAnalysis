About the Broncos : QB Peyton Manning , who is 11 13 in postseason games , will be making his first start ? in two months . Battling various injuries , he labored through the worst regular season of his 18 year career . He threw multiple TD passes in just three of his 10 appearances and established career lows for TDs ( 9 ) , yards ( 2 , 249 ) and QB rating ( 67 . 9 ) . His passer rating was the lowest among all quarterbacks , and he was intercepted on 5 . 1 of his throws , easily the worst in the league . Still , the Broncos are counting on his experience and the balanced attack they displayed when he returned to action in a victorious relief appearance of Brock Osweiler in Week 17 . But if the Broncos are to advance , they may need to rely more on a defense that allowed the fewest yards in the league and had the most sacks ( 52 ) . Denver has lost three of its last four appearances in the divisional round , including two of three at Sports Authority Field at Mile High under Manning .
