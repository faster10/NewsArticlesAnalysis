It is difficult to exaggerate just how evenly divided the two major parties are in Ohio . For example , if one adds up all the Democratic votes for president between 2000 and 2012 , and then compares that number to all the corresponding Republican votes during that same period , the difference is only about 150 , 000 votes out of more than 21 million cast . This comes out to a difference of less than 1 . There is no reason to think , therefore , that the election won ' t be very close in Ohio in 2016 .
