Or so one would think . Instead , the SAG Awards threw us even more curveballs . Purported pacesetter " Spotlight " received less attention than expected , ? with Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo left out of the supporting actor field . " The Martian , " " Joy " and " The Hateful Eight " came up empty handed , and " Mad Max : Fury Road " only managed a stunt ensemble nomination . Helen Mirren made off with two surprise nods , Sarah Silverman ' s dramatic indie " I Smile Back " scored Best Actress over the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Lily Tomlin , and " Straight Outta Compton " edged out hefty competition in Best Ensemble . ?
