So it s hardly exaggerating to suggest 2016 will be a big year for the Vikings and their workhorse running back as they move into a new stadium and try to take another step or two . His ability to get into the backfield in an instant freed up defensive end Cliff Avril , defensive tackle Ahtyba Rubin and linebackers Bobby Wagner and K . J . Wright to finish off running back Adrian Peterson or pressure quarterback Teddy Bridgewater . That s one of those times where I should have just put a double arm wrap ( on the ball ) . Gostkowski was at the YMCA with his son during the Vikings Seahawks game , but he did catch the replay later .
