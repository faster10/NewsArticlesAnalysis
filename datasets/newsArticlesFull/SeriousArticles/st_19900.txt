From observing Jones , Brolin had developed a decent impression of the actor ' s deadpan , laconic , staccato way of speaking that , by chance , he shared with " Men in Black 3 " director Barry Sonnenfeld one night at a dinner with the Coen brothers during the " No Country " shoot . It was good enough to convince Sonnenfeld that Brolin was the only choice to play the young Agent K . Still , Brolin wasn ' t initially convinced he quite fit the part : " It ' s like , ' Why me ? ' I don ' t know if it ' s the Americana people see in me and Tommy . Or if it ' s the size of our skulls . Or if there ' s a Cro Magnon feeling when you look at us sort of a silverback thing . "
