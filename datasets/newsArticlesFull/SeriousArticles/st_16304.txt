In the annals of human history , there has never been a country as compassionate and generous as the United States . When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , the great Russian novelist who defied communism , visited America , he said , " The United States has long shown itself to be the most magnanimous , the most generous country in the world . Wherever there is a flood , an earthquake , a fire , a natural disaster , an epidemic , who is the first to help ? The United States . Who helps the most and unselfishly ? The United States . "
