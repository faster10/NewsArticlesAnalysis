Button is trying to undercut Harold ' s position by comparing Continental ' s spectacular growth with that of rivals . The margin by which Continental ' s financial returns outpaced those of similar oil and gas companies should be considered Continental ' s " active " appreciation , the Button report says . It compares Continental ' s financial returns to those of 76 other publicly traded U . S . independent drillers . Continental and these " peer companies , " the report says , faced similar risks , opportunities and market conditions such as fluctuating oil prices , choices among technologies and drilling locations , and methods to raise and deploy capital . Continental ' s return on investment was at least 44 , 271 percent during the Hamm marriage , Button wrote . The average return among peers extrapolated over the same period was a relatively modest 691 percent , the report says . Continental ' s outsize returns compared to its competitors are " likely the results of difference over time in the specific operational decisions and actions of the management of these companies . " Hamm founded Continental in 1967 , two decades before his marriage to Sue Ann , a former attorney at the company . Continental has said the divorce is a private matter that hasn ' t affected the business and isn ' t expected to . At the same time , Continental attorneys have submitted hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in the trial in support of Harold . They also have repeatedly persuaded the judge to seal evidence and close the courtroom to avoid damaging Continental ' s interests .
