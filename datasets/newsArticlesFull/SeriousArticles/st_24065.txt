Manning has talked about what an unusual season this has been for him . There was a run of terrible play that Manning has never experienced before , the first benching of his career and a bad foot injury . Brock Osweiler looking like Manning ' s permanent replacement pretty late this season , until Broncos coach Gary Kubiak decided he wasn ' t . Then there was the HGH report and innuendo that got Manning so upset , the questions if he ' d ever play again because of Osweiler , and then the triumphant Week 17 return off the bench to help Denver clinch the AFC West and the No . 1 seed . Even on Sunday , the Broncos didn ' t score a touchdown for the first 57 minutes of the game , and the longest pass play of the game came when Manning seemed to give himself up and went to the ground before he got sacked , only to get up because he wasn ' t touched and hit Emmanuel Sanders for 34 yards .
