My first project was " Battlestar Galactica , " which put me on the map in a big way in science fiction . Even the horror and suspense genres , action shows I do a lot of work in that environment . When ( creator ) David Goyer called me about doing " Da Vinci ' s Demons , " it was the first time I was asked to do a historical period piece , so I leapt at the opportunity . One of the things that makes it different when you ' re doing regular TV , or science fiction especially , you can ' t really argue with how music sounds . You can do whatever you want . It doesn ' t mean it ' s always tasteful , but there ' s no right or wrong . I really wanted to embrace the restrictions of that time period Renaissance instrumentation , Renaissance melodies I really wanted to evoke that period . The problem was Goyer wanted to do the opposite of that . It was a very modern adventure show . What ended up happening is actually a hybrid of both ideas . We ended up with this unique hybrid . When you hear it , ends up sounding like the show it doesn ' t sound like anything else .
