Obama has a real weakness in this year ' s debate , however . Read through his play to the base budget , and you ' ll see the term " fairness " advanced over and over again .

And that argument is rooted in rhetoric about the " shared sacrifice " needed to restore national greatness . After all , the world ' s largest debtor nation cannot remain the world ' s sole superpower for long .
