First , I ' ve been evaluating debates for 20 years , and can tell you if you doubted it for a second that Perry ' s mental block was very , very bad . One reason is that the question he was asked at the time wasn ' t even about cutting agencies . It was about how he could work with Democrats across the aisle . But Perry wanted to add some flair , so he looked at Ron Paul in order to brag about how he would cut three different agencies ( although still not as many as Paul ' s five ) and then gave himself the self induced wound .
