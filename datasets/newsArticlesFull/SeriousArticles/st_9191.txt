Third , Pope Francis ' message of a new leadership style of humility and simplicity after the example of Jesus Christ is also a paradigm shift which invites the African church leaders to a new way of service and pastoral ministry . In a continent where the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church are sometimes reinforced by African traditional patriarchal norms of power and privilege , Pope Francis ' style of leadership offers a new model of service . This challenges African church leaders to exercise their pastoral leadership in a more participatory , transparent , and inclusive ministry where the laity and especially women participate in the decision making process in the church . Also to be abandoned is a cult of personality and undue attachment to hierarchical power which parallel the failed political leadership in some African countries .
