Should the Cardinal win , they still will need some help to make the playoff . Oklahoma appears to be in good shape because it doesn ' t have to play in a conference title game , and the winner of the Big Ten championship between Iowa and Michigan State would figure to be a lock . That leaves No . 1 Clemson and No . 2 Alabama . If the Tigers lose to North Carolina in the ACC title game and the Crimson Tide fall to Florida in the SEC title game , the Cardinal could make a case for being in the playoff after climbing two spots to No . 7 in this week ' s CFP rankings .
