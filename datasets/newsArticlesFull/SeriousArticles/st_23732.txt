This combination of factors helps explain why ISIS feels the need to engage in attacks in places like Paris and to break with its previous policy of focussing on the local . ISIS is looking increasingly like a lost cause and it needs to place itself back at the centre of global events , to prove its relevance , and resilience , as well as to attract new recruits . Its propaganda machine requires it to have success stories . It should therefore come as no surprise that the social media sphere exploded with tens of thousands of postings during and after the Paris attacks , jubilating about the conquest of Paris and the killing of infidel pigs . ISIS s daily radio news bulletin ( Al Bayan Radio ) is quite revealing in this regard . It consists of recounting an endless list of victories , on all fronts , with details of enemy losses , but none for ISIS . It is very much like listening to the old Nazi or Soviet radio propaganda ? onward and forward but no retreat or defeat . ISIS not only lacks the confidence to inform about the truth , but as a self proclaimed divinely ordained state it can only enjoy victory and never suffer defeat . Here lies its Achilles heel because with defeat it loses its appeal and its claims ring hollow .
