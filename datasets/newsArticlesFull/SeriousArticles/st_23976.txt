( JA ) : During the 80s , films with modest budgets would get cinema distribution and the stars would have predominantly action orientated backgrounds . But it ' s changed . Now audiences demand a higher standard of acting . Gone are the Van Dammes , Schwarzeneggers and Stallones . . . the muscle bound action hero . The modern action hero is Keanu Reeves in " The Matrix " or . . . good actors like Will Smith , Matt Damon . If you reach Jackie Chan ' s level you will get something really engrossing to watch . That ' s a new breed and I want to be in that niche . Do you prefer muscle bound tough guys like Arnie or modern action heroes like Matt Damon ?
