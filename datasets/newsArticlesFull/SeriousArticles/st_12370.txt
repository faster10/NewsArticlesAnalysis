Any presidential candidate could stampede Trump like across the media if they so choose , saying insane thing after insane thing with few , if any , intermissions for non insane utterances . It s not especially hard . What is an outlandish , racist , xenophobic , sexist , anti Semitic , or just plain nonsensical thing that might earn plenty of attention and ( re ) rile up the baser elements of the electorate ? Coming up with crafty insults or unconstitutional policies that might briefly feed the id is not especially difficult .
