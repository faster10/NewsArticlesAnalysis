Now everything is up in the air again . Italy ' s highest court decided to reject the acquittal in its entirety and send the case back to a panel of appellate judges to reconsider . What that means in practical terms is nothing short of a complicated , confusing mess . When Knox was first convicted of murder , there was outcry in the United States that she was wrongfully convicted , based on shoddy evidence collected by sloppy Italian police . When she was acquitted two years later , there was nearly as much of an outcry in Italy that the courts had succumbed to American pressure . Now , the outcome is again uncertain , with the only guarantee that whatever happens , it will again cause an outcry it ' s just not clear yet by whom .
