It is clear that for the time being , Suu Kyi and her party have decided to negotiate and compromise with the military . This seems to be the reason that the NLD leader has not been openly critical of the government s discriminatory policies targeting the minority Muslim community of Rohingyas . Suu Kyi s reticence has disappointed many of her admirers at home and abroad . But the NLD leader has been forced to walk a tightrope , and she is not keen to challenge the military s authority at this moment . Recall that monumental patience she had displayed in enduring house arrest for a quarter century while refusing the easy option of going into exile . The NLD leader recognises the need to play her cards patiently . For Myanmar to have full full fledged democracy , it will have to change its Constitution . For the time being , a careful balance needs to be struck between its two important centres of power ? one presided by Parliament and the other ? by the military . ?
