Cemal disagrees . He was editor of the Cumhuriyet newspaper during the presidency of Kenan Evren a former army chief who led a 1980 coup and came to symbolize the military s decades long dominance over politics and of his successor Turgut Ozal . In the years after Evren s coup , fifty people were executed and half a million arrested , hundreds died in jail , and many more subsequently disappeared the sort of instability that Turkey has long since left behind . But even in the turbulence of those times , Cemal said , there was greater access to information . He resigned as a columnist from Milliyet in 2013 after the newspaper suspended him when one of his columns drew criticism from Erdogan . Erdogan has to date never held a real press conference , because he never wished to take and answer questions from those opposing him . . . Even the coup leaders including Evren held press conferences , Cemal said .
