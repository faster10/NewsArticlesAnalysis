1924 : The first Macy s Parade takes place along a six mile route beginning at 145th St . in Harlem . The floats are designed with a nursery rhyme theme in mind ? Little Miss Muffet and Little Red Riding Hood included ? to match the store s holiday window displays . Although the parade is held on Thanksgiving , it is billed as a Christmas Parade , kicking off the beginning of the holiday season ( which helps explain Santa s appearance on the final float ) . Instead of balloons on the parade route , real animals , borrowed from the Central Park Zoo , entertain the crowds .
