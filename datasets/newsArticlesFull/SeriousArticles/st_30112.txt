Ballack : Yeah , absolutely . To play a World Cup in your own country as a captain is not normal . When we saw the draw in 2001 or 2002 that we had the World Cup in 2006 we were all really excited because it was a big chance to play a World Cup in your own country . If I look back , it was a great tournament for us , it was a great few weeks . Everybody was so excited in the country , big parties all over the cities and now it ' s a different thing . It ' s the first World Cup in Africa , it ' s a little bit new for everybody . Germany was so well organized , everybody expects the same now , but it ' s a totally different thing now . The fans have a different mentality , it will be a lot different but in a good way hopefully . That ' s why I think everybody is looking forward to it .
