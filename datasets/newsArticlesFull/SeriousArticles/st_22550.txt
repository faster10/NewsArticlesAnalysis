Michael Rosenberg , SI . com : " Brady was more prolific , and in some ways more impressive , but over and over the Broncos were inside his chest protector from the snap . Brady kept pushing his team downfield , any way he could , but the Broncos forced him into two critical interceptions , the kind we have often expected from Manning in these games . Manning did what his team needed . He didn t rack up big numbers , but he was efficient and smart . He took what New England gave him , and he won the game , which is what Brady fans have always said is the whole point , right ? This is what it came to , at the end of what should be the last game of the best quarterback rivalry in history . In the end , Tom Brady was Peyton Manning , and Peyton Manning was Tom Brady . And that is a heck of compliment for both . "
