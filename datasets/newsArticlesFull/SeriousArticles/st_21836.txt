A draft pick like second round outside linebacker Preston Smith is one of the reasons Scot McCloughan will garner strong consideration for NFL Executive of the Year honors . Smith notched five sacks in the final three games to finish the regular season with eight , which led all NFL rookies . Smith forms a strong tandem with fellow OLB Ryan Kerrigan , who led the Redskins in sacks with 9 . 5 . Defensive end Chris Baker also developed as a pass rushing threat with a career high six sacks . As for run stuffing , nose tackle Terrance Knighton does a nice job clogging the interior of the opposition ' s offensive line but the Redskins could be susceptible in this area . Washington surrendered an average of 4 . 8 yards a carry during the regular season , which tied for second to last among all teams behind New Orleans ( 4 . 9 ) .
