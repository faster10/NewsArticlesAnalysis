Hmmmm when it comes to drunk owners , my first thought is Robert Kraft , but then what would he know about dealing with a losing streak ? Jim Irsay is another likely candidate , but his advice is unlikely to stop at just drinking , he probably would have handed Jerry a suitcase containing two bags of grass , seventy five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half full of cocaine , and a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers and also a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of Budweiser , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . I m going to have to settle on Mark Davis , because the massive overconsumption of alcohol is pretty much the only imaginable justification for a billionaire to have a haircut so bad that it makes Trump s look stylish .
