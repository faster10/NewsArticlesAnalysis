On Tuesday , Idris Elba delivered a 32 minute speech to British Parliament on diversity in media . " I ' m here to talk about diversity , " started Elba . " Diversity in the modern world is more than just skin color ? It ' s gender , age , disability , sexual orientation , social background , and most important of all , as far as I ' m concerned diversity of thought . Because if you have genuine diversity of thought among people making TV film , then you won ' t accidentally shut out any of the groups I just mentioned . "
