Recently , a new material known as perovskite has seen the light of day and within just a few years it has started rivaling the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic solar cells , which currently maxes out at roughly 20 percent . This is the amount of solar energy that gets converted into electricity and the higher this is , the more we meet our energy needs . Over 80 percent of today ' s photovoltaics are made from crystalline silicon , but the high expense of both their production and installation means we are in need of alternatives .
