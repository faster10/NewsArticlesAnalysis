A January 12 Quinnipiac University poll which generated headlines found that Sanders had the support of 49 percent of " likely Democratic Caucus participants , " with 44 percent for Clinton , 4 percent for O ' Malley , 3 percent undecided . The previous December 15 Quinnipiac poll found Clinton at 51 , with 40 percent for Sanders . Ignoring margin of error and assuming that all those numbers were accurate , the headlines were generated by the movement of roughly 8 percent of " likely Democratic Caucus participants , " from Clinton to Sanders . If 2016 turnout is more like 2008 turnout , that ' s about 20 , 000 people . If 2016 turnout is more like 2004 turnout , that ' s about 10 , 000 people . Supposing that the national MoveOn vote to endorse Sanders was roughly reflective of MoveOn members in Iowa , there ' s some 30 , 000 MoveOn members in Iowa who are already likely Sanders supporters and just need a friendly and familiar voice to nudge them to show up . Thus , the headline generating shift in the polls in Iowa is of the same order of magnitude as the number of Sanders supporters in Iowa that MoveOn can plausibly move to show up to the caucuses .
