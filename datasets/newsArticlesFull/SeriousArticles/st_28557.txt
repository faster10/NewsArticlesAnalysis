The ground attack of Deshaun Watson and Wayne Gallman once again proved to be a formidable 1 2 punch , and the Tiger defense stiffened in the second half with a performance that evoked memories of the 2014 Russell Athletic Bowl , a 40 6 win over the Sooners . Clemson ran for 5 . 4 yards per attempt , the clear difference in the game . Had Oklahoma stopped the attempt or Clemson just punted the Sooners would ' ve come up with a huge stop and halted some Tiger momentum . It was the same story on the defensive line , as the group dominated the Sooners , pressuring Baker Mayfield and stopping a hobbled run game Samaje Perine played through ankle troubles and Joe Mixon left with an injury despite the absence of star defensive end Shaq Lawson ( knee ) for much of the night .
