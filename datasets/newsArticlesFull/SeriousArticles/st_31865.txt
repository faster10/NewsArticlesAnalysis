The Cowboys , who lost 13 12 , were setting up for a field goal in the first half when the Seahawks discovered they had too many players on the field and and called a timeout so that they would not be flagged . The problem is that they had moments earlier called a timeout , which is , as Joe Gibbs can attest , a no no . Rules prohibit consecutive timeouts by one team in a single dead ball period unless the team is trying to freeze a kicker . Officials are to keep the clock running and ignore pleas for a timeout .
