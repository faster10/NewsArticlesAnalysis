Total : As good as Clemson s offense has looked , and it has been good , there s simply no way it s wise to take an over in a game involving Alabama at this point . What they did to Michigan State was nothing short of extraordinary . Clemson will score more than the Spartans did in that game , but even on their best day it s going to be tough to get to 30 against this Alabama defense . It s going to come down to how much Jake Coker and the Alabama can put on the board . Expect Saban to want to control the ball and try to keep the game at his pace rather than the one Dabo Swinney would prefer . Everything on the line , were will probably be some mistakes . ? Pick : Under 53
