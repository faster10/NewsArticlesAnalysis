So it goes for Grigor Dimitrov , a player not merely touched by the tennis gods but completely massaged by them . If you were building the beau ideal of a tennis player , he would play ( and likely look ) a lot like Dimitrov . The problem : Dimitrov plays tennis . He doesn ' t work tennis . He certainly doesn t compete tennis . You have the feeling he would prefer tennis if it were like golf or bowling . You re not really competing simultaneously . You do your thing and don ' t much worry about other people .
