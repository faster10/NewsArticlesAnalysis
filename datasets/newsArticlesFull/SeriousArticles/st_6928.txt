" Part of who we are as a Jesuit university makes us insist that we care for these students from every point of the compass , " Pilarz said . " We have this tradition called cura personalis which goes back to the 16th century and really is rooted in Ignatius Loyola ' s experience of how God treated him as a unique individual and that ' s how we want to treat all our students . We really try to stress meeting them where they are individually and then moving them along so they achieve well academically . "
