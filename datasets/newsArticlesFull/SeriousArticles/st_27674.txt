Directors at Poole knew the add ons they had written into his Swindon transfer could have amounted to nothing had Austin , then 19 , faded into obscurity . He scored 46 goals in 46 games in his first season at the club then 18 in 11 before the move . Coaching staff at Poole noticed improvement when he started training with Bournemouth ahead of his second campaign . Austin netted twice in a 3 0 friendly against them and manager Eddie Howe liked what he saw . But Bournemouth were under a transfer embargo , so Austin trained with their first team and was released to Poole for matches .
