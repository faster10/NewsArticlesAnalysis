Our generation now makes up 24 of the electorate and could make up the deciding vote again , but only if we make it to the polls . We are not nearly as engaged this election season as the last time around . We lag behind older voters in interest in the election and intention to vote . Only 18 percent of us under 30 are following this election closely , down from 35 four years ago . Just 63 of those of us registered say we will vote , down from 72 last time around . While these numbers hold for both young Democrats and Republicans , a dip in voter turnout is most consequential for Obama , who leads among our peers .
