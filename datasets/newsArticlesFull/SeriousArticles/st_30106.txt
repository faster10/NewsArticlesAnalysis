I also said expect the New York Mets to drop at least two games where all logic says they should win , turning what feels like it should be a six or seven game series into a shorter , stranger one . Which is exactly what happened , the Mets had a really good chance of winning three of the four games that they lost . That s not because the Mets are a bad team , far from it . They re a talented young team who probably overachieved this year . It s because these Royals are that good . They will take advantage of every single mistake . They are the best team in baseball , it s impossible to argue otherwise .
