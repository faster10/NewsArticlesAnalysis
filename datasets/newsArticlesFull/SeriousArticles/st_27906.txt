To say as much isn t a commentary on gun owners per se , but on human beings . We can screen the mentally ill all we want , but the ill aren t necessarily anymore susceptible to stupidity , anger , or crime than normal people . I m all for providing more affordable and accessible resources for dealing with mental illness , but let s not pretend that doing so would actually solve our gun problem . Putting the burden for gun violence on the mentally ill is little more than an all too convenient sleight of hand , one that results , moreover , from a misunderstanding of mental illness . The burden , rather , should be put on gun owners themselves , especially those who rebut any attempt to make access to guns more difficult , and on society as a whole .
