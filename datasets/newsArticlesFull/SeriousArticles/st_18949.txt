With 24 Catholics and 25 Anglicans recognised by the church , Uganda prides itself as the land of martyrs . Thousands of foreign and local pilgrims travel to the Uganda Martyrs shrine at Namugongo , outside Kampala , every 3 June ? a date on the Catholic calendar to celebrate the martyrs . The religious shrine is now a foreign exchange earner and will be even more so tomorrow , when an estimated 1 . 5 to 2 million people are expected to converge there for an open air mass given by the pontiff .
