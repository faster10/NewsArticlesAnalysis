Johnson : One of the things that ' s very important to me in the books is the characters have to change . They have to have things happen to them . You can ' t keep them in a stasis and try and write formulaic books . I think some of the best stories I ' ve ever heard in my life have been when I ' ve been sitting on a porch sitting in a rocking chair snapping green beans or out on a hunting camp looking over a fire at a guy who starts out , " let me tell you what happened to me last month . " I really love that old fashioned style of storytelling . There may have been a time with crime fiction when just writing a whodunnit was enough . A lot of readers come to crime fiction with the same expectations they have for literary fiction . They want fully developed characters , they want an arc of storyline , they want social commentary , they want humor , they want history , and they want to know who did it by the time they get to the end . So that kind of raises the bar up to a level where it makes the books much more worth writing , to be honest with you . If I was just trying to find clever ways of killing people that would get really boring really quick . I ' m lucky to be doing what I ' m doing .
