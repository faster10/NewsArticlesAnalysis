Peyton Manning can join that elite class on 7 February in Super Bowl 50 , adding the one accomplishment that has been missing from his sensational career resume .

Yes , with a win over the Panthers , the 2016 edition of Manning can stake his place among the worst quarterbacks to ever win a Super Bowl . In fact , if the Broncos can upset the Panthers , their quarterback will deserve to stand alone as the worst quarterback to ever lift the Lombardi Trophy .
