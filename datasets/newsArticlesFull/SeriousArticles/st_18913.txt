On his vision for Girl Meets World : Like its predecessor , Jacobs says he hopes the pilot for " Girl Meets World " captures " the confusions about growing up and what we are supposed to be and what we are supposed to aspire to be . " As for Jacobs ' own aspirations for the show , he says , " There ' s a column that I want to play in and that column contains The Wonder Years and Happy Days . That was always the column that I wanted Boy Meets World to be included in and I want Girl Meets World to be in that column as well . "
