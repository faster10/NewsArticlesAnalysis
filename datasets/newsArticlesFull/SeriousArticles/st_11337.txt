Focac is a platform focusing on multilateral projects between African countries and China based on the important accepted premises of South South co operation and equality . Traditionally , Focac Ministerial Meetings , and in this case , the Johannesburg Summit , provide the opportunity for new projects and areas of co operation to be announced . Within the partnership , there is a focus on infrastructure development , debt relief , poverty eradication , industrialisation , investment promotion , market access expansion , agriculture co operation , science and technology co operation , health co operation , education co operation and people to people cultural exchanges , among others . When compared to the nine challenges identified in the National Development Plan , including unemployment , infrastructural and health and education challenges , there are clear bilateral opportunities for South Africa arising from the relationship .
