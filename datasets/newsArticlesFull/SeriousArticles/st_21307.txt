Chicago has often fought efforts to shine light on the police department . Only after winning a federal court case against the city in 2014 did the Citizens ' Police Data Project , in part sponsored by the University of Chicago Law School , begin publishing more than 56 , 000 complaints lodged against some 8 , 500 CPD officers . Data published by the project this year show that no discipline was given to officers in 99 percent of complaint cases , compared with a national average of 90 percent .
