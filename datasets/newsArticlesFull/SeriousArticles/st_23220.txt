We met two of the nicest , warmest , funniest dudes , and through them our perspective on this war , and all war , was fundamentally changed . For the first time , I saw the war through the eyes of the oppressed , and saw it for what it was : ( expletive ) stupid . It was a stupid , stupid war . And the old men that conducted it , on both sides , were essentially the same ugly evil idiots the same ideologues that championed their own particular visions of a new world order under the banner of their chosen gods money , freedom , oil , Allah take your pick .
