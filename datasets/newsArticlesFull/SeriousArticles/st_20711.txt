" You have two great quarterbacks that are at the pinnacle parts of their careers , and they ' ve been so consistent from the adversity that they ' ve been through , throughout their whole career , " Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware said Wednesday . " Now , the clash of the titans is here again . You have an opportunity when you ' re a young kid , you watch those games or you play them on the video games , but now you ' re on the field with those guys . You ' re getting that roar from the crowd or you ' re getting that feeling from the next teammate beside you . That next teammate , for me , is Peyton . I think that ' s a big , monumental thing for me . I ' m really excited to be playing this week and be part of this experience . "
