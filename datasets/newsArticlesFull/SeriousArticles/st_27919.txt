Obviously there is a line that negative attacks can cross , after which they become destructive . But we aren t near that line yet . Get back to me when the campaigns begin dishonestly wrenching the other side s words out of context to completely change their meaning , or when Sanders goes after Clinton s emails in some form or other , or when Clinton red baits the self avowed socialist from Vermont . Then we ll have something to wring our hands about . But I don t think that s going to happen .
