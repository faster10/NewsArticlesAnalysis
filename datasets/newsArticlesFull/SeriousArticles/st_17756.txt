For much the same reasons , Coleman has a realistic shot . Baylor isn t the historic power of Alabama , but it s one of the most respected programs in the sport today . It s in the thick of playoff contention . But most notably of all , Coleman is already on every list , and he has not even yet played in a legit big game . If he puts up his usual big numbers and makes his customary highlight plays in upcoming games against No . 12 Oklahoma , No . 8 Oklahoma State and No . 15 TCU , he could well win the thing . But Baylor will need to win them .
