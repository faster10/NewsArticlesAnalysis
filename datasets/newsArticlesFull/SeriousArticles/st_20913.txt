Big " tigers " have been arrested in each wave : Chen Xitong ( former Beijing Party chief ) in 1995 , who was sentenced to 16 years in prison but released in 2006 due to health concerns . Chen Liangyu , the former Shanghai Party chief , was suspended from the Party in 2006 and eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison on bribery and corruption charges . And now Bo Xilai , the former Chongqing Party chief it is no coincidence that these waves occurred around leadership changes .
