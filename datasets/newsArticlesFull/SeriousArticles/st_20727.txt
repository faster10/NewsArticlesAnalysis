The scale of the challenge is enormous . The unconventional warfare waged by the terrorists is primitive yet deployed in a sophisticated manner . It is probably not too difficult to make the kind of bomb that likely brought down a Russian airliner flying out of Sharm el Sheikh or to acquire guns on the European black market . But to co ordinate so many strikes in so few days requires skill and hateful planning . The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( Isil ) benefits from territorial gains in the Middle East , which have allowed it to raise cash and provide a centre for training . Al Qaeda affiliates , guilty of the Mali assault , continue to exploit ethnic tensions in North Africa . And the entire jihadist movement is allied by a hatred of the West and a willingness to die . Terrorist operations are simpler to conduct when your foot soldiers do not care whether or not they live .
