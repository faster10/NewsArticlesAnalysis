Chiefs ( 4 . 5 ) vs . Bills ? This is more of a bet against Rex Ryan after an emotionally draining loss to the Patriots on a short week going on the road against a suddenly resurgent defense . Rex is a great coach , but there ' s a roller coaster effect in play here and Kansas City ' s been very even keeled the last four weeks , running the ball efficiently ( despite losing Jamaal Charles ) , scoring more than 23 points each week and giving up less than 10 total points . I also think Tyrod Taylor ' s injury is worse than we might think right now , which could mean EJ Manuel being prominently involved in this game . If that ' s the case it won ' t hang at 4 . 5 long .
