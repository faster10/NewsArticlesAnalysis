Can we trust the accuracy of the intelligence on which bombing would be based , ensuring that civilians are not killed or maimed in error , as happened so often in Afghanistan ? Is it really convincing for Mr Cameron , pleading self defence , to insist that he , like Tony Blair , has no need of specific UN authorisation ? beyond that provided by Friday s vote ? guaranteeing that Britain is acting within international law ? And when all is said and done , would such a campaign be undertaken because it is the right , moral thing to do ? or because the White House expects and demands it of us ?
