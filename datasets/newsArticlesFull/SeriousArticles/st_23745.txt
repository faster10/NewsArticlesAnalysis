This might be a controversial " surprise , " but ? Jennifer Lawrence in ? Joy earning the Best Actress nomination over Smith surprised some . We understand she won the Golden Globe , but was an Oscar nomination deserved ? The jury ' s still out on that one . ?

So we ' re not ? totally off base in our mentality .
