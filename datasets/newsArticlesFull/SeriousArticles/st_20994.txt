The 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict , the young distributor that found success with Insidious ( 54 million ) earlier this year . The studio has since struggled with both " Don ' t Be Afraid of the Dark " ( 23 . 9 million ) and " Drive " ( 33 . 7 million so far ) recently . Unfortunately for FilmDistrict , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave " The Rum Diary " a harsh " C " CinemaScore grade , so it ' s not likely to hold well in future weeks . Talk about a bad hangover . . .
