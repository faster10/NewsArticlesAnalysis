There are many ways to jockey over the rules and delegate credentials in 2016 if candidates get to that point . One of the first they would consider is the threshold candidates need to reach in order to be considered eligible for the nomination . Romney delegates raised it from a plurality of delegates in five states to a majority of delegates in eight states ? which kept Ron Paul from getting a bigger role ? at the 2012 convention . That eight state threshold will need to be either renewed or reworked by the 2016 convention rules committee , which will happen just before delegates gather in Cleveland , setting up a potentially brutal rules battle between campaigns .
