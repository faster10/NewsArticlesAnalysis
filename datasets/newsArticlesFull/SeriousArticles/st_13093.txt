Golden State was up 19 at halftime and probably figured they would roll to a 20 plus point victory . And normally , they probably would have . It ' s also nothing new for someone to inform a player they ' re close to a statistical achievement and then for them to have a set amount of time to go get it in what looks to be a blowout . The Warriors just didn ' t do what they needed to do in order to keep that game from getting close . And credit to the Sixers for fighting enough to make the Warriors have to sweat it out .
