Regardless of the means , head towards the towers of Makati , one of the more central areas that make up Metro Manila . Home to big businesses and major hotels that may make you feel like you ' re in Singapore , if you ' re there on a Saturday make sure you wander through Salcedo Market . It ' s an upmarket affair , relatively speaking , where you can grab some great local food and produce . Those hankering for excellent western food and a glimpse of Manila ' s long lunching business types should head to Apartment 1B on Lafayette Square .
