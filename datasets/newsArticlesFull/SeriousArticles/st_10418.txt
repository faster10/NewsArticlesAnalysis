That is why there is nothing more comforting ? or more humbling , really ? than to hear someone say , I m praying for you . Because when hear you that , you realize , you re not alone . God is there . And hundreds , if not thousands , if not millions of people are all speaking to Him on your behalf . They re not praying for some abstract notion . They re praying for you the person . It says a lot about our country that people of both parties ? and all faiths ? will drop everything and pray for their fellow Americans . What it says is , we believe in the dignity of the individual . And that is why prayer should always come first .
