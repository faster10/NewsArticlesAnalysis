Steve Smith , who is arguably the greatest receiver to play for Carolina in the team s history , was released from the team in controversy before he wanted to leave , but still has fond memories of the Panthers . He also has respect for his former quarterback , who he said is seeing racism play into his legacy in the NFL . Automatically people started calling him a thug , Smith said . They don t call ? Aaron Rodgers ? thug . They don t call other guys of other colors thugs , but as soon as an African American athlete does it , they say , thug . ' Smith admits that there is also an arrogance to Newton , but that exists for many other white quarterbacks as well .
