Ohio Gov . John Kasich has not been talking about his spiritual beliefs , but he defended his expansion of Medicaid as what God demanded . It ' s a strained reading of Scripture , alas . After all , the Apostle Paul explicitly refused to command Christian churches to support one another , though he did say he wanted " to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others . " ( 2 Corinthians 8 : 7 ) . He did not include in that ranking Rome ' s role in raising taxes for a public welfare program . Medicaid is policy , not charity , despite the governor ' s confusion .
