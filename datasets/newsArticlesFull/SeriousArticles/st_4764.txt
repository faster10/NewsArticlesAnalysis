Obviously , Jeremy Corbyn won t use those exact words . He will instead talk about solidarity . Comradeship . Collective endeavour . The struggle for peace and international justice . He may repeat his claim the Stop The War coalition represents the very best in British political campaigning . But his message could not be clearer : I don t care what the voters think . I don t care what my colleagues think . I don t care what my party thinks . These are my real friends . And if you don t like it , screw you .
