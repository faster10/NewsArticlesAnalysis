Getting the least speaking time tonight were John Kasich and Ben Carson . For Carson , his entire closing statement was the Preamble to the Constitution . This seemed in line with how much substance he really has had to offer in these debates , that is to say not much . For Kasich , the shortcoming was not for lack of trying . It is actually a shame that he has been overlooked by voters and the media . In another time , he might have been well positioned to do well . A governor that has been fairly successful in his home state , is quite knowledgeable of policy , and takes a relatively moderate approach on most issues ( with the notable exception of his strong anti abortion stance ) . In this time of political polarization , however , moderate conservatives like Kasich stands very little chance . His stated pragmatism and optimism have gained little traction in a race where insults and fearmongering trump substance and possibility . Chris Christie did a little better in regard to time , but by using these tactics . He is the most adept at turning every topic into an opportunity to insult Hillary Clinton , and he continues using fear and invocations of 9 11 to argue for his candidacy . Neither tactic has provided him with the needed leverage to push ahead .
