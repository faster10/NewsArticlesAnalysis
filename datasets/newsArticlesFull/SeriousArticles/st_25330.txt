Unlike Clippers coach Doc Rivers , who has been restrained in his praise of the rival Warriors , Scott heaped it on the defending champs . Steve Kerr and Luke Walton s team scores over five points per possession more than the league s second ranked team , and has its fifth best defense , too . Sometimes it takes one game . They re 2 10 , but they got their last win on a Sunday in their home white jerseys against a good Detroit team . They don t have that championship hangover . I thought it was one of his better all around games . It s scary , because they re not living on past year .
