There is much more light and shade in this film . There is a greater variety of tone . There is much more fun . Once those possibilities had been unlocked for me , I felt like I really wanted to do it . And I ve not regretted it . There were moments in prep when we were feeling like we were racing to get the movie together and I thought , this is crazy . But , like any big movie , it is a wave and when you are riding the wave , it is exhilarating . And when you get knocked down by it , it hurts . It is just the bigger the movie , the bigger the wave , the bigger the highs and , I hope the bigger the excitement at the end of the day when you see it .
