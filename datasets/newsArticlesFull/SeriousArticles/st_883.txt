I think the biggest thing is just trying to prepare myself the best way I can . Over the years I probably haven ' t been in the best shape , but I ' m in better shape now than I was in ' 09 or ' 10 and this past summer . Hopefully in the next ten months I can get in even better shape and just try and accomplish the goals that I have . I have a lot of goals that I want to accomplish in and out of the water before I retire . If I ' m able to do that , then I can look back on my career and say it ' s been a success .
