There has been some controversy over the debate calendar on the Democratic side , of course . Many have pointed out the debate schedule seemed to be set by Debbie Wasserman Schultz to benefit Hillary Clinton ' s chances of becoming the nominee . The tight schedule ( only six debates , total ) and the timing ( holding them on Saturday nights , for instance ) have been criticized , but to no avail . This has even led to " non debate debates " being scheduled ( like the one hosted by Rachel Maddow , last week ) , where the candidates aren ' t actually on stage at the same time as each other ( call them " candidate forums " instead , we are told ) .
