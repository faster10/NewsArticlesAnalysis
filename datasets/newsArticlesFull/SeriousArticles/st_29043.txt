I got involved with the Make a Splash Initiative in 2008 right after winning the Olympic Gold medal . USA Swimming Foundation and Phillips 66 came and approached me and showed me the drowning statistics . After reading that 70 of African Americans don ' t know how to swim and 60 of Hispanics don ' t know how to swim , that ' s when it became very real to me . This initiative has been a very , very big part of my life in the past five years . We are seeing the numbers changing , so it ' s been a success .
