Exceptions are the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir , an American high school sophomore and that of his cousin 16 year old Mohammad Abu Khdair , who was abducted by Israelis and then burned to death . Tariq was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem and was captured on video being beaten unconscious by Israeli police . But his beating might only have become public because he is an American . While Tariq was released from detention after three days under a growing media spotlight , hundreds of Palestinians who have been rounded up remain detained with uncertain futures .
