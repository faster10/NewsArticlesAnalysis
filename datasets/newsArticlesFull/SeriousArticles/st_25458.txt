A special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate how the city of Flint exposed at least 100 , 000 residents to lead poisoning . The financially strapped city was under the control of a state appointed emergency manager in April of 2014 when it switched its source of tap water from Detroit s system to the nearby Flint River in a cost cutting move . Operators at Flint s water treatment plant failed to treat the water to make it less corrosive , causing older lead pipes to dissolve into the tap water .
