Pittman : I think it is still local , and I think people have misinterpreted what we ' re doing if people think we ' re making things less local . We ' re still providing the news and the weather and the emergency services and local contests , local promotions , etc . What we ' re able to do now is we ' re able to tap into a lot of talent we ' ve got nationally . We have the ability for the person from a remote studio to still talk about the town , and we have local people in the town who are directing the person as to what ' s important and developing those local relationships . Local is still paramount to us and very important to making a radio station a radio station .
