Netflix previously revived Fox ' s cult favorite " Arrested Development " for a 4th season , and is often a company that studios call when their shows are axed to see if there ' s any interest . The move could be a smart play for Netflix since it gives the company an exclusive lock on the conclusion of the show without a big episode commitment ( AMC is not part of the deal ) . Whenever viewers stream " The Killing " for years to come , if they want to see how the series concludes , they ' ll have to watch it on Netflix ( or a company that makes a distribution deal with Netflix ) .
