The " Do Not Track " law serves as a sterling example of how bad things are . When it was proposed , it was supposed to give users the right to demand that Internet companies not track them . Internet companies fought hard against the law , and when it was passed , they fought to ensure that it didn ' t have any benefit to users . Right now , complying is entirely voluntary , meaning that no Internet company has to follow the law . If a company does , because it wants the PR benefit of seeming to take user privacy seriously , it can still track its users .
