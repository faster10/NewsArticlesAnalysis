To Sanders credit , he doesn t deny any of these possibilities . What makes his campaign unique is that it s precisely the opposite of what so many critics charge : pragmatic . Unlike , say , President Obama , who promised to transform politics overnight , Sanders knows that s not how democracy works . Hope and change is a nice slogan , but it doesn t happen after a single election . Hence Sanders has stressed the necessity of greater involvement and participation beyond his campaign ? that s how social change happens , and it s the only way it happens .
