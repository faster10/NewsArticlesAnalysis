So there were about 120 kids sleeping in a shack , her home , like six to a bed . And we were reduced to tears one woman and volunteers were looking after all of these kids . We said , " One day , this whole street where you ' re living , we ' ll build you some homes , proper homes for these kids to live in . " Now there are six " cluster homes , " they call them , where they have running water , showers , proper bedrooms , they ' re like beautiful little houses . So that street now , there ' s no original shack left , it ' s got all beautiful houses for these kids to live in . You go there , you see how happy they are , and you think , God this is amazing .
