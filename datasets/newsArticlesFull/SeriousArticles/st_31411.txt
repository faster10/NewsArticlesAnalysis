" When we first put it up at 56 . 5 , we tried to temper it a little bit , just based on you have Kevin Love coming back from injury you have Kyrie Irving supposed to be out until January , " Sherman explained . " Initially , we took a couple of over bets and got it 57 . 5 . Then , with LeBron having his back injection last week and injuries piling up on that team , we eased it back to 56 . 5 . We ' re a little bit long on the over right now , but we just don ' t want to keep it sitting there too high , because that entire team is just built for the playoffs . Basically , the regular season is going to be the preseason to them . It doesn ' t matter whatever playoff seed they get . They are the most talented team in the East . I wouldn ' t put much stock into what they do in the regular season . "
