The three sisters are each cut from a very different cloth . The quietly ambitious Sparkle , a brilliant songwriter , is played by the sixth season American Idol winner Jordin Sparks , who proves to be a lot like Irene Cara that is , she ' s pretty in a slightly pained way and wholesomely sincere to the point of being a bit boring . The whippersnapper Dolores ( Tika Sumpter ) mostly stays in the background , except when she explodes in moments of vengeful high dudgeon . And then there ' s the sister known , literally , as Sister , who ' s the star of the group and is played by the ravishingly sexy and accomplished British actress Carmen Ejogo . In this role , she looks and acts strikingly like a demon driven , down and dirty Beyonc , and her scenes with Mike Epps , as her charismatic but hateful comedian lover , are the most potent in the film . The truth is that whenever Sister is on screen , we ' re a little unsure why the movie is named after anyone else .
