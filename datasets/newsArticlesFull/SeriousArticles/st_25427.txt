The Paris climate negotiations are a pivotal moment for global climate policy and carry huge implications for India s developmental future . The Paris outcome could affect the extent to which India faces dangerous impacts from climate change , which will magnify its development challenges . But it could also impact whether India faces undue global pressure to prematurely cap its emissions or limit its use of fossil fuels for development . Put differently , India faces the challenge of ensuring dual and seemingly contradictory objectives coming out of Paris .

But it also has to make sure that the mechanisms built at Paris to do so are consistent with principles of equity , allow India to contribute in a manner consistent with its development needs , and do not burden the country prematurely .
