The experiment sprang from two lines of thinking : animal studies aimed at modifying CPR technique and a public health effort to train more people in CPR . If your heart gives out while you ' re walking down the street , the number one thing that can save your life is to have a bystander who is not only trained in CPR , but willing to help . Unfortunately , such help is rare . Published studies put the rate of bystander CPR at around 20 percent . If you dig deep , the number really has nothing to do with the lack of desire . Instead , study after study shows people are apprehensive about putting their mouth on someone else ' s and maybe catching an infection from someone who ' s on the ground dying .
