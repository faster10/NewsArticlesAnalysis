In an interview with Steve Inskeep of NPR s Morning Edition , Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona , who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , talked about the Visa Waiver Program and changes that he and fellow Republicans feel would go a long way in protecting Americans from refugee security threats without blocking their entry . The proposed changes would impose stricter regulations for individuals from 38 countries who are currently entering the U . S . through travel . Currently they can visit for up to 90 days without a visa . Republicans seek to change that and tell people traveling to America from Iraq , Iran , the Sudan , and Syria , or people who have traveled to those countries in the last five years , that they can t enter without a visa . CNN has reported that the proposed changes passed the House by a vast majority on Tuesday .
