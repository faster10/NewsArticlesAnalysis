A good place to begin would be the original U . S . offer to swap 20 enriched fuel plates , to be used in Iran ' s research reactor , for Iranian enriched uranium . The fuel plates were originally a gift from the United States to be used in the production of medical isotopes . Iran tentatively agreed to such an offer in 2009 , only to withdraw it in the face of domestic opposition . It later accepted the proposal in writing , guaranteed by Turkey and Brazil , only to have it rejected by the United States in 2010 . Iran has since signaled its willingness to resume discussions without preconditions .
