She s much better just taking questions head on and playing along if she needs to , which is why her appearance on Colbert s show Tuesday night was yet another in the string of successes she s had over the last week . She stumbled at first , for the same reason she always stumbles on talk shows : She tries too hard to give the audience what she thinks they want . When Colbert asked her how she spent her birthday , she started off with a believable answer about taking as much time off during the day as possible in the middle of a presidential campaign , which is to say , not much . ( I slept late , that was pretty celebratory , she said , and there are few things more relatable than having the lone sad commemoration of your birthday be one indulgent touch of the snooze button . ) But then she kept going , claiming that she and Bill love to sit around and binge watch bad television , which strains credulity to its breaking point . The idea of Bill and Hillary lounging in their pajamas mainlining episodes of The Good Wife for hours on end is impossible to reconcile with everything we know about both people , and Hillary trying to pretend it s so feels , as it often does with her , like pandering . ?
