Gansa : That is a very difficult question to answer and it ' s a question that we are asked all the time . I don ' t think you can narrow it down to one thing except to say that the show is greater than the sum of its parts . It ' s one of those amazing instances where everything seems to come together the writing and acting and the directing all complement each other and make each other better . But if I did have to narrow it down to one detail or one element , I would say that it is the chemistry between Claire Danes and Damian Lewis on camera . There is something compelling about watching these two damaged people fall in love with each other .
