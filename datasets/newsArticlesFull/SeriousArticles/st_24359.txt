Ironically , the people who run Chrysler or rather used to run it understand this principle well . You see , the company was recently sold to the Italian carmaker Fiat . When the company went up for sale , the original owners could have insisted that the buyer be American . You know , American pride and all that . But it didn ' t . Instead , company officials entertained offers from abroad in fact , you could say that the owners " imported " prospective buyers . And when a deal was finally struck , the sale went to a foreign company . How about that ?
