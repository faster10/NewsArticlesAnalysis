I was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents , either governmental or private , following peace activists , because that was happening . It ' s not legal , it ' s not supposed to happen , but you hear stories about police officers , mysterious agents , agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists , trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested . You ' d like to think these things don ' t happen , but you keep hearing about things like that happening . I thought that would be an intriguing story .
