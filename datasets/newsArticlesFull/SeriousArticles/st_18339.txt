We can start with the lack of diversity in Marvel Comics itself . For all the good that seeing traditionally marginalized people fighting crime does though , there are still two pressing matters at hand , writes Charles Pulliam Moore of Fusion . First , for the most part , these characters are still being written by white men . Second , there s the perception that Marvel s larger editorial voice and vision are still being guided primarily by white men . Although these kinds of exclusionary hiring practices are hardly limited to Marvel , they do tie directly into one of the most problematic aspects of the Trump campaign s mass appeal . There s something unique about Trump s whiteness and his masculinity , explains Mona Chalabi of The Guardian . He is distinctly unashamed of either trait , and is unwilling to even pay lip service to the notion that they were beneficial to his success . Similarly , despite appealing to a very diverse audience , Marvel Comics continues to disproportionately employ white male writers ? even as they would no doubt insist that race and gender have nothing to do with it . ? In fact , considering the positive press that Marvel has received for tapping Ta Nehisi Coates to write a Black Panther comic and creating the acclaimed Ms . Marvel series , this lack of diversity is even more of a slap in the face .
