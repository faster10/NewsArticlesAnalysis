It wasn ' t until I was an adult that I learned about the politics of black beauty . We live in a society in which normative standards tend to reflect those ideals established by the dominant group . And in a racialized society such as our own , one in which the white ideal is constantly pedestaled as the ideal against which all other bodies are measured , black bodies are often regarded substandard " unacceptable " as is . For black women , our ability to be perceived as beautiful in this society depends upon our ability to emulate a white ideal for feminine beauty . The closer our features are to white ones straight hair , light skin and aquiline features the more likely it is that we will be regarded as beautiful . So when compared to a white ideal , natural hair is not beautiful , especially not dreadlocks .
