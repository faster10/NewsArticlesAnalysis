He said : ' The Rules of Engagement in Northern Ireland were very clear : you were only allowed to open fire at a person actively shooting at you or someone you are with . Also , you could open fire at someone aiming a weapon but who hadn ' t fired yet . We had our own slight variation on these rules . We opened fire at any small group in hard areas , neighbourhoods that even looked suspicious , armed or not it didn ' t matter . We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good . These types were sympathisers and supporters , assisting the IRA movement .
