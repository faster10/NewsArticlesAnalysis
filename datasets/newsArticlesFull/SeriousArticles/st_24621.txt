As Trump s main rival and closest competitor , Cruz didn t have the night that he could ve ? and should ve ? in Trump s absence . He began with great lines like Iowa will not by flyover country , it will be fly to country and that there s a difference between personal attacks and focusing on issues and substance , drawing a clear line in the sand with Trump s style . But besides a great answer to his position on ethanol subsidies , Cruz didn t dominate the way he needed to . He may go up in the polls a little bit , but not the knockout he was looking for .
