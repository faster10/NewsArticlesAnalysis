I ' ve tried death penalty cases , and I ' ve been lucky : None of my clients has ever been sent to death row . But I know many good lawyers who haven ' t been so lucky . You may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases , which last for years , defense lawyers get to know victims ' families . The families of homicide victims , after an execution , often don ' t feel the long sought after sense of relief they expected . Often , they are left , instead , with unresolved emptiness . Two lives are lost when a murder is committed , and two families are irrevocably altered . We should feel the pain as well , and spend more time , effort and money on those who are affected . We should not spend ever dwindling resources figuring out ways to kill .
