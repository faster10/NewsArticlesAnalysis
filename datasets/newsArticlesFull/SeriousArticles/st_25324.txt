" It ' s going to be difficult to look up and see something going on over there that really shouldn ' t , " resident Manuel Arellano told KOAT . " This is too much . I bring my family here to visit their grandpa and my wife to visit her dad . . . What ' s going to happen come Christmas , come Thanksgiving on those hard days for me and my family ? It ' s hard to come when we miss my father in law so much . It ' s going to be hard to see people over there decorating something for somebody that wasn ' t real . "
