When Rock was first announced as this year s host ? eleven years after his last turn in the driver s seat ? it was welcome news . Show producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin called Rock the MVP of the entertainment industry , and Hudlin , who worked with Rock on the beloved Everybody Hates Chris , noted , Chris attracts incredible talent , the number of people who want to write for him , who want to perform with him . There s already been an incredible response of A level talent in every category who want to work with Chris . At least they did , until last week , when the nominees were announced ? and fans and industry insiders alike couldn t help wondering if it was worth it to give the Oscars ? any more attention . Among the lowlights : the acclaimed Straight Outta Compton was all but ignored ? though its white screenwriters got a nod . Sylvester Stallone was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Creed ? but its star Michael B . Jordan was not , nor was the film itself given a Best Picture nod . There is not a single person of color among any of the year s acting nominees . And lest you think Hollywood s problem is strictly racial , note the twofer Best Picture blind spot over the widely hailed Carol , a movie that happens to be a ) about a woman and b ) about a gay one . Remember November , when Creed and Carol were considered the frontrunners ? Good times .
