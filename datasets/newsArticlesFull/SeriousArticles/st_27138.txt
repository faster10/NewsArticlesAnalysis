After the surgery and the radiation and the 2 years of chemo , I was pronounced " in remission . " During this time , as I split my time between homes in London , England , and New York City , I did several 10K races , indoor rowing competitions , and the UK Three Peaks Challenge . These events transformed my life physically , emotionally and spiritually . Brain cancer was a wake up call for our whole family . The shock wasn ' t that I was going to die , but that I had forgotten that I was going to die . We all are . Life isn ' t a dress rehearsal .
