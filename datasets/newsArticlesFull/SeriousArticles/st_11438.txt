The Broncos can get pressure on Brady , of course a team that has Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware is always going to be capable of getting at least some form of pressure . The problem is that the rush has established a nasty habit of going missing during Denver ' s crushing playoff losses . That was true in the 2013 season , when the Broncos failed to sack Russell Wilson once during their blowout loss in the Super Bowl . And it was true again the following year , when the Broncos failed to take down the eminently sackable Andrew Luck during their home loss to the Colts .
