A quick look at the ratings for these programs makes it clear why the networks are red hot for rednecks . The third season of " Duck Dynasty " premiered on February 27 and the episode set the record for the highest rated show in the history of A E . Amazingly , the premiere actually beat " American Idol " and " Modern Family " that night in the coveted 18 to 49 year old demographic . Add to that , just last week , " Duck Dynasty " held four of the top 20 spots on all of cable , while " Swamp People " came in as the 14th highest rated cable show .
