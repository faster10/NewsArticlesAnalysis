If you were trying to explain to a recently arrived extraterrestrial how the British see Europe , you could do worse than play some of those Eurovision programmes ? the resentment , the hilarity , the increasing Euroscepticism are all there . His irritation with Baltic and Balkan voting blocs and with the inevitable nuls points for the UK entry perhaps meant that ? unfortunately ? he started taking the proceedings seriously ( a professional hazard ) . But he effectively invented an entire genre of TV satirically examining itself which thrives to this day .
