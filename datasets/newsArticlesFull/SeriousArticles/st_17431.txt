Joshua Miller of Peoria , Illinois I would like to remember Patrick " Joe " Driscoll today . He lost his life aboard United Airlines Flight 93 on the morning of September 11 , 2001 . He was traveling with his friend , Billy Cashman , from New Jersey to California for a hiking trip . Joe was a man in his 70s who had had heart bypass surgery and hip replacement surgery . These physical setbacks didn ' t stop a feisty guy from New York City . He went on to live an active life . He was a fighter who had a gentle side . He adored his grandchildren , his children , and his wife . Joe is greatly missed . So many of us are so very proud of him . To ease my grief over the losses we all share from that terrible day , I often think of the passage from the gospel of John : " Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . " Thank you , Joe . You did just that .
