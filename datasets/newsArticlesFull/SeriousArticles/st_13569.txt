Navalny is still convicted and he may be allowed to run for mayor only to attempt to discredit him before jailing him . If he gains too much support he can be locked up at any time , or worse , as he well knows , although this would create just the sort of scandal Sobyanin would like to avoid in his quest to appear to be a legitimately elected official . But the election might not be as easy as they think . In last year ' s presidential election Putin received 47 of the vote in Moscow and those are the official numbers , not real ones despite epic fraud and despite facing no real opposition . Can Sobyanin then be expected to surpass the 50 needed to avoid a second ballot without resorting to the same tactics that spawned outrage in 2011 ?
