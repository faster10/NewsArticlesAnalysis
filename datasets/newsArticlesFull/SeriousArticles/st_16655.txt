We see a quarterback who is emerging , who has been through a lot . He did everything a quarterback needed to do in the off season , both physically and mentally , and we have created an environment for him to be as successful as a quarterback can be . I hear what people have said about him . But I see what is on the other side . There are things about him that people do not see . They say he doesn t have passion . They say he doesn t have the work ethic . All totally untrue . He has the burning desire to be the best . I see it every day . I ve really seen it this week .
