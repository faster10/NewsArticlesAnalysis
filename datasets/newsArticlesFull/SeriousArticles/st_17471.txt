Here is the first thing to understand . The people facing the worst impacts of climate change have virtually no voice in western debates about whether to do anything serious to prevent catastrophic global warming . Huge climate summits like the one coming up in Paris are rare exceptions . For just two weeks every few years , the voices of the people who are getting hit first and worst get a little bit of space to be heard at the place where fateful decisions are made . That s why Pacific islanders and Inuit hunters and low income people of colour from places like New Orleans travel for thousands of miles to attend . The expense is enormous , in both dollars and carbon , but being at the summit is a precious chance to speak about climate change in moral terms and to put a human face to this unfolding catastrophe .
