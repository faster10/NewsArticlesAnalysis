The tally of goals equalled the number of red cards in yet another tasty meeting between the two old foes . Franco scored for Argentina in the first minute , cancelled out by Branco , who presumably was not accepting dodgy drinks from anyone . Franco and Gabriel Batistuta put Argentina into a 3 1 lead . Joao Paulo pegged one back . Now for the sendings off : Claudio Caniggia and Mazinho went for a fight in the first half , Enrique and Marcio Santos ditto in the second . Careca followed , having been on the pitch just a few minutes .
