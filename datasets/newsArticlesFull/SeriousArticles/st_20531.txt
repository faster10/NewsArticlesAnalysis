The question is rather : How couldn t this happen ? Why should the GOP establishment retain influence given their record both when in power and out ? They have called the shots for decades and who have they produced as GOP standard bearers ? George No New Taxes Bush 41 ? a one termer who rode the coattails of Reagan into office . The dour Bob Dole . The ancient and acerbic John McCain . The taciturn and aloof Mitt Romney . These men are the epitome of the establishment class . They are also quite adept at delivering classy concession speeches .
