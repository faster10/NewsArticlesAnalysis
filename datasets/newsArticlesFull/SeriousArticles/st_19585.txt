I was on the first floor of the venue . And I was with a friend and we were in the middle of a concert listening to the music , having a good time , and then all of a sudden we heard gun shots . They were quite high pitched at first I thought it was a joke on behalf of the band . I thought they were maybe playing a joke on us . And I didn t actually believe it . And the shots kept going and going and going , and people started screaming and people started ducking , you know , hiding behind the seats and the chairs . And that s when we realized we had to get out .
