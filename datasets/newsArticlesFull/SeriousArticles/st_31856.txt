ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : He s gone from thousands of cheering Muslims in New Jersey to hundreds of people now tell him he s right . He had his chief rival say he saw the same thing on TV , only to say a few hours later that he actually didn t . Donald Trump s latest addition to his campaign highlight reel has the hallmarks of his political style . This was a tall tale with a purpose , calibrated to a moment of jitters and anti Muslim fears and sentiments . Trump , naturally , isn t apologizing or acknowledging that what he said he saw did not in fact occur as he describes it . It now appears unlikely that any one comment or set of comments will unravel Trump . Even in this instance , his supporters grant him a general sense of being honest if not entirely truthful regardless of the specific details , the American people , a lot of Trump supporters know , Rush Limbaugh said Monday . As the anti Trump forces gather , that s a more formidable opponent than the mogul himself . Voters view him as speaking truth to power ? and that means skepticism of anyone or anything seeking to stand in his way , even when he s telling stories that are simply not accurate .
