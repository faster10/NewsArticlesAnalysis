The new restrictions make little sense for most other venues . Fast food restaurants have customer accessible fountains in most cases for in store dining . Few people buy the large size , and many of these restaurants no longer bother with size at all for those sales , sticking with one standard size . Will Bloomberg start regulating how many refills each customer gets , too ? For that matter , many traditional restaurants offer free refills on soft drinks , too . If Bloomberg caps those , what happens when customers just buy another soft drink order ? Will the restaurant be forced to stop serving root beer far more quickly than they stop serving beer ?
