Just like Lucas Duda did . The Mets first baseman received Wright s throw for the second out , and whipped the ball to home plate , to try to complete a most unusual game ending double play , the kind of finish that would have quaked Citi Field and possibly propelled the Mets to a comeback title . Poor Duda , says Kuntz . He just had to get rid of it as fast as he could . Duda s throw went wide left , to the backstop . The Royals scouting report was clear : run on Duda , run on Wright . Hosmer slid in with that tying run .
