Last November , 112 workers lost their lives when the Tazreen Fashions factory , which produced garments sold by Wal mart , Sears and other retailers , caught fire .

The death toll at Bangladeshi factories stands at nearly 1 , 000 since 2006 , based on estimates by the Bangladeshi government and an advocacy organization .
