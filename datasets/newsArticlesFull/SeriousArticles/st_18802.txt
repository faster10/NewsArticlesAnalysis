" I loved those guys , and I still do , " Klecko said of the Patriots . " I miss that place . I didn ' t want to leave there , and I don ' t think they wanted me to leave , but it was never a great fit . I was a 5 10 , 270 pound nose tackle , and that was never going to work there , even though we tried so many times . But when you catch that ball it ' s like , ' I wanted to do this for you , but you let me go , ' and you could see when I spiked the ball it was kind of like a ' screw you ' to them , too . "
