Rob Mahoney : ? Russell Westbrook at equilibrium . The fact that the Thunder are overshadowed by the Warriors and Spurs is a story in itself , which all but eliminates them from this question on the team level . That said , I haven t encountered much response at all to the tremendous season Westbrook has put together . Playing with Kevin Durant will never allow for the same kind of full tilt statistical brilliance that set Westbrook s game ablaze last spring . Instead , he s coming into his own as a more complex , sophisticated player ? a dynamo not only able to exert influence on the game but take it fully under his control . The balance he s struck has resulted in improved efficiency and Westbrook s best playing season to date , all while remaining one of the league s most dangerous scorers .
