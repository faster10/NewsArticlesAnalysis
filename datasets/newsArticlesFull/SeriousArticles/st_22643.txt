This was also unexpected ! In the bottom of the fourth inning , one of the Fox trucks lost power , causing everyone watching to lose their feed for roughly eight minutes . The game was also briefly delayed due to the issue , as neither team had access to replay as a result . The broadcast eventually resumed with just video , while an alternate team broadcasted the game . There was also a very brief outage just before Curtis Granderson ' s home run in the fifth inning , but that lasted just a couple of seconds . Eventually , things fell into place and the rest of the broadcast proceeded as normal . ?
