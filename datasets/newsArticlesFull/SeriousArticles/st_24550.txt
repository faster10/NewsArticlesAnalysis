2 . Bruce Arians : ? The NFL head coaching community can be a bit , uh , stuffy . So Arians s rather in your face personality alone makes him a bit of a different breed . So does his preference for staying aggressive for 60 minutes , regardless of time and score ? the approach nearly bit him last week when an incompletion saved Green Bay time for its Hail Mary . The Cardinals have not become arguably the league s most balanced team across the board by accident . GM Steve Keim deserves a boatload of credit , too , but Arians s imprint is all over this team .
