Curry is correct each voter is going to have different criteria for end of season awards , and that ' s perhaps more true for this one than any of the others . Some people don ' t like to reward expected improvement , so if you ' re in your second or third year , you ' re out of luck . Some people look at players who have simply been given more minutes and produced like they always have some people value per minute improvement . I ' d guess that most voters wouldn ' t even consider Curry , who is a radical choice because he was already arguably the best player in the league .
