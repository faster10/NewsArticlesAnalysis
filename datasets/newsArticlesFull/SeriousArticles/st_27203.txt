After the arrival of 1 . 1 million refugees in Germany last year , with thousands more showing up every day , Merkel s leadership is being tested as never before . Convinced that closing borders would bring down Europe s system of passport free travel , which Merkel has called the centerpiece of the region s single market , she has sought to cajole neighbors into taking in more refugees and to persuade Turkey to keep migrants from crossing into the European Union .

Police said more than 1 , 000 men , mostly from North Africa and the Middle East , many of them asylum seekers , were at ? the ? scene .
