While it would be easy to convince yourself to think pass first when you see Manning coming , what the Patriots must deal with first is Kubiak s zone run offense , which relies on the defense always facing bad decisions . Jump outside to stop the wide run off the double team and the runner cuts back into a crease on the inside . Stay stout protecting the inside and he bounces outside against a defense whose backside pursuit has been leveled and whose safeties have wide receivers in their grill . That is almost exactly how Anderson ran around left end for a 48 yard touchdown in overtime to beat the Pats , capping their outscoring the Patriots 23 10 in the fourth quarter and OT .
