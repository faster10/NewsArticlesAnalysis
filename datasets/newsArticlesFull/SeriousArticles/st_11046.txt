Second round pick Eric Rowe has been a disappointment in limited time , and he ' ll move into the starting lineup now that incumbent Nolan Carroll is done for the year with a broken ankle . Middle linebacker Kiko Alonso , an Oregon product who excelled as a rangy cover linebacker in Buffalo , hasn ' t been able to stay healthy and hasn ' t looked like his usual self when he has been on the field . Outside of stars such as Fletcher Cox and Connor Barwin , the only new additions to impress have been converted cornerback Walter Thurmond and third round linebacker Jordan Hicks , the latter of whom is already on injured reserve .
