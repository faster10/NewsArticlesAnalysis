The Mets might have to go for emulating the Royals and filling their lineup with tough outs . The Mets tried to get Ben Zobrist in a trade before he landed with Kansas City . He would be a better version of Murphy ( upgrades on defense , on base skills ) , but he is going to be in demand in free agency . If the Tigers are rebuilding somewhat , would they ? want to move second baseman Ian Kinsler ( two years left on contract at 30 million ) , who would bring sure defense and contact skills the Mets cannot yet be sure they have in Dilson Herrera ?
