The scary part is , Carolina is almost as good on defense as offense . Luke Kuechly is possibly the best linebacker in football , a versatile player who is both smart and instinctive . Thomas Davis is nearly his equal , although an arm injury suffered in the NFC Championship makes his role heading into the Super Bowl uncertain . And cornerback Josh Norman was a first team All Pro this season , with his athleticism and aggressive technique driving opposing receivers literally ? out of their minds . Add in Carolina s formidable pass rush , which has eight sacks in the post season , and the Panthers might have the NFL s second best defense behind Denver .
