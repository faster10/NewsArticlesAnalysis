There was already simmering anger and distrust in Derry when the soldiers opened fire , and Bloody Sunday only served to increase the anti British sentiment in the city . The soldiers said shots were fired before they shot at the crowd . An inquiry shortly after the shootings largely cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing and alleged some of the dead and wounded were gunmen or bombers . However , former Prime Minister Tony Blair said in 1998 there is no proof that the victims were handling any weapons or bombs . The shootings led to international condemnation and , according to analysts , hardened anti British sentiments in Northern Ireland and led to many fresh recruits to the Irish Republican Army . The semi autonomous Northern Irish government was suspended weeks later , which was followed by decades of rule from London .
