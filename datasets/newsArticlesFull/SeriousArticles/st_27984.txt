The coaching staff will likely take the bullet for this loss , but that would not be a fair assessment of the game . It is hard to imagine what play calls might work on offense , since the offensive line and running backs can never establish a rushing attack . Yes , the decision to go for the first down on fourth and two early in the fourth quarter was a poor choice by Coughlin , if only because he should not have trusted his defense with a lead of any size . Very simply , at that point in the game , Coughlin needed to dictate that the Jets score two touchdowns to win , instead of scoring a touchdown and field goal to tie .
