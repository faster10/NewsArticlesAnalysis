How we came to this point is an interesting story . The 550 mile long border with Syria , Turkey ' s longest , has often been tense . During the Cold War , Syria was a Soviet ally , Turkey was a NATO member ( as it still is ) and the border was heavily mined . Moreover , Hafez Assad , the father and predecessor of Syria ' s current dictator , Bashar al Assad , supported and hosted the PKK , the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party , which has led a guerrilla war against Turkey since the early ' 80s . ( PKK is defined by Turkey and the United States as a terrorist group . ) Turkey had come close to waging a war against Syria in 1999 because of this PKK connection .
