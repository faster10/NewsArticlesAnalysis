If I wasn t happy with my life and I was really struggling , maybe it would be different . I don t know . I have always been his biggest fan and I have always wanted the best for him and that will never change . Jealousy ? I can honestly say never . Even when he was starting to do great things at 17 or 18 and I was not really having any career yet , never once was I thinking : I wish that was me or He s so lucky or Why is that not happening to me ? Never once felt like that . It s your brother . He s your blood .
