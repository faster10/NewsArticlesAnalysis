The Giants got Justin Pugh and Weston Richburg back on the offensive line , but lost left tackle Ereck Flowers to an ankle injury , as the offense sputtered for most of the afternoon . Of course Odell Beckham had a big day , as he had six catches for 149 yards and a touchdown . OBJ had another touchdown within his grasp , but it was stripped by Calvin Pryor right before the half . Tight end Will Tye had three catches , including a beautiful 45 yard catch down the seam , as he and Beckham provided the only offense on the afternoon .
