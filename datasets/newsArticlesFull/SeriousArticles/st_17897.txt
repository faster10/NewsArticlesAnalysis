I agree that there are serious theological differences between evangelical Christianity and Mormonism . But those should be settled in churches , in homes , and in religious gatherings , not in front of a national political event . Pastor Jeffress says his words were merely theological . He , pastor of a successful mega church , should know full well the fine line between religion and politics . His words were clearly political , as evidenced by the damaging effect it had on the Republican presidential candidates and the national debate .
