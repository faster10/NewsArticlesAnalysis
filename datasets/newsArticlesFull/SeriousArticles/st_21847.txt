It was just recently that I started saying , " You know what ? I AM deserving . " I wouldn ' t say two years ago , but I ' d say maybe five or six years ago I was like , " Wow , I deserve this " because sometimes when I get so many accolades , I want to bury my head . But then I hear someone say , " No , pick your head up . You earned this . You walked the walk . You are walking the walk . You are not finished yet , but you are still standing in the fire , walking through the fire . You ' re still 40 , but you are still standing up for women proudly , and doing what you need to do , so keep your head up . "
