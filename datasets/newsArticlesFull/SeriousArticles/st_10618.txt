One thing is certain : " Paranormal Activity 4 " is going to have a front loaded run . The picture fell by a whopping 38 percent from Friday ( 15 . 1 million ) to Saturday ( 9 . 4 million ) never a sign of box office longevity . Furthermore , horror movies and especially horror sequels are typically some of the most front loaded films of any genre due to young audiences ( 60 percent of PA4 ' s audience was below the age of 25 ) , who rush to the theater on opening weekend . " PA2 " and " PA3 " each finished with about twice as much as they earned on opening weekend , grossing 84 . 8 and 104 million respectively , but " PA4 " will be lucky to score 60 million total .
