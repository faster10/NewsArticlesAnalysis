VIEW FROM IAN LADYMAN AT TURF MOOR United have grown in to the game and Di Maria ' s role is already proving interesting . Nominally , he is playing centrally just in front of Darren Fletcher but has done most of his good work drifting out to the left side to try and hurt Burnley from there . The understanding with his team mates is not necessarily quite there yet but he has shown enough already to illustrate how dangerous he can be . From their point of view , Burnley need to keep pushing at the soft centre of United ' s defence . There do still seem to be mistakes there .
