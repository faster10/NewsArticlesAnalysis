The Giants on Sunday lost , yet again , this time to the Jets , 23 20 , in overtime , after taking a 20 10 lead into the fourth quarter . It is the same old sad song , going out of tune when it comes time to close out the concert in style . Three previous games ended with the Giants giving up the winning points in the final 10 seconds . And now this , with Tom Coughlin eschewing a field goal midway through the fourth quarter that would have put the Giants up 23 10 , a decision that came back to haunt him as the Jets scored 10 points in the final 4 : 24 of regulation . The chance to pull even in OT came and went when their perfect kicker , Josh Brown , was wide left on a 48 yard field goal attempt ? his first miss in nearly a calendar year .
