I have read and heard some of the powerful and emotional pleas of families , attorneys and their supporters who felt the 911 calls should have been withheld . Yet I fully believe that access to public records is crucial , even if painful . We can never learn the truth about our society and its ills and inspirations without full access to public documents . No matter how well meaning public officials may be in withholding records , it should not be left to them to determine what our reality is .
