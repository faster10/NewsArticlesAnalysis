Gale , Walt ' s assistant in the super lab set up by Gus , is unaware that he ' s being groomed to take over so that Gus can kill Walt ( Gus tells Gale that Walt is dying of cancer , which by this point is no longer true ) . Just as Walt is about to be killed by Gus ' henchmen , he ' s able to get a message to Jesse , who does the only thing he can to save his partner . More than one , Jesse has been a victim of Walt ' s bad decisions ( including two very painful beatings ) and killing Gale nearly sends Jesse to the brink . Because Gus has no one to run the lab , Walt gets a temporary reprieve , but he knows there ' s only one thing he can do to stay safe . . .
