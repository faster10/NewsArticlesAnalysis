I met the criteria for death with dignity in Oregon , but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes . I had to find new physicians , establish residency in Portland , search for a new home , obtain a new driver ' s license , change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals , and my husband , Dan , had to take a leave of absence from his job . The vast majority of families do not have the flexibility , resources and time to make all these changes .
