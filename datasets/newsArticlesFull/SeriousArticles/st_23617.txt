In March ? ? 2015 , former manager Doug Goldstein gave an interview to Rolling Stone Brazil in which he came up with a unique theory for the over two decade long Axl Slash feud : Micheal Jackson . ? ? In 1991 , Slash reportedly told Goldstein that he was going to perform with Jackson at a tribute show . Apparently , the manager anticipated that this would not go down well with Axl , himself a victim of child molestation , who believed the charges against the King of Pop . " From Axl ' s point of view , this was the only problem . He could ignore the drugs and alcohol ( with which the guitarist had serious problems ) , but could never ignore child abuse , " Goldstein is quoted as saying in the interview .
