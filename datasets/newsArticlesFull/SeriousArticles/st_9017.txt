That , in a nutshell , has been the problem with the Clippers all along . ? It was an issue during Vinny Del Negro ' s final season with the team , when Griffin s and DeAndre Jordan s growth seemed stunted . ? And with Paul Pierce and Josh Smith and Lance Stephenson ( who didn t play one second against Golden State after running for only three minutes against the Pistons in the Clippers previous game ) and the rest of the new additions in town , the Clippers still lack some sort of championship level cohesion . ?
