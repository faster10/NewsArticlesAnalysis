The Patriots set the tone right from the start . The Chiefs won the coin flip , elected to kick off , then sat back and watched Brady carve them up like tenderloin on butcher paper . Reunited with his offensive line and Julian Edelman , Gronkowski , and Danny Amendola , Brady marched the Pats 80 yards in 11 plays , capping the touchdown drive with an 8 yard strike to Gronk in front of the End Zone Militia in the lighthouse left corner end zone . The Pats did not have a rushing attempt on the surgical drive .
