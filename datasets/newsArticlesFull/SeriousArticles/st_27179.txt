He has lost his place this season to Hector Bellerin and , while Wenger would ideally have liked to retain his presence in the squad for cover at right back and centre back , he recognised that Debuchy s only real chance of playing at Euro 2016 was to move . Debuchy has lost not just his starting position but even his squad place in the France squad since becoming understudy at Arsenal to Bellerin and now needs regular football . Wenger had wanted him to stay in the Premier League but Bordeaux was Debuchy s preferred solution . Arsenal do have Calum Chambers who can cover at right back in his absence .
