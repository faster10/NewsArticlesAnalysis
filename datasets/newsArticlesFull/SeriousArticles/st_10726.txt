At midnight on February 13 , 2013 , Bailey rang in Valentine ' s Day by rolling down the aisle hidden inside a 10 foot , Reem Acra designed sculpture as Bleckmann sang " You Make Me Feel So Young " and then " Now We Are Free " from the movie " Gladiator " played . The structure featured a body double of Bailey at the top wearing a voluminous wedding gown . " When my guests first saw my body double rolling down the aisle wearing a 10 foot dress , they thought it was me , completely losing my mind , " Bailey said .
