As others have pointed out , in the wake of the Paris attacks we ' ve conflated support for free speech with support for the actual speech in question . But while I unquestionably support the free speech rights of the KKK and " god hates fags " protesters , for example , that clearly doesn ' t mean I would support , never mind join in , their hateful messages . Some on the right insist that media should have to re print Charlie Hebdo ' s anti Islam cartoons or else they ' re cowardly . However , this is a fundamental perversion of free speech , to say the least . There is no inconsistency between supporting free speech for Charlie Hebdo ' s cartoonists and finding the content of some of their cartoons offensive and disrespectful .
