Local media reported that later in life she posted images on her Facebook page of herself in a niqab , holding weapons and praising other jihadists . I am going to Syria soon , God willing , soon leaving for Turkey , she reportedly wrote on her page . However she never left , and at some point returned to live with her birth mother in Aulnay sous Bois until a few weeks ago . Reports say she might have fallen under the influence of Abaaoud , who prosecutors believe was preparing the team in the apartment to launch fresh attacks . Both families have roots in Morocco .
