Three state elections on March 13 could provide an indication of the peril Merkel faces . While her CDU stands a good chance of winning all three ? and ousting rivals in two of them ? a large turnout for the anti immigrant Alternative for Germany party could make the wins look like losses . Merkel has shown no sign of backing down . In the Black Forest city of Freiburg on Jan . 13 , she noted that countries closer to Syria have found a way to accommodate many more refugees than the Germans have . If a continent like Europe , with 500 million people , is not capable of taking in 1 ? million Syrians , perhaps temporarily , she told a crowd of students and local grandees , that is not in line with our values .
