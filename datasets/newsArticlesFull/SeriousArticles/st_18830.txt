TRUMP TRUMPS Too late to get Steve King or Louie Gohmert ' s endorsements , unfortunately . Elise Foley : " The ' anchor baby ' slur is back in the GOP presidential race , and this time , it ' s being thrown at one of the candidates . Republican front runner Donald Trump said Friday that Sen . Ted Cruz of Texas is an " anchor baby . " It was all part of the real estate mogul ' s repeated riffing on the fact that Cruz was born in Canada . ' Now , Ted Cruz may not be a U . S . citizen . Right ? But he ' s an anchor baby in Canada . No , he ' s an anchor baby . Ted Cruz is an anchor baby in Canada , ' Trump said at an event in New Hampshire , according to ABC News . His insult doesn ' t make much sense , other than as an excuse to throw out the words " anchor baby . " Cruz is definitely a U . S . citizen . He was born in Canada to a U . S . citizen mother , making him an American by birth . He also had dual citizenship with Canada , because the country automatically confers citizenship on people born there . " HuffPost
