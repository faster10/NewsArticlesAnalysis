Christie s potential return to grace can be compared to McCain in 2008 , when the Arizona senator won New Hampshire after months of poor polls , O Connell opined . In that cycle , McCain was widely viewed as the front runner going in , but he dropped dramatically in the polls in 2007 because of his support for adding troops to the Iraq War . He eventually won the nomination . There are some similarities in the sense that the path Christie is taking , he started out as one of the top two then he got slimed with Bridgegate and now he s on his resurgence .
