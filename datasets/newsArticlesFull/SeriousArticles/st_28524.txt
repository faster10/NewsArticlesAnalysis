This is a good country , full of good and great people , dedicated to an extraordinary American promise , our commitment to equal opportunity for everyone . That evening , even the most hardened partisan hearts could feel it . Our country had taken a step forward in racial relations , a big step , something that spoke of what our nation might yet become . A good nation had become an even better one , where the scars of some old wounds had healed and the pain of intense divisions , though not forgotten , had receded farther into memory .
