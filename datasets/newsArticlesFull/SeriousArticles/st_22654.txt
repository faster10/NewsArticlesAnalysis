" The questions about Mannatech ? are definitely gotcha questions , " Carson said . " There s no truth to them . I know people know how to investigate . They can easily go back and find out I don t have any formal relations with Mannatech . They can easily find out that any videos I did with them were not paid for , were things I truly believed . That would be easy to do . If they had another agenda , they could investigate and say ? ? see , there s nothing there ! But if they have a gotcha agenda , they conveniently ignore all the facts and try to influence public opinion . "
