" I was on a second or third date with a guy who was quite a bit older than me . I asked him his age but he wouldn ' t tell me . Later I looked him up on a public records site and found it . The next date I told him I had found his age online in what I thought was a playful manner . The relationship didn ' t last because as it turned out he had a girlfriend in another country for years with whom he has been discussing a serious future , and months later during an argument he told me that my Googling him had really turned him off and included it in a " want to know how to win a guy ? " e mail .
