A . Well , when you look at climate change , it is an incredibly important problem for all countries , including India . How would we solve the problem as long as the energy that is green ( or zero CO2 energy ) costs a lot more than say coal based energy . So , if you say to a developing country like India that because of green reasons it should slow down development , that is really a very difficult thing because we know development in terms of saving lives , providing education to kids , taking care of health and so many benefits of energy usage . Only way you can achieve both goals ( fighting climate change and growing economically ) is to have innovation that brings down the premium for clean energy ideally to zero or even invent the source of energy which is cheaper then coal based energy .
