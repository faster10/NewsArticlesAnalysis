Whether or not Sanders ' promise is realistic ? even if he gets his pick of regulators , it ' s anybody ' s guess how the courts will interpret Section 121 authority after the inevitable lawsuits ? it ' s politically interesting . Glass Steagall , which Sanders would still like to resurrect , has long been a litmus test among progressives . But Sanders is now trying to mainstream the idea that a president could break up the banks while leapfrogging Congress , as long as he has the right appointees in place . I ' m guessing that will intensify confirmation battles under any Democratic presidency , even for formerly obscure posts . Suddenly , Bernie fans and those who fear them have a reason to care about the job of chief credit union regulator . Go figure .
