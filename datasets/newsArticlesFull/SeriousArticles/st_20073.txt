Kartheiser : Well , no , not really . The reason is , I stopped wishing for things with my character because I ' m very aware that ( creator ) Matt Weiner has a plan for how this story should go . I trust him like I ' ve never trusted any writer or creator that I ' ve worked with . He knows what the audience wants and he rarely gives it to them . But in a rare case , the audience wanted this , very badly , for many a year . It ' s one of the few times that Matt ' s plans happened to coincide with what the general population of " Mad Men " wanted . So I ' m kinda glad to give the people a little something that they ' ve been longing for . To be honest , I take a hit much better than I give one .
