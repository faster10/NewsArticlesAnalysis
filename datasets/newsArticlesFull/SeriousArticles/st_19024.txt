The two guys I d maybe compare him the most to are Mark Price and Steve Nash in terms of the combination of ball handling and passing and shooting range and creativity . But Steph has taken it to a new level , the Warriors coach says . Mark and Steve were pioneers in a lot of ways . Mark was the first guy that I ve ever seen who split the double team at the top of the circle and then shoot a runner in the lane . Nobody else used to do that . Now everybody does it . Steve also sort of revolutionized the NBA , along with Mike D Antoni in Phoenix . They changed the way the league looks and operates .
