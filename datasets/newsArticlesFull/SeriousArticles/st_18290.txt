Axelrod , in a recent interview about the time he was asked to become an official aide to President Obama , said : " I ' ve spent my whole life setting myself up so I could tell anybody I wanted to go fuck themselves . And I ' ve walked out of campaigns and work situations when I thought that it wasn ' t right . And I said to Obama ' you can ' t say that to the president of the United States . ' " Obama responded , according to Axelrod : " You can tell me to fuck myself , just don ' t do it in front of anybody else . "
