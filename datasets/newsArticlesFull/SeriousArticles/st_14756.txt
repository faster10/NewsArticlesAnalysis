Fast forward to when I was 14 , getting my feet wet with more experimental rock via mixtapes and compilations , and I heard Heroes , a beautiful , stripped down song about a man seeking love and warmth , if just for one day , by one David Bowie . Surely this wasn t the same Bowie , I asked the Internet , and Yahoo replied with a resounding yes . From there I discovered Bowie influences everywhere ? as the originator of Kurt Cobain s anguished Unplugged performance of The Man Who Sold The World , Freddie Mercury s backup guy in Under Pressure , Mick Jagger s counterpoint in Dancing in the Street , and the man in that one John Lennon song about Fame . You could understand why it was such a coup for Christopher Nolan to have convinced Bowie to play Nikolas Tesla in The Prestige much like his character , the elusive Bowie cast a vast glow across the world of music .
