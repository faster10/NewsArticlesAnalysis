the similarities to AD are real 17 carries out of 20 total 47 yards then you get a 20 and a 70 and a 10 mixed in and you get 20 for 133 . like peterson he seems to break 1 or 2 every game . last couple times the rams played minnesota they would bottle up adrian for the most part but up would jump a 78 yard TD run and the stats alter ! ! i agree comparisons after 4 games are premature , although based on 4 weeks i would say that at least 5 teams of the first 9 in the draft have concluded that they screwed up not taking gurley . brandon sherff vic beasley dante fowler erik flowers kevin white are 5 picks i bet the teams would trade for gurley and all picked in front of gurley ! !
