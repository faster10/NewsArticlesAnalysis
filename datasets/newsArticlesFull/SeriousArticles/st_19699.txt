Melissa Joan Hart weighed in on Instagram about the holiday : " Happy Thanksgiving to all of my American friends around the world ! I pray for a day of world peace , for a little cheer in everyone ' s day and full bellies for everyone . I pray for those who can ' t be with their families today , that you may find someone to spend your time with today . To those that are hungry and cold that you may find comfort today ! I am most thankful for my enormous healthy family full of loving individuals that are all over the world on this day but always close to my Hart . "
