Emerson : One day we were shooting downtown in the financial district . We just finished a scene and the company was breaking up to go to lunch . I don ' t know if I stood and gabbed with somebody on the curb . Next thing , I looked up and couldn ' t find anybody from our company , and I guess I zoned out when they drove me there in the van because I couldn ' t remember which direction I came from . I started walking and I got to another camp and it looked like ours . But it was another show . Laughs I ' m sure they would have fed me . I think it was " Gossip Girl " .
