When Bowie first came up with the Ziggy Stardust material , during a three week trip to the US in February 1971 , his idea had been to have it fronted by Fred Burrett , a young clothes designer he and his wife Angie had met at a gay club called El Sombrero and decided to rechristen Freddie Burretti . Bowie saw himself as the behind the scenes puppetmaster in that setup . Maybe he worried that his teeth disqualified him from frontman duties . Bowie at the time was an ideas man , pitching songs to everyone , including the horror actor Christopher Lee . His publisher was one of the many people in the business who were backing Bowie , but it wasn t clear that his future was as a performer .
