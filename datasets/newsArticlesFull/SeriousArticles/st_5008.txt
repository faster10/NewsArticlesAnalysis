Sanders the dreamer wants health care for everyone , and even released details finally , two hours before the debate about how to pay for it that did not sound crazy . Clinton the pragmatist said simply that there is no possibility that his plan can move forward ( even though she disingenuously referred to it in comparison to Obamacare as " starting over " ) . She ' s right . Sanders ' plan would be dead on arrival . Which doesn ' t make it a bad idea , just one that has no chance of becoming reality anytime soon .
