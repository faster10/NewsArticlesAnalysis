4 ) Stephen Curry game winner keeps Warriors perfect . The Utah Jazz play big , their success is based around a front line of Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert ( two bigs who are quick ) , and they were not going to go small and try to match up with the Warriors . Good for them . The Jazz were going to be the Jazz and go down swinging , and Favors had 23 and Gordon Hayward had 23 . And it was not enough . Draymond Green was Mr Energy . And when the game was on the line late , Curry could create the sliver of space he needs to knock down the game winner to make Golden State 19 0 .
