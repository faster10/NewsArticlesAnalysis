Perhaps the emails , which are trickling out in regular intervals , will fatally damage Hillary some way , somehow . But it seems unlikely . In which case Hillary will simply be a competent Democrat running for president in the mainstream of her party , supported by an incumbent president who is very popular with Democrats and sustaining credible overall favourable ratings in an angry , polarised environment . In other words , Hillary will be running with all the structural advantages that would accrue to any competent mainstream Democrat in 2016 . As each month passes without GOP inroads to Hispanic or Asian voters , the Republican demographic conundrum looms . Jeb Bush is arguably the only viable Republican who can make a credible appeal to Hispanic votes , and he has a rough path ahead .
