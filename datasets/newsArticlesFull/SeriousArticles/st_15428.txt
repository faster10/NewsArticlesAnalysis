In 24 hours , Jimmy Kimmel will stand up in his office at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood , looking less like a talk show host and more , to use his words , like " a hobo . " He ' ll be wearing baggy mesh Dodgers shorts , a rumpled old Coca Cola T shirt and no shoes his hair will stick out in three directions . As he leaves his desk , where he ' s been refining jokes since the morning , his transformation into late night star will begin . After a quick haircut , he ' ll carry his MacBook to the makeup room , where he ' ll put the finishing touches on his monologue while a woman named Stephanie puts the finishing touches on his face : powdering his skin , shaping his eyebrows , blackening his hair where it ' s a bit too gray or a bit too thin for HD .
