I remember being handed a worksheet at a Mommy and Me group that mapped out three goals for toddlers : adaptation , separation , and integration . My sitter and her gang laughed at me . Adaptation ? Baby will do it when she ' s ready . Take potty training . For months my toilet was surrounded by Latina sitters staring at Luna , waiting for poo . Separation ? Never happens . Mamas , grandmas , nanas , your 400 tias and most particularly your girlfriends are in this with you cradle to grave . Integration ? Yes , they are allowed to play with children being raised by their friends . That ' s plenty .
