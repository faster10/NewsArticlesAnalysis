Asked about the incident in the trial , McQueary admitted , " I ' ve said repeatedly I didn ' t do anything physically to stop it . It ' s been well publicized . . . Did I pull the boy out of there , did I physically go and assault anybody , did I remove him ? . . . Physically I didn ' t remove the young boy from the shower or go and punch Jerry out . " McQueary went on to assert that , after 2001 , he was so repulsed by Sandusky he couldn ' t occupy the same room , so much so that other members of the football staff took notice . Why , he was asked , didn ' t he quit ? " I would never resign from Penn State University , " he said .
