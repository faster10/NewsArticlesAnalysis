We also spent a bit of time with the iPod touch . The iPod touch is like the iPhone ' s kid brother , always inheriting old clothes and toys . It has Siri and the 5 megapixel camera from the last version of the iPhone , as well as the A5 processor . The last generation iPod touch got the retina display and front facing camera already available on the iPhone . But this time , the iPod touch got two of the iPhone ' s most stunning new features at the same time : the taller screen and crazy thin and light body ( the iPod touch is actually . 06 inches thinner and weighs 0 . 85 ounces less than the iPhone 5 ) .
