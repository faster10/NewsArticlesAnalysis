As a boy , I read a book about the Pony Express , and had fantasies about joining it . The express started up in the mid 19th century , with relays of postal workers on horseback who would carry letters from Missouri over the Great Plains , through the Rocky Mountains , to California and it only took about 10 days . It was the invention of the telegraph that brought this wondrous service to a halt , not unlike the advent of the Internet , which has made the postal service much less relevant to our lives .
