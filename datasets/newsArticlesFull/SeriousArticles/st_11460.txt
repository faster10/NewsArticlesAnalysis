There was a problem , however . In Virginia ( the only state that was a straightforward Paul vs Romney vote ) , Paul ' s vote was overwhelmingly young but not orthodox Republican in its views . His supporters were more inclined to be pro choice on abortion , nonevangelical , and opposed to the tea party . Given that Paul is pro life , religious , and wildly supportive of the tea party , this confirms the growing tension between the man and his movement . In the future , a Paulite candidate might do better by running third party on a more socially tolerant platform . Young people seem to like their libertarianism to be socially tolerant as well as fiscally prudent .
