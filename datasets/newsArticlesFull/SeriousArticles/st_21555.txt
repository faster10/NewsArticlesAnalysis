Of course , Syria offers a daily reminder that some dictatorships still opt for a bloodbath . In 1982 , Hafez Assad brutally ended an uprising in the Syrian city of Hama . It is estimated that between 10 , 000 and 40 , 000 Syrians were slaughtered in a month . Bashar Assad chose to follow his father ' s example in crushing his own rebellion . The difference is that in 1982 the elder Assad could be confident that he could perpetrate his crimes with impunity . His son ' s regime looks less tenable by the day . No matter what happens , Assad ' s government will never win back its legitimacy .
