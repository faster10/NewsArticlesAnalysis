Google CFO Patrick Pichette to retire
Google's longtime chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, is retiring. The search giant hasn't yet determined Pichette's last day of work, but in afiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google said he intends to assist in finding his successor. That process should be done within six months, the company said. Pichette began working for Google in 2008. Pichette, 52, leaves Google as the company focuses both on its juggernaut advertising business, as well as branching out with audacious initiatives like driverless cars and smart contact lenses. In a blog post, he said he wants to leave the company to spend more time with his family, and especially his wife, as they celebrate their 25th anniversary this summer."While I am not looking for sympathy, I want to share my thought process because so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life," said Pichette.There have been other shakeups in top management in the past year. In October, CEO Larry Page said he would step back from a day-to-day leadership role to focus more on the company's future. In his place, he promoted trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who already ran Google's important Android mobile software business, to take over as Google's product czar.Before Google, Pichette was an executive at the telecommunications company Bell Canada.
