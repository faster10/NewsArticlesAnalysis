Thanks to one of the NBA ' s great all time starts , the 13 0 Golden State Warriors fresh off a 23 point comeback win over a feisty and frustrated Clippers team should be the team to overthrow that record , or at least make a legitimate attempt . True greatness doesn ' t come along often , and the Warriors now sit just two wins away from the 15 straight record to start a season , a clip shared by the 1948 49 Washington Capitols and the 1993 94 Houston Rockets . This is rare territory , and who ' s to say where the team can go from here ?
