Consider the interaction I had recently with a friend who follows politics . The son of a Pennsylvania coal miner and a graduate of Yale Law School and Oxford University , my buddy wanted to put in his two cents about immigration and how to fix a broken system . A moderate Republican , he doesn ' t support the bill that the Senate passed by a vote of 68 32 , and he is looking for something better . He doesn ' t mind the idea of legalizing at least some of the undocumented , but he wants the United States to secure the border first . He ' s reasonable , but this issue troubles him and so do some of the proposed remedies .
