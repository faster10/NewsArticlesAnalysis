Friday night , Sandusky " the former Penn State assistant football coach was found guilty on 45 of 48 counts related to sexual abuse of boys over a 15 year period . The jury took just two days to untangle this horrendous story and make a decision . And though some felt Sandusky would walk , I could not imagine how 12 jurors could listen to the courageous , heartbreaking testimony of all of those victims and believe that it was all a conspiracy , that those young men had all lied about the abuse charges just so they could file civil suits against an innocent Sandusky , as his defense lawyer claimed .
