Republican grandees apparently had Trump on their minds too , if South Carolina governor Nikki Haley s official response to Obama was anything to go by . The job of replying to the State of the Union is never an enviable one , but Haley did about as good a job as could be expected . Her passage about immigration ? in which she delicately balanced a rejection of Trumpism with opposition to Syrian refugees and undocumented immigrants ? showed that she has the potential to be a formidable communicator of conservative rhetoric . Her biggest problem ? and the problem that the establishment which selected her for Tuesday s task also faces ? is that her party shows no signs of allowing such an approach to thrive any time soon . But Haley is 43 . She has more than enough time to wait for the dust to settle . It s quite possible that she could be delivering her own State of the Union in the near future .
