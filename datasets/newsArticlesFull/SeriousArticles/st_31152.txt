WHY SO MANY TAX CUTS ? Well , in this political climate , sometimes it s just easier to push through a tax cut than new spending ? even if they often serve the same purpose . But the WSJ also points out that targeted tax credits have a mixed record of success and often reward businesses for doing things they were going to do anyway . It can be complicated to claim the benefits . And the Internal Revenue Service , already sagging under budget cuts and the complex task of administering the Affordable Care Act , would be given even more work . http : on . wsj . com 1STOVKl
