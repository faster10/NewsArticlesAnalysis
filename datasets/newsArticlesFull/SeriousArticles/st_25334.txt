Meanwhile , Syria and Iraq were traditional friends and recipients of Russian arms . Russia had a diminished role in Middle East since the Soviet collapse . But ? Putin finally sensed an opportunity in the complex regional dynamics of the war against Islamic State . With the collapsing oil market , he also needed a weapons and nuclear exports market . Iran and Syria were at loggerheads with USA . Putin offered them both support . Russia sold the most potent S 300 anti aircraft missile systems to Iran . It also completed the construction of Iran and the Middle East ' s first civilian nuclear power facility , and continuously opposed the economic sanctions against Iran . Syria received around 1 . 5 billion worth of arms . Then , taking the world by surprise , ? Putin moved Russian fighters , surveillance aircrafts and helicopters in support of Assad in Syria , to take on Islamic State . He was quick to respond with very heavy bombing , when Islamic State claimed to have shot down a Russian charter Airbus 321 flight over Sinai , killing all 224 on board . Russia , also for the first time ever , fired missiles from a submarine against ISIS targets . When Turkey shot down a Russian Su 25 fighter which had flown over its eastern region , Putin was quick to order sanctions and promised to punish them strongly . ?
