Speaking of the media empire he has built , Kazako is self deprecating . " Anybody can do this . I ' m like you . . . Wherever you are in your corner of the world , you can become someone . In the very small corner that you are , take off fear and believe in your idea . Believe in your idea , work very hard , and make sure it is going to happen . . . Sometimes it can be very frustrating , sometimes you feel you are bashing a dry hard wall , sometimes people look at you like a crazy fellow , but just believe and keep on walking . "
