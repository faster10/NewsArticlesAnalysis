Obama won a five million vote margin of victory in 2012 with the same share of the white vote , 39 per cent , that condemned Michael Dukakis to defeat in 1988 . The 2012 electorate was 72 per cent white in 2016 it will be closer to 70 per cent . Hillary can fall short of Obama s share of black or Hispanic votes and still win the presidency . If she falls a bit short on both and yet does better than Obama with white women , which seems eminently plausible , she can replicate or exceed Obama s victory .
