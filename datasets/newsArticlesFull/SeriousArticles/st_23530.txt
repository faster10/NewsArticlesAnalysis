Conventional wisdom states that the top three finishers in the Iowa caucuses are all winners , with a chance to win the nomination , especially if they exceed expectations . But jowly former Sen . Fred Thompson came in third in Iowa and dropped out of the campaign . John McCain gained the endorsement of the Des Moines Register in 2008 as well as the nomination , but he didn ' t finish in the top three in ' 08 or ' 00 . In fact , since 1980 , the only Republican nonincumbent who has won the caucuses and gone on to win the presidency is George W . Bush .
