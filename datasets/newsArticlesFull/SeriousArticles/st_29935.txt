It s been the Vikings defense that has truly stood out this season . Minnesota ? allowed just 19 . 3 points per game , which ranks fifth in the league and is quite an improvement from 2014 ( 11th in the league ) and 2013 ( 31st in the league ) . On Sunday , when Minnesota s offense was less than impressive , the defense sent the team into the postseason on a high note . First , the Vikings intercepted Aaron Rodgers in the end zone with 2 : 09 to play as the Packers tried to tie the game , and then they batted down his last second Hail Mary attempt ( something ? the Lions couldn t manage ? a month ago ) to win the division title the Vikings have fantasized about all season .
