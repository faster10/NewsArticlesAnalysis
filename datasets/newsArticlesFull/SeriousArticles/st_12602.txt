This last week has seen a whirlwind of fighting in a dramatic manhunt , leaving an entire city on lockdown and lives in danger . I am heartened to hear stories where the human spirit rose above the ugliness and absolute horror facing the community . Law enforcement officers and other first responders risked their lives to help others . Several marathoners ran straight to the hospital to give blood , and doctors rushed to hospitals . A restaurant opened its doors and offered free food to its neighbors while they were stuck in a lockdown .
