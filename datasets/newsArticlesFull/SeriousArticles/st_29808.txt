The campaigns need to get back to talking about the issues . They need to talk about Hillary Clinton ? her e mails , what she would actually do as president and her general untrustworthiness . They need to talk about the economy ? the 1 . 5 percent GDP growth in the third quarter , the lack of jobs , the stagnation of manufacturing . They need to talk about Obamacare ? the higher premiums , the gigantic deductibles , the collapse of the Obamacare co ops , the shrinking network of providers . And they need to talk about the Obama Clinton foreign policy failures ? the turmoil in the Middle East and the danger of the Iran nuclear deal , for starters . ? All of these things are far more important to voters than any grievance the campaigns have about the debate rules and process .
