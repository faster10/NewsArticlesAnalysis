A few points here . First , I don t know what Rothman considers a grand scale , but in the first year after 9 11 the FBI reported that hate crimes against Muslims went up by 1 , 600 percent . They dropped significantly the next year but still remain elevated well above pre 9 11 levels . Such upticks in hate crimes against minorities always happen during and after periods of upheaval ( think Japanese Americans in World War II or the Vietnamese refugees who flooded into America in the early 1980s ) , and Muslims in the age of the War on Terror have been no exception .
