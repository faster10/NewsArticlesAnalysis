As a result , ISIS ' s recruiting of people in the United States to travel to Syria to fight and get military training has been so bad that it has changed strategy and is now encouraging ISIS sympathizers to stay at home and do something in America . This change in strategy has actually decreased the rate that Americans are traveling to Syria to fight by 78 percent . According to senior counterterrorism officials , since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 , less than 50 Americans have traveled to Syria to fight some died in battle and a small number have returned to the United States but have lost interest in the cause . Thus , American officials have said that no credible organized threat from ISIS exists in the United States they do worry that the Paris attacks could spark angry young men ( and sometimes women ) to launch " lone wolf " attacks in America .
