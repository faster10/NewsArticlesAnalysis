The decline in sales on Black Friday was the second one in a row . Last year , sales on that day dropped 1 . 8 per cent to 11 . 2 billion , though it still was the biggest shopping day last year , according to ShopperTrak . Despite the big drop this year , Shoppertrak ' s Martin said he thinks Black Friday will remain the biggest shopping day of the year for the 10th consecutive year . But if retailers continue to promote Thanksgiving as the start of the holiday buying season , he thinks the holiday will eventually surpass Black Friday in sales .
