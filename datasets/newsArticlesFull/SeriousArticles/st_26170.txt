On the Tory side , the main event is the Cameron succession and there is a lot of hedging of bets going on . You get the sense that some senior Tories are holding back from nailing their colours to the mast on Europe until they know how it will play in the leadership race ( yes , I m talking about you , Theresa ) . It goes without saying that Labour s focus has been too inward looking for too long . If politicians on all sides don t snap out of it quickly , we could be on a trajectory to leave .
