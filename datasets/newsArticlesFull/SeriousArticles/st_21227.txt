As was the case in September , it s highly unlikely that San Diego city or county residents would vote for funneling money toward the Spanos family of Chargers owners . The Spanos clan not only had their own stadium plans in L .

Yet , despite this , the NFL is giving the Chargers until March 23 to say whether they ll play in San Diego or Los Angeles this year ? and the ability to extend that option to Jan . 15 , 2018 , if a stadium referendum doesn t pass in San Diego .
