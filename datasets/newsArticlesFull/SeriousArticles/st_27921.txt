( Tribune Media Services ) Six hundred years ago , Brussels was just a nice place to stop and buy a waffle on the way to France . Today , it ' s a city of 1 . 8 million , the capital of Belgium , the headquarters of NATO and the political center of the European Union . It may be easy to skip as you zip from Amsterdam to Paris by train , but its rich brew of food and culture pleasantly surprises those who stop . Its magnificent grand square , rightly named La Grand Place , alone makes a visit worthwhile .
