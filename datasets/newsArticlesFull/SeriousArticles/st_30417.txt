Once , the career trajectories of Murray and Djokovic , born only a week apart , were almost identical . But the degree of Djokovic s dominance since 2013 , extending his lead over Murray in the race for slam titles to 10 2 , has been crushing .

I know nobody playing tennis like this , ever , the Spaniard said . It s perfection . When I say perfect , it s not one thing in particular . It s everything .
