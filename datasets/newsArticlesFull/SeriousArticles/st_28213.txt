Fowler : Let ' s be honest , Coley . This Steelers offense is loaded . It has three top 25 players in their primes , and that ' s not counting Martavis Bryant , who has No . 1 receiver skills . The offensive line is solid . Everything is in place for a top five offense . If the Bengals can stop the run and force Roethlisberger to hold onto the ball because of good downfield coverage , that ' s a good place to start . A fully stocked Steelers might need a few games before liftoff , after all . The key is Bell , who is fourth in the league with 511 rushing yards in five games . It ' s hardly a guarantee Cincinnati can contain him . He ' s such a patient runner that he almost always gets his eventually .
