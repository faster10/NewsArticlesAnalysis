People can take Snyder s long winded response in a lot of different ways to me , it read not as Snyder telling everyone outside the team to slow their roll on anointing the Jazz the Next Big Thing , but simply reminding his players that while they have the potential to make the leap , it takes a whole lot of work to get there . He drew a pretty vivid picture of how hard the Thunder worked to get to the point where they were one of the best teams in the league , highlighting the dedication their biggest stars have to their craft even in pregame warmups . ( It ' s true : OKC s pregame routine is among the most intricate and well constructed in the league . )
