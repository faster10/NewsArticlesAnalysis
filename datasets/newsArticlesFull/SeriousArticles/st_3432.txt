Young squads like to add veteran influences , but the Timberwolves have taken that strategy to an extreme . They now employ an elder statesman for each position group ? Garnett , 39 point guard Andre Miller , 39 wing Tayshaun Prince , 35 ? so every prospect has a guide . The T Wolves are a team of freshmen and senior citizens . It s hard to find anybody in his prime . They recall the Thunder , circa 2009 , so it was appropriate that their first preseason opponent at the Target Center was Oklahoma City . Garnett sat on the end of the bench during player introductions , head already lacquered with sweat , staring at the floor . His entire body seemed to be vibrating . He never looked up , wordlessly raising his right fist every time a teammate was introduced , waiting for a pound . When LaVine was announced , he ran straight to the court , unintentionally bypassing Garnett . Towns would not make the same mistake . He would not leave KG hanging .
