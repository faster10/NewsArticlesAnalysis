If you choose to say those words all lives matter in a conversation with your friends , or if you type the hashtag on Twitter or put it up on Facebook or something , you should know what you re saying . You are not saying that all human life is equal . You are saying that there is no racial disparity in America . You are refuting rafts of statistics that prove there is racial disparity in America . You are saying , simply and straightforwardly , that black lives do not matter . At least not as much as white ones do . Is this what you want to be saying ?
