After a rest in the park , take in Midtown for its neck wrenching skyscrapers . Admire the Chrysler Building , the city ' s homage to art deco , and gape up at the city ' s tallest building , the Empire State Building . Stop in Grand Central Terminal , taking note of its Beaux Arts beauty and its constellation inspired ceiling , where you may have time to sneak a drink in the tucked away , wood paneled Campbell Apartment bar . Then admire the nineteen buildings comprising Rockefeller Center , before glimpsing at St . Patrick ' s Cathedral across the street . ( Shoppers beware : the temptations of Fifth Avenue shops and department stores may pull you off schedule here ) .
