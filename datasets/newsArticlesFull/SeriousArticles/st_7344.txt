Sanders , on the other hand , has been in politics for a long time , but he was never a prominent national figure . He has yet to earn the sustained ire of the right wing propaganda machine , as Hillary has . That ought to trouble Democrats because , fair or not , Bernie will make an easy target . He self identifies as a Democratic Socialist , a term most of the country doesn t understand and is thus ripe for demagoguery . And while Sanders can ? and has ? explained how mainstream Democratic Socialism really is , the term socialism remains hopelessly loaded and misunderstood .
