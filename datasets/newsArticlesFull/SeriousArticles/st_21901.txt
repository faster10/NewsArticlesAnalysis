Our interests in the actors nominated for awards has as much to do with recognizing award worthy performances in the arts as it does our biology . We re social animals who are naturally inclined to focus on alpha males and females , which often includes Hollywood celebrities . These actors are people we pay attention to both on and off the screen , and heavily influence our culture . Nominations for awards shows like the Golden Globes reinforces who s important and influential , raising our collective consciousness on contemporary popularity . ? We re automatically interested in the lives of the winners we want to know who they are , where they came from , and exactly how they found themselves at a top tier in the social hierarchy .
