That sentiment wasn ' t nearly enough for Detroit Tigers shortstop Alan Trammell , who received a career best 41 . 9 of the vote in his 15th and final year on the ballot . Gone , too , is Mark McGwire , who slugged 583 home runs but bowed out in his 10th year with just 12 . 3 . This past summer , the Hall reduced from 15 to 10 the number of years players appear on ballots , although players like Trammell and Raines who were past the 10 year mark were grandfathered in to get a full 15 years on the ballot .
