The academy ' s Web site links to videos of children with autism alongside those of " typical " children . For example , one video shows a " typical " child at 20 months playing make believe games with two adults and trying to feed a bottle to a Big Bird stuffed animal . The accompanying video shows a child of the same age with autism in the same setting , ignoring the adults and stuffed animal and becoming aggravated when someone reaches out to him . ( The video , part of a visual autism " glossary " on the Web site of the advocacy and education group Autism Speaks , requires registration . )
