You can t spot a team 31 points on its home field and expect to win very often , especially the top ranked team in the NFL . Newton , who will likely win the NFL s MVP regular season award when all is said and done , went 16 of 22 for 161 yards and one touchdown . While the numbers are far from staggering , it was Carolina s ground game that did much of the damage . Running back Jonathan Stewart had a pair of touchdown runs , finishing the afternoon with 106 yards on the ground on 19 carries . Newton , who is one of the more elusive quarterbacks in the league , rushed for a mere three yards on 11 carries . Again , far from decisive numbers , but Seattle s inability to shut down Carolina s offense in the first 30 minutes of play was too deep a hole for the team to rally from . K . J . Wright concluded a stellar season with 14 total tackles , while Bobby Wagner provided 13 total stops , including seven solo tackles .
