Hart : You ' re looking at me achieving a goal that I didn ' t think was achievable . I ' m sure everyone knows now that only a few have performed in Madison Square Garden . That list is so small . Now I ' m on that list . I ' m a part of a very small group , which is unbelievable . You relish in that moment for a second . When I did that onstage it choked me up because I genuinely thought about what I ' ve accomplished and where I was and what I did to get here . And now that I ' m here , the sky ' s the limit . I ' m in love with this , with making people laugh . And the fact that I had this venue to do it in was crazy .
