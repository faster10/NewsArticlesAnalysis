Therefore , let ' s avoid mixing apples with oranges , or oranges with apples . Let ' s avoid any double talk . If one is using " Free Tibet " as an expedient alternative for " Independent Tibet , " then don ' t complain about China ' s wrath at his real motivation . If one is advocating freedom of religion to the disregard of the separation of church and state , then don ' t complain about being accused by China as a hypocrite . If one is mesmerized by the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader or even the reincarnation of God , he should not accuse China for being cool headed enough to see through the religious veil which covers major political agendas .
