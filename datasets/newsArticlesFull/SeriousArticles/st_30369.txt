In ? the next round , looking straight at the camera , he asked viewers whether the federal government is doing such a great job as to warrant ceding more power to it . Christie got another round of cheers by pointing to Hillary Clinton as the real threat to fiscal discipline . She s ? coming for your wallet , everybody . Don t worry about Huckabee or Jindal . Worry about her , he said . Later he deflected Louisiana Gov . Jindal ( Bobby , he called him ) , again pointing to his own conservative record and going after Clinton . When Jindal persisted , Christie killed him with kindness , saying , Bobby s done a nice job down there . Plainly he had no interest in squabbling with an obviously desperate Jindal . He then returned the argument back to his conservative record in New Jersey .
