Raiders coach Jack Del Rio has this team on the right track . At 7 8 , his first year in Oakland has been a success , win or lose Sunday , and with a ton of cash to spend this offseason , it s hard to imagine this young team not taking a step forward next year . Veteran offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave s unit ranks 22nd in the league in yards per game ? three spots ahead of the Chiefs ? while defensive coordinator Ken Norton , Jr s unit ranks 22nd ? 174 spots behind the Chiefs . Still , the Chiefs are winners of nine straight , and while Oakland should be a problem for the foreseeable future , the Chiefs have the edge here at this very moment .
