If Preibus really does cut ties with NBC , it wouldn t be completely unprecedented . Democrats boycotted a Fox News debate back in 2007 . But NBC News shouldn t be mistaken for MSNBC , which is often viewed by the right as Fox News is on the left . Nor should CNBC , which as my colleague Ben Mathis Lilley pointed out , is a big business friendly , conservative leaning network whose correspondent Rick Santelli literally launched the Tea Party . If Republicans believe they can t get a fair shake on its stage , I m not sure how they can justify appearing elsewhere .
