' Selma ' director Ava DuVernay has praised the Academy ' s steps , but hopes we can use a different word to discuss the issue than " diversity . " We re hearing a lot about diversity . I hate that word so , so much . I feel it s a medicinal word that has no emotional resonance , and this is a really emotional issue . It s emotional for artists who are women and people of color to have less value placed on our worldview . . . . There s a belonging problem in Hollywood . Who dictates who belongs ? The very body who dictates that looks all one way . ?
