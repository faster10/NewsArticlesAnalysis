There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey , where you have large Arab populations . They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down . I know it might be not politically correct for you to talk about it , but there were people cheering as that building came down ? as those buildings came down . And that tells you something . It was well covered at the time , George Stephanopoulos . Now , I know they don t like to talk about it , but it was well covered at the time . There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it , a heavy Arab population , that were cheering as the buildings came down . Not good .
