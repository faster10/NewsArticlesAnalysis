In Bihar , state is an important institution . In a society you need three things : State , civil society and market . Out of the three , corporate sector is not important here . Civil society is entitlement oriented . Effectively , you have a state . Therefore , entry and exit in the state is a very important matter . That is why the Mohan Bhagwat statement is important . On the question of revisiting reservation , people from the subaltern background are not well disposed to this agenda . That has created a problem and that has made the trajectory of the election agenda as forward backward agenda .
