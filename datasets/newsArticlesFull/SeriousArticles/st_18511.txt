Cousins was not intercepted Sunday but could have been twice and a third was erased thanks to a wonderful one handed catch by tight end Jordan Reed . Cousins did a terrific job this season , but he ' s not a finished product and he is dependent on those around him . But he showed plenty of reasons why they should keep him around and be excited . Was Sunday just an example of not having playoff experience ? It could be . The Redskins had not been punched that hard figuratively in a while . But that ' s a typical playoff battle . You need to keep countering . Cousins was off . It happens . But with anything Redskins , you always wonder what it means going forward .
