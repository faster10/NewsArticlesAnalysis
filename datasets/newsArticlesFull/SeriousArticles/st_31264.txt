In New York , the FBI ' s actions were complemented by , if not coordinated with , the New York Police Department ' s Bureau of Special Services , which regularly logged license plates of cars parked outside mosques , organizational meetings , business and homes . The actions of the police on the day of Malcolm ' s assassination are particularly noteworthy . Normally up to two dozen police were assigned at Malcolm X ' s rallies , but on February 21 , just a week after his home had been firebombed , not one officer was stationed at the entrance to the Audubon ballroom where the meeting took place . And while two uniformed officers were inside the building , they remained in a smaller room , at a distance from the main event area .
