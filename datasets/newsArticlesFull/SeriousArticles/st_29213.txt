Shortly after last week ' s column ran , the Cardinals opted to place Chris Johnson on injured reserve designated to return . The decision ultimately ends his regular season and makes him droppable in all formats . Andre Ellington would normally assume the starting role in Johnson ' s absence , but a lingering case of turf toe has kept him off the field as well . Instead , rookie David Johnson started against the Rams and proved he ' s more than capable of handling things . Johnson rushed for 99 yards on 22 carries and added two receptions and a receiving touchdown . Those fortunate enough to add Johnson should once again benefit in Week 14 , as a quick turnaround plays in his favor . With the Cardinals hosting the Vikings on Thursday night , the odds of Ellington ' s ailing toe improving enough to warrant a start are slim .
