Today isn ' t just four days out until the Iowa caucuses it ' s also the final GOP debate before Monday ' s contest . But as you know by now , there ' s a TAD bit of drama on that front . After refusing to participate in tonight ' s debate , Trump is holding a competing event in Des Moines to benefit veterans organizations . The short term result : Without Trump on the stage , there will only be so much oxygen for attacks on him before the candidates start turning their fire on each other , which means that Cruz and Rubio are definitely going to be in the crosshairs . Meanwhile , Cruz is trying to leverage Trump ' s absence by proposing ANOTHER debate on Saturday night in Sioux City between the two Iowa frontrunners , and the superPACs backing Cruz now say they ' ll give 1 . 5 million to veterans charities if Trump takes the bait . Here ' s the thing though : Candidates don ' t try these kind of stunts when they ' re confident they ' re winning . If Cruz thought he had the upper hand , he probably wouldn ' t be issuing this kind of challenge . Plus , news cycles in the Trump era move so fast that it ' s not really clear that voters are going to care about the debate over debates by Saturday . After all , it ' s not like there ' s been a shortage of debates on the GOP side .
