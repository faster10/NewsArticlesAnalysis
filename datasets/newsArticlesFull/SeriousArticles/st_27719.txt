Swinney was a scrawny wide receiver at Pelham High School . When he went to the University of Alabama it was not with a football scholarship . He sat in the stands at Bryant Denney Stadium as a freshman and watched games with that girl he met in first grade , Kathleen Bassett . Swinney saw receivers dropping passes and thought he could do better . So he went out for the team and made it as a walk on . Bill Curry was the coach at the time , but when he left Gene Stallings took over in 1990 . Stalling had played for and coached under Bryant .
