Criminal trials are underway following months of police investigation . Details of murky cases are trickling out . Among those on the dock is Xie Caiping , a portly woman believed be the " mama san " of one of Chongqing ' s notorious triads . Xie is accused of operating gambling dens , drug trafficking , giving and collecting bribes and terrorizing people , including policemen who had tried to investigate her illicit activities . More trials are expected as the city fights at least 14 mafia style gangs . Given China ' s opaque political world , it is notable that the ongoing trial is extensively covered by the Chinese media .
