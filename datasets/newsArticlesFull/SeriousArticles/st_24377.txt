PP : Well , that s not enough . What s more important , in the long run , is going to be the diplomatic cooperation , and here , I think , we re facing what I consider to be good news , which is multilateral conference in which we re going to have foreign ministers from the U . S . and Russia and other concerned , outside parties , talking together , really for the first time , in the multilateral context , about ways to try to resolve this conflict , or at least , stop the violence and that s the kind of cooperation we are mostly talking about .
