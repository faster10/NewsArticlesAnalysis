For the short term , take removing Assad from power off the table . Empower the Syrian forces to take some of the territory back from the rebels , extremists , extortionists and anybody who is using the Syrian and Iraqi population to make money . At the same time , force the Haider al Abadi government to appoint legitimate representatives for Iraq s Sunni population . Compel , under the auspices of the Iran deal , to call back the Shia militia helping the Al Sadr militia in eradicating Sunnis in Iraq . Finally , use all force available to beat back most of the power structure of IS . It is difficult but doable .
