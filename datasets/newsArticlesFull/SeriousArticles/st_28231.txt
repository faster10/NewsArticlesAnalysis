Three years later , Wright and Alderson are both believers in the plan . When the Mets take the field Tuesday night at Kauffman Stadium for Game 1 of the World Series , it will be after following Alderson s sales pitch of adding pieces around the power arms .

Very rarely do you mention four or five guys in the minor leagues and you fast forward a couple of years and all of them are these types of pitchers .
