New England Patriots : Giants quarterback Eli Manning seems to thrive in this matchup , delivering some of the most clutch performances by a quarterback the Patriots have seen in recent years . The Patriots are banged up and thus I wouldn ' t be surprised if their undefeated season comes to an end , but the main reason I ' m sticking with them is the porous Giants defense . It doesn ' t look like the same unit that gave the Patriots trouble in two Super Bowls . The Giants ' 21 forced turnovers lead the NFL , and ball security will be the key . Patriots 34 , Giants 27 .
