Peyroux : It was . . . . I live in Brooklyn , New York , and I was up at 4 a . m . , the quietest hour , where the highway just slows down for about five minutes so you don ' t hear any trucks banging over the potholes . I had the windows open . The debates had been on television . It was an exciting feeling , and we knew that there was a change coming . And I needed to know that in my bones , and I wanted to feel it . Luck would have it that Obama was elected the day that I recorded the vocals on that song .
