Privacy is a shared responsibility . Discussions about privacy usually revolve around consumer privacy and protection . But in this era of social media , when everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster , individual responsibility to respect privacy should be the focus .

But posting embarrassing photos and videos and making thoughtless comments can be a wrongful invasion of privacy as well . Each of us has a responsibility to consider the privacy implications of what we do online .
