My friend Mike Viola of the Candy Butchers , who I wrote the whole record with , called me Amanda Leigh when we were in the studio all the time . Like " Amanda Leigh , come on , we ' ve got to get to work ! " And I don ' t know , it just sort of became synonymous with making the record to me . I had never really owned my name . It was just synonymous with my parents being mad at me . So I was like , " All right , I ' m 25 , I ' m a woman , I ' m an adult . I think I can probably take ownership with that name now and be OK with it . " But I ' m still happy to be Mandy at the end of the day .
