Over in England , you also had the FA Cup last weekend , and three Germans , Lukas Podolski , Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil , were part of the winning team for Arsenal which is fantastic for the World Cup because it will give them a huge confidence boost ahead of this summer ' s tournament . I will meet our boys in the training camp next Tuesday to do some photo shoots and marketing activities with Mercedes Benz . I always look forward to joining them before a big tournament . It ' s nice to exchange thoughts and get some impressions of how their training is going .
