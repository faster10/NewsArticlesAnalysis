It was on the eve of his home Grand Slam that Hewitt made his withering remarks about the slowness of the playing surface at Melbourne Park . " If I ' ve got to play on cow s , I ' ll try my best to do that , " he said . " I thought I might have a bit of pull after being the No . 1 in the world for two years and winning a couple of Grand Slams , but obviously not that much . I ' m baffled by the whole thing , I really am . I ' ve had a gut full of it , to tell you the truth . " Despite his misgivings , he would finish as the runner up to Marat Safin .
