Reiss : Yes , this is one of their biggest concerns based on what happened in the first meeting . The secondary , in particular safety Duron Harmon , didn t tackle well . The front struggled at times as well . One thing that could help the Patriots is that linebacker Jamie Collins , who didn t play in the prior meeting because of an illness , should be available . And fellow starting linebacker Dont a Hightower , who left the game in the second quarter with a knee injury , is also back . When Hightower was in the game , the Broncos had 15 rushes for 43 yards . Once he left , the numbers spiked to 17 carries for 136 yards and three touchdowns .
