Key player : Just as he did in their Week 1 victory over the Texans , Chiefs Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce figured heavily into their blowout victory Saturday . Texans linebacker Brian Cushing had said that their defense , which has played as well as any since Houston turned around its season , needed to be aware of and be physical with Kelce throughout . But Kelce torched the Texans defense throughout , amassing 128 receiving yards on eight receptions in just the first three quarters . In the season opening victory , Kelce scored two first quarter touchdowns , finishing with six catches for 106 yards .
