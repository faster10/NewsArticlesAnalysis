About 50 miles from Tubac , Rancho De La Osa was part of the original 3 million acre land grant from Spain ' s king to the Ortiz brothers of Mexico in 1812 . The rancho fell within the boundaries of the United States after the 1854 signing of the Gadsden Purchase settling the U . S . Mexican border . It now welcomes overnight guests , who can view a cannonball on display that Pancho Villa reportedly fired at the house during the Mexican Revolution . The nearby Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge is open 24 hours a day and welcomes horseback riding , hunting , bird watching and bird migration counts . ( Look for the spring migration count on or around the second Saturday in May . )
