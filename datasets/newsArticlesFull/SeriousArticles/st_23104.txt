Parker will be a player to watch this season . He didn t look like himself for most of last season and scouts have remarked that they felt that quick first step looked a half a step slow . He s 33 but has been playing pro ball since his mid teens and is entering his 15th NBA season . And that doesn t include the two plus seasons ( 203 games ) he has played in the playoffs . Expect Parker to be a full fledged member of San Antonio regular season protection program this year . The Spurs are hoping that a healthy Patty Mills will be able to share the point guard duties and keep Parker fresh for the playoffs . I don t think San Antonio should look to move Parker nor do I think they will but his minutes will need to be closely monitored .
