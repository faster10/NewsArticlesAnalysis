With a shrinking margin , a strong showing by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could cut Clinton s national lead even more . However , he would still have to overcome Clinton s demographic advantage in the ensuing contests , said Patrick Murray , director of the Monmouth poll . Sanders is aided by the fact that most Super Tuesday contests are open to independent voters ? a group where he performs well . On the other hand , about two thirds of the pledged delegates awarded on March 1 will be from states where black and Latino voters comprise anywhere from one third to a majority of the electorate . It looks like the demographic dynamic that hurt Clinton in 2008 may be what helps her in 2016 .
