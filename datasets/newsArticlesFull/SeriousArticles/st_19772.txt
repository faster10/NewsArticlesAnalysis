Kimberling : I like the wood thrush , as does the narrator , Nathan , and as did Audubon and Thoreau , both . It ' s probably not humanly possible to listen to the wood thrush attentively without some emotional response . Whereas the Acadian flycatcher is pretty boring . I think " birdsong " and " songbird " are both misleading words . Lots of songbirds just chirp . I was a research assistant for a major study of songbirds for two years , starting at 5 a . m . six days a week . I especially enjoyed running into non birds . Foxes , raccoons , opossums , all finishing up the night shift at around the time I started . Their collective expression was : " Hey , you ' re human . Either shoot us or leave us alone . Stop coming around every day . "
