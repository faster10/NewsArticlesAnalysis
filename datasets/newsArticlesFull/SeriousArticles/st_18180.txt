Reasons number two and three are that a no fly zone would deepen U . S . involvement in the Syrian quagmire and has no legal basis ( even overlooking of course that U . S . bombing of Syrian territory without a proper congressional authorization is already illegal and unconstitutional ) . A no fly zone would involve expensive constant air patrols and the insertion of U . S . ground forces to protect the zone the tip of the iceberg of possible escalation that doesn ' t solve the overall problem . Finally , even if a no fly zone garnered the United States leverage to get a good settlement with Russia of the Syrian civil war , it may not be worth the paper it ' s written on . In the international system , great powers are usually accustomed to coercing lesser entities to do what they want . The brutal and wild Islamist groups opposing Assad ISIS , al Qaeda ' s affiliate al Nusra , and some other radical Islamist groups will probably not pay any attention to the United States and Russia . They will either need to be smashed using military power or be made to lose their cache by their heinous violence becoming obsolete .
