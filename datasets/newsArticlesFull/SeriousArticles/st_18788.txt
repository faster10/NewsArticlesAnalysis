America s greatness is a testament to generations of courageous individuals who , in the face of uncomfortable truths , accepted that the work of perfecting our nation is unending and strived to expand the reach of freedom to all . For too long , our most basic liberties had been denied to African Americans , and today , we pay tribute to countless good hearted citizens ? along the Underground Railroad , aboard a bus in Alabama , and all across our country ? who stood up and sat in to help right the wrongs of our past and extend the promise of America to all our people .
