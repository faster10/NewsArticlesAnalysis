And at the same time as Mr Osborne is making councils spend more on this one source of need , he is cutting the grant that councils receive from central government from ? 11 . 5bn this year to ? 5 . 4bn in 2019 20 ? an eye watering 56 per cent cut . Mr Osborne claims that local government is actually being hit less hard than some other departments , because their income from council taxes and business rates will go up , and the Government is pressuring them to sell off assets and cap the salaries of their senior officers . Limiting the pay of chief executives is a token gesture at best , and flogging off council owned land and buildings is not a sustainable way of funding local services over the long term . Though it is good that councils are becoming progressively less reliant on the Government , and more on locally raised income , they are still constantly required to do more on less money .
