The attorney general ' s office began a criminal investigation in July 2012 , after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan ' s co workers , who alleged her work might be unreliable . The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly had tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab , allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely " dry labbing " samples . " Dry labbing " is a term used for visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test .
