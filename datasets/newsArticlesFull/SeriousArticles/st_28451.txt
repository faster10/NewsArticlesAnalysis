Trump , if you ignore the margin of error ( and you shouldn ' t , but never mind ) , is actually doing less well among Republicans than Sanders is among Democrats .

Marco Rubio would appear to be the most likely beneficiary of this process . But even Jeb Bush looks no more hapless than Mitt Romney did in late 2011 .
