Rubio is clearly outside the general electorate mainstream on abortion , and Democrats will no doubt spend millions on abortion themed ads if he becomes the GOP nominee . But this isn ' t so clear cut . Rubio is a skilled politician . And voters are accustomed not only to a generous amount of hypocrisy and temporizing on this issue , but to an ever lengthening history of Republicans opposing abortion at the federal level without doing much to stop it . Arguably , Bush ' s history in the Terry Schiavo case , in which he forced a husband to keep his brain dead wife alive , is a greater liability than Rubio ' s more easily muddled position against abortion .
