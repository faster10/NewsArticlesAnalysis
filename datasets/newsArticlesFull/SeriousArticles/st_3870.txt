MAYNARD WEBB : FIRST OF ALL , THE INVESTOR PERCEPTION AND THE OVERHANG BECAME MUCH CLEARER AS WE WENT CLOSER TO ACTUALLY AFFECTING THE SPIN . ALSO WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR MONTHS WITH A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND A LOT OF HELP FROM ADVISERS . WE ARE CERTAINLY CONVINCED THAT IF WE WENT FORWARD IT WOULD BE VERY , VERY LEGAL AND WOULD RETURN GREAT SHAREHOLDER VALUE . IT JUST WOULD TAKE TOO LONG FOR US TO GET THROUGH ALL THE CLARITY WE NEED AND WE FELT VERY CERTAIN THAT THE UNREST WITH THE OVERHANG FOR THE STOCK FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME WOULD DESTROY TOO MUCH SHAREHOLDER VALUE .
