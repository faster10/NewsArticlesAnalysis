Obamacare repeal vote set : Republicans are pushing toward Senate approval on Thursday of legislation that would demolish President Obama s signature health care law and halt federal money for Planned Parenthood , setting up a veto fight the GOP knows it will lose . But Republicans , the Associated Press writes , think the fight will delight conservative voters . Lawmakers have voted dozens of times to repeal all or parts of the health care law , but this would be the first to reach Obama and get vetoed . Republicans say that scenario would highlight GOP priorities for voters .
