White House issues veto threat for House bill on regulatory process
The White House issued a formal veto threat on Tuesday for a U.S. House of Representatives bill called the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act that would create new judicial reviews of regulations.The bill in the Republican-controlled House would "introduce needless uncertainty into agency decision-making and undermine the ability of agencies to provide critical public health and safety protections," the White House said.
