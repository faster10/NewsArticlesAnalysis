I try to have at least 15 minutes of still time and just kind of sit in my thoughts in the morning and just kind of meditate . And normally what happens with me is my mind would always drift to the game . Always . And then I found myself sitting there . My mind wouldn ' t drift towards the game all the time anymore . And that ' s when I started realizing , ' You know what ? It ' s getting close . It ' s getting close . ' Because now I ' m not obsessively thinking about the game anymore . It ' s not wired into my subconscious the way it used to be .
