Maybe it s simple . Maybe it s just that Edelman operates on a different pain spectrum than the rest of us . After all , he did play nearly the entire second half of a game in college after he tore his PCL . And then , after that game was over , he was back at practice the next day going full bore . He will always play hurt , and he ll always play through pain , says Doug Martin , his coach at Kent State . A lot of guys talk about it , but Julian talks the talk and walks the walk . His competitiveness and his toughness are second to nobody .
