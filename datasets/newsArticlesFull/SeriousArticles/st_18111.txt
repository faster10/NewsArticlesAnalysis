RuPaul : I think the characters are stronger . I think it ' s more character driven . Before , we had a lot of pretty , pretty girls . You know , there were some pretty girls this season , but that wasn ' t the main focus . The main focus was difference and character , and that ' s why I think people are so passionate about this season . The bottom line is that people want to see themselves , they wanna see passion , and they wanna see characters . I think that ' s why this is our biggest season ever .
