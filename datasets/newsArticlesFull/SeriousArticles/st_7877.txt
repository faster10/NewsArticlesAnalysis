But I think another piece of advice I would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want , because I think one thing that happens with women , which perhaps is a gender difference , is that women often hang back and think " I will be noticed for my results , everybody will see how great I am because I ' ve delivered these exceptional outcomes " . But actually life isn ' t like that , you have to tell people about your results and your achievements , and men are often better at doing that than women are .
