Indian companies are quite active in African nations but are nowhere near their Chinese counterparts . China ' s economic power has successfully blocked Indian investments in hydrocarbon assets in Angola , Algeria and Uganda . The ONGC , to take just one example , lost out on acquisition of Ugandan oilfields to China ' s CNOOC . What distinguishes China ' s involvement is that it is accompanied by a clear government policy in support of African commercial ventures , abundant financing and tax benefits for its firms operating abroad , and robust diplomacy towards the region . State owned Chinese companies can depend on the Ministry of Commerce to add sweeteners to bids for African government contracts or assets . In contrast , New Delhi gives little financial autonomy to ONGC Videsh Limited ( OVL ) , its most active public sector company in Africa . OVL has to go through a lengthy approval process and is empowered to invest on its own only in projects costing less than 75 million much smaller than the limits imposed on Chinese firms . India can learn from the Chinese example and back its companies on foreign shores .
