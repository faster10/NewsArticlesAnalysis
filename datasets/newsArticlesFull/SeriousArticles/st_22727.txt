In his 1997 memoir , Trump : The Art of the Comeback he fairly assessed his relationship with women as such : " I don ' t know why , but I bring out the best and worst in women . " His disrespectful rant toward Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and her implied menstrual cycle , as well as his subsequent decision not to participate in the GOP debate ahead of the Iowa caucuses because Kelly ( a hard hitting journalist who questioned his treatment of women ) would be the moderator further proved that Trump was woefully out of touch when it comes to American women . Score one for Kelly whose sheer professionalism showed Trump for the dinosaur he is . And while I ' d hardly consider Fox News a legitimate news source what cable network hires Stacey Dash , a " clueless " failed actress to spew idiocy when apparently she isn ' t out back picking cotton during commercial breaks even I was appalled when Trump came after Kelly for simply reminding Trump of his own fallacies , and daring to ask tough questions during a televised presidential debate . Last I heard , gathering the candidates on a stage and volleying questions back and forth was a vital part of our country ' s political process . But perhaps Trump would simply prefer his questions to come from a mediator wearing only a pink tutu and pompoms , bursting through the top of a six foot cake .
