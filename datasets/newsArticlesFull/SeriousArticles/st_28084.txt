Zakaria : I think a good historic analogy is President George H . W . Bush ' s cautious response to the cracks in the Soviet empire in 1989 . Then , many neo conservatives were livid with Bush for not loudly supporting those trying to topple the communist regimes in Eastern Europe . But Bush ' s concern was that the situation was fragile . Those regimes could easily crack down on the protestors and the Soviet Union could send in tanks . Handing the communists reasons to react forcefully would help no one , least of all the protesters . Bush ' s basic approach was correct and has been vindicated by history .
