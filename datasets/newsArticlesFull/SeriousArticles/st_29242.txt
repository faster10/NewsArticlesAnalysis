The U . S . Iranian relationship is not symmetrical . It ' s not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors . Iran is about to try a U . S . citizen and Washington Post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from Iran ' s serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its Shia militias in Iraq . I can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind the scenes plan to have Iran release Jason Rezaian .
