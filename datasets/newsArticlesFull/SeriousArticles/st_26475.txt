The news release now includes a clarification that reads , " This release originally referenced a photo of Sen . Obama and incorrectly termed it to be ' Muslim ' garb . It is , in fact , Somali tribal garb , hence , we have deleted the photo . Also , in order to diffuse attempts by Democrats and the Left to divert attention from the main point of this release that Sen . Obama has surrounded himself with advisers and received endorsements from people who are anti Semitic and anti Israel we have deleted the use of Barack Obama ' s middle name . "
