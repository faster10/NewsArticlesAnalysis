The directors of Murderer did what many documentary filmmakers dream of doing . Drop everything , obsessively chase one single story across ten years and then witness , with cameras rolling , that story metastasize into an epic tragedy of Shakespearian dimensions . The filmmaker s Cinderella story is one of the best embodiments of what critic Manny Farber called Termite Art ? creations that feel their way through walls of particularization , with no sign that the creator has any object in mind other than eating away the immediate boundaries of his art . In comparison with the White Elephant Art of other true crime films and TV shows , the presentation of Murderer is earnest , unkempt , and completely self effacing , with the filmmakers nowhere in evidence . This series is more , great journalism than great filmmaking but who really cares ? Making A Murderer dissolves every barrier between the viewer and the subjects at hand . Obviously , this is what documentaries are supposed to do but in this case , for ten long hypnotic hours , the transporter is on .
