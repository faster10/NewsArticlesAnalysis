PS : When I wrote " Billy , " it was the first time that Billy really looked at his childhood in a chronological order and with depth . It was a painful process , but cathartic . The book gave me the opportunity to understand a lot more about him . Just putting some of this together , the sexual abuse , for example , that he received from his father , the physical abuse he received from his aunts , helped me understand why there ' s a part of him that ' s very closed off . Watch Billy recall his troubled childhood
