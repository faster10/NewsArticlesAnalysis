The great bulk of black American voters upward of 90 supported Obama in 2008 and do so today . They do so because of his party affiliation , his liberal policy preferences , his identification with the African American community ( the offspring of an interracial couple , he calls himself black and married a black woman ) , his personal attractiveness he is uncommonly articulate , handsome , knowledgeable and gracious and the fact that with all of the added burdens attendant to his blackness , he was still able to climb the Mount Everest of American politics .
