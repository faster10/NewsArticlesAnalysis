It is distressing to read that four class XI students of Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Tiruchengode consumed liquor when they had reported to school for writing examination . ( Nov . 25 ) . Gone are the days when schools were considered temples of learning and students even removed theirs shoes slippers before entering the classroom . Access to liquor has become easier these days , as Tasmac shops , in some places , are located closer to schools . It is up to the government to put a check on the easy availability of liquor to put an end to this habit which would otherwise spread as virus in many educational institutions , spoiling the younger generation . The severe punishment of dismissal from school given to the students should impart a valuable lesson to other students . The teachers too have a vital role to play and parents should keep a watchful eye on the children as the society provides them ample chances to go astray .
