Glastonbury has been around since dairy farmer Michael Eavis first held a free two day festival on his farm in 1970 , and it ' s long been the festival in England for seeing the biggest and best bands in the world . It also may be the muddiest heavy rain in several years , most notably 1997 , turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog . Everyone from Radiohead to Jay Z has headlined the festival , and with more than 700 acts each year , there is something for everybody . Some of the proceeds from the festival go to Oxfam and Greenpeace . This year ' s headliners include Franz Ferdinand , Blur , and Bruce Springsteen .
