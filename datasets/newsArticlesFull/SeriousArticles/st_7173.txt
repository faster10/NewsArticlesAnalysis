But in our elation over their safe return we must be careful not to forget the dangerous circumstances of their release . President Obama has appeased Iran s terror sponsoring ayatollahs , this time with a prisoner swap to secure the overdue release of four innocent American hostages in return for which Iran gets seven lawfully convicted terrorists and criminals , fourteen terrorism prosecutions halted , 100 billion in sanctions relief , and an industrial scale nuclear program ? and Iran gets to keep Americans Siamak Namazi and Robert Levinson to extract future concessions . While we exult in the return of American hostages , one must also wonder how many more Americans will be taken hostage in the future as a result of President Obama s shameful decision to negotiate with these terrorists .
