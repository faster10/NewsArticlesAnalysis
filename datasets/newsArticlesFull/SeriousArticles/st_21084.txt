SM : ? I don ' t believe so , because they know very well , Houthis or Zaidis they really have nothing to do with Iran . They have been ruling Yemen for 1 , 000 years . They were removed off from the power in early 1960s when Egypt invaded Yemen . Therefore , they have roots , they have history of 1 , 000 rule in Yemen . Of course they have good relations with Iran , no doubt about it , but the Saudis , with invasion of Yemen , they have pushed Houthis and Zaidis to have more cooperation , strategic relations with Iran otherwise they could have good relations with Houthis after Egyptian invasion in early 1960s Saudis were actually supporting Houthis , that ' s why I believe , this is their own mistake , it is not Iranian issue .
