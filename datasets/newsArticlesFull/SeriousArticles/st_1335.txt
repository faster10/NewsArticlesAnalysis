I really did . The whole thing was interesting for me . I ' ve never interviewed anybody , first of all . I ' m pretty good at the initial instincts , and the very first time that I met Jay Z some months back , we met with him in his office and there was just something that I really respected about him . I think he ' s pretty true to himself and pretty clear about what he thinks . Kind of the opposite of mercurial , I ' d say . I don ' t know what the opposite of mercurial is , but he ' s I think tremendously focused . I ' ve been around a lot of artists who are also good at business and . . . one minute they ' ll sound like an artist and the next minute they ' ll sound like the characters in " Mad Men . " Jay Z ' s a very good businessman and he talks about it and enjoys it , but he doesn ' t shift . He has a sense of what he thinks people might appreciate , because he sort of trusts that if he appreciates it , there are people out there who will as well . And that ' s what ' s interesting to me : that he ' s accomplished in those areas but I don ' t hear that sort of cynical , world weary quality .
