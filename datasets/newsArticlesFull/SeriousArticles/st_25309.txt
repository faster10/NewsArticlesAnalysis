Trend of the week : Last week we were talking about the lack of non offensive touchdowns in the league . Week 12 bucked that trend . There were non offensive scores in four of the six games , including three special teams touchdowns and three defensive touchdowns . All three defensive scores came in the Territorial Cup where the Sun Devils had two pick sixes and the Wildcats had one . Besides the McCaffrey kick return , USC s Adoree Jackson and Washington s Dante Pettis each had punt returns for scores . That pushes the Pac 12 into a tie with the Sun Belt for most defensive scores this season with 25 .
