There ' s a couple of big problems , though . The first is that despite the recent momentum for Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire Clinton has to remain the favorite to get the Democratic nomination , given her current popularity with black and Latino voters , among others . So what does a Trump Clinton Bloomberg election look like ? Bloomberg is very liberal on social issues such as gay rights , strongly pro gun contro l , and a spokesman for the Wall Street elites . While Clinton is very liberal on social issues , firmly anti gun , and historically friendly to Wall Street . Do we really need a richer , male version of Hillary ?
