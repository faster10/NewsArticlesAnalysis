Nicotero : I ' m not there on a day to day basis , but I have interacted and consulted with Mike Aiello and his creative team in regards to all of the sculptures . I provided them with photos of a lot of sculptures we did at KNB EFX . They replicated a lot of the stuff we did . In a few instances , like with Michonne ' s pets , I sent them actual prosthetic pieces used on the show so their sculptors could duplicate , as close as possible , the work we did on the show . I really was involved in that capacity .
