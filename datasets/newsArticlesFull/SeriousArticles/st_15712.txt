Green was again one of the NFL ' s best players at his position this season , especially when it came on passes deep down the field . His 15 catches on balls thrown 20 plus yards beyond the line of scrimmage were fourth most in the NFL and his 50 percent catch rate on those passes was the league ' s third best mark . The Steelers ranked 26th in Football Outsiders ' DVOA ( Defense adjusted Value Over Average , which adjusts performance for down , distance , and opponent ) on deep passes , so trying to get Green involved on those types of plays could be a way to even things up in a matchup where Cincy ' s offense isn ' t at full strength .
