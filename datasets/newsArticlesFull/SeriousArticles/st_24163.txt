Republicans threw a collective fit over how last month s CNBC debate played out . Fox Business , which no doubt sees an opportunity to best its better watched business news rival , is vowing the candidates won t have the same complaints after this one . As one of the network s on air promos ever so subtly put it : CNBC never asked the real questions , never covered the real issues . That s why on Nov . 10 , the real debate about our economy and our future is only on Fox Business Network . It s unclear , though , whether the Milwaukee moderators ? Neil Cavuto , Maria Bartiromo , and the Wall Street Journal s Gerard Baker ? can live up to that promise .
