At receiver , the Sooners do graduate All America wide receiver Sterling Shepard , whose consistent and gritty production will be irreplaceable . But that doesn ' t mean receiver will be a weakness . Dede Westbrook was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year , and just this week the Sooners added Penn State graduate transfer Geno Lewis , who had 55 catches two seasons ago for the Nittany Lions . Factor in budding tight end Mark Andrews and several capable young wideouts , and Mayfield could have plenty of options even without Shepard .
