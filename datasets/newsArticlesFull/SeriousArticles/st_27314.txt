" Trainwreck " as a movie was anything but . The best part of the film is obviously star Amy Schumer , who also wrote the screenplay . Schumer is witty as her character , Amy , and she has great chemistry with supporting actors Bill Hader , LeBron James ( yes , that LeBron James ) and Vanessa Bayer , elevating the simple premise of the movie to something extraordinary . There are so many cringe worthy but entertaining moments that go beyond the " traditional " bounds of a rom com ( this movie might as well be an awkward sex com with a little bit of rom ) , but that ' s just what makes this film so special . Plus , Schumer ' s so hot in Hollywood right now that it seems impossible for her film not get recognized for its hilariousness .
