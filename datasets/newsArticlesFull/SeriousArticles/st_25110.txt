Sports became a career choice and I spent most fall Friday nights , Saturdays and Sundays on some sideline or another covering various games . I can ' t tell you how many I ' ve seen but I was privileged to see some of the best of their time . I ' ve covered 18 Super Bowls . I go to church when I can but not on those 17 or 18 Sundays in the fall during football season . I figure if I kneel down after the game like a lot of today ' s players I ' ve done my due diligence . I pray a lot during most Bills games anyway .
