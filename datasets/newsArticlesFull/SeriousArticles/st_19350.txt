Ben Carson : A respected brain surgeon and successful inspirational speaker , Carson overcame a faltering start as a candidate to become the early leader in Iowa polls . His career story , mild demeanor and clear commitment to his faith appealed to the evangelical voters who have often dominated GOP caucuses there . But late in the fall , terrorist massacres in Paris and Southern California refocused voter concerns . Carson seemed lost in the new landscape , and his support decayed . His campaign infrastructure teetered on collapse , and his debate performances faded even more . In Iowa , his voters largely decamped to Cruz . Carson has no prospects in New Hampshire , but might stick around for South Carolina .
