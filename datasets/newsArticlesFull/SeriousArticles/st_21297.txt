Some of it is still the double standard in our society that it ' s more acceptable for a man to be this antihero badass doing all these things that break the law or are really awful . People watching want to be Walt , or they identify with him . He doesn ' t have to answer to anybody . He does what he wants . There ' s a fantasy element to that , I think . I also think that in some ways , there ' s kind of a sexism to it , honestly . Sometimes . . . pauses I ' ve been told particularly , how do you say . . . non flattering or just really vicious you could use the word vitriolic angry stuff about Skyler , or about other female characters on other shows . The hatred and the vitriol and the venom and the nastiness and the attacks are so personal sometimes that it feels like , " Oh gosh , OK , I get that you don ' t like Skyler , you like Walt , you ' re on his side , but it just feels different . " I don ' t feel like that stuff would be written about a male character .
