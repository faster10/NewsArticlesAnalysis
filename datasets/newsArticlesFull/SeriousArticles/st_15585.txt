Teresa Barger : If Chinese do go in for a sharp one time devaluation , that is not their policy , what I would do if I were in their shoes , because there is probably 3 trillion dollars of pent up demand for diversification of assets on the part of Chinese and they are looking at what is called flight capital to diversify their assets out of China I would want to do it now before the inevitable devaluation comes . Gradual devaluation is not their friend on capital outflow side , but it anyway if there were a bottom to the devaluation in China , then I would say , yes , it is a buy opportunity in its neighbouring countries and I am actually monitoring for that .
