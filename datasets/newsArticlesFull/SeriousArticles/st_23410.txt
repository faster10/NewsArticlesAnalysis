My dad was a WWII combat veteran who fought in the Pacific , and when I graduated from high school , I joined the military , too . I grew up around guns , and Dad taught me how to handle firearms at an early age . We hunted together and I ' ll never forget a bit of wisdom he imparted to me . " If you need more than one bullet , you ' re a piss poor shot and have no business with a gun in the first place . " Which brings me to my point : I can think of no legitimate reason for a civilian to have a semi automatic gun and every reason to come together as Americans and agree to get rid of them .
