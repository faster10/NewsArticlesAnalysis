One reason to get excited : The defense , even with some mental lapses like Ward s as well as some quirky coverage assignments ( nose tackle Sylvester Williams was dropped into coverage on West on the touchdown reception ) , still makes almost every yard hard earned . The defense was put into difficult field position time after time and the Chiefs had the ball for more than 21 of the 30 minutes in the first half and had it 28 : 30 by the end of the third quarter . The score won ' t look all that pretty , but even the Broncos defense can ' t go it alone .
