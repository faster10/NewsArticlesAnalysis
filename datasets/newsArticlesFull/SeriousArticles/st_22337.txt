NOTES : Chicago forward Richard Panik played in his first game with the Blackhawks since he was acquired in a trade with Toronto on Jan . 3 . He wasn t supposed to play after just joining the team for the morning skate after resolving a visa issue , but was pressed into action with Anisimov out . It s a really good team , Panik said . I have to earn a spot , so going to do my best and hopefully it s going to work out for me . Blackhawks general manager Stan Bowman said there have been no setbacks for C Marcus Kruger , who had surgery last month to repair a dislocated left wrist . He could return for the end of the regular season or the start of the playoffs . The Predators scratched D Petter Granberg , LW Eric Nystrom and C Colin Wilson .
