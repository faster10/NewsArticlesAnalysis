Wormholes in space are shortcuts linking distant points a bit like that other sci fi favorite , the star gate . Leap through one and you might come out on the other side of the galaxy a few minutes later . If wormholes exist , they could be adapted to make time machines that send you into the future if you traverse them in one direction , but into the past if you go in the other direction . Like a black hole , a wormhole would be a massive gravitational space and time warping object . But whereas a black hole represents a one way journey to nowhere jump in and you can never get out a wormhole has an exit as well as an entrance .
