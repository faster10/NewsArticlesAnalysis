Ben Carson is in the midst of a campaign collapse . There ' s just no polite way to put it . His numbers are headed down , and they ' re headed down in a big way . Last month , Carson was giving Donald Trump a real run for his money , and Carson had even led in the polling briefly ( a feat no other candidate has come close to achieving ) . This month , he ' s dropping like a stone . Currently , he ' s at 15 . 8 percent , down from 24 . 4 last time around . That ' s a falloff of 8 . 6 points in a very short time . Nobody quite knows why Carson fell when he did his numbers got worse even before the Paris terrorist attacks refocused the race on foreign policy . He said a few outlandish things , but then he ' s been doing that for the entire race , while his polling went up , not down . But for whatever reason , Carson seems to be fading fast . He won ' t disappear altogether , as I think he ' s got a certain level of core support that won ' t abandon him for a while , but as an actual contender for the nomination I think he ' s headed towards being the best longshot ( the position Bush now occupies ) . He could surprise everyone and recover , but that ' s pretty rare for any candidate who has been near or at the top and fallen so far . The only silver lining for Carson right now is that he ' s still leading the other second tier candidates but that will likely last only until the next few polls come out .
