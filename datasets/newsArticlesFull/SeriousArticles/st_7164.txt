When asked why I would jump into a primary ? kind of stirring it up a little bit maybe ? and choose one over some friends who are running and I ve endorsed a couple others in their races before they decided to run for president , I was told left and right , you are going to get so clobbered in the press . You are just going to get beat up , and chewed up , and spit out . You know , I m thinking , and ? You know , like you guys haven t tried to do that every day since that night in 08 , when I was on stage nominated for VP , and I got to say , yeah , I ll go , send me , you betcha . I ll serve .
