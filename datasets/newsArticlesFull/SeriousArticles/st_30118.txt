" She knew that I knew and she didn ' t want me to say anything . There ' s a level of narcissism which is all mixed up with self hatred . I know it well . . . . But I can ' t think what I could have done apart from take her and shake her ! ' You stupid little c t ! Wake up ! ' " Faithfull said she was " appalled " by the younger singer ' s death .
