Here ' s the tale of the tape , state by state , beginning with Tuesday night : Minnesota had just more than 47 , 000 people turn out for its caucuses this year four years ago it was nearly 63 , 000 and Romney came in first , not a distant third as he did Tuesday night . In Colorado , more than 70 , 000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 but in 2012 it was 65 , 000 . And Missouri even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest had 232 , 000 people turn out , less than half the number who did four years ago .
