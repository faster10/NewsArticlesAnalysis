So the next time people in power propose a new war and they will journalists need to ask some important questions . What are the limits of our understanding of this country we might invade ? What are the motivations of the people pushing for the action ? What evidence is the government offering to support its claims ? Are there knowledgeable people who disagree , and what are they saying ? Which of the government ' s claims have I investigated myself , and which am I taking on face value ? What are the potential consequences of military action , good and bad , and have I explored them in enough detail ? And in the context of Iraq , which questions do I wish I had asked last time around ?
