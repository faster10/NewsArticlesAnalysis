Not unlike a certain leading Republican , Clinton lists goals with barely a nod as to how to reach them : moving Putin off Assad , getting the Iraq government to deal in the Sunnis and Kurds getting the Saudis to focus on ISIS getting the Saudis to stop funding terrorists a second Sunni Awakening an intelligence surge , a political resolution of Syria s civil war and , quaintly , an end to partisan sniping here at home . It s a rickety structure the moral equivalent of Rube Goldberg . To reach any of its goals you must reach all or at least most of them . Clinton cites every kind of smart power but her constant theme is military mobilization on a scale big enough to smash the would be caliphate . She leaves no doubt as to who d be in charge : This is a world wide fight and America must lead it .
