I feel like I ve been in a relationship for , like , six years . I have just gone from one person to the next , Kylie Jenner explained on her website on January 28 , via a Hollywood Life report . I was dating someone for , like , three years ? 14 , 15 , 16 and a little bit of 17 . Then I went into another relationship at 17 , 18 , and now I m just like I feel like I really need to find myself this year and have a relationship with myself , because I don t know what it feels like to be by myself .
