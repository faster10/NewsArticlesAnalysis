In a speech at a mosque in Baltimore , Maryland , yesterday , President Obama declared that our TV shows should have Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security . As with anything that Obama says about Muslims that s not related to vaporizing them with a drone strike , it didn t go over too well with conservatives . That wasn t much of a surprise , as any show of compassion or empathy from the president is seen by the rightwing as cowardice or worse , treason . What was surprising , however , was that Obama would point to television as a means of easing cultural and religious tension , when it s often used for exactly the opposite purpose .
