New York Giants : The Giants will hope for some positive news Monday on left tackle Ereck Flowers , who sprained his ankle and left Sunday ' s game in the third quarter . Flowers left the stadium on crutches and in a walking boot and is obviously in danger of missing next week ' s game . But he has played on a sprained ankle for much of this season , and the Giants do have an extra day this week since they don ' t play until next Monday night . They can ill afford to lose Flowers after losing right guard Geoff Schwartz for the season last week . Dan Graziano
