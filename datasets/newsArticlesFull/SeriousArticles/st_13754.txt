I spent most of the day dismantling the kitchen , ripping out cabinets and countertops with a crowbar . Everything was almost new installed only six years ago but had to go , because it had been soaked by Sandy . The homeowner ' s 84 year old father helped me carry out the heavier appliances . Nearly two weeks after the storm , the gas stove was still dripping wet as we lugged it to the curb . By the time we finished , the entire contents of the first floor were sitting in the street waiting to be hauled away by the heavy equipment making its way through the Rockaways section of Queens , New York .
