Benedict Cumberbatch , who so exquisitely plays Turing in the movie , said it best perhaps : " Alan Turing was not only prosecuted , but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early , by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved , as all human beings do . Sixty years later , that same government claimed to " forgive " him by pardoning him . I find this deplorable , because Turing ' s actions did not warrant forgiveness theirs did and the 49 , 000 other prosecuted men deserve the same . "
