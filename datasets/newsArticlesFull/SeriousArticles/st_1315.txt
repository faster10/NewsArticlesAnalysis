Exactly . The root of the taunt implies that there s something inherently wrong with enjoying fingers in the booty . If we applaud that attitude , we re taking a major step back for sexual freedom . When we call this an embarrassing sexual claim , we re playing into homophobia , and creating a hierarchy of sex acts that are okay , and sex acts that aren t okay . We re making men who do enjoy being on the receiving end of anal sex ( or might someday be curious about it ) feel like that s something to be ashamed of or to hide . Both Rose and West played into that , her with her accusation , him with his denial , which could easily have said something like , I m not into anal , but everyone should be free to enjoy what they enjoy . It s 2016 , and it s high time anal sex stopped being used as some sort of epithet .
