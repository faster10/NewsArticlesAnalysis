In his penetrating new book " The History of Future Cities , " author Daniel Brook matter of factly declares Dubai as the center of the world . But he also sketches a portrait of a place that is not just a city , but an idea , and a dream . In one generation , Dubai has graduated from a village that people just fly over , to an instant city in the desert , to a destination for migrant workers and expatriates , to a world financial center and demographic microcosm of the planet . Just a couple of years after its economic crisis it feels like the center of the world again . In the traditional but affluent beachfront district of Jumeirah , the aesthetic matches the geography of being halfway between Europe and India : patisseries next to sari shops . An even further concentric circle of cultures is represented : Burger King and Chinese massage parlors .
