Are the Seahawks the most dangerous team in the playoffs ? You d have to go back to the 1993 Buffalo Bills to find a team that made it back to the Super Bowl after losing it the previous season . Maybe Seattle ? is just the team to pull it off . They rode home field advantage to get to the past two Super Bowls , and would need to win three consecutive road games to make it back again . But they still have a defense that allowed the fewest points in the NFL ( again ) , and a big difference is Russell Wilson s growth as a pocket passer .
