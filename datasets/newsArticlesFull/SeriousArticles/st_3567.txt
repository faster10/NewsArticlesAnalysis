What of those seemingly impolitic suggestions that we accept only Christian Syrians ? ? Well , not to favor one group of faith addled folks over another , but exactly how many Jesus freak Jihadi Johns have we seen beheading American journalists ? How many Syrian Christians have even so much as suggested burning a Quran ( remember that pastor in Florida ? ) , let alone advocated slitting the throats of their religious rivals ? At least as far as security goes , accepting Christian Syrian refugees hardly seems like a bad idea . In fact , it seems like a no brainer .
