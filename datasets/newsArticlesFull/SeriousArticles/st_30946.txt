Shortly before the train crashed , according to reports , the Spanish train had passed from a computer controlled area of the track to a zone that requires the driver to take control of braking and acceleration , Harrod said . " It ' s possible that the driver ' s phone conversation which apparently was part of his official capacity as a driver distracted him and he missed the transition from automatic to driver control , " Harrod said . He may have been unaware he was in control of the train and realized , ' oh , no , we ' re headed for a curve . ' If that ' s true , I really don ' t think it was his fault . "
