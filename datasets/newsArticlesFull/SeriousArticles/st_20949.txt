The next day , campaigning in New Hampshire , Cruz went even further , finally taking a direct swing at Rubio and others who have supported immigration reform . Last night , you listened to one Republican after another who said , Gosh , it would be mean to enforce our immigration laws , said Cruz at a Veterans Day town hall in Kingston . He continued : And I would point out , by the way , everyone talks about how compassionate it is to grant amnesty to 12 million people here illegally . They re very compassionate , but it s not very compassionate if I say , I m going to give away your job . That s the opposite of compassion .
