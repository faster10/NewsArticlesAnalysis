Obama needs to suspend the Border Patrol ' s policy of allowing unaccompanied minors to stay in the United States with relatives . Young people need to be held by U . S . immigration officials until they can be brought before an immigration judge to determine if they should be deported or whether they have a legitimate claim to refugee status . Since current law says that unaccompanied minors have to be placed with relatives within 72 hours , we have to make sure that they get before a judge within that time period . It ' s not ideal . But changes have to be made , since the current system has been compromised by smugglers who are using it to line their pockets .
