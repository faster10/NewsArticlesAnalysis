Stephen ' s twin , Inspector Stuart Lewis , was the first senior officer to reach the scene in Clydach , near Swansea , where Mandy and her family were bludgeoned to death . After lying in wait and slaughtering them with a heavy pole , the killer set fire to their house in an effort to cover his tracks . Inspector Lewis could not account for his movements at critical times during the night of the killings , June 26 , 1999 , and went off duty before telling any senior colleagues that this was a case of mass murder and arson . An official inquiry found he had told numerous lies and he was formally disciplined , though not criminally charged .
