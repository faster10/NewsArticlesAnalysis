If a child is not present at school , he or she cannot possibly learn . Schools that consistently report high student achievement consistently have students with great attendance . Yet one of our greatest school problems is student attendance . Why do we have to beg parents to get their children to school , to convince them that we need their children present and as stress free as possible ? A parent asked me once why her child needed to come to school every day . She was actually upset that the school district had a policy that addressed absent and tardy children . She said it was not the school ' s business to tell her how to raise her children .
