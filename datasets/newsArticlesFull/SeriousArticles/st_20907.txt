A lot of us in brown and black bodies have become used to the neo colonial lens through which the rest of the world views us . We are there to be " helped " , to be " liberated " . There exists a powerful and deliberate narrative around Africa and the Middle East : " we must go there and free them ! " If you are only viewing people as hapless , helpless children which is how I see a lot of Femen ' s rhetoric as applied to Africa and the Middle East you rob them of agency . It is not up to Femen to go and " free " these women . We cannot export tactics that simply don ' t work , in the name of sisterhood .
