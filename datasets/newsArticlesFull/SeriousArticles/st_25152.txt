Headhunters Odgers are understood to be arranging the recruitment of the FA ' s new chief executive at a significantly reduced fee . This is because the FA board ' s nominations panel are prepared to do some of the work themselves , with chairman Greg Dyke making it known at the start of the process that he couldn ' t see the need to hire a recruitment agency as the directors themselves could come up with a strong short list to replace Alex Horne . FA concerns about any perceived cronyism in the appointment led to Odgers belatedly coming on board .
