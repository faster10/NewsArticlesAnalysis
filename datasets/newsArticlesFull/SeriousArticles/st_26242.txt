10 . Patriots rookie defensive end Trey Flowers , who impressed in the preseason opener with a sack of Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers , has been rehabbing from shoulder surgery after being placed on season ending injured reserve on Dec . 1 . It was a quiet rookie season overall for Flowers , the fourth round pick from Arkansas , as he only played in one game , but that was due more to the team s depth at the position than anything else . I m told the shoulder surgery was more routine for Flowers to address a lingering issue .
