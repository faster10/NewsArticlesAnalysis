The devil is in the details . The good news is that we will have a chance to look at those details in a few weeks and tell the FCC what we think . The FCC will be voting on the new rules at its May 15 meeting . If it votes to adopt them , it must publish the proposed rules in advance and respond to public concerns about them . The problem is that most people don ' t know how this process works , and so they don ' t participate .
