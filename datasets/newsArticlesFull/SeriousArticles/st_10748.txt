Why To Watch : These are two young teams who seem to be about to make their fans forget all about some of their franchise ' s recent struggles on field and off . Both of these teams are making a move , both have second year starters in place who look like cornerstone quarterbacks and an imposing power running game and defenses that have been overhauled and are thriving . A lot of similarities here with these teams being something of mirror images in opposite conferences . One difference has been the Vikings have found a way to steal a win here or there or at least not let games slip away while the Raiders are still dealing with overcoming that issue . Oakland has been more at ease especially late in games at home , however , and they will be driven after a heartbreaking setback in Pittsburgh on Sunday . Bridgewater ' s status will be dependant on his ability to get through the league ' s concussion protocol , but the Vikings have a steady backup in Shaun Hill who can buy them a few weeks .
