Now scientists say pesticides may no longer be necessary thanks to genetic modification . One method , known as population modification , allows researchers to edit out the part of the mosquito genome that can carry infections disease . Researchers successfully used the genetic modification technology known as CRISPR last fall to keep mosquitoes in a lab from being able to spread malaria . The technique could easily applied outside the lab , according to James , one of the study co authors . Mosquitoes would still exist ? and they d still bite ? but the chain of transmission for malaria would be broken .
