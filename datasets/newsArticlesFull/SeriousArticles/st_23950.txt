In the bottom of the 12th inning , dozens of Royals fans stood under section 120 at Citi Field , to watch KC close out the series . A few obnoxious Met fans left bitter . Get out of the way , a ? hole , one said to a man in a Royals cap . Have a nice trip to flyover country . Others offered good wishes . Congratulations , said one Mets fan to Garrett Meyer , who grabbed a 400 ticket and flew in from Kansas City for Game 5 . You kicked our asses . A jubilant Meyer , 23 , was shaking . I remember going to Kauffman Stadium when there would be less than 10 , 000 people in the stands , Meyer said . This erases all of that .
