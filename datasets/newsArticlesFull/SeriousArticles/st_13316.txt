Bryant , however , at least has the consolation of a final lap of honour around NBA arenas . On Tuesday he was back in Philadelphia , where he was born , for a game against the woeful 76ers . He had dissed the team in the past , and was dubbed Hometown Zero by local tabloids . Whenever he returned he was loudly booed . Not this final time , however , as fans cheered his name for a full minute before the game . The Lakers lost , but Bryant was visibly moved . Appreciative beyond belief , he said . I couldn t have asked for anything better , other than winning the game .
