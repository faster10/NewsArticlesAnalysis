If the Alawites lose power , the next government would likely be constituted from the current oppositional groups and the Sunni majority in Syria , who comprise roughly 74 of the population . As in Egypt and Tunisia , where the Islamic Sunni parties were the ones who won the elections , in Damascus , the Sunni oppositional groups are more likely to win most of the parliamentary seats in the situation of a new government forming after Assad . This will be regarded as a considerable shift in regional and international balance of power against Iran and in favor of the Arab Gulf states , particularly Saudi Arabia .
