In particular , the dream " confluence " for Bloomberg would be quasi fascist blowhard Trump on his right , with self proclaimed " democratic socialist " Sanders on his left . That seems like Politics 101 , right ? Millions of Americans at least based on the public opinion polls insist that they could never vote for Trump likewise , only 47 percent of Americans say they would ever under any circumstance vote for a " socialist . " That would create a wide center lane that Bloomberg who created a paramilitary police force during his 12 years running New York could drive an armored personnel carrier through . ( It could also set up a bizarre election in which the former NYC mayor , born in Boston , might be the only non native New Yorker , if facing Brooklyn ' s Sanders and Queens ' Trump . )
