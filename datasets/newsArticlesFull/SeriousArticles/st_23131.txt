I have spoken with representatives of the Small Island States at the U . N . Tuvalu , Marshall Islands , Samoa , who have begged the U . S . to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to stop the floods and destruction of their islands and cultures . They observed , " The President has refused , telling us he can ' t get a strong commitment through a Republican Congress . But we feel it is he who does not really want to do it for all he has to do is make the case and make the Republicans look bad . But the U . S . is too powerful for us to challenge them directly . That is your job . "
