In the appeal , two independent forensic experts argued Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be " inadmissible " because the clasp had not been properly handled . Prosecutors dismissed the theory again during the appeal , specifying it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene . They said documents showed that proper checks were carried out before and after their DNA tests to verify the quality of the work . But the appeals judge couldn ' t find the documents in court records and ruled they would not be admissible .
