But Thursday night ' s debate offers the national media especially the cable television outlets a shot at partial redemption . They can decide to ignore Trump ' s choreographed sideshow altogether ( Trump is scheduling his event at precisely the same time as the debate begins ) . The networks can cover the debate and discuss what the candidates say about each other , about the issues , and about Trump . They can insist , in unison , that they will not be nakedly manipulated on at least this one night . The non FOX NEWS networks are of course competing with and also often disagree with FOX NEWS and its philosophy and approach to information dissemination . But all of the major networks still maintain that a large part of their programming is actual journalism and news reporting . Being magnetically pulled over to Trump ' s orchestrated distraction as if they are powerless to make another choice will be another " huge " public capitulation .
