What has got into those Canadians ? Aren t they supposed to be America s allies in the war against radicals ? They have agreed to take 25 , 000 Syrian refugees from camps in Lebanon , Jordan and Turkey over the next three months . They have ceded much of the work of vetting those refugees to the International Organisation of Migration , an intergovernmental body based in Geneva . And now they plan to distribute the refugees to 36 cities across the country . Don t they know those people are terrorists ?
