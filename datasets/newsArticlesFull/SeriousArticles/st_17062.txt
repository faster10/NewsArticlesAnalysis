Now that India and Pakistan , despite tense boarders where intermittent skirmishes have become a norm than an exception , were somehow able to break the ice by shaking hands in Paris and hugging in Lahore and discuss a broad range of bilateral issues briefly but candidly , does it make sense for either India or Pakistan to put a nail in the coffin of a peace process that has been initiated with much effort and courage on the part of the civil and military leadership of the two countries ? This is the central question being raised by the regional media after the attack on the Indian airbase inPathankot , which is located not that far from the international border with Pakistan . Also , Pathankot has historical relevance with regards to the partition plan and the geostrategic value of it for the Indian state with respect to its northern command that is essentially Pakistan ( and Kashmir ) centred . Based on the past trends and speculations , one can scheme out certain scenarios where someone from within the rigid bureaucratic world of either India and Pakistan or both might have allied and aided certain existing actors who are well trained to carry out sabotage acts .
