She has a hard time capitalizing on debates . She does a really , really good job in debates . She s extremely well prepared . She s never flummoxed . She s never stumped . She never makes a mistake . She never makes a gaffe . She knows exactly what she wants to say , when it was foreign policy , when it was financial regulation , she had her bullet points ready to go . It was like a Power Point presentation . She s really got it together , but somehow , after the debate is over , she can t get out there and turn that in to rising support . She tends to disappear after the debate . She ll do a couple of media interviews the next day and then nobody really hears from her .
