But ever since the Romans conquered Lutecia more than 2 , 000 years ago ( and probably long before that even happened ) , terrorism has taken lives in these very streets , be that those of Roman prelates , medieval tax inspectors , betrayed Protestants , abandoned kings , nobles and revolutionaries alike , early communists and fascist collaborationists . Proven right by history or not , in most cases , the only thing it accomplished in the long run was bringing us closer together , and reminding us that we re one city , and one country , and , should we not prevail , no one is going to take away our freedom or who we are . And I feel like that s the kind of spirit I witnessed last weekend in the streets of Paris .
