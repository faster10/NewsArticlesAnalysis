Rob Gronkowski : The Patriots tight end continues to rehab a sprained right knee and his status for Week 14 remains undetermined . He ' s also dealing with a bone bruise in the area , an injury that often prolongs the recovery process . However , New England ' s loss to Philadelphia in Week 13 could force the team to adjust its timeline with a top seed in the AFC playoff picture suddenly up for grabs . Unfortunately , the Pats are often cryptic with their handling of injury information , so fantasy owners should protect themselves and have a serviceable backup plan available in case Gronk sits for a second straight outing .
