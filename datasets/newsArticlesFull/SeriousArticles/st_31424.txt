The doc has a few more words with Williams at the break , though it ' s still unclear what is ailing the champion . Her play certainly doesn ' t seem too affected right now . The Russian loses another point immediately to go 0 15 behind . . . things not looking good for her right now . But Williams can ' t return her next serve and it ' s level . Oh wow . A great forehand from Sharapova is returned by an even better one from Williams . 15 30 . That ' s not when you want to do a double fault . Two break points for Williams and she only needs one . She is now closing in on victory .
