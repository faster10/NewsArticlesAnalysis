Blake tends to get picked on more than the others , and he ' s arguably been the NFL ' s worst cover corner this year . Quarterbacks completed 76 of 110 passes thrown his way , for 1 , 074 yards , eight touchdowns , and two picks during the regular season . That works out to a 117 . 0 passer rating . If McCarron sees Green matched up on Blake one on one at any point during the game , he could do worse things with the ball than just chuck it down the field and trust his guy to go up and get it .
