The backcourt boys had plenty of watchers , but few fans in the true sense of the world . This is both the Open ' s great success and essential failing , that they would be there anyway . They come for the event , not in these early days the competition . In Sopot , Poland , in 2008 , where this whole thing first came to light , did anyone care whether a Russian or an Argentine won ? Isn ' t that the point ? And unlike in soccer , for instance , or cricket , it only takes one player to make a workable fix .
