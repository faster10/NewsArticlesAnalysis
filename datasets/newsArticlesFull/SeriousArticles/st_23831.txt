The facial gesturing , the cap and the self talk are not for everyone , in the way Andy Murray ' s on court persona is not for everyone . But I think too much has been made of Hewitt ' s minor indiscretions because they suit a particular view . I refer to him calling an umpire " spastic " . I take that as another kind of in character expression that can happen during play . It ' s vulgar enough , but it doesn ' t rank on a scale of abuses that fall from sportsmen ' s mouths , unheard . The racial innuendo he is accused of in a match against American James Blake is another conversation .
