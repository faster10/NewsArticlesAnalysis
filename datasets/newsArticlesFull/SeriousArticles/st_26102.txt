New York Giants : The Giants are 5 0 against Washington since the start of the 2013 season and 13 24 against everyone else . They operate with a high degree of confidence against this team . They believe Kirk Cousins will give them chances to intercept the ball , and the way they ' ve taken the ball away from their opponents this season ( second most in the league ) , they believe they can and will take advantage . This should be a close game , as the teams appear evenly matched on paper , but the Giants have this team ' s number , and I don ' t think it ' ll change just because it ' s a road game . Giants 28 , Redskins 24 . Dan Graziano
