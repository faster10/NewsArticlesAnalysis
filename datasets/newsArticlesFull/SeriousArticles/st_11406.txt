HILLARY CLINTON HAS AN ELECTABILITY PROBLEM HuffPollster : " Hillary Clinton may have something of an electability problem . The problem is not that Democratic voters don ' t think she ' s electable . It ' s that they don ' t care who ' s electable . That ' s too bad for Clinton , since she ' s made electability a cornerstone of her campaign . HuffPost teamed with YouGov to probe the views of Democratic and Democratic leaning voters . What we found is that only 8 percent say they ' re backing somebody who isn ' t their top choice , but whom they see as more electable . Sixty two percent say they ' re supporting their favorite candidate regardless of that consideration , while the rest are undecided or don ' t plan to vote . A majority of all Democratic and Democratic leaning voters 54 percent now say that Clinton ' s chief rival , Sen . Bernie Sanders , is in fact electable . " HuffPost
