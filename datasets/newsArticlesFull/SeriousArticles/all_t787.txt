Hugh Jackman,â€‹ Sigourney Weaver take on "Chappie"
"Chappie" is a science-fiction movie that isn't afraid to dig into something deeper.The film, which comes from the makers of the sleeper hit "District 9," centers around a robot who can think and feel. "District 9's" Sharlto Copley used performance-capture technology to play the robot, Chappie.  "Pretty much a character actor's dream, I think. I got to play a character that comes into the world as a baby basically and forms his personality on camera," Copley told CBS News.The film also stars sci-fi royalty Sigourney Weaver as a ruthless businesswoman and Hugh Jackman as a bad guy threatened by Chappie's artificial intelligence."It's so much to do with coming of age and what your creativity is and your capability what consciousness is, all these things," said Weaver.  Jackman said the movie plays with audience's expectations.   "We are so used to seeing these images of the future robots being destruction, we're going to kill you, take over but what if we created a better version of ourselves -- more caring, more able to look out for the planet, more connected?" said Jackman.  And sci-fi fans have more to look forward to: "Chappie" director Neill Blomkamp is teaming up with Weaver on a new "Aliens" movie."Chappie" opens in theaters on Friday.
