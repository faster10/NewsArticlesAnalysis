This is Saoirse Ronan s second Oscar nomination . She was previously listed in the best supporting actress race for Atonement in 2007 . ? " When we made Brooklyn , we had no idea of what was to come . It is the most personal film I have ever done , the hardest one too , she said in a statement . This has all been a dream . To see how the film has been embraced has been heartwarming . Thank you so very much to The Academy you are a group of people I respect greatly and to be recognised by you means so much . Thank you !
