Apple should also move some of its assembly operations to Mexico . Mexican labor isn ' t as cheap as Chinese labor , but after one adjusts for the differences in the cost of shipping , establishing assembly line factories in Mexico should be quite acceptable from a financial and quality perspective . By moving more production of advanced components to America and the human labor to Mexico , more jobs will be added to North America and help reduce the U . S . Mexican trade deficit , which is about 55 billion annually . And by having the assembly work just over the border , Apple can ensure that costs can be kept under control .
