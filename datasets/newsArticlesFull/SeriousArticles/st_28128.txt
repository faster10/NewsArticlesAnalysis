Kickstarter s overview of the thousands of projects proposed each year , and the varying popularity of different hardware and software , means it is well placed to identify new trends . Better placed , maybe , than CES . Of the 19 , 802 technology projects launched on the site so far , 3 , 887 have been successfully funded by the public , from drones and 3D printers to a wired air guitar and headphones . The now ubiquitous ( and controversial ) hoverboards started on Kickstarter with a project called Hovertrax which was first funded in May 2013 . Dimatos says that was just one of a wave of last mile of transportation projects on Kickstarter , and though many start as curios they occasionally break out , as the hoverboard did . ( Battery powered rollerskates have yet to break free in quite the same way . )
