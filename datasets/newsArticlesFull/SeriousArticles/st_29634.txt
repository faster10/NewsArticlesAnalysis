The entire notion of foreign policy experience is based more on vague impression than reality . What matters above all , as Obama rightly insisted in 2008 , is judgment not experience . In the case of Clinton there hasn t been a major foreign policy decision in the Middle East she pushed for that didn t end up being a disaster both at home and the countries she advocated meddling in . The most commonly cited mistake was her support for the Iraq war which is one of the main reasons she lost the nomination the first time around . But even if one excludes this . Even if one puts it into a memory hole and buries it along with her support for DOMA , welfare reform , and harsh prison sentences , the choices she s made after 2008 show she not only didn t learn any lessons from that war but has only grown more bellicose and hawkish . From her advocating regime change in Libya , to arming dubious opposition forces in Syria , to undermining peace with Iran ? Clinton has consistently been wrong on foreign policy even after her supposedly humbling loss of 2008 .
