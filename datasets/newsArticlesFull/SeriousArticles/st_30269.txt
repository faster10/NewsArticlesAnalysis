Packers Redskins has a game total of 45 second biggest on the Week 18 slate with host Washington as a one point dog . My guess is Vegas installed Green Bay as a short road favorite almost entirely because the public loves betting on the Packers . Washington has been the superior team . . . . The Redskins ' team total is 22 points , a number I like Washington to exceed on Sunday evening . One of the NFL ' s hottest quarterbacks down the stretch , Kirk Cousins combined for a 73 completion rate and 11 : 0 TD to INT ratio in Weeks 15 17 . Due to their ground game ineffectiveness , the Redskins embraced a pass based plan of attack in the second half of the season . Cousins cleared 300 passing yards in four of his last five home games , where Washington also performed markedly better as a team . The Packers did finish No . 6 in pass defense DVOA , but their quarterback schedule was one of the easiest in the league . At worst , this is an average matchup for Cousins in a game that will offer shootout potential if Green Bay ' s offense comes to play . . . . The expected unavailability of Matt Jones ( hip ) locks in Alfred Morris as the Redskins ' early down back against the Packers . Passing down specialist Pierre Thomas may be the superior fantasy bet , though . According to Warren Sharp of Sharp Football Analysis , the Redskins threw the ball just 55 of the time in one score games in the first three months of the season . They transitioned to a 65 passing team in one score games in the final month . Thomas appears to have passed Chris Thompson ( shoulder , toe ) , logging 34 of Washington ' s snaps and 19 touches to Thompson ' s 19 and eight touches the last two weeks . Thomas is a sneaky , minimum priced DFS punt play this week . Thomas could potentially lead the Redskins ' backfield in playing time and touches if Green Bay ' s offense shows up .
