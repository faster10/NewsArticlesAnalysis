The defenses are built around solid linebacking units that don ' t give up many explosive plays . Josey Jewell and Cole Fisher lead the hit parade for the Hawkeyes , with Riley Bullough and Darien Harris doing much of the clean up work for the Spartans .

But Iowa TB Jordan Canzeri and his 5 . 48 yard average per carry could prove helpful in the clock control area , especially if QB C . J . Beathard can provide some air cover .
