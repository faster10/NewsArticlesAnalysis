Atlanta Falcons : It will be nearly impossible for the Falcons to break their five game losing streak , especially against arguably the league s best team . Sure , the Falcons won last year in Charlotte 19 17 , but a much more mature Cam Newton is guiding the undefeated Panthers right now . The Carolina defense , led by linebacker Luke Kuechly and cornerback Josh Norman , will make it tough for a struggling Falcons offense to score , even with Julio Jones on the field . Jones hasn t scored a touchdown in four straight games , and the Falcons haven t had a rushing touchdown since Week 6 at New Orleans ( Oct . 15 ) . Panthers 28 , Falcons 17 . Vaughn McClure
