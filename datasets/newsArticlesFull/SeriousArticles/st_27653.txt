The parallels between the two administrations do not end with fabricated terminology . Lawyers in the Justice Department ' s Office of Legal Counsel in both administrations have written secret memos apparently analyzing the legality of these troubling practices . After the memos were written , waterboarding continued during the Bush administration . President Obama finally ended it with an executive order signed within days of his first inauguration . Guantanamo , however , stayed open , and targeted killing continued . We can safely assume that the memos conclude the United States may lawfully carry out such practices .
