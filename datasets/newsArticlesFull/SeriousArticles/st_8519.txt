The undercard : This is a four person debate : Christie , Huckabee , Jindal , and Rick Santorum . Frankly , the only candidate in this group with any shot of moving up is one of the men who got bumped from the main stage : Christie . A video of Christie telling a moving story about a friend who died from an addiction to painkillers has gone viral . If Christie can get to that story in the debate , it might be distinctive enough to contrast with the normally contentious tone of the undercard debates . The other candidates have shown no hint of capturing the imagination of voters in three successive debates , and only Jindal shows any life at all in Iowa .
