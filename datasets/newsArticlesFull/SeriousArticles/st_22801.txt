America is not now nor has it ever been a melting pot . It ' s barely a patchwork quilt , what with all the quilt squares bickering all the time . We are , however , a democracy , and to the extent that we want that democracy to function and become stronger over time , we have to really look at and really listen to each other . I need to hear " What ' s Goin ' On " and see Hamilton not just because they ' re great works of art , but because our entire social compact depends on Americans of all stripes honoring the experiences of those whose stripes are different from our own .
