Checking the weather display for our departure from JFK Airport in New York to London ' s Heathrow Airport , an awkward blob of green , yellow , and red is sprawled diagonally across most of the New England coastline . Studying the computer in Operations , the routing filed with ATC ( air traffic control ) appears to navigate through the least intense area of a very wide storm system . I pick up the company phone , taking a rare opportunity to consult with our dispatcher located in a central location at our main hub almost 1 , 400 miles away .
