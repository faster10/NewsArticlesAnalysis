This is all held together by a terrifying brutality . We never doubted that these men would kill us without a thought . And that goes for El Chapo too . For all the comedy of his escapes and the delight in his legends , he maintained his power through targeted brutality . While his men always told us that he was no psychopath like his enemies in the other cartels , there is no question his cartel has been responsible for much of the insane violence that has consumed over 100 , 000 victims over the past decade . After last summer s escape , life up near La Tuna changed radically . We were invited back , told of the tunnel they had built to practise his escape last year . But we were warned it was no longer business as usual . Where once warnings of military raids came hours if not days in advance , enabling El Chapo and his closest to fly out , now the military carried out surprise raids . A couple of his houses and farms were seized . There was talk of his mother having to move out . In October , El Chapo escaped injured from a house we had stayed in just a year before , a house we knew was just a hillside away from his brother s ranch .
