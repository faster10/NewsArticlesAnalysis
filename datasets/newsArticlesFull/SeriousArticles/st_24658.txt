Might have ED my guess voting record from the N already . He voted for immunity from gun makers and sellers switch the NRA says with the most important piece of gun legislation . In twenty years that would have to agree with both of them they ' ve both been inconsistent when it comes of this season . I am absolutely committed to universal health care what our campaign was saying Bernie Sanders was full of what universal health care for my entire life . He wants them and Medicare and Medicaid and the Children ' s Health Insurance Program . That is nonsense I don ' t think thanks . I don ' t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs . You have said the President Clinton would advise you on economic issues are you talking about that kitchen table on economics but we have a real . Policy role . Well they ' ll start at the kitchen table we ' ll see how it goes from there .
