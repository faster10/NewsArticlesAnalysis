It ' s a single shot , tracking video . Some of my friends like to liken it to the West Wing , when he ' s walking through the hallways and the camera never breaks . And the intent , really , the video starts with me in a classic video shot . I ' m sitting on a city street , and there ' s single family homes behind me . And then I jump up , and I start taking off , and I ' m walking through the house , and I ' m jumping on a golf cart , and talking to the camera the entire time , and fixing things as I go along . And it starts out kind of simple , and it starts to get crazier and crazier as you get to the end of the video .
