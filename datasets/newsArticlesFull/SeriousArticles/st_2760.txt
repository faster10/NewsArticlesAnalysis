I ' m partial to leather leashes because they wear well over time . Certified professional dog trainer Amber Burckhalter of K 9 Coach in Smyrna , Georgia , introduced me to the Mendota leash , a clever collar leash combo that tops my list of favorites . One end has a looped handle , while the other serves as an adjustable collar . This multitasking leash gets frequent use at my house during bathroom breaks , but Burckhalter says the Mendota works great for dogs that tend to slip out of their collars . The rope style leash features an adjustable leather attachment that makes it one size fits all . You can find Mendota leashes at most pet supply stores . Amazon . com offers a variety of colors with prices starting at 11 . 45 .
