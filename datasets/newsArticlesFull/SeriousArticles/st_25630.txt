Asked about the report , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said , " I would refer you to the Yemeni government for any information on operations against al Qaeda in their country . That said , the Yemen government should be commended for dealing with the al Qaeda threat in their nation . Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatens the stability of the region and poses an increasing threat to Yemenis and Americans . We strongly support actions against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and cooperate closely with Yemen and other countries on counterterrorism initiatives . "
