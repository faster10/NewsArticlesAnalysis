Dan Bickley , Arizona Republic : Eulogies are rarely pleasant . Our farewell to the 2015 Cardinals is somber proof . For the second consecutive season , their Super Bowl dreams died in North Carolina . Their 49 15 loss to the Panthers on Sunday was painful and embarrassing , a night when even the great Larry Fitzgerald struggled to catch the football . The Cardinals lost to a better team , to a better quarterback . But they did not bring their best game to the penultimate stage in football , and that will haunt them in the months ahead .
