Physicality : It ' s incredibly physical . I drive up to 280km h . The hardest thing is the g force on your body under braking and the high speed cornering . I do a lot of back and stomach exercises and for the braking I need to have quite strong legs as well . Some drivers are very aggressive . I ' m a smooth driver . I have very little movement on the steering wheel , which is why I ' m sometimes better at conserving my tires than my teammates . Drivers try to stay as slim as they can and that ' s where I have a massive advantage I ' m 20 to 30 kg less than the guys .
