The speech came right after the Ermenek coal mine collapse in the Central Anatolian province of Karaman while 18 coal miners were still trapped . " With endless thanks to our God , today , the republic has gained a structure that keeps an equal distance from all ethnicities , faiths , languages and cultures , " he continued . " We will continue building the future with this spirit of solidarity and fraternity . " It was a good speech but wasn ' t received very well because it was a great challenge for many of us to believe Erdogan ' s sincerity while watching his unjust actions at the same time . Yes , the words came from the same Erdo ? an whose increasingly authoritarian mode of governance has harmed state institutions , the press and civil society enormously . He is the one who blames everyone else , calling them " traitors of the nation " if they do not agree with him and the Justice and Development Party ' s ( AKP ) policies . He has not viewed his opponents as humans , equal in dignity to himself , and he has failed the test of democracy several times .
