So the two big reasons are making a dent in a costly bad lifestyle choice and saving money for the health care system by hiring tobacco free employees . I am not sure if I buy the smoke break disruption or the smelly clothes arguments . If they are problems , then send the smokers outside to a spot far away from where the patients come in and out , or have them wash their hands and faces , which everyone ought be doing anyway , and only give them the same breaks from work that everyone else gets .
