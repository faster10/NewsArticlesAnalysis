User generated sites are built on feedback from the masses : TripAdvisor , for example , features more than 50 million traveler reviews sounding off on nearly 495 , 000 hotels worldwide . While the company , which launched in 2000 , bills itself as having " World ' s most trusted travel advice , " the sheer volume of sources and TripAdvisor ' s inability to vet them all for accuracy make these reviews something to take with a grain of salt . ( A general rule is to ignore the ecstatically positive and totally negative reviews in favor of those in the middle . )
