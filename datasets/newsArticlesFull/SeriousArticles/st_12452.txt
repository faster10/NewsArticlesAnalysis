Modine : It is . A few years ago , I had the pleasure of reading a book about President Kennedy and his experiences as the captain of the PT 109 during the Second World War . And even if half the stuff in the book was an exaggeration , the 50 that ' s remaining makes me think that John Fitzgerald Kennedy was an absolute stud . And so now I have the honor of participating in this new John F . Kennedy documentary about the Cuban missile crisis . And intelligence and courage that he demonstrated against all odds is amazing . All of his advisers wanted him to engage Russia in a nuclear war , and he refused to take that route . He wanted to keep an open door policy and a conversation , a dialogue , with Khrushchev to avoid our two nations from going to war . It was through intelligence and negotiation that war was avoided . It just makes me love him and admire him all the more .
