Determined not to face a third close contest , Nixon and the Republican Party implemented the Southern Strategy to bring long time Democratic white southern , rural and evangelical voters into the Republican Party . Those voters , alienated largely by the Democratic Party ' s embrace of civil rights , became a core GOP constituency . And the strategy was successful . Four years after his narrow win over Humphrey , Nixon demolished George McGovern , winning 49 states and 60 . 1 of the popular vote . While McGovern was a particularly weak candidate , Nixon ' s 1972 election numbers largely mirrored what 1968 would have been if you added George Wallace ' s vote totals to Richard Nixon ' s , which would have given Nixon 56 . 9 of the popular vote and a 44 state landslide .
