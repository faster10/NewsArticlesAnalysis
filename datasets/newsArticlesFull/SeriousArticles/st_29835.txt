In this Nov . 13 , 2015 , file photo Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses the Sunshine Summit in Orlando , Fla . The Republican outsiders have been getting a pass on their limited grasp of foreign policy in the presidential race . That may be ending .

And they didn t fret over Ben Carson s mistaken belief that the Chinese are involved in the Syrian conflict . Yet Friday s terrorist attacks in Paris have sparked an urgent focus on national security that will test the appeal of the outsiders like nothing they ve faced so far . ( AP Photo John Raoux )
