Video games aren ' t like that anymore . In everything from the legendarily controversial Grand Theft Auto to more recent games like Watch Dogs , the player is left to dictate what kind of actions his or her character will take , presumably because players have so much more command over the character . They ' re not just relegated to running the four levels of the Keystone Department Store in control of a law enforcement agent . They command ambiguous characters with motives as yet to be determined in a game of life that isn ' t otherwise particularly directive . There are consequences to the actions players take , sure , but they can still drive around a city , talk to people , enlist their support , have sex with them , run them over , beat them up , rob them , or do pretty much anything else they want ( or not ) . Each player has to determine what code of ethics they ' ll follow , what kind of person they ' ll be . It , on the other hand , is far more like real life than we ' d perhaps care to admit .
