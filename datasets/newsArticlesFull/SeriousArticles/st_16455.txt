so i asked pat and nancy to come over to my apartment for coffee and told them : i m going to record some music . should i make up a band name , or make a james murphy record , or should it be LCD ? we all thought a good amount about it . we have had lives for the past 5 years , which has been nice , and those guys have made amazing music with Museum Of Love , the Juan MacLean , and all sorts of other things . i d managed to do a bunch of fun , dumb stuff which mostly annoyed people who were into the band because , well , subway turnstiles and a coffee aren t LCD , basically .
