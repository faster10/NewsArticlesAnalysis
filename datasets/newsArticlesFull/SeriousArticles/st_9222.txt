It ' s rather inspired to cast an actor so associated with a recognizably benevolent character in such a disturbing role ( sort of the effect Elijah Wood had as the expressionless , evil Kevin in " Sin City " ) . Seeing Knight go from a bright eyed family man one moment to a sinister predator who snarls , " Tell me you love me , Mommy " to the women he ' s assaulting ( ick ) in the next is appropriately chilling . And , as it turns out , the dichotomy makes even more sense as , in a twist typical of this long in the tooth series , Knight is pulling a Sarah Michelle Gellar and playing estranged identical twins , one of whom has a seemingly charmed life whereas the other ' s is in serious shambles .
