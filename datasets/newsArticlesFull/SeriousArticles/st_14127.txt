All in all , Clinton s camp said the sum total of the new tax hikes on the wealthy would add up to a half trillion over a decade , when counting the surtax announced on Monday . Clinton outlined the new tax plan less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses , and with her main rival , Sen . Bernie Sanders , surging in the polls . A new NYT poll found Clinton with a 7 point national lead over Sanders , down from 20 in December . But Sanders now has a 5 point lead in Iowa , according to Quinnipiac , after trailing there by 11 last month . And Monmouth has Sanders with a 14 point lead in New Hampshire , after Clinton had a 3 point lead in November .
