Not likely . The policy was initially designed to slow births in a predominantly agricultural society , where more children meant more laborers and security in old age . In today s increasingly urban and educated society , the economics of raising a family have flipped . Now the costs of putting a child through school place an enormous burden on families , dampening their desire for a second child . Loosening the policy two years ago produced fewer additional births than hoped and a baby boom doesn t appear to be on the horizon . ?
