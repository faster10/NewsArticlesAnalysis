While Roethlisberger has continued to work fully with his receivers in practice , there is one caveat . If his knee isn t 100 percent , he won t be in the game . I think if there is a restriction I shouldn t be out there . That s my opinion , said Roethlisberger . It s going to be a coach s decision what happens if I play but you can t go out there if you are restricted in any way . Unconcerned about playing after missing four games and having the wear a brace , Roethlisberger wants to place his concerns on what his team will do on the field . I can t afford to have one , he said about an qualms over using a brace . I m not going to think about it . I have been wearing ( the brace ) to work out , to do some things in , just to try and get used to it . I have never worn one before . It s something definitely new I don t want to think about what I ve had , what I am wearing I just want to go out and play the game of football .
