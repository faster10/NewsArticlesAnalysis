Casagrande : Whether it ' s the electronics in the camera or the fact that they ' re just really inquisitive , they almost always swim straight up to the camera and either bump it with their snout , or , the more investigative ones , decide to bite it . I ' ve said before it ' s like you ' re eating a bowl of spaghetti and you accidentally bite down on your fork . Most sane people don ' t try to continue to bite through that fork and swallow it . They immediately let go and realize wow , that ' s something that ' s not natural for me to eat , so they don ' t eat it .
