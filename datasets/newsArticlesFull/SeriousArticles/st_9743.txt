The right wing news entertainment media complex routinely uses eliminationist and violent rhetoric to describe liberals and progressives . There , the implicit ( and often explicit ) narrative is that those people who are not members of the American right wing are traitors , un American and deserving of whatever violence comes to them . This is not empty talk , hyperbole or playful rhetoric designed to cheer on Republicans and build up morale before a presidential election . The right wing media has actually weaponized its followers . The results are those black folks killed by Dylann Roof in Charleston , the women s reproductive health doctor George Tiller , and the other victims of right wing domestic terrorists shot dead at Sikh Temples , Jewish Community Centers , and elsewhere in the United States .
