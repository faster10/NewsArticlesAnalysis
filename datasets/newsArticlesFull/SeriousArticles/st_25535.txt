Professor Juan Cole of the University of Michigan once wrote that , " One most certainly does insult Muslims by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism . Muslims perceive a double standard in this regard : Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols would never be called ' Christian terrorists ' even though they were in close contact with the Christian Identity Movement . No one would speak of Christo fascism or Judeo fascism as the Republican s . . . speak of Islam o fascism . . . . Many people also point out that it was persons of Christian heritage who invented fascism , not Muslims . "
