Let ' s be clear here : I have no problem with managers picking what some would consider a weakened side . If that manager believes it ' s a team that can win the game , then there is no issue . Swansea City are a good example from this weekend . Garry Monk knew he could win the tie at Tranmere Rovers with the ' weakened ' team he selected and he was proved right . But for Newcastle to risk a below strength team against Premier League opposition who picked up points over Christmas and New Year , was pure folly and totally disrespectful to the Newcastle fans .
