The ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) , created by the junta and led by retired soldiers , has conceded defeat in a poll that was a major milestone on Myanmar ' s rocky path from dictatorship to democracy . Suu Kyi also requested a meeting with former USDP chairman Shwe Mann , the lower house speaker . He lost his seat , but before the election had been seen as a presidential contender . He antagonised the military while in parliament and built close ties to Suu Kyi , arousing the suspicion of many in his party .
