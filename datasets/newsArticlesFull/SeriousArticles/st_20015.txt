Professor Amy Vittor , an expert in insect borne diseases at the Emerging Pathogens Institute of the University of Florida , said the emergence and spread of the virus was absolutely likely to be connected with environmental degradation in its broadest sense . She said that such diseases persisted in a closed cycle of animals and mosquitoes until they spread to people through such incursions as cutting down trees , adding that her research has shown that deforestation followed by agriculture and regrowth of low lying vegetation provided a much more suitable environment for the insects than undisturbed , pristine forest .
