PB : I don t think this is mission creep , I think this is mission running . There is no question the US has been directly engaging in a war against ISIS at various points against others , whether it s the Al Qaeda force known as the Al Nusra front , whether it is against parts of the regime of President Bashar Assad in Syria . The US has been engaged militarily for quite some time . So , this is not mission creep except to the degree that they are acknowledging that this is outside the official mission and now we are going to match that by moving to the new definition of the mission . This is and has been a very serious problem since August of 2014 . The problem isn t new . Acknowledging it may be new , but that is not the problem . The problem is the militarization of this conflict on all sides . We need a cease fire we need an arms embargo on all sides .
