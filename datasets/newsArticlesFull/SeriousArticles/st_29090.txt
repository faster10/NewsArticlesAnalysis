What I said boiled down to this : I am horrified that religious Jews would spend millions of dollars on a rally to protest an unstoppable force such as the Internet instead of focusing their attention on the real problems their community is facing , such as the sexual abuse scandals that are now public knowledge . The Internet can never be stopped , but parents and kids can be educated as to how to use it , just like in the real world . Instead , I argued , the ultra Orthodox were just trying to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the real problems by waving a giant distraction in front of it .
