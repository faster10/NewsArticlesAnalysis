Some recent examples of this change come from REI and Macy ' s . REI announced within the last few weeks that their brick and mortar stores in the U . S . will be closed on Thanksgiving and on Black Friday . In contrast to this , Macy ' s announced that their stores will open at 6 p . m . on Thanksgiving . Thanksgiving and Black Friday ads and promotions are almost gleefully leaked by many retailers , incentivizing and enticing holiday shoppers . The message is clear . Everyone can get the Black Friday discounts that used to be available to the lucky few who were first in line in the wee hours of one day . ( Black Friday sales can be held any time of the year ! )
