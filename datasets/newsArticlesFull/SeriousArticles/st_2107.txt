Granted , I do enjoy good clapback . A daily helping of petty keeps the doctor away ( " I am your OG and I will be respected as such " should be on a T shirt immediately ) . And to be fair , Kanye has the right to defend his wife ( though it begs the question of whether or not she wants or needs defending ) if she really was being insulted . But Ye took the exchange to a really problematic level . Weaponizing your ex , who also is a mother , and dragging her son in the argument is embarrassing , disrespectful , misogynistic , and quite frankly it ' s just corny .
