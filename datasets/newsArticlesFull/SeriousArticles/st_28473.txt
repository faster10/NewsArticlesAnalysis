ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : It makes for a grand exit , if not a grand bargain . The budget deal now being finalized between congressional leaders and the White House serves as a parting gift from House Speaker John Boehner to his all but certain successor , Paul Ryan . It buys Ryan and Republicans in Congress budget peace for the balance of the Obama administration the period during which they are guaranteed to have a Democratic president . Barring a rebellion that could would harm Ryan even before he assumes the speakership , Boehner will be leaving Ryan with the kind of maneuvering room he knows he will need to succeed in his new role . Tea party forces will hate Boehner even more , if that ' s possible . But if Ryan is able to take advantage of what Boehner is handing off to him , it ' s enough to prompt a reassessment of the Boehner era . He led by lightly leading at times , with a restive group of congressmen who didn ' t always want a leader . But under the circumstances , between this budget deal and a permanent doc fix , he was able to get some things done that he wasn ' t supposed to be able to do . It ' s rarely been pretty . But this would be quite an ending for a man who always said and meant he came to get things done .
