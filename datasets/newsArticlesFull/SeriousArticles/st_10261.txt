Former Bush 43 speechwriter Matt Latimer criticizes his party in a New York Times op ed for being mostly silent about what ' s happening in Flint , MI ( which is Latimer ' s hometown ) . " Flint was not mentioned in the last Republican debate . Though Ben Carson , a Detroit native , on Tuesday blamed local Flint officials for the troubles , unless I missed them , no tweets in solidarity have been issued from other Republican contenders . ' That ' s not an issue that right now we ' ve been focused on ' was the best Marco Rubio could say when asked about the devastation of this American city . " In fairness , Cruz has spoken out against Flint . " What ' s happened in Flint , Michigan is an absolute travesty , " he said . " It is a failure at every level of government , a failure of the city officials , a failure of the county officials , and the men and women of Michigan have been betrayed . " But that has been more the exception rather than the rule .
