For me and for many of my women colleagues , as well as for mothers , sisters and daughters everywhere , the House Republican ' s decision to pointedly discriminate against these groups of women was stunning . Surely , we should all be able to agree that where a person lives , their immigration status or who they love should not determine whether or not perpetrators of domestic violence toward them are brought to justice . Surely no police officer should ever have to ask the sexual orientation or immigration status of a woman who lies bruised and battered at the scene of a crime . Yet , the House bill drew those lines .
