So , I ' ve got a problem in general with this narrative , and those of you that have been with us for a while understand this . LeBron plays for this team . And he ' s the leader of this team . And he desperately wants to bring a championship to this team . LeBron doesn ' t run this organization . LeBron is about this organization , and he is of this organization , and he ' s of our community . But this narrative that somehow we ' re taking direction from him , it ' s just not fair . It ' s not fair to him in particular . But frankly , it ' s kind of not fair to me and our group anymore .
