That ' s what I thought growing up in Washington , DC in a nonviolent family of Harvard graduates . I thought I couldn ' t possibly be stupid enough to let a man beat me , until my husband , also an Ivy League graduate , choked me five days before our wedding . During our marriage he held a gun to my head , pushed me downstairs , routinely called me " retard , " and repeatedly threatened to kill our dog . Abuse can happen to anyone . Although the police had evidence , my husband was not arrested or charged at the time I had no idea that physical abuse was a crime , and I would have protested that I was a strong , smart woman in love with a troubled man , but not a battered wife .
