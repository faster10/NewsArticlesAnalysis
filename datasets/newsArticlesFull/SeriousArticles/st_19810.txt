The major issue with Flint River water , it turns out , is that it is corrosive , especially to old piping systems , to the point that lead was leaching into Flint ' s water supply from April 2014 to October 2015 , when the city finally reconnected to Detroit water after the revelations about lead levels came to light . The long term damage done to the health of residents , especially to the brains and crucial development of children , is painfully incalculable and it will take many years before we fully know the impact . What we do know is that at several points during 2014 and 2015 , concerns were raised about the quality of the water , and because of Flint ' s status as a town in emergency receivership of the state , because of mistakes and or neglect by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency , and because of a seeming lack of urgency from the governor ' s office or Flint ' s succession of governor appointed emergency managers , lead poisoned water continued to flow from Flint ' s taps for more than a year . To put it simply , figuring out the problem of Flint ' s water was not a priority for the governments responsible for protecting Flint ' s people .
