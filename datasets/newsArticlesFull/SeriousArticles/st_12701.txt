In fact , the primary engagements of PM Modi in Lahore were necessarily of private nature participation in the birthday party of PM Nawaz Sharif and the wedding ceremony of his grand daughter . Again , the question is whether a democratic head of government is justified in spending the tax payers money on such chit chats and personal get togethers ? Why have the people at the helm in a democratic country like Pakistan become quite habitual of running the affairs of state in a monarchical fashion ? Why were a large number of passengers made to suffer by not allowing domestic and international flights to land at or take off from Lahore international airport during PM Modi s stay in the city ? What personal relations do subsist between the PM s of two countries ? Can two prime ministers really promote mutual personal relations while both countries are at logger heads with each and consider each other their arch foe ?
