The Republicans have their own " red wall , " and it actually includes more states : 21 plus a major chunk of Nebraska . They are the GOP bulwark , voting consistently for the Republican presidential nominee in each of the past four presidential elections . But they tend to have much smaller populations than the Democratic states so that they account for only 179 electoral votes 91 shy of 270 , leaving a huge hill to climb . John McCain a valiant candidate in 2008 won the red wall but nothing else .
