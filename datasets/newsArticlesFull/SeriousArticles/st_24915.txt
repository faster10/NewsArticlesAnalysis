As you can see in the video , Love ' s very comfortable attacking from the left block , but no matter where he is , the goal is to get to that right hook . All of his moves typically end up as an attempt to create separation with the defender to get that right hook off . If defenders try to take away an easy entry pass by fronting or orbiting him down low , he ' s an expert at giving a quick shove before the pass is delivered to get the space for a quick shot . And the Cavs seem more willing to take the time this season to get the pick and roll switch and be patient enough to let Love work against the smaller defender .
