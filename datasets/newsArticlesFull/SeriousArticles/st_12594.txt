This lavish English Cotswold style estate nestled amid the verdant Green Mountains was once the home of Allen Miller Fletcher , who , among other accomplishments , served as governor of Vermont from 1912 to 1915 .

Guests who check in here will see many of the property ' s other authentic design features , from the wallpaper in the staircase that dates back to 1905 to the gneiss stone that was quarried onsite to construct the exterior .
