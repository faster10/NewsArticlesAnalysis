The next president of the United States shouldn t engage in earning votes on such lazy and populist thinking . But what s more alarming , in my opinion , is that Bernie Sanders says these kinds of things because he simply doesn t seem to understand the financial system or economics all that well . And that makes an extremist that much more dangerous . In a lot of ways , he s perfectly juxtaposed in these discussions as the Democratic version of Rand Paul . And while the commentary often sounds good in theory , it s often based on a total lack of understanding about very important topics .
