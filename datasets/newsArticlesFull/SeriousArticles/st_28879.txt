" There are more Italians speaking Italian every day right across the Atlantic , " I said . " You could board a plane or hop a ship today and travel to your home country and hear your people ' s language reverberating off Italian walls . We , Native Americans , don ' t share in that luxury . This is it . This is our home country . Our languages are invariably on the brink of extinction , especially since we are 1 of the population . So when a Native American language dies , it ' s forever gone . "
