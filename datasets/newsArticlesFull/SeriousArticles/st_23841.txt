The Bulls and Trail Blazers claim the only two game schedules for the coming week , and thus both net 1 ratings in the process . As if the Warriors needed help , they face three generous space and pace foes , while the Spurs claim four favorable pace and scoring matchups , with three coming at home . Other than fading assets on the Bulls and Blazers , the Nets and Lakers both face unfavorable road heavy schedules . For those chasing extra games at the end of the week in head to head formats , we find the Lakers , Nets and Raptors as the only teams that play on both Saturday and Sunday . In leagues that limit weekly transactions , identifying teams with busy weekends is a prudent angle to maximize results . You ' ll notice the NBA doesn ' t play on Thanksgiving , but full slates on either side of the holiday more than make up for any scheduling losses from Thursday .
