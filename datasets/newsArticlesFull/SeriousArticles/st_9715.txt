Months ago , I requested a classified briefing to learn about how the administration planned to screen potential refugees for admittance into our nation . The results of that briefing , held yesterday , weren t encouraging , but it gets worse . FBI Director James Comey openly told the Senate that screening Syrian refugees is very difficult and admitted that there are gaps in the system we have today . That is unacceptable . Even one gap in the system could lead to thousands of American deaths .
