Forsberg : With Turner handling the ball at times for Boston , we might just see the old Simeon St . Joseph matchup a bit . Rose will be in the spotlight a lot from this vantage point , especially when he ' s matched up with Thomas . With Marcus Smart out with a knee injury ( some are worried about his Rose like propensity for injuries early in his NBA career ) , Thomas has operated as a starter much of this season and is maybe Boston ' s best shot for an All Star . With Rose on the other side and a national stage , Thomas should have a little extra intensity for Wednesday ' s game .
