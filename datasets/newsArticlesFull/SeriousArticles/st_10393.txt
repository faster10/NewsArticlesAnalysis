Wilson s favorite target during this madness has been veteran wide receiver Doug Baldwin , who has gone from steady possession guy to potential All Pro . The 27 year old Baldwin , undrafted out of Stanford four years ago , is tied for the NFL lead with 14 touchdown catches . He is flanked on the perimeter by the versatile rookie Tyler Lockett , a diminutive dart who earned Pro Bowl honors as a return specialist . Lockett set a franchise rookie record for most all purpose yards at 1 , 915 ( 852 on kickoff returns , 664 receiving , 379 on punt returns and 20 on rushes from scrimmage ) to go along with eight total touchdowns .
