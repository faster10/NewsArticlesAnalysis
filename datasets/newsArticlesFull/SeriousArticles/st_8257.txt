Now , to some people , pop is a dirty word , or only a " guilty pleasure . " But I f king love pop music . I always have , and I will ' til the day I die , and I want to make pop records . But I love bringing rock ' s balls and irreverence to my music as much as I can . I once said that I wanted to make " c k pop . " And there are moments of that on the record , but there are also the quintessential Ke ha moments like " Come On " rap talking , s t talking and there are also moments that are unexpected , stripped down and just me . As far as the people I collaborated with , I just wanted to take all my idols and make a record with them .
