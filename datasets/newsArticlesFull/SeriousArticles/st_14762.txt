There has been a change of command in Saudi Arabia and Iran . The young Mohammad bin Salman with all his exposure to western economics has so far the same fear as his elders , i . e . of Iran forming a Persian empire . The latest series of executions , including that of Iranian scholar Nimr al Nimr , are not indicators of much difference in the style of leadership . Similarly , though Rouhani has put Iran on the path of openness , he is still a messenger of Ayatollah Khamenei . Thus , their philosophies are very much the traditional mode of fighting proxy wars and supporting opposing sides to establish their regional supremacy . The flaw of being a franchisee is that the local context is compromised . In any case , what has been successful in the past or anywhere else in the world may not be successful in the future or in all countries . Americans have learned that religion for or against is the most emotional way of manipulating public support . This has been followed by Saudi Arabia and Iran , which have exploited sectarian feelings to create public sentiment in their favour .
