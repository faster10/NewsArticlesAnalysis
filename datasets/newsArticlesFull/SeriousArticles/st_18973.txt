If a legally binding outcome is being contemplated , developing countries like India must be very careful in assessing its implications for the existing UNFCCC . If a new treaty is being envisaged , will it supplant or supercede the UNFCCC ? Will the new legal template invalidate the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC , in particular , the principle of differentiation between developed and developing countries ? Will the template continue to accord equal priority to adaptation , as to mitigation ? Will the review process also look at performance with respect to provision of finance and technology to developing countries ? These are all critical questions from the standpoint of India and other developing countries .
