Last year , when the Arizona Cardinals were eliminated by the Carolina Panthers , they chose to release their wide receiver acquisition from that year , Ted Ginn Jr . The quick receiver had left the Panthers for the big money contract in Arizona and flopped , catching 14 receptions for 190 yards in the season . It looked like a huge bust , but then Carolina brought him back . This season , he led the Panthers with 44 receptions for 739 yards , which may not be No . 1 receiver numbers , but was a huge improvement . However , he also caught 10 touchdown passes . Despite his failure in Arizona , Ginn said there are no hard feelings . This is the NFL , Ginn said . I m just going out and playing football . The next guy is the ? Arizona Cardinals . Hey , what happened to me a year ago is nothing to do with Sunday .
