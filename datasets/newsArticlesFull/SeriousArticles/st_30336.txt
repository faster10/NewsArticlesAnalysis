So U . S . companies that depend on selling products overseas struggle to grow their profits and ultimately ? if hurt badly ? start laying people off . In Illinois , the impact has been clear . Caterpillar sells bulldozers and other equipment that have been greatly in demand in China and other countries in previous years . Now that China is slowing , and other countries are having trouble selling to China , Caterpillar ' s profits have been hit hard . The company has been laying off thousands of people , as have other companies that sell into China and other emerging markets that depend on China ' s purchases . When layoffs happen , of course , people are less able to buy what the economy needs ? everything from sweaters and groceries to trips and restaurant meals . So the pain for businesses can snowball into more layoffs and a slower economy
