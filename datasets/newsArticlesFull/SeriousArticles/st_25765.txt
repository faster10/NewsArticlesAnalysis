Look , you got not only Democrats , not only Republicans not only Independents , You ve got people all over this country who are struggling economically . Yes , thank you President Obama , we re much better of today than we were 7 years ago . But that doesn t negate the reality . Media doesn t like to discuss this but the middle class continues to disappear . Forty seven million people living in poverty , 29 million people having no health insurance . And yet while the average person works longer hours for low wages , almost all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 . How do you think the average Republican , Independent or Democrat feels about that ? That s my message .
