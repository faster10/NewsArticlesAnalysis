There were so many moments to choose from had the Packers lost but they didn ' t , so the call is obvious . With six seconds left in the game , Green Bay tried one of those ridiculous throw it short then lateral it until the ball is fumbled or someone is tackled plays . Of course , we all know what happened . James Jones caught a 19 yard pass , tossed to Richard Rodgers who then threw it back to Aaron Rodgers . Devin Taylor , who earlier had a pair of sacks , tackled the quarterback but was called for a face mask , giving the Packers one untimed play , which proved to be very fortuitous for Green Bay .
