Another issue for Stop the War has been bubbling away for over a month . Syrian groups in Britain have claimed that they have been sidelined and ignored by Stop the War . On 2 November , the group organised a meeting in parliament in opposition to airstrikes , chaired by Diane Abbott : the panel included Murray , Caroline Lucas and MPs from the Labour party , the Conservatives and the SNP . As evidenced by videos of what happened , towards the end of the meeting , a kerfuffle erupted when Syrian people who had turned up claimed they were being denied the right to speak . They were supported by the dependably doughty campaigner Peter Tatchell ? a long standing opponent of Stop the War , Murray says ? who has since claimed that Syrian victims of Assad s brutalities turned up but were not allowed to speak , and that Stop the War stewards tried to throw them out .
