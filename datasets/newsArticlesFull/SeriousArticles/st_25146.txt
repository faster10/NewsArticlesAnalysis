If you have time and the funds , why not sign up for a brief language course in your hometown ? If you ' re on a budget , your local library likely has phrasebooks or dictionaries you can borrow . Does a restaurant in your area serve food from your destination country ? Visit before you go and ask the staff to help you with a few words . Smart travelers know that it ' s the small things that mean the world to those you ' ll meet . Show respect by speaking their language even if just a little and you ' ll get respect in return .
