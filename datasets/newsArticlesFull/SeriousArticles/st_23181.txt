( PT ) : Look at what ' s happening here in the Kingdom : Universities , schools , hospitals , roads , construction boom , social development , political development , everything . It ' s like a beehive of activity . Hopefully in the final analysis , all these bees that are coming together will make us a lot of honey . It ' s very easy to sit back and be critical when so much is going on in the development factor . But it is more difficult for that critical outlook to be positively critical . Distinguish between what is negative and what is positive . All countries commit mistakes all peoples have different views from each other . I think what has been important about the Kingdom is that the people have come around to embrace change in the Kingdom . And it is a change that is driven vertically by the leadership , but also horizontally by the vast population of the Kingdom .
