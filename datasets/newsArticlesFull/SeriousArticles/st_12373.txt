" We put our hard hats on tonight , " said Shaun Livingston , who scored 13 off the bench . " We were just assertive on the defensive end , and we were playing to our strengths , switching and then ball pressure . Draymond was excellent tonight taking the challenge on Aldridge . They rely on him a lot to get them going . Andre ( Iguodala ) and Klay ( Thompson ) on Kawhi Leonard . It ' s just taking on the individual challenge but also communicating on all the back cuts and paying attention to all the little details . "
