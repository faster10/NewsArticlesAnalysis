Nearly half of Palmer ' s passes were thrown over the middle , with the vast majority of those throws ( 186 of 245 , per PFF ) being attempted between 0 and 19 yards down the field . That ' s the most targeted range for most NFL quarterbacks , and Palmer is no different . What ' s different is Palmer ' s production on those passes . Four of his nine picks on throws to the middle of the field were on deep balls , and so were three of his touchdowns . That means that on throws within 20 yards of the line of scrimmage , Palmer posted a 78 . 4 percent completion rate while throwing for 9 . 66 yards per attempt and seeing his throws turn into touchdowns 7 . 0 percent of the time and interceptions only 2 . 3 percent of the time . In short , he was ridiculous .
