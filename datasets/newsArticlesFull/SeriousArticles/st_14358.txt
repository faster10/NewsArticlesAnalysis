TS : I think the Cocoon frees virtuality from the computer . I ' ve been dealing with this concept for probably ten years , because it was a big theme in architecture in the 90s . Everyone was afraid that architecture would disappear and be completely replaced by virtuality . I think it ' s got such amazing potential to make the world so much more exciting . When we think about our childhoods or watching " Star Trek " seeing people being beamed there ' s so much cool stuff and ideas . . . the future is now .
