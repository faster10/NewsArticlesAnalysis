" It ' s ' CSI ' they pay me a lot of money , and I don ' t have to work very hard anymore . I ' ve got it all figured out . And I just realized , God , as an artist , I ' m going to atrophy . You do anything for nine years , it becomes somewhat rote . I didn ' t want to be on the show because they were paying me money and I liked the money . I didn ' t want to be on the show because it saved me from having to go look for other jobs . Just didn ' t want it . It was too safe for me at this point . So I needed to try and break that , and the way to do that , for me , is the theater . "
