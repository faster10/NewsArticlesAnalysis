Conservative women didn t fall for the lies of the feminist movement and they don t need self proclaimed leaders telling them who they should and shouldn t support . I have always said a Renaissance Woman can think for herself , she doesn t need a spokesman and she is not predictable . Because that leads to control . She is a leader not a follower , a winner not a whiner and a victor not a victim . This is the type of woman who is rising up and telling the fearful men to step aside . As Lee Iacocca once said , Lead , follow , or get out of the way .
