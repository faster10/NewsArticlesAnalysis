The US had wanted Iran to abandon its plans to develop nukes . In July 2015 , Iran and six major world powers reached a nuclear deal after more than a decade of negotiations . The world hailed the nuclear deal , President Barack Obama termed the agreement as a major step towards a more hopeful world , Iran s president , Hassan Rouhani , said it was a historic deal and the European Union called it a sign of hope for the entire world , while Israel called it a historic surrender . With the lifting of sanctions on Iran , the Middle East will be transformed . Iran will get rid of its isolation , the US and the west will have Iran s full cooperation against Islamic State ( IS ) , as Iran is already helping Iraq and Syria in their fight against IS militants . Iran can help reduce the west s tensions with Syria and improve the situation in Yemen .
