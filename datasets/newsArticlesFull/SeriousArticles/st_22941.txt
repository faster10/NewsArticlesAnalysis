An interior decorator ' s dream , and a regular resource for the likes of Top Design alum Eddie Ross , Atlanta ' s monthly 3 , 300 booth Scott Antique Markets provides consistent conditions ( two climate controlled exhibition centers with shuttle bus transportation ) , and predictable pricing ( not quite garage sale cheap , but less expensive than some more famous markets ) . You ' re almost guaranteed to find heirloom quality oil paintings , French armoires , and upholstered furniture in the mix . Note : this is not the place to come for makeover projects most everything for sale is already rehabbed and ready to go .
