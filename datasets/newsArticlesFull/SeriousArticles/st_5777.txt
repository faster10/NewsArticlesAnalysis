But letting handset makers and , especially , carriers make the Android experience worse is a bad move , and one the hurts Google ' s customers . And , contrary to what the company claims , it wouldn ' t have to betray any principles of open source to fix this . Google can go ahead and give away its source under the Apache License , and let people run wild with it . But it shouldn ' t give away the " Android " brand to any company that cripples the product . Google is spending lots of money hyping that brand , and it is staking its reputation on it . These companies are taking full advantage of that .
