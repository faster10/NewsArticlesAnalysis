Black teenagers are not just more likely to be arrested , they also are more likely to be locked up , even when convicted of the same crimes as others . Racial disparities are especially pronounced when it comes to punishment for relatively minor offenses , such as drug possession . For example , black juveniles are nearly twice as likely as their white peers to be locked up for a drug offense . As a result of mandatory sentencing laws , courts don ' t have much discretion when it comes to sentencing people convicted of serious violent crimes , which makes sentencing less racially biased in these instances .
