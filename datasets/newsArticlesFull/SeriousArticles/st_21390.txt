A swaggering statement of purpose for post ? Def Jam Rihanna , Consideration finds Rihanna in full bad gal RiRi mode . Is it a romantic breakup , as the folks over at Genius suspect , or is it about Rihanna s struggles to take control of her own career ? It could be either or both , but I suspect it s principally the latter . The song opens with a Peter Pan metaphor about being held back from maturing . I come fluttering in from Neverland , she sings , Why will you never let me grow ? ( Is that Neverland reference a deliberate echo of Michael Jackson s arrested development ? ) But in each chorus she comes out on top , insisting , I do things my own way , darling .
