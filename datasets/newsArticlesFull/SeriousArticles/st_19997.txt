More importantly , though , I find the grayness of espionage compelling . In crime fiction , the antagonist is usually the " bad guy " in the literal sense . In espionage , these labels are harder to affix , at least in my mind . If the antagonist is , say , a spy for China , he ' s just someone doing what he can to advance his own country ' s cause . The protagonist in a spy novel is doing the same thing . They are or can be equals , even when they commit morally heinous acts , and I love that moral quandary . It also explains why , thus far , I haven ' t been writing terrorist antagonists they ' re much harder to empathize with .
