As the title suggests , ANTI is not your typical Rihanna album . There are no bangers courtesy of pop super producer Dr Luke or Norwegian production duo Stargate , who had hands in four of the Barbadian star s No . 1 songs , Rude Boy , Only Girl ( In The World ) , What s My Name ? and S M . Instead , she favors minimalist , shadowy R B styles throughout ? ? especially in the album s second half , where songs are stripped all the way back to just her vocals and atmospherics . This means tracks occasionally feel so loose they re on the brink of dissolving entirely ( Desperado , Never Ending ) , but there s a compelling realness to that listening experience coming from one of the world s biggest pop stars .
