We begin with the FBI ' s intense search for answers in that terror attack . The head of the agency says the killers were radicalized before they even met . Now the feds trying to unlock the secrets on their phones and computers . ABC ' s Matt Gutman starts us off in San Bernardino , good morning , Matt . Reporter : Federal authorities , George , are telling us that the terror couple had tashfeen malik and Syed farook not only tried to destroy their data but encrypted some , as well . No use that the use of encryption is part of terrorist trade craft . Reporter : Telling ABC news they were only to crack some of their phones , computers and thumb drives . What did they salvage ? Pictures of farook ' s phone of this San Bernardino high school with its 2500 students . Was it a target ? We ' re working very hard to understand did they have other plans ? Reporter : What is clear investigators say plans were laid years before . Farook may have been radicalized in 2012 . And by late 2013 , farook and ma malik were exchanging their visions online . Talking about jihad and martyrdom before they were engaged and married . Reporter : Investigators checking whether they were a match made specifically for terror . At least in this one instance the Jihadi websites and chat rooms prove to be a match making service . The FBI will now be looking to see if this pattern occurred elsewhere . Reporter : And also looking to see whether malik was brought into the country on that fiancee Visa to set up the sleeper cell striking mayhem when it activated . Of course , questions swirling about how tashfeen malik managed to get into the U . S . On that fiancee Visa . If she had been fantasizing online about terrorism and jihad for at least a couple of years , authorities also investigating whether or not other terrorist matchmakers managed to infiltrate their people into the country using that Visa , as well . Robin . Thank you , Matt . The investigation continues .
