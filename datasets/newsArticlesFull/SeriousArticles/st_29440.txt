Were we going to react to that ? Of course not . We ' re not going to react to anything that ' s part of the traditional part of hard , aggressive racing . This is , there is going to be contact . I always expect that . I don ' t expect people to turn people around . That ' s not what we mean when we say contact . But sometimes it happens . . . . Lots of things can happen when there ' s really hard racing and contact going on and NASCAR will officiate the way we have always done that . That ' s why there ' s been zero , I want to say that , zero drivers walk in and say , can you ask , can we talk about where the line is . They know exactly where the line is . "
