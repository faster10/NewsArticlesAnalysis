I have no fond childhood memories of running off to see the groundhog emerge from his burrow . My family never gathered for groundhog diners , nor did my mom bake special groundhog cookies . What kind of a real holiday is it anyway we don ' t even get a day off from work or school ? The notion that a bunch of people would stand outside in the cold during the early morning hours to watch a groundhog predict the weather seems a little bizarre if not ludicrous . If intelligent and well trained meteorologists struggle with predicting something as uncertain as the weather , what makes us think that a giant squirrel can do better ?
