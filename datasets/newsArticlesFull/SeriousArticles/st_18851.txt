Trohman : Guys are notoriously bad at emoting and communicating , and I think we had to learn how to do that . But also taking that time apart to be with our families , do other projects , work with different people and experience different things allowed us to come back and realize that maybe we did this thing not so well maybe we should have talked more maybe we shouldn ' t have been so passive aggressive maybe this guy should have voiced his opinion more . I think we are better at that , and it has been very healthy for the band .
