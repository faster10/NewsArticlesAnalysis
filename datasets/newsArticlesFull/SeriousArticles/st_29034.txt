Politically , these groups may not see eye to eye and of course there remain deep ethno sectarian tensions in Iraq and beyond , but regardless of these differences they all view ISIS as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated . To be sure , the Sunni tribesmen involved in this campaign are more anti ISIS than they are pro government , but that they can work with the pro government Shia militias is both good news and good progress for a country believed to be ripping itself apart along ethno sectarian lines .
