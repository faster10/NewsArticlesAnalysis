It ' s old news and a closed case as far as Piazza is concerned . He ' s in Cooperstown , deservedly so , and that ' s that . Where it creates a paradox for the Hall of Fame , and for the Baseball Writers Association of America , is with others marked by PED admissions and rumors . The circumstances for Barry Bonds ' and Roger Clemens ' use and alleged use of PEDs are different than that of Piazza . But it remains a valid question : If the Hall has accepted Piazza ( and surely others who have done PEDs ) , why would it keep the likes of Bonds and Clemens shut out ?
