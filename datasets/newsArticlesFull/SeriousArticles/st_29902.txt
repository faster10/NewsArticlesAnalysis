You re starting to see that more in TV than you are in film ? people who see that there is a market there and that people will come and look at films with people of different stripes and colors . That s what ultimately is going to move this in that direction . The profit motivation is always going to be the greatest . We re still in a capitalist society , and the dollar is going to push everything . If there s going to be change , that s where it s going to come from . The protests and outspokenness are important and can start the push . But ultimately it s when the bottom line is affected that you re going to see real change .
