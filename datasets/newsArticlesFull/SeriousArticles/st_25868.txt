So I was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel how much control do I have over my fate , the country , my community ? Do I really believe in a perfect future ? Some of us would like to think we ' re creating a better future , especially if we ' re in politics or public service . We ' re trying to take a bad situation and make it better . But how much better can we make it ? Are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it ' s going to come down and crush us again ? Do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that America is a noble experiment and we ' re still working on it to try and get it right ? Can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes ?
