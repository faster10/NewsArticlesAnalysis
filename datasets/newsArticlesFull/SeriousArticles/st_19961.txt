In a cavern , in a canyon , Excavating for a mine Dwelt a miner forty niner , And his daughter Clementine Light she was and like a fairy , And her shoes were number nine , Wearing boxes , without topses , Sandals were for Clementine . Drove she ducklings to the water Ev ' ry morning just at nine , Hit her foot against a splinter , Fell into the foaming brine . Ruby lips above the water , Blowing bubbles , soft and fine , But , alas , I was no swimmer , So I lost my Clementine . How I missed her ! How I missed her , How I missed my Clementine , But I kissed her little sister , I forgot my Clementine .
