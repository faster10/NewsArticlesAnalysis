Tuesday , Public Policy Polling released the results of a survey of North Carolina voters , summing them up this way : Trump s Islamophobia is a central feature of his appeal to his supporters . It found that Trump s support among the state s Republicans is as high as it s ever been , at 33 percent . Of those supporters , 67 percent want to create a national database of Muslims in America . Only 24 percent think Islam should even be legal in the United States . The poll also had good news for Cruz , finding him the candidate with the most momentum in the state . A majority of his supporters , like Trump s , want to shut down mosques and believe that thousands of Arabs in New Jersey cheered 9 11 . It should surprise no one that Cruz has hesitated to condemn Trump s immigration plan . Both men know what their voters believe , and why they believe it .
