" I believe our league is the greatest league that we have in the world . We have the greatest athletes and greatest fans and so on and so on , " James said . " So for the president of the United States to grace us on opening night in Chicago , I ' m just honored . Something I can tell my kids a long , long time from now . I ' ll actually be able to have the film showing them kids don ' t believe me sometimes I ' ll be able to show them the film that the president of the United States was at a ballgame I played in . That ' s pretty cool . "
