White people are products of their own whitewashed , sanitized environment . Black people have been systematically excluded from white neighborhoods . Black stories rarely surface in popular culture . The history of race in high school textbooks has been boiled down to a handful of bedtime stories about Jackie Robinson and Rosa Parks . Try to tap into the average white person ' s feelings on race and you won ' t necessarily find feelings of hate and antipathy . You just won ' t find much of anything , no fully formed or well considered thoughts about race of any kind . There ' s nothing really there . Even white people who want black friends don ' t know where to start .
