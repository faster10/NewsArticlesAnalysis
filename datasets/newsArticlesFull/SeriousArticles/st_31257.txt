It ' s hard to give a definitive answer now based on all the other dominoes that have to fall this weekend , but here goes nothing : First of all , I ' m just going to assume Alabama beats Florida because , well , does Florida even field an offense lately ? So let ' s say Clemson loses . That would leave two scenarios : One in which North Carolina and Stanford both win conference championships , and one in which only UNC does . In the first scenario , I ' d give the nod to Stanford . ? Its strength of schedule trumps UNC ' s , and the fact that it d be a conference champion in this scenario trumps Ohio State . In the second , I ' m picking the Tar Heels . Yes , I know two of their presumptive 12 wins came over FCS teams , but beating Clemson , who ' s been at the top of the rankings for weeks , has to count more than that , doesn ' t it ? And sorry , Ohio State . Not making the conference championship keeps you out of here in my book . Maybe I just want some new blood .
