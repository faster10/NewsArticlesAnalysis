Not every duty free item is a true bargain . Yngve Bia , president of the duty free research company Generation Research , says price differences depend on two things : geography and currency exchange rates . " Right now , Heathrow and Gatwick in London offer good deals , especially for liquor , because of the weak British pound , " he says . For example , a one liter bottle of Absolut vodka has a typical non duty free price of about 30 at retail U . S . shops . But travelers can buy it for just 15 ( 10 ) at duty free shops at London ' s Heathrow and Gatwick airports . That ' s a significant savings .
