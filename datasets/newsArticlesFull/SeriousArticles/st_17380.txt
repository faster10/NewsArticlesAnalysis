Vesely : I definitely have always liked to do things by myself , just because I like to be a part of it . The more I do , the more it ' s my music , personally . Of course , working with a producer is a necessary thing when you ' re making music , because they ' re trying to put your creative thoughts together , and make it as effective as possible in a song form . . . . Being able to do the three tracks on this new album on my own with my drummer Tom Breyfogle was a great experience because it was the first time that I ' d gotten to produce something except my first album " Awake , " but that was pretty much just acoustic guitar and vocals , so there ' s not much production going on , so to speak .
