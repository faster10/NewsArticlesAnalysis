One billionaire has already demonstrated how this works . In 2013 , Michael Bloomberg gave 50 million to the Sierra Club s remarkably successful Beyond Coal campaign . Beyond Coal doesn t invest in technologies to replace coal , or to capture emissions , or to make coal burn more clearly . Rather , it invests in public work ? showing up at hearings , filing lawsuits , pressuring utility commissions and state and local legislatures . Time and again , it makes the public case for ironing coal out of the electricity supply . Thanks in part to more stringent federal standards and the availability of cheap natural gas , Beyond Coal has had a remarkable amount of success . Bloomberg s 50 million investment in Beyond Coal has done much more to purge coal from the U . S . electrical system than a 50 million investment in wind research could have .
