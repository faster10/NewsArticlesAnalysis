Flint officials rejected an offer from Detroit to revert to the original water supply in January 2015 , despite a growing drumbeat of concerns . It was not until early 2015 that Flint sought an independent review of the water supply , due to concerns about high levels of trihalomethanes , a byproduct of disinfecting efforts . A research team led by Dr Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech conducted a study that found the Flint River water contained eight times the amount of chlorine as Lake Huron water and was highly corrosive . This caused pipe corrosion and leaching of dangerous levels of lead into the water supply . Lead is a potent neurotoxin that can cause developmental delays in children as well as a host of other effects , including mood disorders , memory impairment and miscarriages .
