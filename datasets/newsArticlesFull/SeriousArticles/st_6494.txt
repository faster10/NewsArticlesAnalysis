The scale of the problem is staggering in so many conflicts , sexual violence is adding to an already terrifying situation for children . Earlier this week , I spoke to a working group for the U . N . Security Council about the threat of sexual violence facing Syrian children , who have already been uprooted by a bloody two year old conflict . Save the Children spoke to girls from Mali who saw their friends raped and killed by armed men children in the Congo subjected to vicious sexual attacks in recent fighting around Goma and mothers in Colombia whose young children had been raped as the rule of law broke down around them . This problem is not isolated , something happening in just one corner of the world , but instead a troubling pattern that we have seen in too many places .
