The two countries are separated by huge gaps in political systems and cultural values , which can be a major cause of conflict . The two governments still deeply distrust each other . Since the Obama administration ' s implementation of its " strategic rebalancing " toward Asia in 2010 , the U . S . government has failed to convince China and many other countries in Asia that its purpose is not to counter China ' s growing power . America ' s deployment of more forces in the Asia Pacific region and beefing up its alliances with China ' s neighbors smack of a policy of encircling China . Of course containment will not work in this day and age , and Asian countries do not want to be drawn into a great power conflict .
