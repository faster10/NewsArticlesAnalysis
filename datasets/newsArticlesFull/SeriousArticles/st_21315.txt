A subtle cue of body language , the placing of objects within the frame , how the music moves the action along , all of these and more come alive when we ' re not tied to watching the actors speak . Hazanavicius has a deft hand at directing and a delightful sense of whimsey . The film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic Hollywood tradition , and both Dujardin and Bejo prove more than up for the task . A brief pantomime between Bejo and one of George ' s suit jackets is worth the price of admission alone and keep your eye on the dog !
