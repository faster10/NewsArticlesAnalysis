Of course , there s no doubt that the Perry Clinton friendship is mutually beneficial . The Perry association helps Clinton appear more appealing to young female voters , which is an important and increasingly influential demographic : A 2014 U . S . Census analysis of young adult presidential election voting habits found that since 1996 , women ages 18 to 29 have voted at higher rates than men . Plus , Perry posting support on her personal Twitter account ( or playfully commandeering Clinton s Instagram account ) feels far more casual and genuine than if Hillary herself was trying to court the youth vote on her own . And for Perry , her Clinton friendship draws attention away from the ongoing ( and increasingly contentious ) fight over her buying a convent in Los Angeles , and keeps her positively in the public eye even though her touring cycle is over . ( Which helps , especially because she has a new live DVD looming , not to mention an app on the way . )
