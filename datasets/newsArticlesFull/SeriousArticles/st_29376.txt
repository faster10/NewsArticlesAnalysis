Wide reciever DeAndre Hopkins will be a key to victory against the Chiefs . Hopkins has endured a different kind of adversity this season . So it was good to get back out there . Houston has a middle of the pack 25 takeaways this season , but they do rank tied for 10th in differential at 5 . This may seem important in every game , but in a game in which both teams have extremely similar playing styles , the team that makes the fewest mistakes will win . Blue eclipsed 100 yards last week against a tough Jaguars defense . Smith also had 61 yards on the ground .
