But many Lebanese people are not yet willing to give up . In her emotional discourse , Ms . Zeinab Al Saffar , a prominent socio political talk show anchor and producer ( Al Mayadeen TV ) , declared one day after the carnage : I think that after what we ve seen and witnessed yesterday , apart from the huge losses of our dear ones and the pain of the injured and all the families , especially the mothers , our people are now more deeply rooted in their national resistance they are standing firm in face of any schemes that target the resistance ! It is now clear that defending our land and people , even with our own bodies and our own children if necessary , is something that is inculcated in our blood since our inception . Believe me : we are strong ! And we will remain steadfast and strong !
