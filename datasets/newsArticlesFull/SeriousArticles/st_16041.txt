' It ' s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training , ' he said . ' At one point , it would take three buses and one train . But it ' s worked out well . I ' ve always been pushed hard to succeed . To get those buses , it was nothing . ' As soon as he was able , he bought his mother a house . ' She ' s my hero , ' said Delph . ' We didn ' t have a car , so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me . She was just a great Mum and a great role model . '
