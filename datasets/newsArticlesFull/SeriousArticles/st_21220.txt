French officials , however , have declined to positively identify Abaaoud as killed during the raid . Paris prosecutor Fran ? ois Molins said the bodies are still in the process of being identified . Explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition fired reduced the apartment building to near rubble . Other outlets , like the New York Times , have held off in reporting the Abaaoud s death . When the raid was all over , the police had swept eight people into custody and found at least two mangled bodies . Mr Abaaoud had not been taken alive , the authorities said ? and it was not clear whether one of the bodies was his , the Times writes .
