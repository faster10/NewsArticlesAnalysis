Legwold : In looking at all of the times the Broncos have faced Brady since his first year as a starter in 2001 , there have been only two games in 14 overall when the Broncos have sacked Brady at least once and intercepted him in the same game . One of those was in 2001 and the other was in 2014 , when Brady still finished with four touchdowns . And the Broncos best chance to move on will require Denver s marquee players on defense Von Miller , DeMarcus Ware , Chris Harris Jr . and Talib to at least slow Brady and the Patriots ' offense down some . The Broncos fully expect to get the same kind of pace and play calls from the Patriots as the Chiefs got 14 consecutive pass plays to open the game by New England and just 14 rushing attempts overall , with six of those from Brady . So , if the Broncos become yet another team that can t pressure Brady or at least get him off schedule and make him reset from time to time , there isn t much chance the Broncos will move on . But if their defense does what it has done for much of the season only Ben Roethlisberger topped 300 yards passing against the Broncos the Broncos will earn the franchise s eighth Super Bowl trip .
