Demos : I think that s an example of what is different for the viewer than for the jury . As a viewer , you have a national expert on interrogation techniques and the psychology of confessions about what to look for and how to identify problems , and that helps you look at the footage . An expert like that would have been critical at Brendan s trial . If his court appointed attorneys had called an expert like that to help the jury understand because it s counterintuitive that people falsely confess , and yet we know that happens . Jurors are not always equipped . They press play , and four hours later their eyes have glazed over . It seems as if this person has said they did it , and they need some help understanding what they re seeing .
