Saudi Iranian relations are not currently in a phase of accord and reconciliation . Rather , escalation reigns supreme in all regional conflicts where both countries are involved .

Others believe one of the key reasons Riyadh insists on maintaining the same level of production is actually to undermine Iran and Russia economically , to prevent them from having a free hand in Syria .
