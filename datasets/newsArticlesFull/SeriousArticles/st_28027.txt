Yet of all the Hanukkahs of years past , the most memorable for me was spent in Israel with my children at the home of dear friends . As we walked past houses nearby , we saw the candles lit in the windows and everyone gathering with their own families . When we got to our friends , we lit the candles on several menorahs and had a festive meal . There were no latkes that night , only delicious Moroccan stuffed vegetables and sufganiyot , Israeli doughnuts stuffed with jam , much more popular than pancakes in the holy land . Unlike in America where there are too many presents , the highlight of this evening was being together with friends and family .
