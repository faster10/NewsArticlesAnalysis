In early March some of the guys went to the museum of Fine Arts for a fund raiser and got to hang with President Barack Obama . Everyone was a little bit in awe . The President turns to Ray , points at Rondo , and says , Hey , Ray , why don t you teach this kid how to shoot ? Everyone starts laughing . KG told me he saw the look on Rondo s face and the kid was devastated , embarrassed . Dissed by the President , even though I m sure Obama didn t mean any harm . Rondo smiled and went along with all of it , but KG told me he could see it in his eyes . It bothered Rondo . It killed him . The next day Rondo shot the ball horribly . He stopped taking shots after that . He s so sensitive . I think it was a real jolt to hear the outside perception of a basketball fan who happens to be the President of the United States . It messed with his mind . I m sure of it .
