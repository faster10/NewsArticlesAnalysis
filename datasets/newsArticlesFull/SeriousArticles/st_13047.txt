In case this is not obvious to those camping out near Wall Street and in various other cities around the country , consider the following : In about 13 months , all 435 members of the House of Representatives must stand for election . In addition , 33 Senate seats and residency at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will be up for grabs . And this is just at the federal level . So if the " Occupy Wall Street " crowd wants to peacefully overthrow the government , there is no need to gather in a public square . The demonstrators can work for a candidate or run themselves .
