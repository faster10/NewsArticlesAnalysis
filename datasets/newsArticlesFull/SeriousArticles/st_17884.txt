It ' s not merely the wins and losses with James . He is also the definitive leader of any team he plays on . His presence alone changes the culture . When his relationships with both Erik Spoelstra and David Blatt were under fire , his teams suffered . When those relationships improved e . g . the second half of the season the result was sustained playoff success . The same can be said about 2015 : The Cavs enter year two under Blatt , and the second year of their Big Three . How James handles Blatt and how he handles his massive leadership responsibility is only trumped by the culture change . The Cavaliers have never won a world championship . Maybe they do this year and maybe they don ' t , but having LeBron as the definitive face of the organization might be equally important .
