With the Coalition having just re approved Adani ' s mine and the fossil fuel industry puffing up its meagre economic importance , the reality is that demand for coal is dropping like a stone . Galilee coal is primarily destined for China and India yet China has capped its emissions and coal consumption and India ' s own energy minister says that India will stop importing coal within 2 3 years . It ' s no surprise then that , years into this ludicrous project , Adani has failed to raise the capital needed to get it off the ground , nor that fourteen major international banks have ruled out involvement in the Galilee . This is the inevitable fate of all new fossil fuel projects .
