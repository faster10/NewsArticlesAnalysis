2 . ' Heaven ' s Gate ' ( Michael Cimino , 1980 ) A disastrous Western that nearly brought down United Artists , the studio founded by Charlie Chaplin . Given free rein , Cimino overspent massively and the original budget of 8 million ballooned to a whopping 36 million . The historical drama eventually clocked in at three and a half hours . It was slammed by critics and bombed at the box office , paving the way for the sale of United Artists to MGM . Shaken by the extent of the failure , which is still considered one of the biggest in Hollywood history , studios clamped down on the freewheeling excesses of the 1970s and a new , more conservative era was born .
