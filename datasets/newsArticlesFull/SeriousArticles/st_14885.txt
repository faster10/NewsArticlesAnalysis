Law enforcement sources told Fox News that investigators believe the couple ' s death prevented a second attack Wednesday , though they have not established what the target would have been . They point not only to the sheer amount of weaponry left unused , but also to the fact that the couple ' s rented SUV was due to be returned Thursday . Authorities believe it to be unlikely that the couple would have risked the SUV and any unused munitions being found if the vehicle was kept longer than its rental period . ?
