Bloomberg did what every other politician does : balance public health and safety with realpolitik . Consider one of the judge ' s major arguments : balancing public health and economic considerations is " impermissible . " This judicial reasoning makes no sense . If policy makers could not balance economic consequences , virtually every law in America would be flawed . There is another huge problem with this argument . It assumes that unless public health does everything , it can do nothing . The whole art of politics is compromise . The mayor gets a lot of what he seeks to fight obesity , but not everything .
