At my first M and M as a medical student , I heard the story of a patient who had received antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection . Two weeks later she developed joint pain and blisters on her chest and arms , a condition known as Stevens Johnson syndrome , which can be caused by an allergic reaction to antibiotics . She ended up with sepsis , a body wide infection , and spent two weeks in intensive care . She , too , survived , but most stunning was the doctor ' s admission that her original ailment had been a mild viral illness she hadn ' t even needed the antibiotics that led to such a terrible reaction . Years later , that case still makes me think harder about every test I order and every medication I prescribe .
