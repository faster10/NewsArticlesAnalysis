Denver didn ' t end up needing or getting much at all out of Manning , who led an 11 play , 83 yard drive on the Broncos ' first possession , but had just one drive longer than seven plays the rest of the game . Manning finished the game 17 of 32 passing for 176 yards and two scores the second on a 16 yard drive set up by a Von Miller interception but because of players like Miller , who also had 2 . 5 sacks , and DeMarcus Ware , who terrorized Brady all afternoon , Manning ' s plodding effort was just barely enough .
