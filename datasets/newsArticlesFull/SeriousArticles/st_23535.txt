In the many conversations I have had over the last year about the issue of anti Muslim bigotry , I ' ve noticed that many people perceive it as a little misunderstanding . If people had better data and information about Islam and Muslims , there wouldn ' t be so much anger and hate directed at Muslims in America . Certainly an absence of knowledge and understanding about Islam and Muslims is a problem in America a big one . But the reality is that correcting these misunderstandings with some facts and evidence has not been shown to actually work in helping to improve the perception of American Muslims .
