JR : I don ' t think honestly that the Republican Party is listening to them . The Republican Party has to make peace with Latinos , otherwise they ' re going to keep on losing election after election after election . Latinos will become the majority in this country in less than 100 years . We won ' t be here to see it , but without the Hispanic vote , no one can make it to the White House . If Republicans don ' t make peace with Latinos , Texas is going to become a blue state and Republicans are going to keep on losing elections . They don ' t get the fact that immigration is the most important symbolic issue for Latinos . Other issues are more important jobs , education , health care , but immigration is the most important issue . If Republicans don ' t get it , they are going to keep on losing the Hispanic vote .
