At the same time , ban the box doesn t work in the other direction either , for those who want to break the stigma of incarceration . The formerly incarcerated shouldn t have to make invisible a part of their life once they ve done their time to have access to employment . Having to do so is not unlike being asked to hide one s religion for the right to work ? it s insulting to tell them to be in the closet about their conviction yet that is what ban the box demands . It s also impractical : how is a former inmate supposed to explain a 10 year gap on a resume ?
