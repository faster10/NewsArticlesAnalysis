New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie in a brief interview on Sunday with MSNBC observed , I am not one of these guys that s going to sit around and complain about this , ok ? If you can t take it on the stage , no matter whether it s fair or unfair ? and I thought there was a lot of unfair stuff the other night ? but if you can t take it , then how are you going to take running against Hillary Clinton and how are you going to take negotiating for America around the world ? This morning on Fox and Friends he reiterated that message ? in essence , telling his competitors to stop complaining . That is exactly right .
