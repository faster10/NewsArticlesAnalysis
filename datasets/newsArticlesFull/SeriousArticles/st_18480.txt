" Thousands of towns and villages have simply been washed away , " Ban said , speaking alongside Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari . " Roads , buildings , bridges , crops millions of livelihoods have been lost . People are marooned on tiny islands with the flood waters all around them . They are drinking dirty water . They are living in the mud and ruins of their lives . Many have lost family and friends . Many more are afraid their children and loved ones will not survive in these conditions . "
