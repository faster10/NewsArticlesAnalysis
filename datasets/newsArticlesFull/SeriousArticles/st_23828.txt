I once heard an ESPN caller describe Hewitt as " chronically red faced " . This is the short version of a kind of summary to which Hewitt has long been subject . His resilience is celebrated to the point of boredom in part because , for the past decade or more , it has ? been the most visible part of his game . He has ? been injured . He has chased . He has ? kept on going . It ' s strange to think that compared with those early winning years most of his career has been played in a relative state of decline . That must have been hard for a person of his talent . Perhaps his greatest resilience has been to play on with this knowledge , and through it , for so long .
