As for Conway , who lost a Senate race to Rand Paul in 2010 , the sooner he exits Kentucky state politics the better . He s a dull campaigner at the best of times , despite his All American square jaw and appearing to be a reasonable human being . The belief that Democrats can only win in places like Kentucky by being slightly less conservative than their nutcase opponent is bunk : Conway s support for drug testing welfare applicants and suing the EPA left many Kentucky Democrats scratching their heads . Conway is the political equivalent of Amstel Light in a Natty Lite state .
