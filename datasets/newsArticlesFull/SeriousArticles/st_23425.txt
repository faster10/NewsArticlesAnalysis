President Barack Obama has sought to position the U . S . as a global leader on climate , hoping to reverse years of inaction and outright opposition by Washington at past UN climate conferences . Domestically , Obama has instituted a slew of policies to push a decline in greenhouse gas emissions . Chief among them is the Clean Power Plan , which calls for a 32 reduction in carbon emissions from power plants from 2005 levels by 2030 . On the international front , Obama has signed up the U . S . for a number of bilateral climate agreements , including joint commitments with China .
