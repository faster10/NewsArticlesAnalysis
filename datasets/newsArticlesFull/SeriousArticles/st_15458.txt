This is not the season for Robshaw to take a back seat . Can you imagine Martin Johnson or Lawrence Dallaglio allowing this situation to arise ? It might suit Harlequins but it doesn ' t suit England . Stuart Lancaster should be throwing tea cups around over this decision . He needs all his leaders to the fore this season , ideally ensuring at least six of his starting team are captaining their clubs week in , week out . In the 2003 World Cup we had 11 past , present and future England captains in the matchday squad for the final .
