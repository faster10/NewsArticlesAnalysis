The budgetary support for Karnataka ' s prevention society has also seen a slide . Already we have seen a funding cut . We had given a budget estimate of Rs 117 crore for 2015 16 but only Rs 77 crore was allocated . A proposal was sent from the Karnataka SACS to NACO for a budget for three years up to 2016 17 . We were told that this year ' s budget will be 80 per cent of the previous year ' s . Our budget was Rs 96 crore last year in effect it works out to nearly a 35 per cent cut from our budget estimate for the current financial year , says Raveendra .
