Renewables need to overcome two big hurdles . One is that the sun does not shine all the time , and wind does not blow all the time . As the renewable share of electric power goes up , this " intermittency " will be a bigger concern . One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables ' " partner " to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty . Another the subject of much research is to find some way to store electricity in large scale . Success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy
