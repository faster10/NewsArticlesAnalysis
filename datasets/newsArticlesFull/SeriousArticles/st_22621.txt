Bravo Company ' s leader , Capt . Ryan Sparks , is a mentor and friend to many of the young Marines , often making split second decisions when lives are in danger . He acknowledges the challenges when he addresses his men , saying , " I guarantee you we will lose Marines . I guarantee you we will . Don ' t let emotions control you . There ' s 80 , 000 civilians in this city there ' s maybe a thousand enemy . So when I go home , I don ' t want to feel ashamed because I ' m having problems sleeping at night , because I ' m not sure that I did the right thing . What happens over the next five days will be a cornerstone of your memory for the rest of your life . "
