And when it comes to Rubio playing in Iowa and New Hampshire , remember that immigration is still a potent issue in both states with majorities of Republicans in both states less likely to vote for a candidate who supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants . And here was Ted Cruz raising the issue yesterday : " On Tuesday night , you listened to one Republican after another who said , ' Gosh , it would be mean to enforce our immigration laws , ' " Cruz said yesterday in New Hampshire , per MSNBC ' s Benjy Sarlin . " And I would point out , by the way , everyone talks about how compassionate it is to grant amnesty to 12 million people here illegally . They ' re very compassionate , but it ' s not very compassionate if I say , ' I ' m going to give away your job . ' That ' s the opposite of compassion . " Asked by Sarlin how Cruz distinguished himself on immigration from Rubio , the Texas senator responded , " It is not complicated that on the seminal fight over amnesty in Congress , the Gang of Eight bill that was the brainchild of Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama , that would have granted amnesty to 12 million people here illegally , that I stood with the American people and led the fight to defeat it in the United States Congress , " Cruz said . Translation from Cruz : Rubio was a Gang of Eight author , while he was against it .
