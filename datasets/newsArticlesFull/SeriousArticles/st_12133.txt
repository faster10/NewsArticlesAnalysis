Experts anticipate that the 500 billion in scheduled federal budget cuts will cost us nearly one million jobs . The 1 . 25 trillion from a carbon tax would allow us to avoid these cuts with money to spare to pay down the deficit , and to maintain clean energy investments that create 3 . 2 times as many jobs per dollar than subsidies for fossil fuels . A carbon tax would also reduce barriers to market entry for clean energy startups facing an entrenched fossil fuel industry . There are already 3 . 1 million green jobs in America imagine how many more there would be if we leveled the playing field instead of subsidizing oil and coal companies .
