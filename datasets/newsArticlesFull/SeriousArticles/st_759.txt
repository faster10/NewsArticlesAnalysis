1 ) No Budget , No Pay This proposal would provide some personal incentive for senators and representatives do to something basic : Pass a budget on time . But the sad fact is that it has been more than 1 , 000 days since Congress passed a joint budget resolution , which is why we keep playing chicken with a government shutdown over continuing resolutions . What ' s worse is that this failure has become standard operating procedure . Congress has passed a budget on time only four times since 1952 and , for the past decade and a half , annual budgets have been an average of four months late . Some members of Congress complain that having their 174 , 000 a year salary docked until they pass a budget would unfairly penalize them . But we need to apply some reasonable pressure to focus Congress ' collective mind . No Budget , No Pay is a good place to start .
