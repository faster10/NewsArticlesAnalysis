On Saturday night with the Spurs in town , threatening to snap a three game Cavaliers winning streak and cast even more doubt on Cleveland s title hopes , it was Love who shucked the noise and offered the loudest answer . A 37 point Cavaliers first quarter was bolstered by 14 aggressive , confident ones from the highly paid , equally scrutinized power forward . Love served as target man and release valve for a noticeably decisive attack . The Cavs hot start turned into a dominant half and a 117 ? 103 win over an elite opponent that mattered most of all for the sake of controlling their own narrative .
