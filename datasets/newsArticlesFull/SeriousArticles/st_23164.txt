Irvin , however , didn ' t feel he was in good enough shape given his military stint . I had three years of athletic rust and a bad case of war nerves , he later said . What s more , Rickey was unwilling to pay the Eagles for his rights , as he had done in signing Don Newcombe . Irvin didn t lament passing up the opportunity , saying in 2010 ? I don t have any regrets . I couldn ' t aspire to becoming a Major Leaguer because the door was closed . Jackie Robinson is the real hero and the real pioneer . I was just so happy he was successful , and it made it much easier for all of us who came after him .
