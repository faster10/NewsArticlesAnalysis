These groups are causing harm , and there s ample evidence to prove it . Organisations that run abortion clinics , like the British Parental Advisory Service ( BPAS ) , have been speaking out about the impact on women for several years .

And this was when their behaviour was legal : several women reported being followed down the street and one said she was assaulted .
