However , the biggest risk for potential investors is that the public issue price of Rs 2 , 684 per gram for the sovereign gold bond , which was based on the average gold rate in the domestic market in the previous week , includes a 10 import duty on the precious metal . So investors will lose money should the government cut the basic customs duty on gold at any point of time before the maturity of the bonds , as domestic prices of the precious metal would then drop accordingly . And as the bonds will be for a period of eight years with exit option from only the fifth year , there is a real chance that the import duty may be trimmed in between .
