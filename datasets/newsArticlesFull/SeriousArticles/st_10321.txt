BI : I can t see how it is a coincidence that it s just a couple of days before a vital election ? and let s face it , this election is a snap election . This is probably a second and may be the last chance for Erdogan to get his majority that he has been craving he craves to change the constitution to afford the presidency more powers . I am very doubtful at this stage . I have no doubt this is linked to the elections themselves . The underlining element here behind these raids is , obviously , the opposition . But the opposition here is not a certain opposition party . It is Fethullah Gulen and his Hizmet movement . They ve been locked for a number of years Erdogan and Gulen have been locked in this war in the background . In Erdogan s own view this as a state within a state that he s been looking to purge for quite a while . He sees it as a conspiracy and maybe he is trying to kind of shake that sentiment just before these vital elections . ?
