The Star Telegram says that Virgil appears to be a Saarloos wolfdog ? a female European wolf and a male German shepherd hybrid , and that a ? relative of the Couch family , Misty McWilliams , posted a notice on the Puerto Vallarta SPCA Facebook page on Monday with a photo of the dog and an offer of a 1 , 000 reward . The notice says the dog went missing near Colombia street ? the street where Couch and his mom were picked up in December . A spokesman for the Jalisco fiscal office tells the Dallas Morning News that The dog was never in our possession , so I cannot deny or confirm that the dog was there . This is also a mystery to us .
