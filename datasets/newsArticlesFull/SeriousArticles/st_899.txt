Through a program called Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques , or SPOT , the TSA employs thousands of " behavior detection officers " who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of " mal intent " in airport screening areas . The officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the TSA associates with stress , fear or deception . When the officers perceive clusters of such behaviors in any given individual , they refer that person for secondary inspection and questioning .
