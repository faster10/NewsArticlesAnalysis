Am I overrating the loss of Dante Exum ? Several scouts think I am . Exum is a promising prospect and his length at the point guard gave the Jazz one of the longest lineups in the NBA . But there are many in the NBA who think the combination of Trey Burke Alec Burks will capably fill the point guard spot and expectations are that the Jazz ' s second half surge last season was no aberration . I m buying big that Tyson Chandler s presence will have a significant impact in Phoenix , where there are whispers that the Suns may be playing for Jeff Hornacek s job this season . But it wouldn t surprise me at all if Utah slides into that final playoff spot in the West .
