Now the Chargers and Raiders have to scramble . The Jones backed plan reportedly had the Chargers joining the Rams in Inglewood , though the team had said before Tuesday it had " zero interest " in the project . That ' s probably going to change , at least in public the Chargers can now negotiate for some kind of partnership with the Rams while using their potential move to Inglewood as leverage to get a more amenable offer from San Diego . Meanwhile , the city of Oakland has pretty much had zero interest in engaging the Raiders on a new stadium . Vice Sports ' Neil DeMause suggests an intriguing scenario : If there ' s no hope of moving to LA , why wouldn ' t the cash strapped Raiders talk to the city officials from St . Louis who were willing to throw a half billion dollars at Kroenke ? The NFL says it will kick in only a paltry 100 million to both the Chargers and the Raiders should they decide to build new stadiums in their current cities .
