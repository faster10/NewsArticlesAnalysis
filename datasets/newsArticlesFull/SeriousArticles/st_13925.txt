Moments after his Denver Broncos clinched a playoff berth on Monday with a 20 17 overtime victory at home against the Cincinnati Bengals , Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said he will stay with Brock Osweiler as his starter in next week s final . The Bengals are hoping to get him back for the playoffs , but the likely first round game complicates it . The 20 17 overtime clash can basically be summed up as a tale of two halves , with the Bengals dominating the first and the Broncos dominating the second . Tight end Tyler Eifert missed the past two games with a concussion . Of course , Pittsburgh could have avoided all this by simply beating Baltimore last Sunday something the Belichick deliberately lost to the Jets to screw the Steelers crowd ( oh yes , they re out there ) conveniently ignores . 1990 was the last time we saw Cincinnati get past the Wild Card Round and into the second round of the National Football League playoffs . I ve got to get them ready to go , but they understand that .
