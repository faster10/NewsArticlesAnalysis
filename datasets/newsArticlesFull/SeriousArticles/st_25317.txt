This is disingenuous , at best . The ad was to anyone who hasn ' t been living under a rock clearly aimed at Clinton . Whether it was a " negative ad " or not is debatable ( if " negative ad " means " any ad drawing a contrast between two candidates " then that rules out a whole bunch of ads , to put it mildly ) . It ' s not a personal attack , or muckraking . The ad isn ' t trying to personally destroy Clinton over some irrelevant matter . But it is a clear contrast between Bernie and his Democratic challenger . The Sanders campaign was forced to pull the ad , and Bernie tried some more hair splitting , by now pledging ( the ad in question was a web ad ) that he ' s still : " someone who has never run a negative TV ad in his life and never will . " At the end of the day , Bernie looked like a normal politician but that runs counter to his image , so it didn ' t exactly help .
