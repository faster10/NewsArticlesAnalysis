Rickman was so good as Gruber that he became a go to villain , in films like Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , Sweeney Todd , and of course the ? Harry Potter ? franchise . ? The actor s performance as Snape in the latter introduced him to a new generation of fans and proved an inspiration to at least one fellow cast member . ? I got the part , and I thought , I d better watch what the first one was like , Jason ? Isaacs , who played Lucius Malfoy in the series , told EW in 2010 . And then I realized to my horror that Alan Rickman was in the first film , and utterly brilliant . Nobody does sinister like Alan Rickman . I thought , If I m going to do something , it d better be unbelievably extreme .
