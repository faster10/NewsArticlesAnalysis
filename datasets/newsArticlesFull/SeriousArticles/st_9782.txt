The loss also seems to come at a bad time because now the win streak will now forever feel artificial . Officially , the Warriors win streak stands at 28 games , a number which combines their 24 0 start this season with the four straight wins they accumulated at the end of last season . Technically this puts them in second place on the NBA s longest consecutive regular season wins list , ahead of the 2012 13 Miami Heat s 27 game total , but it feels so incredibly unnatural that it feels more like a record book quirk than a legitimate accomplishment .
