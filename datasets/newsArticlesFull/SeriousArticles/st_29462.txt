Boston : There ' s a few of them . They think I ' m paranoid . I ' m not . I just learned early on that you have to expect the worst while hoping for the best . Expecting that the best is going to happen when hard times show up you won ' t be prepared and you will fail . People assume because I own guns that I ' m not educated or that I don ' t know how to think for myself . I own guns because I ' m educated to the dangers and the reality of the world that we live in . I accept the reality that we live in and I don ' t accept that the police will always be there for me . I own guns because I ' m very much attached to reality .
