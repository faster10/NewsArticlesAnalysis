Still , the Golden Globes can be a welcome , valuable disrupter to the cultural conversation about TV . Two seasons ago , the HFPA s seemingly premature veneration of Brooklyn Nine Nine shined a spotlight on a fledgling sitcom that ( lucky timing ! ) was about to go next level great . Since then , Andy Samberg s screwball policier has grown even more into that Globe and become one of TV s funniest comedies . And I do like how the group often winds up championing quirky , fringy , or marginalized quality that needs the profile boost . Last season , the HFPA justly honored Gina Rodriguez of Jane the Virgin as Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy . They ve nominated her again this year , although weirdly , they ve apparently forgotten what she looks like , as they confused her for Superstore s America Ferrera on Thursday morning during the announcements . Embarrassing . )
