The design your own trend is growing and it ' s not just limited to sneakers . Zazzle . com lets you customize your own T shirts , mugs , plates , skateboards , postcards , ties , aprons and pretty much anything else that has a printed image on it . It ' s just a matter of importing the image you want to use , adding some text , if that ' s what you want , and clicking ' ok . ' The result won ' t make Gucci lose any sleep , but it will be unique . While it ' s very different experience from that offered by Etsy , Zazzle does have tools that let you sell your designs on their Web site .
