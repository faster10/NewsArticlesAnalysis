The first snap sailed past Manning and into the end zone for a safety 12 seconds into the game , the quickest score in Super Bowl history . The Seahawks built a 22 0 lead by halftime , padded by a 69 yard interception return by Malcolm Smith for one of four turnovers by the Broncos . Percy Harvin took the third quarter kickoff back 87 yards for another score , and Russell Wilson tacked on two more touchdown passes after that to leave no doubt about the league ' s best team that year with a 43 8 decision .
