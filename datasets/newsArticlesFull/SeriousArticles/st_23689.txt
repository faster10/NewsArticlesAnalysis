" The publisher had me doing western magazines , crime magazines , men ' s adventure magazines , even romance and teenage magazines and one day he came to me and he said you know one of our competitors has a book called The Justice League and it ' s selling well and it ' s a bunch of superheroes , why don ' t we do some superhero magazines ? I said OK , I wanted to keep my job so I came up with The Fantastic Four and the others and that was the only reason . If my publisher hadn ' t said ' let ' s do superhero stories ' I ' d probably still be doing A Kid Called Outlaw , The Two Gun Kid or Millie the Model or whatever I was doing at the time . "
