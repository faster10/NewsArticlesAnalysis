Earlier in the day , we had a special meeting chaired by the CM and attended by the Director General of Police Pravin Dixit , the Mumbai Police Commissioner Ahmad Javed , the Joint Commissioner of Police ( Crime ) Atulchandra Kulkarni and me . We took the decision that since Rajan is a transnational criminal and since India is a signatory to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime ( UNCTOC ) and CBI is the designated agency under the convention , we have decided to transfer all our cases to the Central agency , said Bakshi .
