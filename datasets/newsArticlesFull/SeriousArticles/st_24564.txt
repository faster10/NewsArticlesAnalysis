Added defensive lineman Michael Bennett : " I think what he was trying to do , he was just trying to get fire under the team . They were in a situation where they re against the wall , and he wants everybody to have the same type of ambition and understanding what they re dealing with . I think he was just upset with the way it happened . They stopped that team . That s a hard team to stop in that situation that they were in . And then they scored . And they felt like they were going to win the game . He probably just got overheated . Hopefully he can work it out . But Hardy s one of the best defensive linemen in the NFL . He s been doing his thing since he s been here , so I know he s a great player . He just has to stay out of the news . "
