CA 125 is not a good test for ovarian cancer screening , and ovarian cancer may not be a good cancer for screening . What we need is a test that flags fewer people who do not have the disease as suspicious of having the disease . It would be even better if the test found more than half of the women who have the disease . Screening also works better in cancers that tend to stay localized for longer periods of time . Many ovarian cancers spread throughout the abdomen very early in the life of the cancer when the tumor is still very small .
