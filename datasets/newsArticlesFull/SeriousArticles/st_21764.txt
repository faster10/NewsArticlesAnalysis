About the Seahawks : They ' re still alive to win a third consecutive NFC crown after another wild playoff finish during Sunday ' s 10 9 win in frigid Minnesota . This Seahawks squad has become as reliant on the arm of QB Russell Wilson ? he set team records for passing yards ( 4 , 024 ) and TDs ( 34 ) ? as it is on a staunch defense that has periodically struggled this year but finished strong . The Seahawks are the only team in the Super Bowl era to allow the fewest points in the league for four consecutive seasons . The status of RB Marshawn Lynch ( abdominal surgery ) , who hasn ' t played since Week 10 , ? will remain a topic of conversation after he was a late scratch for the wild card round . All pro rookie KR Tyler Lockett , K Steven Hauschka and P Jon Ryan form the core of a standout special teams group . Despite mostly lacking the services of Lynch and injured TE Jimmy Graham , the Seahawks averaged 32 points and 404 . 1 yards on offense in the second half of the season .
