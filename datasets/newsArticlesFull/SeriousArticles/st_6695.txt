As I write this commentary , I am watching football highlights . I debate football vigorously with my friends , but we always walk away friends . Irrespective of viewpoint , calling people " deniers " or " warmists " is counterproductive and inflammatory . There are deep rooted feelings that have created zealotry , and at times , all sides have crossed lines of civility . I am proud to say that I enjoy very solid collegial and personal relationships with people who I sometimes disagree with on climate science .
