I didn t tour at all , " Stefani told the magazine . " But I did record the No Doubt album , which was super hard . I was torn the whole time . Every day I would take the kids to school , drive to Santa Monica , work on the album , and then I d think , Oh my god , if I don t leave by 2 : 30 , I m not gonna get home in time for dinner . And Gavin being on tour I m not gonna say there weren t some incredible moments making that album . But it was a lot of knocking my head against the wall . A lot of struggle .
