LaMarcus Aldridge is 30 , his championship window is about four years wide . David West ' s is even shorter . We stopped writing off the Spurs as a basketball media collective about three years ago , but eventually , no matter how long the battle is , Father Time wins ( I think ) . And in that , this may be the first time the Spurs really are driven to do more than play well , play together and let the chips fall where they may . They want another ring . They want the LaMarcus Aldridge gambit to work . They want to settle any doubts about whether this is one of the all time great teams ( despite any such concerns being absurd ) .
