There are other issues where Sanders could make exactly the same point , but this is the most poignant one , since both he and Clinton say they ' re for the same goal ( a family leave policy ) , but differ on the mechanics of enacting that goal . Clinton would either have to remain true to the goal ( and compromise her tactics ) or stay true to her tactics ( and miss the chance to achieve her goal ) . Either way , it would point out the inherent centrism ( and aversion to progressivism ) behind Clinton ' s mantle of practicality and pragmatism .
