President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress requesting a resolution that will grant him authority to use military force against ISIS . In an effort to placate opponents of military intervention in both parties , the administration has hedged the request by including language that restricts " enduring offensive ground forces " and limits any intervention to three years . He sent a letter with the request promising Congress that he would not authorize " long term , large scale ground combat operations " as occurred in Iraq or Afghanistan . With that language , he then does ask for authorization to use ground troops .
