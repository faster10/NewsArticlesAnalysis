Will they re sign quarterback Kirk Cousins ? There ' s no doubt the Redskins want him back . Cousins has always taken a wait and see approach to keep his focus on the field . But a lot will depend on how both sides view his value . The best early guess is that he ' ll require a contract worth at least 17 million a season . A few weeks back , the Redskins knew it was hard to pinpoint where Cousins should be slotted in terms of value because this was his first full season as a starter and he was inconsistent the first half of the year . But his strong finish elevated him into a different landing spot financially , even with a playoff loss . Cousins might just be a game manager , but with the talent around him , that ' s all he needed to be and it worked . He has talked often about being able to play in one system for a long time staying in Washington would give him that opportunity . But if they can t come to an agreement , the Redskins still have ultimate control with the franchise tag , which would cost anywhere between 20 million and 25 million .
