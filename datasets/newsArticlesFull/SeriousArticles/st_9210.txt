For starters , the invitation to the Syrian talks , sent out on Wednesday night by De Mistura made no reference to Geneva II of 2012 , which called for a Transitional Government Body ( TGB ) with full executive powers that would replace Al Assad in Damascus . Instead , their term of reference was the Vienne Communiqu of November 2015 , which called for the creation of a cabinet of national unity , with no mention of Al Assad s fate or future . This threatened to bring down the talks before they even started , creating shockwaves in opposition circles . Also , the invitation letter made reference to UN Security Council Resolution 2254 , which legitimised outcomes of the Vienna Conference and was music to the ears of decision makers in Moscow and Damascus .
