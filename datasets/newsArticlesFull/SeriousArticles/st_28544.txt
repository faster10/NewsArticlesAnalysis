The Texas senator s campaign has now moved on to waging a quiet war with Rand Paul s supporters over the small but influential libertarian wing of the GOP .

Cruz has waged a steady appeal to more socially conservative libertarians who have not embraced Rand Paul in the same way that they backed his father , Ron , and he is attracting Republican regulars from different wings of the party .
