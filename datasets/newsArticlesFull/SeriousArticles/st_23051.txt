Hillary Clinton recently sat down and answered extremely hostile questions for 11 straight hours . She did so with aplomb and certainty , and received praise for her poise from just about every neutral observer . Compare that to Republicans who spent a total of maybe 10 or 15 minutes each answering questions from the station that created the Tea Party , and who now want to write the rules in advance so that they don ' t have to listen to any more disrespectful questions . That is a clear contrast in strength and wimpiness , folks .
