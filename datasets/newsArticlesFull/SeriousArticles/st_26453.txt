Still , for the 800 GE employees coming to Boston 200 corporate staff and 600 " digital industrial product managers , designers and developers " this move seems great . An office on the waterfront near great restaurants , museums , tech startups and transit stops in Boston sounds a lot more appealing than one surrounded by lawns and parking lots in suburban Connecticut . Also , GE is trying to profile itself as a " high tech global industrial company , " and while Boston is no Silicon Valley , it ' s pretty high tech for the East Coast . Lower taxes and a six minute ride to the airport don ' t hurt either .
