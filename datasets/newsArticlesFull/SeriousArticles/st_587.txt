Prudent bankers attracted depositors by following low risk strategies . But now their depositors are asked to pay for the high risk strategies of other bankers . High risk bankers risked their depositors ' money . But their depositors will not lose more than the depositors of other banks . This is the logic of the Cyprus " bailout " by the International Monetary Fund , the German led Euro group and the European Central Bank . Delinquent bankers ' losses are protected by prudent bankers ' gains .
