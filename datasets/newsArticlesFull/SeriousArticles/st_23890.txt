What the U . S . report does not say , and what Brewer should be concerned about , is the fact that SB 1070 violates U . S . human rights obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , which is binding on all levels of federal , state and local governments . The convention obligates federal , state and local governments to guarantee that laws and policies do not discriminate , in purpose or effect , on the grounds of race , color , descent or national or ethnic origin .
