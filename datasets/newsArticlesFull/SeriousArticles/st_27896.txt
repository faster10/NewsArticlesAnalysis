Stapleton s anointing by the insiders of Music Row has been immediately celebrated as a victory for fans of great country music . The fact that he took the stage over polished , multi platinum stars that enjoy mass radio airplay and can sell out arenas is a clear signal from the industry folk responsible for making country music that , after years of deafening criticism both inside and outside of Nashville , broad popularity isn t deserving of heraldry . The votes for Stapleton suggest that music producers and fans alike are hungry for substance , and the soulful Traveller ( I covered it here ) delivers just that .
