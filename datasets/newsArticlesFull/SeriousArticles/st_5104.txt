His shot totals have gone up lately and his turnovers have gone down , signaling he ' s getting more confident . The Sun Devils are coming off a rather comfortable 86 68 win Thursday against visiting Oregon State , just their second win in eight games , and are now averaging 75 . 8 points , which would represent their highest average since the 2004 2005 season .
