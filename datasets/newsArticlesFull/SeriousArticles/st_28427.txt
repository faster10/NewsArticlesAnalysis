" The Martian " has been a tough film to predict this awards season . It seemed like a potential frontrunner for Best Picture , but was left out of SAG ' s top category . Matt Damon was also overlooked for Best Actor at the SAG Awards , but did earn a nomination at the Golden Globes . " The Martian " should make the cut come Academy Awards time and Damon will likely round out a Best Lead Actor category that also includes DiCaprio , Cranston , Eddie Redmayne ( " The Danish Girl " ) and Michael Fassbender ( " Steve Jobs " ) .
