The text described in this newest " Lost Gospel " is said to be a translation from an original Greek manuscript , according to a letter dating to the sixth century that accompanied the Syriac text in the British Library , says a Daily Mail article on the book . No matter how you look at this narrative , it is ancient in origin and may indeed reach back to the first century , when the four canonical gospels Matthew , Mark , Luke and John were written , although this is Wilson and Jacobovici ' s conjecture .
