" There are two things to keep in mind about circumstantial evidence : The first one is that you may draw inferences and conclusions only from facts that have been proved to you . The second rule is that any inferences or conclusions which you draw must be reasonable and natural , based on your common sense and experience of life . In a chain of circumstantial evidence , it is not required that every one of your inferences and conclusions be inevitable , but it is required that each of them be reasonable , that they all be consistent with one another , and that together they establish the defendant ' s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . If the Commonwealth ' s case is based solely on circumstantial evidence , you may find the defendant guilty only if those circumstances are conclusive enough to leave you with a moral certainty , a clear and settled belief , that the defendant is guilty and that there is no other reasonable explanation of the facts as proven . The evidence must not only be consistent with the defendant ' s guilt , it must be inconsistent with his ( her ) innocence . "
