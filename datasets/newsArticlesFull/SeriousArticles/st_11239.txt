Dassault had , on January 31 , 2012 , been declared the winner of India ' s tender for 126 MMRCA aircraft . After exhaustive trials , the IAF chose the Rafale over five other fighters Boeing ' s F A 18E F Super Hornet Lockheed Martin ' s F 16IN Super Viper Saab ' s Gripen NG RAC MiG ' s MiG 35 and Eurofighter GmbH ' s Typhoon . However , in protracted price negotiations that followed , the defence ministry found that Dassault ' s payment would amount to more than what its commercial bid initially suggested . The United Progressive Alliance government dragged on the negotiations . The National Democratic Alliance government chose to abandon the MMRCA tender altogether , and instead buy 36 Rafales over the counter .
