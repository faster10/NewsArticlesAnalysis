" What I liked about Delly ' s game tonight was that he made simple plays and he made them at the right times , " Blatt said . " Played the game solidly and simply and just helped his team run and win . He played 38 minutes tonight . That ' s not normal . There ' s always a place for Delly to play on this team because of the things , the intangibles that he brings . Is he going to keep playing at 38 minutes going down the line ? I doubt it , but he ' ll be there to help us try to win games , I know that . "
