I wanted to do something a little more ( with this compilation ) , Hayes explains . We always have these weird , wild and wacky acoustic arrangements and the live arrangement always have a different energy as well , so my thing was like , Let s just have all those as part of the story . They re going to live in that space . They re going to become those things ? acoustic versions , live versions eventually . Why not do it now ? Why not make it all a part of a project ? Why not give the fans 21 songs at once versus just seven ? It just sounded like more fun to me .
