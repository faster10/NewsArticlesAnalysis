To alleviate factional infighting , I would introduce two measures . First , I would build a governing coalition in which each political faction is represented on the basis of its electoral weight . Second , I would create a National Solidarity Council to serve as a platform for dialogue and understanding to increase transparency , find commonality , and narrow differences among factions . Because I have never been a member or adversary of any faction , I expected to be trusted with this intermediating function .
