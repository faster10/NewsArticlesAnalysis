MASHAL : They posted a video of the attackers on their website . And the video shows 10 young men sort of giving a message to President Obama in broken English . And what ' s weird about the video is when the guy ' s giving the message , there are two other young men sitting next to him who can ' t hold back sort of smiling and chuckling because the English of the guy giving the message is so bad . And the guy basically says , President Obama , we ' re giving you a warning , your forces are not safe in Afghanistan . You ' ve said that you will extend the presence here across several bases , but we will come after you anywhere . But the irony is that there was no harm to American forces , as far as we know . It was all Afghan civilians and some security forces that died .
