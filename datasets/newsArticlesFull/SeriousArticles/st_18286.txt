Speaking of politicians being weaselly about medical marijuana , we have a Chris Christie update . Of all the candidates running for president , Christie has been most supportive of moving the country backwards in the War On Weed . The questions he ' s been getting on the issue are getting a lot more specific , pointing out a basic contradiction in his political stance . In a recent town hall in Iowa , someone has asked Christie the exact question I wanted to hear him answer . A veteran asked Christie directly about the issue of marijuana being a federal Schedule I substance , defined as having " no medicinal value . " Christie tried to explain that medical marijuana was somehow different because a doctor prescribes it . The questioner pointed out that he was flat out wrong about that : " But under federal law , a doctor can ' t write a prescription . They can only recommend . Because it ' s a Schedule I substance . That ' s the problem . " Christie went on to again , wrongly state that the president can ' t change the law , Congress must act . In fact , the attorney general can change the classification just by signing a piece of paper . The more this issue gets raised in questions to politicians , the closer we come to actually admitting that state level medical marijuana has not changed federal law one bit . Kudos to Shelly Van Winkle for pinning down Chris Christie , who has staked out the most reactionary position of any candidate on marijuana .
