It is fair enough to call Sanders a Democrat , but one must make an important distinction between neoliberal Democrats , like Bill Clinton , and New Deal Democrats , like Franklin Roosevelt . Sanders obviously falls into the latter category , and thus has been considered fringe for most of his career ( just as FDR would have been towards the end of the 20th century ) . Of course , it s true that Sanders has voted with Democrats the majority of the time , but this is probably not the best way to measure Sanders ideology , as there are only two major political parties in the United States , and he would certainly not be voting for bills that the Republican Party , which has become increasingly extremist over the years , supports .
