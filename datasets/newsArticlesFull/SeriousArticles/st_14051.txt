Castor testified that in deciding not to charge Cosby , he intended to forever close the door on prosecuting the comedian . He said he considered his decision binding on his successors . Similarly , Cosby ' s lawyers said they never would have let the TV star testify in the civil case if they didn ' t believe criminal charges were off the table . " In this case , the prosecution should be stopped in its tracks , " Cosby lawyer Chris Tayback argued . " Really what we ' re talking about here is honoring a commitment . " But current District Attorney Kevin Steele questioned whether Castor ever made such an agreement , since it was never put in writing on a legal document and the Cosby attorney with whom Castor dealt is now dead . Steele argued that in any case , Castor had no legal authority to make such a deal
