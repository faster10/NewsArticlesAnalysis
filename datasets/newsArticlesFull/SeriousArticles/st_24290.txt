With this latest row , sectarian tensions and clashes are likely to rise . There are reports of clashes in the Sunni populated parts of Iran and the Shia populated parts of Saudi Arabia . The sectarian scourge is destabilising the whole region , from Syria to Yemen . That s damaging to everyone . But the sectarian conflict hurts Iran ( especially Rouhani s vision of Iran ) most , because it boxes Tehran in a corner with only Shia friends . That only validates the charge that Iran is pushing a sectarian agenda in the region .
