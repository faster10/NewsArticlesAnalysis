I don ' t doubt smokers cost us all a lot of money . It is also cheaper not to have to hire them and give them insurance or see them miss work . But the obese , the gamblers , rugby players , skiers , the sedentary , the promiscuous who don ' t practice safe sex , those who won ' t wear helmets on motorcycles and bikes , horseback riders , pool owners , all terrain vehicle operators , small plane pilots , sunbathers , scuba divers , and surfers all of whom cost us money and incur higher than average health care costs are still on the job .
