Henry : Reluctantly , I turned it down . Reluctantly . Not turned it down like snubbing my nose turning it down . I was obligated to my business it had just opened up , and it was hard to leave . But it was what they seen in me . . . They had me believing that I was the only person who could do this part . After I turned them down , reluctantly , three times , they really convinced me that no one could do this part but me . They sold me . They had so much belief to put their whole film , millions of dollars , into my hands .
