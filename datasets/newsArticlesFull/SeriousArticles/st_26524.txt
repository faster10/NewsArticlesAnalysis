With former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush recently announcing that he was exploring a run for president and almost instantly topping the polls among GOP contenders , and with Hillary Clinton being the presumed Democratic front runner , we could see a replay of families from the 1992 presidential race in 2016 . While they are both solid candidates , I fear a match up between these political " royal families " could turn more people off from politics . Can we at least mix it up a little and get a Kennedy or Roosevelt into the race ?
