Trainwreck . I loved this movie less than most . The main character was fresh and interesting the third act of contrived breakup followed by dramatic conciliatory gesture wasn t . But the thing it did that hadn t been done in a studio comedy before ? ? ? more than just simple ribaldry , which had been done plenty , if by the other gender ? ? ? was take someone genuinely flawed and have her struggle with how to deal with that . Yes , Bill Hader could have had more depth . But Amy Schumer had enough for both of them .
