" By taking this action , Facebook has now recognized an important standard to be applied when evaluating issues of non compliance with its terms of service involving distinctions between incitement to violence and legitimate calls for collective expressions of opinion and action , " said a statement Tuesday from Abraham H . Foxman , national director of the group . " As it continues to monitor its pages , Facebook should be able to apply this standard in response to complaints about other pages with similar content . We hope that they will continue to vigilantly monitor their pages for other groups that call for violence or terrorism against Jews and Israel . "
