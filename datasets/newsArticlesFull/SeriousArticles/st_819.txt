Sadly , although life is likely to exist on exoplanets throughout our Milky Way galaxy , intelligent life is another thing altogether . Humans have lived at most a few hundred thousand years out of the Earth ' s 4 . 6 billion year history or less than 0 . 006 of the available time . In contrast , simple single celled organisms probably formed several billion years ago , and thus have populated the Earth for more than three quarters of its existence . This means it is overwhelmingly likely that the life we find elsewhere will be extremely primitive .
