In November we heard that the group we had filmed producing marijuana for the cartel had been attacked and killed by another cartel . Control of the mountains was loosening . Then in December , Crist bal and seven of the men we had been dealing with were gunned down in an ambush just up the road from La Tuna . Some say they were attacked by a group from a rival cartel that El Chapo had previously smashed . Others say it was a deliberate killing by the authorities . Whatever the reality , it was clear El Chapo was losing control of his homebase . It was also clear it had not taken much for the authorities to make it impossible for El Chapo to run his business any more . It now appears that they drove him out of his safety net , and back down to the coast , where he was caught . Where once El Chapo and his family controlled the mountains and the towns , able to release people from prisons at will . These concerted attacks will have undermined his people s control of the cartel over the past months . This time the king probably is dead .
