When the United States speaks about human rights , other countries listen . We do not need a perfect score from Human Rights Watch to have our views respected . When other countries choose not to listen to the United States or follow its lead , it is not necessarily because we do not practice what we preach instead , it is because those countries see human rights as a potential threat to their rule . Even if the United States had an unblemished human rights record , the Bashar al Assads of this world are still going to massacre their people and authoritarian governments will still imprison and torture their dissidents .
