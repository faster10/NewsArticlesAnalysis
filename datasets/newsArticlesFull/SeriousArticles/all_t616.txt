Sinead O'Connor is over "Nothing Compares 2 U."16PhotosSinead O'Connor through the yearsThe once-controversial Irish singer is now sporting a new lookThe Irish singer took to Facebook Monday to announce she will "cease" singing the 1990 hit that catapulted her to fame. "After twenty-five years of singing it, nine months or so ago I finally ran out of anything I could use in order to bring some emotion to it. I don't want audiences to be disappointed coming along to a show and then not hearing it, so am letting you know here that you won't. If I were to sing it just to please people, I wouldn't be doing my job right, because my job is to be emotionally available. I'd be lying. You'd be getting a lie. My job is to give you honesty. I'm trained in honesty. I can't act. It just isn't in my training. I have ceased singing other songs over the years for the same reason," wrote the 48-year-old singer. Post by Sinead O'Connor."Nothing Compares 2 U," which was written by Prince for one of his side projects, appeared on O'Connor's sophomore release, "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got."Guess we'll have to settle for a live recording of it.
