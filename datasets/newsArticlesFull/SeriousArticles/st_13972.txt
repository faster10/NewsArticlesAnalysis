Co written and directed by comedy veteran Harold Ramis ( " Ghostbusters , " " Groundhog Day " ) , " Year One " is little more than a series of juvenile skits dressed up in toga party glad rags . It rambles off into Old Testament territory when the boys stumble across Cain ( David Cross ) killing his brother Abel ( Paul Rudd ) , then arrive in the desert in the nick of time to save Isaac ' s neck ( Christopher Mintz Plasse ) from his zealous father ' s knife though his foreskin is another story .
