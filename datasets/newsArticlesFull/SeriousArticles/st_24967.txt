I think that what Hillary presents is a recognition that translating values into governance and delivering the goods is ultimately the job of politics , making a real life difference to people in their day to day lives . I don t want to exaggerate those differences , though , because Hillary is really idealistic and progressive . You d have to be to be in , you know , the position she s in now , having fought all the battles she s fought and , you know , taken so many , you know , slings and arrows from the other side . And Bernie , you know , is somebody who was a senator and served on the Veterans Committee and got bills done . And so the ?
