I for one , do believe the Chicago police officer went too far shooting his victim 16 times . That was way over the line . But , the protesters in Chicago on Friday were way out of line . As far as I ' m concerned , they were local terrorists blocking access to businesses . They have every right to protest and march , but they do not have the right to block access from public streets and sidewalks . What gives them the right to prevent me , a free citizen like themselves , from going into a store to shop ? The shopping public was essentially being terrorized by these protesters and it ' s a shame not enough of them were arrested . There is a right way and a wrong way to get your message across . This was wrong .
