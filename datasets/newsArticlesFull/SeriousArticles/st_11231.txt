Ouch : The Bengals entered Sunday as arguably the healthiest team in the league , with each of the players on their 53 man roster practicing the last two days of this past week . Although Vontaze Burfict wasn ' t expected to play much , the linebacker did end up being relied upon throughout the afternoon after middle linebacker Rey Maualuga left a first quarter calf injury . Burfict and A . J . Hawk were used in a rotation to help replace Maualuga . Defensive end Carlos Dunlap ( shoulder ) and Andre Smith ( head ) also left the game with injuries . The Bengals nearly lost a couple of other players in the physical contest . Receiver Marvin Jones took a hard shot to his midsection from Steelers safety Mike Mitchell . He was back later that same drive . The same went for cornerback Adam Jones , who curled into a ball on the ground for several moments after breaking up a deep Roethlisberger pass .
