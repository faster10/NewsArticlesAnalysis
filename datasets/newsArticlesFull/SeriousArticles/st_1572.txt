" We have heard this quite a bit , that there are certain allegations and information about various players , and they can be sometimes seen to be a consistent , a consistent group , " Kermode said when asked about there being a core group of players involved in the alleged match fixing . " But . . . it ' s about obtaining evidence . You can have . . . lots of information , lots of anecdotal reports , but it ' s about getting evidence that we can use . So anything that is reported to the Tennis Integrity Unit is acted upon and is investigated , and that ' s , again , a very important sort of message to get across . This doesn ' t just sort of filter out somewhere . It is acted upon . "
