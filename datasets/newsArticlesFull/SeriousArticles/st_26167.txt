One Commonwealth visitor to the memorial told The Mail on Sunday : ' I was very disappointed to see a portable toilet at the memorial . It is very disrespectful . I tried to complain about it but could not get through on the phone . ' Another said : ' I just don ' t understand why anyone would build a wonderful memorial like this and then spoil it so thoughtlessly . There is plenty of grass in the park to the side of the memorial . If they had a little sensitivity , they would have put it there . It ' s the product of the jobsworth mentality . '
