Second of all , if things are going to get a lot rougher , let s at least hope the campaigns don t insult our collective intelligence with the old game of feigning piety about the other side s awful negative attacks while simultaneously launching their own . The Sanders campaign suggests it will sharply question Clinton s record but won t get into attacking her character . But suggesting Clinton is changing her positions for political reasons is attacking her character . And the Sanders camp has been doing a whole lot of that . Which , by the way , is fine . If the Sanders campaign wants to cite Clinton s previously held positions to suggest she may be insufficiently committed to her current ones , that s what this process is for . It s completely fair game . Just don t pretend that isn t what you re doing .
