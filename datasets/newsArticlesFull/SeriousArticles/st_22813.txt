Benson would know just how different the two games were . In his return home last season , Benson was 0 for 1 from the floor , missed both his free throw attempts and turned the ball over twice in his 17 minutes . His most notable moment of that game came at the end of the first half when the then freshman guard knocked loose a ball , potentially setting up a last second Oregon possession . Down 13 at the time , a bucket would have been huge . Instead , the ball went straight from Benson ' s diving body to Rondae Hollis Jefferson , who snagged it , dunked and hung from the rim . As the 14 , 655 on hand went crazy , Benson buried his face in his hands .
