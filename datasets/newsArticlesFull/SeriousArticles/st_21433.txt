Piazza : Roy Campanella said , when I was in spring training a long time ago , he said , ' Mike , just play the game . Just play the game . Let the people say what they have to say , let them write what they have to write . Let them boo , let them cheer . The fans love you one day , they hate you the next day that ' s part of it . ' I ' ve always had that sublime philosophy in a way . You ' re always going to have critics , but you just keep going , and you can ' t worry about addressing everybody who has a beef with you . We ' ve joked many times maybe it ' s the guy who I didn ' t give an interview , maybe the guy , one time , I took his girlfriend , or whatever I have no idea . It is what it is , and you just have to kind roll with it , try to keep going forward , and dwell on the positives of life .
