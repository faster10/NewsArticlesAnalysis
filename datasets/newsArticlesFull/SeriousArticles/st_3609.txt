This point about the ideological marriage of ISIS and the Republicans has been made in various ways by various commentators since the Paris attacks ? I made it myself in the immediate aftermath , even if I buried the lede ? but I don t think it can be restated often enough . Strategists of the Islamic State want Western regimes to persecute and marginalize Muslim citizens , crack down on immigration and squander their financial and political capital on a military response that is unlikely to produce a clear cut victory and highly likely to harden anti Western attitudes in the Islamic world . A similar approach worked brilliantly for Osama bin Laden in 2001 ? better than he expected , I would guess ? and ISIS possesses a far more sophisticated understanding of Western politics and culture than Osama and the old school al Qaida leadership ever did .
