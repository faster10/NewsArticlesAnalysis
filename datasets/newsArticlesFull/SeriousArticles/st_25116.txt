In 2012 , the Supreme Court reaffirmed in Arizona v . United States that " The Government of the United States has broad , undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens . " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority , " Returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate . . . The foreign state may be mired in civil war , complicit in political persecution , or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be harmed upon return . " Kennedy noted that under the supremacy clause of the US Constitution , " Congress has the power to preempt state law . " States cannot regulate conduct in a field that Congress " has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance , " Kennedy added . " Federal law makes a single sovereign responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and unified system to keep track of aliens within the Nation ' s borders . "
