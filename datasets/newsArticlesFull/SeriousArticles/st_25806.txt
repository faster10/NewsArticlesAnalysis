One bone of contention is the Academy s failure to nominate Straight Outta Compton , a biopic of rap collective NWA , for the best picture Oscar . Its black director , F Gary Gray , was also overlooked , as were its cast members . The film did receive a single nomination , for its four white screenwriters . Creed star Michael B Jordan and his director Ryan Coogler were also left off the shortlist , though Sylvester Stallone was recognised for his work in the film . Creed was written and directed by the black Ryan Coogler and starred a black man , but the only nominee was a white man , wrote Variety s Tim Gray .
