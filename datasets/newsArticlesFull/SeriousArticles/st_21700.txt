" The Big Lebowski " is one of those movies where you notice something new during every viewing . For example , did you know the opening scene takes place exactly a decade before 9 11 ? The next time you watch the film , you ' ll see that when the Dude purchases a 0 . 69 carton of half half , which he pays for by check , the date he writes is September 11 , 1991 . And , as he ' s signing the check , President George H . W . Bush is seen giving a speech on the store ' s little TV set about how aggression against Kuwait " will not stand . " Strange but true .
