The subgenre of slash fiction , which takes two presumably straight characters and imagines their homosexual love , exists for every popular franchise , too . ( Go ahead and google Spock slash Kirk . ) Slash fiction has a particularly strong presence on the Internet , perhaps because LGBT people are still used to reading between the lines for their onscreen representation . So it didn t take long for fans , some whom are LGBT themselves , and some who just long for more inclusive representation of gender and sexuality , to start shipping Poe and Finn . And the slash followed soon there after . Here s a little PG taste .
