Saoirse later released an official statement : ' When we made Brooklyn , we had no idea of what was to come . It is the most personal film I have ever done , the hardest one too . I am honoured to represent this film with my friends John , Nick , Finola , Yves , Colm , Amanda . This has all been a dream . To see how the film has been embraced has been heartwarming . Thank you so very much to The Academy you are a group of people I respect greatly and to be recognized by you means so much . Thank you ! ' ?
