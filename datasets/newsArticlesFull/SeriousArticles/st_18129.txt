Meanwhile , in the doldrums of the Republican race and his own private Koch funded purgatory , Jeb Bush actually praised Obama s mosque visit to radio host Hugh Hewitt . In the neocon interventionist ideology of his big brother s administration , that would have made sense : Those guys needed compliant Islamic despots to act out their imperial reconquest of the Middle East , and deliberately avoided any rhetoric of religious war . ( George W . Bush visited a Washington mosque a few days after the 9 11 attacks , and said all the same stuff Obama just said . ) You can t feel too bad for Jeb , who has reaped as he has sown , pretty much . He has no idea what hit him , but he knows this : When you say something nice about Barack Obama , as a 2016 Republican , it s all over .
