Finally , Georgia ' s revised Safe Carry Protection Act may also cost you more money . Before this law , cities could simply prohibit firearms or any other weapons in government buildings by posting a sign now , they can do so only by screening entrances into the government building with security personnel . And guess who ends up paying for that ? That ' s right , the taxpayer . And if the police officer is sued for asking to see a gun carry permit , who will pay for his or her defense ? It will be up to the municipality , using taxpayer funds .
