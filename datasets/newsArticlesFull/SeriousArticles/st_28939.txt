The four produce several singles with titles such as " Girlfriend in a Coma , " " William , It Was Really Nothing , " and " Heaven Knows I ' m Miserable Now , " top the British charts for a few years , and then go their separate ways . That was the story of the Smiths , and their four studio albums along with three compilations and a live album have been remastered by the guitarist , Johnny Marr , for this box set . For the true diehards , Rhino Records also has a limited edition version with CDs , LPs , singles , posters and wallpaper , yours for 499 . 98 .
