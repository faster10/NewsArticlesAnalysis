Most polls suggest the AKP will struggle to win a majority on Sunday and be forced into coalition , potentially with the main opposition CHP , although one survey on Thursday indicated it would be able to govern alone . Whether or not there will be more oxygen in the system for journalists will depend on the result of Sunday s elections , said Asli Aydintasbas , a journalist for around 20 years . If there is a decline in AKP votes and if they fail to form a single party government then they ll have to be more compromising , more democratic , she said .
