In type 1 diabetics , the pancreas makes very little or no insulin , a hormone that controls glucose levels , or the amount of sugar in your blood . Patients must constantly check their levels throughout the day , determine how much insulin they need to lower their blood sugar and administer the proper amount using a pump or syringe . Drops or spikes in blood sugar can be extremely dangerous . If the level is too low a condition called hypoglycemia patients can experience shakiness , confusion , trouble speaking , seizures , even coma and death . A level that is too high hyperglycemia can cause excessive thirst , frequent urination and cardiac arrhythmia . Left untreated , hyperglycemia can lead to a number of serious complications including vision loss and nerve damage .
