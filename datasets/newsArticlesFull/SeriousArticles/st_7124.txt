Rock is under intense scrutiny as the Oscars African American host at a time when the awards ceremony is being blasted for its lack of African American nominees . For the second year in a row , there are none in any of the acting categories .

In protest , Spike Lee , Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith announced they would not attend the ceremony .
