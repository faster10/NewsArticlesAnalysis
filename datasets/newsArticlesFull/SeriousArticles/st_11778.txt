The New Jersey governor has made this dramatic turnaround in two ways . One , he has focused on New Hampshire like a lion stalking a zebra , bombarding the residents with calls , texts , and his own ? lumbering presence . He has spent 50 days there this year , more than any other candidate besides Lindsey Graham . The residents of the state , naturally , have been flattered and responded accordingly . ( Whether flattering this mostly white 1 300th of the population of America into giving your campaign the illusion of momentum , resulting in the press and the national party declaring you a new favorite to win the nomination , is a healthy way to pick the next leader of the free world is a debate for another day . )
