A similar trend was visible in the Delhi polls held earlier this year . Initially , all polls gave a higher vote share to the BJP while Kejriwal remained the most preferred CM candidate . This contradiction was eventually corrected by the mid of January when polls gave Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) the lead in terms of vote share as well , though popularity of Kejriwal dipped a bit due to announcement of Kiran Bedi as BJP CM candidate . The vote share gap moved in tandem with the popularity gap between Kejriwal and the second top contender and turned from negative to Advantage AAP just ahead of polling .
