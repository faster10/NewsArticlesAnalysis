When I traveled to the Aloha State to talk to nonvoters , I met people who didn ' t know the election was coming up in November , those who feel like their votes don ' t matter because they ' re so far ( in distance and psychology ) from " the mainland , " and those who don ' t want to participate in a political system that values conflict over compromise . I can ' t help but think that our national politics bogged down in money and aggression could use a healthy dose of the Aloha Vote . Hawaii ' s voice should finally be heard .
