We got your good ol representative Steve King ? friend of mine , I thought , she said to the Cedar Rapids , Iowa , crowd before introducing Donald Trump at a rally . Here I see that just a bit ago , somebody s showing me a story , he s accusing me on MSNBC ? first , MSNBC , really ? ? of selling my support to Mr Trump . And this is why , when you read things like this , this is why people don t really like politics . They know that it s a dirty business because people will say things that they know are untrue .
