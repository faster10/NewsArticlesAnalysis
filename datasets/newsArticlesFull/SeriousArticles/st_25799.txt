You might have noticed a recent TV commercial from Chevron Corp . showing a Chevron professional next to an eighth grade student with a robot . The student describes the remote control robot , and the young Chevron professional talks about how a high school science teacher made him what he is today ( a geologist for Chevron ) . The next part of the commercial caught my attention , because in bold letters the words " Science Rules " flashed on the screen . While I agree that " science rules , " so does technology and engineering .
