Improved transportation links : Public transportation access to all of New York ' s airports is behind other world class cities , which have one seat train rides directly from the city center to the airport . Options for getting to LaGuardia via public transportation are very limited , but a Bus Rapid Transit system , with dedicated lanes and just a few stops to the airport , would help remedy that . This service would remove the threat of traffic delays normally associated with buses and provide a convenient and reliable direct ride to the airport . Reviving long dormant plans for a direct subway extension to LaGuardia are also worth exploring .
