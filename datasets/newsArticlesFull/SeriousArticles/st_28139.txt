? Penalties . Right guard Willie Colon was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct in the second quarter . You read that correctly . Yes , Colon ( knee ) is on injured reserve , and , yes , he was in street clothes on the sideline . But he drew the flag after jawing with Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers Cromartie just after wideout Eric Decker caught a pass . The Jets saved face by eventually scoring on that drive . And on that 17 play , extended drive that ended with Miles ' interception , the Jets were penalized three times , including two against their secondary . ? And with less than three minutes remaining , tight end Jeff Cumberland was flagged for running into punter Brad Wing after Wing shanked a 30 yard punt that went out of bounds near at the Jets ' 46 . Wing got another chance , and his do over gave the Jets the ball at their own 29 ? a 17 yard difference .
