But that ' s not where Ben Carson ' s money is going . Much of it is going to the fundraising itself , mostly through direct mail . And money spent to raise money is just gone . Yes , you can go back to those people who contributed and ask for more , but that might or might not pay off . The Carson campaign is also delivering phone spam to untold numbers of people all over the country . I know lifelong Democrats who have gotten these calls and can ' t figure out what list would include them as potential Carson supporters , suggesting a telemarketing firm is billing the candidate for oodles of useless calls .
