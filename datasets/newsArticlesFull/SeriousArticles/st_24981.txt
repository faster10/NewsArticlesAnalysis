Democratic U . S . Sens . Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow and U . S . Rep . Dan Kildee of MI said Wednesday that they will introduce legislation to clarify the Environmental Protection Agency ' s authority to notify the public if a danger from lead is in their water system . The big corporations followed suit . But some say : shipping bottles is just a short term solution . Flint has since switched back to Detroit water , but tests have shown high lead levels in the blood of some Flint children . The governor has repeatedly blamed state Department of Environmental Quality employees for failing to require Flint to add anti corrosion chemicals that would have prevented lead from leaching from old pipes into the water supply .
