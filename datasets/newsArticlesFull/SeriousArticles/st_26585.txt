Hillary needs to make this one of her core arguments against Bernie , even more so than she did last night . The most interesting thing Hillary ' s now doing is to ( as one pundit put it ) " wrap herself in Obama . " I actually do give Clinton a lot of credit for her full throated defense of Obama ' s record and legacy , which ( in the larger sense ) is a rebuke of how Democrats ran for office in 2010 and 2014 . Defend Obamacare ( Hillary is telling the rest of the party ) , defend and praise Obama ' s record in general , and remind everyone why they voted for him in the first place . If Obama ' s approval with the public goes up , it will benefit Democrats all up and down the ballot next year .
