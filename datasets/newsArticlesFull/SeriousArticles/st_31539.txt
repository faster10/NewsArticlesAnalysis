Let ' s look at this another way . Imagine that there were a rash of threats targeted only at LGBT individuals , gay celebrities and gay youth under constant threat of rape and sexual violence . Or imagine this was happening to only people of color . When such hate fueled acts are targeted specifically at another historically oppressed group in our society , then they are seen for what they are , a hate based violation . And we would express outrage and rally to the defense of the victims of this crime .
