The Carolina Panthers are going to the Super Bowl , in part , thanks to Newton s amazing play . When it came to his passing game , he did throw the one interception , but he also completed passes to seven different men . Greg Olsen was as great as usual , leading the team with six receptions while tying for the most yards with 113 yards . Interestingly , it was little spoken of Corey Brown who also had 113 yards through the air and caught four passes . It was Brown s first game of his NFL career to break 100 yards , and he added a touchdown as well on an 86 yard touchdown catch and run in the first quarter .
