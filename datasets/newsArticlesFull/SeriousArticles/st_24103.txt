' I left the Navy to be with someone . It would not have worked out well . I would have been faced with periodic deployments given my specialty , and ( my partner ) didn ' t like the deployments , so I decided to leave . It ' s difficult to hide a gay relationship . When you ' re single , the fifth senior officer on the ship , and always being the one who shows up alone at formal functions , it ' s difficult to maintain a charade . I grew accustomed to the fear of what would happen if I were caught . But I also knew that if something did happen , I would not ever admit that I was gay , ' Larry Baxley says . The Washington , D . C . , native resigned from the Navy in 2005
