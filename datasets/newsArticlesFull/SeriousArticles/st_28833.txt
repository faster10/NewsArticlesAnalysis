? Russell Wilson errant snap recovery and pass to Tyler Lockett : Wilson admitted he was attempting an audible when the snap arrived early . With the Vikings dropping both safeties low to a Cover 0 all out blitz , Wilson was likely checking to a pass . The alignments suggest a post route to Jermaine Kearse to Wilson s left and the personnel suggests a deep shot to Doug Baldwin in the slot right . When the ball was snapped , the offensive line was not on the same page : the left side blocked left while the right side ( including center Patrick Lewis ) blocked right in what did not appear to be a pass blocking scheme .
