The budget deal reached by congressional leaders has much to recommend it . Its biggest virtue , assuming it s passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama , is that it will end the threat of a national default . The federal debt ceiling ? limiting the Treasury s ability to borrow ? will be waived until March 2017 . Similarly , the possibility of a government shutdown , while not eliminated , should be vastly reduced , because Congress will have an agreement on total spending . This makes it easier to pass individual spending bills .
