Vitali was badgered post fight by Lennox Lewis about if he would come out of what the defeated champion s brother called semi retirement to avenge his sibling . Vitali was non commital . Well into his 40s , it s likely the elder Klitschko will stay retired and focus on politics . And though Wladimir has a rematch clause in the fight contract , can anyone see him motivating himself to play the role of challenger and try to reclaim top spot after all these years . He himself turns 40 next year . We may have just seen the last Klitschko fight not just the last of their dominance .
