There s the tell . Are we really to think that the Republican Party establishment has already come to terms with losing this election ?

If the establishment was already prepared to lose the election , they d be better off going with Cruz to at least scratch the conservative movement s itch for one of their own as the nominee in order to prove that this path won t actually work .
