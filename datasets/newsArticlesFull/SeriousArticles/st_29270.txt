" The rebels were taking turns . There were too many to count . Every day , there was a new face . They zapped me with an electric stick on my legs and on my arms . They did that twice . They asked me questions when they did this . . . . They asked me again and hit me . I said ' No , I swear I didn ' t , ' so they started electrocuting me . They wanted me to confess but in the wrong way . They hit me every day . They used falaga ( beating on the bottom of the feet ) and hit me on my back , all over my body , and slapped my face . They did this three times . "
