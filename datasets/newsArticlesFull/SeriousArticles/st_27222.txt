In a new issue of Lena Dunham s newsletter , Lenny , Best Coast s Bethany Cosentino spoke out about her own experience : When I saw Amber s tweets , I knew I had to speak up , because Heathcliff has sexually harassed me too . I had never shared my story publicly because I was afraid of the backlash that I might receive or that I would come across like some kind of wrathful bitch . ? Cosentino went on to write an impassioned , powerful essay calling for an end to the double standards rampant in the music industry : People need to stop calling women bitches because they re strong and empowered . People need to stop calling me a slut for my public support of Planned Parenthood , an organization that has saved my life as well as many other men s and women s lives . People need to stop calling me a whiny baby because I write songs about heartache and my feelings . Did anyone call The Beatles whiny babies for singing the lyrics This boy wants you back again ?
