It is yet another ? one of Trump s ? ridiculous and unrealistic plans ( like deporting 11 million people ) , which he and his yes men advisors probably ? came up with while ? thinking of new ways to rile up his paranoid base .

As many , including President Obama , have pointed out , the Islamophobia that we have seen from Trump and other GOP candidates over the past month is one of the best recruiting tools for the Islamic State and other extremist groups .
