In the 80s , Bowie was also wealthier than ever . EMI paid him between 10 million and 17 million to make five albums . After Let s Dance , Bowie retreated to Switzerland to work and ski . His follow ups , 1984 s Tonight and 1987 s Never Let Me Down , were overproduced and underinspired . Bowie had abandoned the freaks for Let s Dance , and he had no idea how to get them back or how to keep his new Top 40 audience interested . I went mainstream in a major way with the song Let s Dance . I pandered to that in my next few albums , and what I found I had done was put a box around myself , he told an interviewer . It was very hard for people to see me as anything other than the person in the suit who did Let s Dance , and it was driving me mad ? because it took all my passion for experimenting away .
