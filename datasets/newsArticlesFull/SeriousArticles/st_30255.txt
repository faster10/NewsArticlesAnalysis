So although these elections are a step forward , a significant improvement on the manifestly rigged affair in 2010 , they should be seen for what they really are : A flawed , partial exercise in democracy that won t lead to the profound changes that people would almost certainly vote for if only they were given the opportunity . The polls should be supported . But the international community ? and especially those countries , such as Britain and the United States ? that have invested heavily , politically and financially in the reform programme ? should be pressing for the constitutional and institutional changes that will , eventually , make the real difference . It is clear from the experience of the last two years that , elections or not , the military is not going to give up power lightly in Myanmar , and will probably have to be bullied into doing so . In this context , these elections are just one more battle in a very long war .
