Books on tape are also a great bet for families who prefer the road to the skies . The story can become a shared experience because everyone , including the driver , can listen at the same time , assuming you can get the older kids to turn off their iPods . There are plenty of holiday stories , like " A Christmas Carol " performed by Jim Dale , who read the Harry Potter books so well , John Grisham ' s " Skipping Christmas " ( www . randomhouse . com audio ) read by Dennis Boutsikaris or Fannie Flagg reading her book " A Redbird Christmas , " which I just listened to on a long drive in Colorado . Also check out Brilliance Audio ( www . brillianceaudio . com ) for other titles like Adam Canfield ' s " Watch Your Back " about the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid middle school reporter .
