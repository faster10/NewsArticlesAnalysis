On the campaign trail , Biden ' s Catholicism expresses itself in public attendance at ethnic Catholic events like the St Patrick ' s Day parade in Pittsburgh . But he also recently took time out to eat ice cream with the nuns of Dubuque . Some interpreted this as a private " thank you " for the support many sisters have shown for Obamacare , contradicting the public position of their bishops . It ' s also notable that Biden ' s Catholicism was invoked by many commentators after his embrace of same sex marriage , as if he spoke for a generation of Catholics who have come to terms with social change . When it comes to the culture war , Biden enjoys a certain amount of soft power .
