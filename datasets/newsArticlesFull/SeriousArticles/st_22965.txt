10 . Was hoping that new Browns coach Hue Jackson was going to get his Raiders band back together after naming Al Saunders as offensive coordinator , but NFL Network s Albert Breer reported that Hal Hunter will be the Browns offensive line coach ? not Bob Wylie . He was Jackson s offensive line coach with the Raiders and was impressive in that job . With Bob as the coach , the offensive line outperformed the expectations of most , says then Raiders CEO Amy Trask . Bob is a sensational teacher who cares deeply for the players he coaches and while his coaching style is thought by some to be unique , it is tremendously effective .

His Raiders line in 2011 went from 29th in sacks to fourth , and finished seventh in rushing .
