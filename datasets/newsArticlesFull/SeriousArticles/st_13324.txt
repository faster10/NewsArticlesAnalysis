I implore you to not take the words of a few and depict the thoughts , hearts and motives of many . At the end of the day , Dr Martin Luther King Jr . proved with his nonviolent approach that hate filled words will not liberate anyone . To be sure , there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all . We continue to need someone who will hold us accountable to our best practices and not our worst . But there is no liberation without love , no prosperity without philanthropy and no hope if the church becomes immersed in the quagmire of pettiness .
