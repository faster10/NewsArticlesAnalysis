This is where terrorism is going . In an age of instantaneous , decentralized global communication , it s often difficult to ship supplies or people . But it s easy to transmit ideas . Governments can inspect cargo , prohibit migrants , and build Trump like walls along their borders , but they can t stop the flow of ideas . In the West , politicians often say this as a boast , as though the only irrepressible ideas are good ones . But killing infidels is just another message you can spread with a phone and an app . We can monitor networks of terrorists or extremists . But when the network never contacts the killer ? when the only connection between them is a susceptible mind hearing a worldwide plea ? how can we find and stop those who are about to strike ?
