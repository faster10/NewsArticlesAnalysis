Fuqua : Never . Never . Not in my time . I thought somewhere down the line it would happen , but not in my time because I still deal with racial situations . Sometimes people don ' t do it blatantly . They ' ll say something , or they ' ll behave a certain way when I know they don ' t normally behave that way . As a director , you run into walls where they say , " Well , it doesn ' t translate well overseas . You know , you need to have a white movie star in it . " There ' s some truth to that . So if Hollywood ' s not ready to embrace more stories about African Americans and that ' s based on the money that the movies make then would the country really be ready to embrace a president ? You know , the CEO of the country ? And obviously , we are . We are ready .
