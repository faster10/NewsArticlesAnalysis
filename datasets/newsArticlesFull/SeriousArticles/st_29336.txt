When Fassbender called from his trailer , he had just finished his last scene on his last day of filming for Assassin s Creed , which marks his first foray into producing . Looking back on the shoot , he feels confident about the film , largely thanks to many of his collaborators from Macbeth , who reteamed for this project . I really do think we ve got something original and special for this genre . Just in general , actually , it s been an amazing journey , he says . It s also great to be back working with director Justin Kurzel and Marion Cotillard and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw . We ve got a really good shorthand , so I was very pleased when they came on board . They ve been invaluable .
