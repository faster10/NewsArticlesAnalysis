What gives ? Mainly it ' s the calendar . Pennsylvania , which holds its presidential primary on April 26 , and New Jersey , which votes on June 7 , are about as far back on the primary schedule as you can get . A candidate who survives in the race that long will have plenty of time to campaign here in the spring , so why waste time in Pennsylvania or South Jersey now that they could be shaking hands in Iowa or New Hampshire ? ( Does anybody really know what time the Delaware primary is ? Does anybody really care ? )
