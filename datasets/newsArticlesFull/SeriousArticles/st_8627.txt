McCarron ' s championship past : Perhaps this point has been overplayed in the month since McCarron became the Bengals ' quarterback , but it still is a valid one . At every level of his football playing life , McCarron has been a winner . He won Little League championships , was his area ' s Punt , Pass Kick champion , led his middle and high school teams to titles and did the same in college at Alabama . The two time national champion simply doesn ' t have much of a history with losing . Much of that comes from the extra preparation that has long been a hallmark of his pregame approach . He ' s so intense when it comes to his preparation that some close to McCarron have joked about him breaking down film at home with his wife . No doubt , McCarron will be ready .
