Proposition 187 had been a major issue in California s gubernatorial election of 1994 . Republican governor Pete Wilson , who was running for a second term , was a vocal backer of the ballot initiative , which called for draconian punishments for illegal immigrants . As part of his re election campaign , Wilson ran this ad featuring some of the same elements that Trump uses in his spot twenty years later . There is black and white security camera footage of migrants running across what is presumably the border while a narrator congratulates Wilson for having the courage to say enough is enough to the scourge of illegal immigration . This is intercut with footage of Wilson dramatically gesticulating as he makes a point and somber white people nodding along in agreement .
