It is easy to forget , as Clinton is on the defensive for her speaking fees and donations from Wall Street , as she tries to find her footing in an anti establishment moment , that we have never had a woman president . And it may not matter much to many Sanders supporters , who argue that they support a woman president , just not this woman . But it s fair to say Clinton is caught in a Catch 22 . No woman but Clinton has ever come close to the presidency . But the very gravitas and experience that any women in public life is required to have in abundance , and the first female president in particular , is now being held against her . ?
