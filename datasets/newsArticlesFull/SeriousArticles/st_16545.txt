But here s the truth : the chances that Barack Obama will end this conflict in the 14 months remaining in his presidency are miniscule . He will almost certainly be handing things off to his successor , who might be Hillary Clinton , or Marco Rubio , or Donald Trump . Because they re running for president , they re naturally inclined to present themselves as having the answers to any problem no presidential candidate says , Honestly , this is complex and difficult to predict , so all we can do is try to make the best of an awful situation . Instead , they re going to tell you they know exactly what we ought to do , and just you wait until they re president , because then this whole thing will be taken care of .
