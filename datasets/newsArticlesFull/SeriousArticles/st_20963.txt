Trump s latest publicity seeking gambit will have a major impact on his chief rival in Iowa , Ted Cruz . Trump s absence will leave the Texas senator as the only front runner on stage ? something that should earn him a few more broadsides from his polling challenged rivals than he otherwise might have faced . Most of his fellow GOP hopefuls will have other things on their minds ( namely : each other ) , but Cruz s current position in New Hampshire will be more than enough of a reason to attack him . If Rubio and co . do train their fire on the Texan in unison , it would remind viewers at home just how few friends Ted has among his fellow Republicans , something Trump has taken great pleasure pointing out in the past few weeks . Normally , Cruz would wear that as an anti establishment badge of honor , but that becomes an awkward proposition now that he s trying to convince Iowa Republicans that they should caucus for him for the good of every GOP candidate not named Trump .
