Ross Tucker , Sports on Earth : " The goal of the medical timeout is to avoid a Julian Edelman situation from this past Super Bowl , when the Patriots wide receiver stayed in the game even though he was pretty clearly a little woozy from a big hit he took on a pass over the middle . If officials don ' t stop the game in Keenum ' s situation , when will they ? The NFL will take a lot of heat for what happened Sunday , and rightfully so . But I think it ' d be foolish to only look in the league ' s direction . Did the officials standing right there not see that Keenum was having an issue ? If Foles started warming up , why didn ' t a trainer or somebody for the Rams at least tell the officials they needed to check on Keenum ? Is the ATC spotter just watching the field , or does he she have an ability to look and listen to the monitors as well ? One look at the replay was enough to know a concussion was highly likely . The NFL is a rough , violent game . Players are going to get banged up and get up slowly at times . Should the action be stopped every time a player gets up slowly ? Of course not . Should somebody stop the action when the back of the quarterback ' s head slams the turf ? Absolutely . There is a gray area in terms of when the action could or should be stopped , but by any measure or casual observation , Keenum ' s situation called for a whistle . If officials genuinely believed Keenum was OK , the NFL needs to go back to the drawing board regarding this process . And they need to do it soon , before a concussed player like Keenum suffers a second blow to the head that could prove disastrous . "
