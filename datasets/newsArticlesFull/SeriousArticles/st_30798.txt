Part of the reason that the Packers passing game , which ranks 23rd , has struggled is that No . 1 receiver Jordy Nelson has been out all season after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a preseason game . It also doesn t help that leading receiver Randall Cobb has been charged with seven dropped passes , including five in the last four games , by Pro Football Focus . Rodgers has hooked up with Cobb , who has 53 receptions , only 56 . 4 percent of the time that he targeted him .
