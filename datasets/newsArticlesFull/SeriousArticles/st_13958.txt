Running Back : Darren McFadden fumbled twice , and was unable to convert a third down and goal at the one with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter , which would have given the Cowboys a 13 9 lead . It was tough sledding trying to run against Washington s big defensive front , and he made an absolutely boneheaded decision to run out of bounds and stop the clock when the Cowboys were set up to run time off and win the game without giving the ball back to Washington . McFadden finished with 53 yards on 14 carries and a touchdown , while Robert Turbin added 12 yards on six carries . ?
