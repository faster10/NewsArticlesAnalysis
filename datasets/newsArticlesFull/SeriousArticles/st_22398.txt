The thing that really gets Romney exercised in these debates is when he thinks he ' s not getting his due , which means he wastes far too much time demanding another minute or the final say or a chance to go back to something from a previous answer . Romney may believe this assertiveness makes him look strong and in command . More likely it reinforces a negative perception that the candidate needs to dispel : that of a plutocrat grabbing every last crumb he thinks he deserves . The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself .
