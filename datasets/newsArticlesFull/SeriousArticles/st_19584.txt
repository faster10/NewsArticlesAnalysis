I was in the pit in the front , it was a concert where the music was loud , I heard cracking noises , I turned around , and I saw a figure with a baseball cap by the door in the back , he was shooting in my direction . People started to fall and throw themselves on the ground . I thought that the guy next to me was dead . I think that ' s the case . I ran , I jumped the barrier and I got out in the first movement of the crowd by the stage . I got out through the emergency exit on the opposite end of the room . We took refuge in a cafe , barricaded on the second floor . People believed us right away . It ' s a war here , there was gunfire again just recently , we can only hear sirens , we ' re waiting to be evacuated in a cafe on Boulevard du Calvaire .
