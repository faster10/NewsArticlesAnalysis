As Donald Trump leads yet another national poll , the New York Times ' Jonathan Martin asks a question that has consumed the political world : Can anyone inside the Republican Party via negative TV ads or a scorched earth campaign stop Trump ? And if so , do they even have the will do it ? " Almost everyone in the party ' s upper echelons agrees something must be done , and almost no one is willing to do it , " Martin writes . ( Where have we heard that one before ? Sounds a lot like foreign policy in the Middle East , right ? ) But here is our follow up question : Even if there ' s the will to take down Trump , can you do it when there is almost perfect information out there about him ? After all , you can ' t say that Trump ' s background , claims , and positions have gone unchallenged over the past six months . And he has perfect name identification in our NBC WSJ polls : All Americans know who he is . When past presidential insurgents have failed see Howard Dean , Herman Cain , or Ben Carson ( at least for now ) it ' s been because voters get new information about them . But what new information stops Trump ? And does it even exist ?
