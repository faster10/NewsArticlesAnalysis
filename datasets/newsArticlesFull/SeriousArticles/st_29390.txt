" Every single statement in the lawsuit is either false , meritless , or both , " said Matthew Goforth , a Birmingham based attorney hired for the museum . " It is sad that Harper Lee ' s greedy handlers have seen fit to attack the non profit museum in her hometown that has been honoring her legacy and the town ' s rich history associated with that legacy for over 20 years . Unfortunately for Harper Lee , those handlers are doing nothing but squandering her money with this lawsuit . The museum is squarely within its rights to carry out its mission as it always has . "
