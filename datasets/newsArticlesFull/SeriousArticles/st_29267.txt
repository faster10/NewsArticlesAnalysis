No . 15 LSU lost a third straight game for the first time since 1999 , and it was not pretty as it fell to Ole Miss , 38 17 , Saturday at Vaught Hemingway Stadium after falling behind 24 0 in the second quarter . The offensive line had two true freshman and one redshirt freshman in the lineup due to injuries . It prompted questions about Miles , the recent success of the team ( last four years ) and whether or not Miles would be coaching for his job in the remaining games . A very good season for a lot of teams .
