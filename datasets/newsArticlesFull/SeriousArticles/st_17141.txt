" Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close " fared about as expected during its wide release into 2 , 630 theaters . The 9 11 drama , adapted from Jonathan Safran Foer ' s novel of the same name , found a lukewarm 10 . 5 million this weekend , yielding a mild 4 , 010 per theater average . Audiences generally liked the Warner Bros . picture , giving it an " A " CinemaScore grade , but unless " Extremely Loud " garners a surprising slew of Oscar nominations next week , it ' s doubtful that the film will climb to impressive numbers . In 2006 , another 9 11 themed film , " United 93 , " opened with a similar 11 . 5 million , and despite good reviews ( much better than " Extremely Loud ' s , " in fact ) , it only found 31 . 5 million overall . A similar result seems likely in this case .
