For intellectual guidance , I ' m turning to the work of the late philosopher John Rawls , whose 1971 book " A Theory of Justice " was written about eight years before this rich poor gap in the United States started to widen . Rawls argues , in a roundabout way , that a society is unfair if its citizens would not agree to be randomly reassigned to another income class . Michael Norton , an associate professor at Harvard , explained it to me this way : Imagine you ' re moving to a new country , but when you do , you will randomly be assigned to any income level that currently exists in that society .
