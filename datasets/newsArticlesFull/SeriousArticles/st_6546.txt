Rebel maverick troll Donald Trump is now overtly running against Hillary Clinton rather than his Republican opponents , and presumably does not need Saudi oil money . Does that mean he is willing to buck the trend on this question , and cut through the Gordian knot that ties us to the worst country in the world ? Not exactly . Trump wants a seat on the Saudi gravy train along with everybody else . But give him credit for being too clueless , or too unschooled in the language of politics , to lie about the nature of the transaction .
