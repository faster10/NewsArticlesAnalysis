But " Crystal Skull " was directed by Steven Spielberg , who has almost certainly earned the right to strike out every now and then . Spielberg has been producing great , complex , entertaining Hollywood fare for 40 years now . You don ' t just pick out your favorite Spielberg film you pick out your favorite Spielberg phase . Do you prefer the " Classic " era , from 1975 ( " Jaws " ) to 1982 ( " E . T . " ) ? Or perhaps the underrated " Weird " period , from 1984 ( " Temple of Doom " ) to 1991 ( " Hook " ) , which also includes Spielberg ' s work as the producer of " Gremlins , " " The Goonies , " and " Back to the Future " ? Some people dig the " Revival " period , when he made the " important " trilogy ( " Schindler ' s List , " " Amistad , " " Saving Private Ryan " ) and mixed in a couple " Jurassic Park " movies , why not ?
