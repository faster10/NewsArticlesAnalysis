That same month , Sia released " Cheap Thrills , " a song she had originally written for Rihanna . " Her manager said , ' We want ' Diamonds . ' We need soul . We want some music that has feeling . ' I went to producer and songwriter Greg Kurstin , and that ' s what we came up with , " Sia told Rolling Stone . " I realized just as soon as I was cutting it that it sounded a little bit too Brit pop for her . It ' s more Icona Pop . We did actually send it to her , but they passed on it , and then I just couldn ' t stop listening to it in the car . "
