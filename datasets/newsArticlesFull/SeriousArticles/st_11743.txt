The fact that they have won 16 straight might be less impressive than how they ve done it . During this span , the Warriors have outscored opponents by an average of 15 . 6 points . They ve spent greater time leading by more than 15 ( 167 minutes ) than they ve spent trailing by any margin ( 149 minutes ) . They refrain from playing their best lineup all that often the death lineup composed of Curry , Iguodala , Klay Thompson , Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green because they don t really need to . We ve only seen 62 minutes of that look this season , and during that rationed time the five have outscored foes by a whopping 87 points .
