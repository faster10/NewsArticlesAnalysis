We must seize this moment in history to renew our national commitment to protecting public health by passing strong tobacco control laws . The most effective ways to help people quit smoking and keep children from starting the deadly habit are by consistently and significantly increasing tobacco taxes , passing comprehensive smoke free laws that protect all workers from secondhand smoke and fully funding programs that help people quit tobacco and prevent others from starting . Lawmakers at all levels of government must make a priority of these policies to end death and suffering from tobacco use .
