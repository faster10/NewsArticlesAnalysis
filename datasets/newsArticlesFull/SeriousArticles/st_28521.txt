" I think we ' re a good team , " he said . " But I don ' t think we ' re a great team right now . We ' ve got to continue to get better . I really think it ' s absurd to think about May and June it ' s not guaranteed , man . If we continue to win and put ourselves in position and we do make the playoffs , then we give ourselves a chance . . . . But that doesn ' t guarantee you anything . One shot here , one shot there , a turnover here , a turnover there , can change a series . So for me , to focus on down that road when tomorrow isn ' t promised , I think , is absurd . "
