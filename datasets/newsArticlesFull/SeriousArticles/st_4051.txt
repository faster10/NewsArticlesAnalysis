The choice before us couldn t be clearer . On the one hand is the US that flouts international law , claims that it is exceptional and therefore entitled to world domination through any means , from military interventions to proxy insurgencies in sovereign countries . It likes to dictate its allies , using them , and American citizens , as pawns in its deceptive double games . On the other hand , leading a host of emerging powers , is President Putin who stands for respecting the legal international order and sovereignty of other nations , international cooperation in fighting the world wide terrorist threat and non state militants , dialogue and accommodation of conflicting interests and larger public welfare over corporate interests .
