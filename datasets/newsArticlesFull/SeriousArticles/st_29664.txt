Many are expecting the USDP to be electorally annihilated some USDP candidates , including Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann , have stated as much . There is concern that without a safety net for the first time in its rule , the USDP will maneuver to halt the NLD ' s march to governing power . Additionally , the military has , despite assurances that it will recognize the election results and work with the new government , undertaken efforts to highlight its position of power and concern for the direction of the country , most notably with the quashing of recent constitutional amendment efforts and taking an unofficial yet active role in the purging of Speaker Shwe Mann from the USDP . The current election could play out similarly to 1990 , either with a delay of official results , perhaps due to contested seats being deemed " too close to call , " or if the military and USDP counter with a deal to amend the constitution or election rules to make the contest more fair . Though such scenarios are unlikely , given the effort the government has put into the contest , precedents in Myanmar ' s past , as well recent examples from neighboring countries such as Thailand , make this scenario worth preparing for .
