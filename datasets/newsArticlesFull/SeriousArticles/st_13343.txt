After Samu Manoa had made his 100th appearance for Northampton last weekend , he was congratulated by club mate Tom Wood on Twitter , as he prepared to return home to America to take on the All Blacks . The flanker no doubt spoke for the entire England squad when he said : ' Good luck next weekend , soften them up for us . ' The USA will go toe to toe with the world champions in front of a sell out crowd of 62 , 000 at Soldier Field , Chicago , tomorrow , a week before New Zealand face Stuart Lancaster ' s men at Twickenham . Realistically , the Eagles can ' t hope to beat the Kiwis , but they can throw a spanner in the works by targeting Sonny Bill Williams on his return to union , or shackling Dan Carter when he emerges from the bench for his Test comeback . This fixture is a potentially momentous occasion in the history of USA rugby , so the hosts can benefit from it hugely in the long term , but in the short term they could also help Europe ' s leading nations by further slowing the All Black juggernaut .
