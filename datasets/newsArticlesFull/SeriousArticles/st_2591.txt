" There were times when I was like , ' Why am I pulled so strongly to be a voice , to not keep my mouth shut ? Why can t I just keep my mouth shut , take the job , take the money and walk like everyone else ? ' , Rodriguez told The Huffington Post . ? " But if I don t speak up , I m just going to what ? Sit around and complain and hope that somebody else will ? , " she added . " No . I wasn t raised like that . If I want change , then I ' ve got to do it . And if I want to do it , I ' ve got to be that change . And that takes sacrifices that sometimes don t pay the bills , you know ? And I m OK with that . " ? ? ?
