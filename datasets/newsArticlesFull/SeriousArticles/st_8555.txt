Where to begin ? ? It s bad enough that Clinton seems to think that the gender breakdown of her donors ? has anything to do with the fact that she s Wall Street s favored candidate among the Democrats . But to invoke terrorist attacks and the subsequent rebuilding as any sort of ? defense for Wall Street having such potential influence is unbelievably tone deaf at best , and wildly offensive at worst . ? It s one thing to invoke Sept . 11 , 2001 in the context of the Paris attacks or in a discussion about foreign policy and national security in general . But on issues not obviously connected , Sept . 11 has its own Godwin s Law : The first person to evoke it immediately loses the debate . It won t stop her from winning the nomination , but this was far from Clinton s finest moment .
