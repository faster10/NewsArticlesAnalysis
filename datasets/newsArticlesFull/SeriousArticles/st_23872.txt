The elephant in the room is the simple fact that we must stop flying . It ' s the most polluting thing the ordinary person can do . But nobody is willing to admit it they want their holidays , no matter what . I recently attended here in Tasmania a tourism conference at which a golden future was heavily spruiked , particularly by the CEO of Qantas , all hanging on having over a million tourists flying in . Not one of those businesses wants to know the reality that they are actively contributing to destroying the very air our grandchildren will need to breathe . No amount of dollars is worth that but when will we actually change our life styles accordingly ?
