RuPaul : You know , I didn ' t think it would get to this point . I knew that there were people who absolutely loved drag and drag is their life , and I knew that there were people who understood drag . There are so many other layers to it , just by the nature of the beast . But I didn ' t know it would become such a cult hit , and sometimes it is disappointing because , yeah , there are shows that get 15 million viewers and our biggest audience is sometimes 1 . 5 million , maybe . But honestly , I ' d rather have that 1 . 5 million of devoted fans , who live and breathe this show , than the other . I ' m happy at Logo . They let us do so much . They give us free reign , and I couldn ' t ask for anything more .
