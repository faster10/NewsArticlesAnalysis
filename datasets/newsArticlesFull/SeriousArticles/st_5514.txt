I adored Alan Rickman from an early age for his bigger , more widely known roles and became more interested in his more off the beaten track work , such as the incredible Snow Cake film he did with Sigourney Weaver in 2006 . As a depressed teenager , often in and out of hospital with frequent , fraught experiences with social services , I wrote him a short letter telling him how his films brought some joy and escapism to my life . With a remarkably quick turnaround came a very encouraging , kind letter back and a signed photo . Thankfully , nearly ten years later , my life has turned around . I will remember this man and his kindness , creativity and compassion fondly for the rest of my life . I only hope he realised the comfort his humility brought to people like me all around the world .
