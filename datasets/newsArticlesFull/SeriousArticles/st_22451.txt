To a large degree , Clinton s black outreach ? premised on his background and his cultural familiarity ? was symbolic . Put frankly , Clinton felt comfortable around black people and never tried to hide it . On the other hand , however , he never promised to directly address black interests and he ? after winning the nomination ? tried to distance himself from black activists ( e . g . the Sistah Souljah moment ) . But symbolic politics is potent , and black voters stuck with Clinton through the general election .
