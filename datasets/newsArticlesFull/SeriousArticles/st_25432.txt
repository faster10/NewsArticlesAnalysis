This tailored approach to differentiation will need to build on the notion of self differentiation , in which countries implicitly place themselves along a spectrum of actions through their climate pledges . Such an approach can be accomplished through a mix of implicit and explicit signals to guide the self differentiation process . For example , India could use a key idea at Paris ? the progression principle that each country moves over time to ever more ambitious pledges ? to argue that progression should be based on current starting points which reflect developed and developing countries differences . We could also call for the idea of progression to apply not only to mitigation but also to obligations related to support ( finance and technology ) , as this will ensure that developing countries have increasing levels of support as they take on more ambitious efforts . Other aspects may need to be more explicitly addressed . In mitigation , for example , it would be useful if the agreement were to explicitly articulate the notion of developed country leadership , and that developing countries such as India will approach the climate challenge within the context of sustainable development . Such provisions will provide India the necessary reference points to appropriately safeguard development interests . And when located in the context of the progression principle , this helps meet the political objective of sending a signal that India supports an effective climate agreement .
