Over the years , Russian officials have looked for opportunities in the media to portray Russia as helpful and constructive even when it was not . They attempted to use Russian television , and later the Internet , to brandish a better image in the West creating a news agency , RIA ( The Russian Agency for International Information ) which operates 80 news bureaus around the world and Russia Today which boasts a following of 630 million people in over 100 countries . The Russians are also fans of inserting newspaper supplements of Russia Today in American newspapers just to remind readers of their relevance .
