It is every bit as stressful as I thought It would be , said Buescher , who drives the No . 60 Roush Fenway Racing Ford Mustang . It s always difficult . There s a tremendous depth of talent in this series and through all the NASCAR series . It makes it that much more special , knowing that we beat some of the best guys coming up through this sport right now . To be able to pull it off at the end is a very special , very humbling experience . It s not easy . This is a very difficult thing to get .
