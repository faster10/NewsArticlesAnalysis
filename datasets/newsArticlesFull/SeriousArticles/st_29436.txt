Tom Fornelli , college football writer : I took Alabama because , let ' s be honest , the Tide just feels like a death machine right now . It ' s impossible to pick against them , particularly with the way Jake Coker has played the last three games . He ' s completed 73 . 2 percent of his passes for 669 yards , five touchdowns and no interceptions . Those aren ' t " Air Raid " numbers . . . but in Alabama ' s offense ? When you already have to worry about stopping Derrick Henry ? Clemson ' s definitely good enough to keep things close , and I ' m sure it will , which is why I ' m taking it against the spread . But as for who will win , well , Roll Tide and all that .
