8 . Better camera . Isn ' t 3 megapixels usually better than 2 ? Generally , yes . But Apple also added the ability to take close up ( macro ) shots , and an intuitive autofocus feature . Simply tap the area on the screen you want to be in focus , then take your shot . And before I forget , a friend told me that if you wanted to take a picture of yourself ( with the screen facing the other direction ) , tap and hold the " snapshot " icon . Flip the screen away and when you ' re ready to shoot , simply lift your finger from the trigger . Thanks , David !
