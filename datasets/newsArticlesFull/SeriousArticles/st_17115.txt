That seems to me , as the father of two underage college students , the right age for drinking to be legal . By then , when most students are sophomores , one year of college will be in the bag , with the awkward but necessary social adjustments mostly accomplished . Instead of students continuously lusting after the forbidden fruit of alcohol and sneaking around furtively with bottles of vodka and rum and then quickly guzzling them in an effort to get limbered up to be able to " hook up " with one ' s peers , perhaps a more , shall we say , refined and responsible approach to alcohol can prevail on campus .
