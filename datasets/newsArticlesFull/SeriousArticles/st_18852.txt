I love what I do . I have a great time on the field . This is all I ve ever done , Collins said during Saturday s workout at Citi Field . Buck Showalter has never won . And I consider Buck one of the best managers in the game . And I don t think that s ever going to change . I was very excited when Jim Leyland , who you guys know is so close to me , when he won in Miami . I was with him and watched what a good manager he was in Pittsburgh , and then he went through all those tough years and he finally got the chance . But you know what ? I always thought , This guy is still a great manager , no matter if he won the World Series or not , or got to there .
