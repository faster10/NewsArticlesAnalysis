All bets about Pep Guardiola s next move in football were off after Manchester City confirmed that the hottest managerial property in world football will join the Premier League club on a three year contract from next season . The decision leaves current City coach Manuel Pellegrini in a potentially awkward limbo until the end of the season , though the Chilean seemed sanguine : The club are not doing anything behind me , I knew this one month ago , but I don t think it s good to have rumour or speculation about these things , he said . City , meanwhile , have been drawn away to Chelsea in the standout tie of the FA Cup fifth round after the previous round produced few shocks . Chelsea did have a little surprise for their veteran captain John Terry , however the club are releasing him at the end of the season . Meanwhile , desperate clubs plonked huge piles of cash in front of players of varying quality as the midwinter transfer window closed . Newcastle spent ? 12m on temperamental Spurs winger Andros Townsend , while Everton splashed out ? 13 . 5m on Senegal striker Oumar Niasse
