Rubio is bland and the polls of Republican voters show it . He s been slowly building up his numbers , but he s still lurking under 10 percent in national polls . Republican voters , if they think about this debate at all , will likely focus on the quickly forming myth that the CNBC moderators were out to get the candidates , and not on Rubio s performance . Actual liberal media , such as the New Republic , tends to see Rubio as an empty suit , a bunch of glib mannerisms covering for the fact that he s an incurious person with little interest in actual policy or issues . His unwillingness to show up for votes only reinforces this narrative . ? Marco Rubio doesn t inspire much passion in anyone , it seems . Conservatives are bored by him , but so are liberals .
