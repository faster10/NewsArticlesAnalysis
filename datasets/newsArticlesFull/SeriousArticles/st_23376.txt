I don ' t really agree with the more dramatic visions of a nightmare future in Syria that ' s something between " Mad Max " and the Taliban . I think it ' s going to be a much more watered down version of that . I think there ' s an optimism , perhaps amongst many Syrians , that they are educated , moderate in terms of the Islamic values they have . And remember also , this wasn ' t really a rebellion started over Islamic principles . It is not Iran or Afghanistan . This was about trying to reject what they saw as a corrupt and repressive regime . . . .
