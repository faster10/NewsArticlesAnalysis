Relativity ' s " Immortals " became the new box office titan , fending off competition and scoring a strong 32 million opening . While that number pales in comparison to the openings of 300 ( 70 . 8 million ) and " Clash of the Titans " ( 61 . 2 mil ) , it puts " Immortals " ahead of other swords and sandals debuts like " Prince of Persia " ( 30 . 1 mil ) and " Alexander " ( 13 . 7 mil ) . The Tarsem Singh directed visual feast , which stars Henry Cavill and Freida Pinto , also revives the ancient epic genre ' s viability in 2011 after flop openings from " The Eagle " ( 8 . 7 mil ) and " Conan the Barbarian " ( 10 mil ) .
