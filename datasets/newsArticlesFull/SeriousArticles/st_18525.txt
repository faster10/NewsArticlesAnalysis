About the recent column on the editorial page about keeping the first round blank in a policeman ' s gun : This doesn ' t make sense to me . A blank will do nothing except cause problems . A blank at close range can be as deadly as a bullet . If you ' re shooting at close range and the other party has any tactical weapon , particularly a knife , you ' re in serious trouble . You wasted your first shot and might not get a second one . There ' s an old rule in gunfighting : If they get within 21 feet of you , you better be shooting or you ' re going to be in trouble . Police officers do what they ' re supposed to do and what they were trained to do ? shoot . I ' m wondering why people make such a point of this .
