We now risk a vote to leave the EU . This is ironic because the EU used to represent shared values and social solidarity . That the union has become increasingly neoliberal and dysfunctional has much to do with policies promoted by every UK government since 1979 . Having corrupted the club , a vote for Brexit would suggest in Groucho Marxian terms I don t want to be a member of a club that would accept me as a member . This produces the bizarre prospect that pro Europeans at home and abroad may derive grim satisfaction from a vote to leave . Brexit could lance the union s Anglo Saxon boil , enabling it to recover its purpose . Some in continental capitals may share this assessment , meaning Cameron s sham renegotiation will fail . The EU may recover but Britain ( or what s left of it ) will become ever more the captive state , the plaything of rightwing ideologues and corporate interests .
