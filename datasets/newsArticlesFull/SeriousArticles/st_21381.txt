On April 26 of this year , we launched the first switchable battery electric taxi project in Tokyo . With the support of the Japanese government , we ' ve partnered with Nihon Kotsu , Tokyo ' s largest taxi operator , to show what ' s possible in a rigorous environment with cars that drive almost continuously . Tokyo has much to gain from this : The city ' s 60 , 000 taxis may only represent 2 percent of all cars in the city , but they are responsible for 20 percent of emissions . If the switch works for taxis , imagine how it can work for average drivers .
