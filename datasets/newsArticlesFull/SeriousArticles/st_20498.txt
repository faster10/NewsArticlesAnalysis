Just to see greatness up front is always a nice thing , it s exciting . These guys are their idols . They got to watch how they work , how serious they are , and ironically , a lot of stuff they do , we re trying to do . Maybe most importantly , this Warriors team , this was a process to get to where they are . That s our biggest message to our guys . You don t just show up and be good . Each and every Warriors individual , they paid the price to get on top . That process , while you go through it , is excruciating and frustrating , but when you hang in there , it s way worth it .
