I think what we said is we wanted to be out of business with him , Greenblatt said . We had a couple businesses that we were doing with him ? ? Apprentice and the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants . We got out of both of those businesses and that was ? July , when most of us thought he would be sort of waltzing into the background of the political arena . And lo and behold , ? he s now ? the frontrunner . The poll numbers are astounding , ? and he s everywhere . He s on every news show , every morning show , every nightly show , every cable news show . He s been on Colbert , he s been on Fallon . He was on SNL and I think that reconciles quite easily with ? ? we re not in business with him , ? but he s one of the most , love it or not , one of the most important political figures of our time , ? and he s on our shows .
