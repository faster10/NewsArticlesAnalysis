All this has made Clinton s presidential campaign somewhat vulnerable to attacks from the left . So has the record of her husband , former President Bill Clinton , who signed into law two anti gay measures : don t ask , don t tell ( DADT ) , the military s former ban on openly gay service members and the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , which defined marriage as the union between one man and one woman at the federal level . Clinton also signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , a measure that was intended to protect religious minorities from unnecessary government intrusion , but has in recent years inspired a wave of anti LGBT legislation that would essentially sanction discrimination on religious grounds . Several Republican presidential candidates have vowed to protect religious freedom if elected , widely interpreted today to mean they would protect the right of business owners ? or in some cases , government officials ? to turn away gay and lesbian couples based on religious objections to same sex marriage .
