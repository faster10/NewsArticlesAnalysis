After the court decided United States v . Windsor in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the Defense of Marriage Act , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same sex marriage .

Supporters of the existing laws went to the Supreme Court and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place .
