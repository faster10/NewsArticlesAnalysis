In the series ' finale , Durst appeared to admit complicity in the crimes he was linked to , muttering : " What the hell did I do ? Killed them all , of course " in a bathroom off camera without realized he was still wearing his microphone . While this apparent confession will likely be inadmissible in court , the show did much to convict Durst in the court of public opinion . He has since been arrested and charged with Berman ' s murder . Durst , who has been a suspect in the 1982 disappearance of his ex wife and was exonerated in another murder in 2001 , has denied killing Berman .
