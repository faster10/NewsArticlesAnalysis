Americans might find it surprising that many North Korean officials take a nonideological view of foreign affairs . Indeed , we would call them realists . They are well aware of their national interests and are dedicated to safeguarding them , a dedication that is based on a keen understanding of the outside world . A case in point : At one meeting , I was sitting next to a well connected North Korean official who wanted to talk about Hillary Clinton s book It Takes a Village . ( I was embarrassed to say I had not read it . ) The North Koreans have demonstrated to me during many meetings that they are well versed in the particulars of political , economic and other developments in China , South Korea and Japan .
