Another test of spatial perception involved a picture of a clear plastic cup with a horizontal water line in the middle . It was shown to 67 men and 55 women . Then they were shown a single page with four images of the cup tipped and the water line at varying angles . They were asked to identify the correct image , which showed the water line in the tipped cup parallel to the ground . This task also has been shown to be easier for men and also may be related to certain navigation skills . In the new study , the men also were significantly better at it than the women .
