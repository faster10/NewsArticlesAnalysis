Flowers , candles and other tributes began piling up on Saturday at the site of the attacks , which ranged from the Stade de France sports stadium just outside Paris to two restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall in the heart of the city . Although authorities have advised people to stay home , many are gathering at Place de la Republique to light candles to pay tribute to the victims . Place de la Republique was the site where the unity march began in January after 12 staffers were shot and killed at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo .
