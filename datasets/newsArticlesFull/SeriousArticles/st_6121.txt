In 2008 , al Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister ' s Dawa Party , and even Shiite militia members from the south . A number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with al Maliki loyalists . The moves were made to marginalize Sunnis and Kurds in the north and entrench al Maliki ' s regime and the Dawa Party ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009 , 2010 and 2013 .
