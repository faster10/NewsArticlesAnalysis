Trump , more than any other candidate , has had his way with the media . When it became clear the business magnate was a ratings magnet , the usual rules of engagement were suspended . For one thing , Trump got to call in to the most prestigious news shows , when other candidates had to show up in studio . Besides Trump s well known war against Fox News host Megyn Kelly , the Trump campaign also banned journalists from The New York Times , Buzzfeed , Fusion , The Des Moines Register , and The Huffington Post from covering Trump events .
