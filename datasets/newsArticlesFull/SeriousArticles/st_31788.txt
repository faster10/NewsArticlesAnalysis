Yeah , I know Washington s political class is still nervously convincing themselves that this cannot last with each inappropriate word uttered by Trump ( even as these same political insiders begin to concede the possibility of supporting Trump because there is no way they re going to support Ted Cruz ) . But as voters begin to head to caucus , the reality remains ? that they have lifted the Trump campaign above the others because it has been his campaign that has most closely reflected their mood . And they believe he , more than the others , will do something about the Washington establishment ? on both sides . We ll see .
