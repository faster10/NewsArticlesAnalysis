PB : Deploying troops will make everything worse . Keeping fighting forces whether elite or not on the ground , having planes in the sky bombing whether they are Russian or American planes is making everything worse and not better . There is no military solution to the war in Syria and Iraq . And pretending that somehow we can say that , as President Obama does over and over again , and yet acting as if there is a military solution and we are going to do it meaning sending troops , sending elite trainers , bombing , drone strikes , etc . makes all of the other possibilities that are so necessary whether it is diplomacy , negotiations , greater humanitarian support ? none of those things are possible as long as we are carrying out military activities . There has to be an end to the militarism , then we can go about the process of new negotiations to end this war .
