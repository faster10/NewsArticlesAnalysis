Public Enemy frontman Chuck D and LL Cool J teamed up to induct the Beastie Boys . " They still are one of the greatest live acts in music , " said Chuck D . " They challenged the conventions in the music business and made up their own rules about what it means to be world class hip hop cats . . . They always insisted ( on ) maturing as musicians and human beings . " LL Cool J said that he owes his entire career to the Beasties . " I wouldn ' t be here today without them , " he said . " The Beastie Boys actually played my demo for Rick Rubin in his NYU dorm room . A lot of people don ' t know that . "
