I think the second factor is that there are political issues around what ' s happening in those markets . There ' s uncertainty we ' ve all seen what ' s happening in Libya . It ' s places like Bangladesh and Pakistan a significant population in both countries , and particularly in the case of Pakistan , a case of instability in the last 10 to 20 years . If that ever gets resolved , who knows ? That could be a very fertile land for growth . And there ' s obviously India in the middle , which is not an Islamic country but again has a huge Muslim population , which is a potential growth area .
