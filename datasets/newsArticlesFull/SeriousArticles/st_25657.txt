With a capacity of just over 98 , 000 , the Nou Camp which simply means " new field " in Catalan is the largest stadium in Europe and an absolute must to visit for any football fan . Only 50 years old , the stadium stands like a shining beacon , dominating its surroundings . Despite its size , the high over hanging stands somehow still manage to give an enclosed , intimidating feeling , although the locals ' displeasure at a bad display ( cue the waving of white hankies ) can give the stadium an eerie feeling when things are not going Barca ' s way .
