The truth is I can see the massive benefits of Cooper wanting to secure his professional standing before coming out . As a nationally beloved commentator , he ' ll successfully test the hearts and minds of viewers who may not be comfortable with homosexuality but respect and admire him . He couldn ' t have managed that had he come out before amassing a large and loving audience . The political impact of him revealing his same sex preferences now , as opposed to when his career first launched , are far greater . But even now that he ' s out , I can ' t quite put away the idea that there ' s something wildly subversive and compelling about people who refuse firm categorization .
