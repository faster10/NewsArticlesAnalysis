It is clear that Christie is trying to stake out a position as a social moderate in an attempt to differentiate himself from many of his more conservative Republican rivals . But he is not averse to taking a hard line policy stance on many issues , particularly in foreign policy . It remains to be seen how this will play out in New Hampshire . In this vein , his biggest rivals may be Jeb ! and Kasich , two other big state governors who have relatively moderate positions among Republicans on social issues , but who are also adopting a get tough foreign policy . But in contrast to both of their more laid back demeanors , Christie exudes a brashness and edge that many in yesterday s audience seemed to appreciate , although one person did question whether that temperament was most conducive to dealing with foreign leaders . Christie s response was classic : I have a lot of clubs in my bag . When the media covers me they usually focus on when I use my driver . But when I get close to a policy objective , I can use the pitching wedge .
