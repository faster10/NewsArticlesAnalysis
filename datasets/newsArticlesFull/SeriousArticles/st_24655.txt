Based out of the site near the town called Truth or Consequences , Project SkyBender is using drones to experiment with millimetre wave radio transmissions , one of the technologies that could underpin next generation 5G wireless internet access . High frequency millimetre waves can theoretically transmit gigabits of data every second , up to 40 times more than today s 4G LTE systems . Google ultimately envisages thousands of high altitude self flying aircraft delivering internet access around the world .
