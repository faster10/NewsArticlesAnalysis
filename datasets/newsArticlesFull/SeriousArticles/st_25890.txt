In corporate America , blacks and other minorities are as invisible as black actors are in Hollywood . We rarely see an African American in a top level job at a high tech firm . Increasingly , minorities are becoming invisible in the newsrooms of daily newspapers and TV stations . On major college campuses , the number of African American professors lags far behind whites . Even the military , once a threshold to the middle class , has seen declining numbers of African Americans in its ranks . And we all know the problems that have resulted from a shortage of minorities in our police departments .
