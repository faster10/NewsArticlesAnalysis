Last week " Straight Outta Compton " and " Ride Along 2 " producer Will Packer wrote this on Facebook : " The academy ' s voting record is only part of the issue . These films performances and the scripts that drive them often go into development YEARS before they are released and thus in Oscar contention . We need more content produced by , written by , directed by and featuring filmmakers and actors of color being given the greenlight . . . . We need them to start moving forward this year so in 2019 there are quality projects in contention . "
