The heliosphere , in which the Sun and planets reside , is a large bubble inflated from the inside by the high speed solar wind blowing out from the Sun . Pressure from the solar wind , along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium , determines the size and shape of the heliosphere . The supersonic flow of solar wind abruptly slows at the termination shock , the innermost boundary of the solar system . The edge of the solar system is the heliopause . The bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy .
