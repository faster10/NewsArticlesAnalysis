" Billy Casper was one of the greatest winners in PGA Tour history and was a dominant player for the better part of three decades , " tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said in a statement . " We remember his three major championships and his incredible work on the greens that made him one of the best putters of his generation . Beyond his career as a player , though , we will remember Billy as tremendous husband and father , a man devoted to family , charitable pursuits and his religion . He truly has left us with a lasting legacy . "
