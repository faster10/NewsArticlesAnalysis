The Broncos and Panthers ranked first and sixth , respectively , in yards allowed and fourth and sixth in points allowed during the regular season . The Broncos led the NFL in sack percentage . The Panthers led the league in interceptions and fumbles . Each unit is terrific front to back . The Broncos pressured Brady relentlessly , sacking him four times , hitting him 20 times , deflecting 10 passes and picking Brady twice . Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware combined for seven of those hits . They re the top pass rushing duo in the league at their best , and yet the Broncos have stars on all three levels , assuming both starting safeties , T . J . Ward and Darian Stewart , are not badly hurt . Coordinator Wade Phillips is a terrific assistant who has brilliantly brought this group together . The Panthers also are loaded , as they forced seven Cardinals turnovers in the NFC title game and feature four Pro Bowlers on defense ? ? defensive lineman Kawann Short , linebackers Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly and cornerback Josh Norman . Davis ( broken right arm ) will be a serious question for the game , as will Jared Allen ( foot ) , and it would be a shame and a shock if either or both long tenured veterans chasing a ring cannot play in the game . But even if they can ' t go , the Panthers have playmakers everywhere on that side of the ball .
