The government also claims that health care is different because producers are sometimes required to give free emergency services to the uninsured . But why is this fact constitutionally relevant ? The answer seems to be that failure to buy insurance thereby has adverse economic effects on producers . Put that way , failure to buy health insurance turns out to be no different from failure to buy any other product . Any time someone fails to purchase any product , producer profits are lower than they would be otherwise .
