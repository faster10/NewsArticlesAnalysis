After news of the exchange broke Saturday , Christine said she called the White House but didn t hear back from anyone until hours later when White House Deputy National Security Advisor Lisa Monaco called to apologize . Christine said that Monaco explained that they meant to tell her ahead of time , but the Iranian government apparently leaked the news early .
