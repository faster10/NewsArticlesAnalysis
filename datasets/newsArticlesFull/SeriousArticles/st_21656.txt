Chicago Bears : Chicago has the edge at quarterback on Sunday with Jay Cutler over Brock Osweiler . Head coach John Fox and offensive coordinator Adam Gase know exactly what Osweiler can and cannot do . The Bears have won four of six . The Broncos have lost two in a row . I know this sounds crazy , but unless Cutler turns the ball over three to four times , Chicago has a great shot to win . This is Fox s Super Bowl , even if he tries to play it off like just another game . Don t believe the coach speak . Fox wants to make a statement . Bears 22 , Broncos 21 . Jeff Dickerson
