Also , at this point , Cam s fair share of critics consists primarily of an angry mother in Tennessee who didn t like him dancing in her team s end zone , and Seahawks fans who are also displeased by Cam s antics yet have no problem with Richard Sherman screaming into microphones , ala Ric Flair . And I ve said that prior to being in this situation . And if I m in this world living for that person ? Oh , this person is going to say this this person is going to say that ? then I can t look at myself and say I m Cam Newton , or Cameron Newton to most people , because I m not because I m living for you .
