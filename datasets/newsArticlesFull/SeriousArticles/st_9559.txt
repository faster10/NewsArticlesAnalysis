Despite tallying 24 straight points in the second half , Seattle ( 11 7 ) could never get over the hump . Quarterback Russell Wilson was under duress in the first half especially , as Carolina picked off the Seattle signal caller early in the first quarter , allowing the Panthers to take a 14 0 lead . Wilson would finish his afternoon going 31 of 48 for 366 yards , three TD s and a pair of interceptions . While Lynch saw his first action after missing seven games due to abdominal surgery , he was limited in his effectiveness . Lynch finished the day with only 20 yards rushing on six carries . Through the air , Seattle ( outgained Carolina 403 295 total yards ) was led by Jermaine Kearse , who finished with 11 catches for 110 yards and a pair of scores . Seattle s offensive line had its hands full to say the least , as Wilson was sacked five times on the day .
