I m disappointed that the NFL does not have a policy to punish a player who does that to a coach , Theismann said in a telephone interview . If a player bumps an official , he is disciplined and suspended . But if you attack a coach , that s okay ? For Jerry Jones to use the name Greg Hardy in the same sentence with the word leadership , that s wrong . What the Cowboys basically have said is , As long you have talent , whatever you do is okay . That s wrong . You re talking about someone who hasn t had one situation , but many situations . To listen to Jason Garrett and Jerry Jones defend his actions , I can t believe they actually believe what they re saying .
