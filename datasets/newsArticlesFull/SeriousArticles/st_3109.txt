Cameron Todd Willingham met the same fate in 2004 after being convicted of killing his three young daughters by setting their home on fire . The Texas Forensic Science Commission investigated the arson evidence against Willingham and concluded that the findings were a product of " flawed " processes , five years after he had been put to death in Huntsville . His family has spent the past two years seeking a posthumous pardon from the state but has met with as much denial as during his appeals process .
