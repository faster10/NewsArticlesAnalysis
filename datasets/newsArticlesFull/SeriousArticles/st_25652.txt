Mr Obama casts climate change as a threat more grave than global terrorism . He suggests the Islamic State , or ISIS , will tremble before the image of world leaders standing arm in arm in defiance of the purveyors of fossil fuels . What a powerful rebuke to the terrorists it will be , he said last week , when the world stands as one and shows that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children . Who would have guessed that the war on gasoline powered lawn mowers and wood stoves could have the secondary benefit of saving the world from ISIS ? Americans are by nature respectful of the office of the president , but such rubbish pushes the baloney meter into the red zone .
