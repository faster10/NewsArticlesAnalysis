What makes the Paris attack different , however , is its complexity and coordination ? it is not a lone wolf attack . Rather , it appears to have been organised and directed by the Islamic State , and , as such , resembles an al Qaeda style overseas operation that ISIS leaders have explicitly condemned in the past . For ISIS s ideologues , organised violence has invariably been focussed on the enemy that is near , principally Shias and agents of apostate Arab governments ( e . g . , Iraq or Saudi Arabia ) . Major and coordinated attacks in distant lands are to be avoided because these can result in a massive retaliation and the loss of the territorial base that was acquired by the caliphate . ISIS leaders have often criticised al Qaeda for the 9 11 attacks because this led to the crushing of the movement in Afghanistan and the defeat of its host , the Taliban regime . Furthermore , attacking the distant infidel is not a priority given the closer and more dangerous enemies at hand such as the Shias .
