Steinhauer : It ' s a bit of both . Through reading I ' ll come across actual craft that I pick up , though you ' d be surprised how much realism you can acquire by simply getting into a character ' s head and turning on the paranoia . If I wanted to get from Miami to Chicago without anyone knowing , how would I go about this ? With a basic knowledge of how cell phones can be tracked , how surveillance cameras pepper highways and public spaces , one can gradually form a plan that looks a lot like real spy craft . And if it works , then there ' s no reason to think it isn ' t spy craft .
