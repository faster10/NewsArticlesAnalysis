Manning is back and will start his first game since Nov . 15 . That s when he was 5 for 20 for 35 yards and four interceptions before he was benched for the first time in his career and later diagnosed with a partially torn plantar fascia . Brock Osweiler started the last seven games , but Gary Kubiak switched back to Manning in the third quarter of the final game against the Chargers . Manning helped Denver clinch the AFC West and the No . 1 seed , but it s been a dreadful year with the injuries and the HGH link . His 67 . 9 QB rating tied him with Ryan Mallett for worst in the league .
