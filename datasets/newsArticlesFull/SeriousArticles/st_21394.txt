Another early fan favorite , this one may have mustard on the beat , but it doesn t follow DJ Mustard s tried and true recipe . Instead , with its swirling , airy , atmospheric production and distorted , high pitched vocal sample , Needed Me would have fit right in on Nothing Was the Same . It has more songwriting credits than just about any other song on the album , but it boils down to a simple message , one that reverses stereotypical gender roles : Don t get it twisted , Rihanna tells a man she s loved and left , You needed me .
