According to a source , Javed reportedly registered his protest against the decision . " During the meeting , the commissioner told the CM that the decision would seriously affect the morale of the force , to which Fadnavis expressed helplessness , as the orders had come from the central government , " said a source . He added , " Due to the commissioner ' s reservation , the responsibility of making the announcement was entrusted to ACS ( Home ) . " Hence , breaking away from the protocol , ACS ( Home ) arrived at the Mumbai police headquarters at Crawford Market and addressed the press at Javed ' s office .
