Late Sunday afternoon , in the final hour of the final day of the con , the first ever anti bullying panel took place . From the moment I posed the first question to writer Jane Espenson of " Once Upon a Time " and " Buffy the Vampire Slayer , " to the very last comments by Masterson , the room was full . Every person stayed . Within hours of the panel ending , tweets were already coming in from people asking us to bring anti bullying panels to other pop culture conventions . Leaders in the geek community are spreading the word .
