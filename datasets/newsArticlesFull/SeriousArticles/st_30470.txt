As all this indicates , Shankar was already well known before the Beatles got involved . In fact , they weren ' t even the first rock group to get hip to Shankar . That honor belonged to the Byrds , who recorded in the same World Pacific Records studios as Shankar did for producer Richard Bock . They in turn got George Harrison hooked on raga and Harrison began plucking the sitar on his own . ( Dial up " Norwegian Wood " from the Beatles ' 1965 album " Rubber Soul " and you ' ll hear that instrument poking out the theme . )
