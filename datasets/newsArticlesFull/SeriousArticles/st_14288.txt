Denver Broncos : Emmanuel Sanders did not practice this past week because of an ankle injury coach Gary Kubiak said Sanders was " really sore ' ' to close out the week so the Broncos will lean on Demaryius Thomas plenty in the passing game , per usual . But also keep an eye on the tight ends as well . Kubiak has promised Vernon Davis will play " a lot more ' ' against the Chiefs on Sunday than the nine snaps he played last weekend in Indianapolis , and the Broncos have made a concerted effort to get the tight ends involved in the past two games . The tight ends combined for 105 yards receiving in the win over the Packers , and Owen Daniels had 102 yards receiving last weekend in the loss to the Coilts . Jeff Legwold
