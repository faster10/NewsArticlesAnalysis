Current state : Rob Gronkowski was an unstoppable force and touchdown machine through the first seven games . The past seven games ? A different story . Without Edelman , Amendola and Lewis , defenses have been able to focus on shutting the tight end down . The knee injury he suffered in the Broncos game that forced him out for a week is likely another factor . Whatever it is , he s not quite the same player . Statistically , he had 40 catches with 7 TDs and four 100 yard games in his first seven games . In his last eight , he had 32 catches with 4 TDs and just one 100 yard game . The Dolphins successfully took him out with single coverage as he finished with two catches for 18 yards . He had four catches ( 86 yards ) against the Jets , five ( 54 yards ) against the Titans . It s not bad , but it s not Gronk .
