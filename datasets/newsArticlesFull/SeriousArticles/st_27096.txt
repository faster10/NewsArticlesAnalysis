I think some places are throwing darts at a dartboard , ESPN analyst Louis Riddick , former NFL safety and personnel scout with the Redskins and Eagles , told The Post . They have gone after so many different types , gone after so many different profiles , when they re talking about coaches here , I don t know if they have anything in mind as to exactly what they want . My hunch is they probably would want something like they had a couple of years ago : They would love to find Andy Reid the Second .
