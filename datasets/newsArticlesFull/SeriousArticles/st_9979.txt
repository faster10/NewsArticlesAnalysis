In some contrast , cooperation in intelligence , policing , counter terrorism , and joint diplomacy , as over the Iranian nuclear programme , seems to be improving . Mr ? Cameron mentioned some of the remaining gaps in such cooperation . His support for President Fran ? ois Hollande s military and diplomatic campaign after the Paris massacres , whatever ? the specific merits , should point the ? way toward more systematic cooperation between European countries . There is no need to revive the once vexed question of European defence versus Nato defence . Both ? structures are now rather weak . Arguing ? about architecture if the bricks ? are ? not there is not worthwhile .
