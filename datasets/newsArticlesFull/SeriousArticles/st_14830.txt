I saw Scott Weiland perform in 2011 , two years before he was kicked out of the Stone Temple Pilots it was a small show at the PC Richard and Son Theater in New York , intended to promote his Christmas album , The Most Wonderful Time of the Year . His face had limited animation , and his voice had somewhat contracted into a raw blur . He spoke almost exclusively in free associations , digressing from the military to Hedwig and the Angry Inch to Pete Townshend in a fractured if enthusiastic rhythm .
