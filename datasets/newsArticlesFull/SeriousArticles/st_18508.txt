When I asked David Kimaiyo , Kenya ' s Inspector General of Police , about Lewthwaite ' s seven month stay in the affluent middle class neighborhood , he told me : " He was not aware " she had been there , adding " it ' s all rumors . " Oakpark ' s manager would disagree . Lewthwaite and the man he believed to be her husband had him doing all sorts of odd jobs , from fixing water pipes to fetching groceries , he says . They were the sorts of odd jobs he used to do for all his tenants , but the woman he now knows as the " White Widow " was anything but ordinary .
