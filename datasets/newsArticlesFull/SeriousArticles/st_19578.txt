You may be surprised to learn that recreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands . Yes , even pot . But an official policy of tolerance emerged and in 1976 the Dutch parliament decriminalized possession of less than 5 grams of cannabis . That gave rise to a type of establishment found only in this country . In hundreds of " coffee shops " across the country not to be confused with " cafes " where you , in fact , go for coffee you can select from a menu of cannabis products and light up in full view indoors or at a sidewalk table .
