So maybe it should come as no surprise that libertarian Sen . Rand Paul , while pointing out he ' s not " anti vaccine , " called it a " personal decision . " Or that New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , looking to burnish his conservative credentials , allowed that parents " need to have some measure of choice " about vaccinating their kids ( although he later tried to soften that statement by adding there ' s " no question " kids should be vaccinated against measles ) . Is this the same Christie who , going against the advice of experts , required a mandatory quarantine of a woman returning from Africa who had been fighting Ebola to keep the public healthy ? Hard to square that circle .
