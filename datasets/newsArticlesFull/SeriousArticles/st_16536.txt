In watching it all unfold , it ' s hard to underestimate the task at hand . It ' s also hard to figure out whether it ' s actually going to work . Hillary Clinton and her experienced campaign team are disciplined and relentlessly on message . That ' s usually a good thing when you ' re running a presidential campaign . But when you ' re sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume unprompted it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent . ( Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words as " standing up for our country . " Short shrift , it seems to me . )
