" I think that when President Obama was running for re election , I was glad to step up and work very hard for him , while Sen . Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him , " O ' Malley said . " I am a Democrat . I ' m a lifelong Democrat . I ' m not a former independent . I ' m not a former Republican . I believe in the party of Franklin Roosevelt , the party of John F . Kennedy . I believe that we ' re all in this together and we can make a better future . And that ' s why I ' m running for our party ' s nomination . And I ' ve never once rejected the nomination of the Democratic Party . Nor will I this time . "
