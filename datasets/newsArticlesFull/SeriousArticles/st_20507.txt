All things considered , it s hard to deny the Bulls are a better offensive team with Noah on the floor . His 4 . 3 points per game are the second worst on the team among players getting significant minutes .

Noah thrived in the Thibodeau era , but Hoiberg has installed a far more complex offensive system , and some pieces left over from previous years just didn t fit the scheme . Noah , as talented of a player as he may be , happened to be one of them .
