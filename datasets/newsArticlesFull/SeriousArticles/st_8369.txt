Everyone is struggling to get to where Mr Smith and where Mrs Jada Pinkett Smith are . I have more respect for her because she s come through the ranks . But y all are at your mansion in a gilded cage standing up there with billions of dollars in the bank . You could do more for the industry and for black Hollywood than anyone could . You could be mentoring young screenwriters . You could be setting up a program . You have the ability to do so much . You could become the new Tyler Perry . Tyler Perry is not going , I want an Oscar . He found his niche and we love him for that .
