Beyond the potential response from Israel , the Palestinian bid at the U . N . is risky . The U . S . is opposed to the move and lawmakers in congress have threatened to pull the plug on hundreds of millions of dollars in annual American aid . Others say the move will unrealistically raise expectations of Palestinians and , if little actually changes on the ground , could contribute to regional tensions . The Palestinian Authority could also risk losing support from its own people . The Hamas political faction , which controls Gaza , does not support the U . N . strategy and there are concerns among the Palestinian refugees in the region that the statehood bid could compromise their " right of return " to their homeland .
