Dear fans of The Walking Dead , this is a hard story to tell . And when we were planning to tell it we knew our friends at the Talking Dead would be talking to you about it . And knowing you ' d all be talking , and feeling and commiserating , I knew we should say something about it , lest our silence say something we didn ' t mean to say or not say . So I ' ll say this : In some way , we will see Glenn , some version of Glenn or parts of Glenn again , either in flashback or in the current story to help complete the story .
