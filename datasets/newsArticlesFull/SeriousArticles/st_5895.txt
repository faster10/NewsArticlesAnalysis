The fact is , there doesn ' t appear to be any incentive for Jackie to have lied . She wasn ' t seeking to tell her story in the first place ( the Rolling Stone reporter found her ) , and she must have known that she would face the usual victim shaming and blaming ( witness the slime " journalists " who have now published what they allege is Jackie ' s full name and address ) . Indeed , while Jackie named the fraternity involved , she left her alleged assailants ' names out of it , so it ' s hard to see what sort of " revenge " agenda could be served by fabrication .
