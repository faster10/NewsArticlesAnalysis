Well obviously any time you have Marshawn it s a great thing , Wilson said . He s a great football player . Nobody really runs like him at all , and hopefully we can have him out there on the field . But as teammates we want him to be healthy , we want him to feel like he s ready to go . We get to play this game , this game is such a physical game , especially the way he plays . He s one of a kind . We still prepare the same way . We still prepare to win . We still prepare to have great foresight into what s going on in the game and have great preparation .
