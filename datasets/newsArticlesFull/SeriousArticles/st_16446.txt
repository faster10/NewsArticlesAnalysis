Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial , Philadelphia . The Park Service isn ' t exactly modest in its holdings : from the Grand Canyon , to California ' s Sequoia National Park , to Wrangell St . Elias in Alaska ( the reigning champ at over eight million acres ) , it has its share of massive parks . But these spaces contain enough to fill a lifetime , so they might not be the best choice for a weekend trip . If you ' re not up for getting lost in a vast wilderness , why not go to the opposite extreme and visit the smallest destination in the NPS ? Commemorating the life of an American Revolutionary hero , this National Memorial includes exhibits and artifacts from Kosciuszko ' s military career in the new country he helped to liberate . Housed within Kosciuszko ' s small Philadelphia home and measuring in at only . 02 acres , the memorial is perfect for a quick historical tour .
