After the disastrous eight years of Nouri Al Maliki when Sunnis were sidelined in the political process , the Sunnis in Iraq had nowhere to go . The persecution and murder of Sunni leadership and civilians continued under the watchful eyes of the western backers of Nouri Al Maliki . The army of Muqtada Al Sadr and Iranian backed militia continued to ethnically cleanse the formerly well integrated neighbourhoods of Iraq , pushing Sunnis out of their well established homes and businesses . Islamic State ( IS ) was created as a result of the power vacuum and came into being for the protection of the displaced Sunnis in Iraq and later Syria . Had IS put on a more humanitarian face and been allowed to consult with western powers it could have been called the Sunni Protection Force ( SPF ) or something similar .
