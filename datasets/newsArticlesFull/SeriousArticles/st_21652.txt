Detroit Lions : Detroit is coming off a historic win against Green Bay , but the 2 7 Lions have a problem ? their secondary is really , really beat up . Detroit likely will have Darius Slay on Amari Cooper , but that leaves Michael Crabtree for a combination of Crezdon Butler and Bill Bentley , both of whom were not Detroit Lions last Friday . That should be an area for Derek Carr to pick on and could result in at least two touchdowns . Add that the Lions have scored more than 20 points only twice this season ( Week 1 vs . San Diego , Week 6 vs . Chicago ) and any team that can put up points is going to be a problem for the Lions . Raiders 27 , Lions 21 . Michael Rothstein
