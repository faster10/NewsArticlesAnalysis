Mr Thein Sein said before the vote that the military and the government would accept the outcome , should the ruling party lose , and work with the opposition to ensure a stable transition . Even if the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party is ousted , the military will still retain a significant role in politics , because it is guaranteed 25 percent of seats in Parliament , as well as control of key ministries , under a constitution written by the departing junta . The constitution also bars Ms Suu Kyi from becoming president .
