When I first came home , there were months of isolation where I was too proud and too ashamed to talk about my feelings a downward spiral that almost ended in suicide . But , I was lucky , because through a twist of creative fate , and a simple film project that quickly became a full blown documentary based on personal footage I ' d shot in the war , I was forced to share my experiences with others . I spent weeks of 12 hour days with the editors going over the scenes of horror that I ' d experienced . These editors quickly became people whom I loved and trusted dearly . Opening up , and talking candidly about the things that were locked away behind my emotional barriers , ultimately led to my recovery . In essence , the making of a film became one long therapy session .
