Gruber said attempts to control costs in a real way were politically untenable . " The problem is if we just say , ' Look , let ' s just cut our spending , ' well , the problem is you ' re going to then eat into what the rich guys are getting that they ' re liking . And that doesn ' t go so well . That ' s going to be pretty hard politically . That ' s why no one has a politically feasible way right now to bend the cost curve , it just doesn ' t exist . " Politicians could suggest capping costs but " you wouldn ' t win many elections . "
