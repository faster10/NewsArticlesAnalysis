Second , global demand for food and resources is skyrocketing . By 2050 global food production must increase by 60 , while soil and fresh water must be regenerated , not depleted . American farmers are held back by expensive , distorting , and antiquated Cold War era subsidies that essentially pay farmers to overwork the land and waste scarce water resources . We ' ve already lost up to 50 of Iowa ' s topsoil , drained the Ogallala Aquifer , and created a fertilizer based " death bloom " at the mouth of the Mississippi . While conventional agribusiness is enjoying high global prices , climate related drought and floods have reduced the harvest to the lowest since the early 1970s . Shifting the worst of these subsidies from big commodity crops ( like corn , wheat , and soybeans ) to pay farmers to convert their operations to modern regenerative systems will help our farming families earn a more secure living and be better stewards of the land .
