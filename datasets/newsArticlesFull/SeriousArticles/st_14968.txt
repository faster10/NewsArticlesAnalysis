Bernie Sanders has become that improbable new face . He is summoning Democrats back to the principles and ideals that animated the Party from the days of Franklin Roosevelt , through Harry Truman , and on to Lyndon Johnson . He favors health care for all , a living wage , low cost college , a renewal of the civil rights movement , and hope for a broadly shared prosperity . This platform is not a radically socialist agenda , but the fulfillment of old progressive promises of a juster , fairer America .
