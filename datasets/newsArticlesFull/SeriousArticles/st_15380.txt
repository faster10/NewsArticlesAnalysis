Let s be honest : These have been trying times for Chicago s Rahm Emanuel ? with calls for him to resign his post . But here s one reason he might be able to survive : Due to a lack of a contested Democratic presidential race , we aren t seeing much pressure among the candidates to demand Rahm s ouster . Think about it if the Democratic race were as competitive as the GOP s , there would be incentive for a presidential candidate to call for Rahm s resignation , and that would lead to an avalanche of other resignation calls . But with Hillary Clinton leading by 20 plus points nationally , that same kind of incentive doesn t exist . Just something to think about .
