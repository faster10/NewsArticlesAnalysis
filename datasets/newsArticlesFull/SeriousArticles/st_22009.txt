I ' m writing this on a Sunday . My teen is sleeping in and my husband is away . The silence of the morning provides a perfect context for writing . But when my groggy teen wakes up , I ' ll put aside my work , and we ' ll share toast and tea and a plan of the day . Because if I tried to skate through breakfast with one eye on my daughter and one eye on the clock or smartphone , a fleeting moment of togetherness would be diluted . The silken threads of mutual presence would be thinned to the point of fraying .
