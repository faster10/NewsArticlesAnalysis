BERNIE SANDERS ROLLING OUT NEW HAMPSHIRE TEAM . The last few weeks have been good ones for Hillary Clinton : a " Saturday Night Live " guest appearance , a well regarded debate performance , and testimony on Benghazi that appear to avoid any new controversies . Her poll numbers have risen , too . All this may be reason for Bernie Sanders supporters to be concerned in New Hampshire , the early voting state in which he ' s expected to fare best . But perhaps most troubling has been the Vermont Senator ' s difficulty in garnering endorsements from state lawmakers . But they may be on their way . A Bernie Sanders spokesperson tells ABC News that the campaign expects to roll out a New Hampshire steering committee this week , perhaps as early as Tuesday , ABC ' s BRAD MIELKE reports . It will feature " well known activists , labor leaders , community activists , and some sitting state legislators , " according to the spokesperson . http : abcn . ws 1klX0Nf
