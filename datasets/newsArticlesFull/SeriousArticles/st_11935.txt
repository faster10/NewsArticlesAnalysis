Neither Mets owners Fred Wilpon nor Royals owner David Glass are quite as loathed as , say , Jeff Loria is down in Miami , but they certainly have given fans of their teams headaches at times . The Wilpons ? the team is owned by the family and run by Fred s son Jeff ? have been embroiled in financial scandal and , to some degree , personal scandal . ? Both the Wilpons and Glass ? have been accused of being penny pinchers at times and not without good reason . Both have been enriched at the expense of taxpayer subsidized stadium construction and improvement , much to the chagrin of those taxpayers and folks who don t think billionaires are owed charity .
