There are really three mini tiers in this category , and Jeb can indeed claim to be the only one in the clear lead . All of these candidates , however , all only separated by a margin of 2 . 2 points , so these really are micro divisions . Forming the middle of this pack are Carly Fiorina ( 3 . 0 percent ) and Chris Christie ( 2 . 8 percent ) . Carly finally bottomed out of her own spectacular fall in the polling , and now gets a pretty steady three percent , down 8 . 8 points from her high point . Christie , on the other hand , has been polling in the two to three percent range for months . He drifts up a point , then down a point , and recently is on an upswing which places him with Carly in the middle .
