He gave up Radio 2 s breakfast show by choice . Chris Evans now has a bigger , younger audience , but always acknowledges the sure foundation Wogan built . From 2010 he tried a new Sunday morning radio show , with an audience and big acts , live from the BBC Radio Theatre . To the relief of his fans , after four series of that he went back into the studio , quipping , observing , bestowing nicknames , enjoying the music , talking to just me and you . He was a rare broadcaster , and a lovely man .
