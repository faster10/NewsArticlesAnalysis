Grading the defense is always a difficult task , as the Giants have limited personnel with which Steve Spanuolo has to work . Once again , the defense could not shut down the opposition with a touchdown lead and time running down in the fourth quarter ( sound familiar ? ) . The Jets tandem of Brandon Marshall ( 131 yards , 1 TD ) and Eric Decker ( 101 yards ) could not be contained in the passing game , as quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick took turns harassing Dominique Rodgers Cromartie and Prince Amukamara . Even running back Bilal Powell had 91 receiving yards on the afternoon , including a 31 yard center screen pass for a touchdown in the second quarter .
