Enten ' s review of past Iowa polling revealed " two types of candidates who tend to outperform their polls . " Candidates who gain " late momentum , " such as John Kerry in 2004 and Rick Santorum in 2012 , and candidates who do well with evangelical conservatives . According to Enten , the final Dem Moines Register polls " in 1988 , 1996 and 2012 all missed the candidate favored by Christian conservatives by at least 8 . 5 percentage points . "
