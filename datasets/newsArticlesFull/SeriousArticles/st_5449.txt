HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2 ( Blu ray , Sony , PG ) seems to be one of the few possibilities these days where Adam Sandler can score a hit . The premise is that now that Count Dracula s lair is open for tourists , the world is really changing . ? That means his daughter Mavis ( Selena Gomez ) and her human husband ( Andy Samberg ) might have produced a son Dennis ( Asher Blinkoff ) who as half human half vampire might go in grandpa Drac s view anyway the wrong way , give up the bad old ways and be a nice guy instead of a bloodsucker . ? It s a creepy scenario actually , about an overly possessive parent grandparent but HT2 is lively and the Blu ray bonus exclusives include deleted scenes and a guide on how to throw the ultimate monster party and how to draw ? your favorite characters . ? There is also an I m in Love with a Monster music video from Fifth Harmony , an on target commentary by director Genny Tartakovsky and another three person commentary with Allen Covert who is voice of the Candle Cake Monster , Sandler who co wrote the screenplay with Robert Smigel who is also here .
