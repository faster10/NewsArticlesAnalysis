Don ' t go urban exploring . Why would you want to go into an abandoned building ? They ' re old , they ' re dangerous , they ' re full of asbestos . The street cred associated with going through these places is long gone . And most Detroiters are offended if that ' s the only reason you visit . Lastly , it ' s illegal and with more police on the streets thanks to donated patrol cars and a shift in internal structure , you ' re running a greater risk . If you ' d like to explore a beautiful building , try the Albert Kahn designed 1928 Fisher Building in New Center , a commercial district north of downtown , or the 1928 Redford Theatre on Lahser Road .
