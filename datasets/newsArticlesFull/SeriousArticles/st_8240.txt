The contrast could not be greater to Federer , who at this stage of his life knows he has to plan everything with the precision that his country ' s watches are known for not just his training but his family logistics as well . That is why he will be favoured to reach a second consecutive Grand Slam final of the season , where he would meet either Japan ' s Kei Nishikori or still the tournament ' s most likely winner , Novak Djokovic . It is also why he has the resolve to hold off the pair of match points which came at 4 5 in the fourth set in the course of a 4 6 , 3 6 , 6 4 , 7 5 , 6 2 victory over Monfils .
