Our visit last year started out as an average Saturday at the Dumbo , Brooklyn outlet of Mikey ' s Hook Up , an Apple retailer and repair specialist . Well groomed arty types came in , alone , in couples , with lattes in hand , all there to admire the shiny wares or bring in their dead laptop for repair . The air was quiet , calm , tinged with some nail biting concern about lost files , perhaps , but mainly confident . In other words , no sign of the kind of melee happening in the art space just across the street , where the Bent Festival , the annual circus of the art of " circuit bending , " was happening .
