Miller : I ' m going to be collaborating a lot more with Alexis this time around . We got a lot closer on " Reign of Terror , " but really the last song we worked on was " Comeback Kid . " I sort of just gave her the instrumental . I had the lyric and half an idea for a melody , but that ' s our first true collaboration and it ' s my favorite song on the record . I think really we have not utilized any of her talents . She is incredibly gifted when it comes to coming up with really memorable melodies , what I consider to be great melodies . There ' s so much of her in " Comeback Kid " and I love it . I happen to play in a band with her , but I ' m also a fan .
