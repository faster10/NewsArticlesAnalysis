Nose tackle Dontari Poe makes everything work inside , as the 6 foot 3 , 346 pounder is a mauler who often requires double teams , particularly to open running lanes . Center Bryan Stork needs to hold his ground against Poe because the Pats need extra blockers for Houston , Hali and Ford . And don t sleep on interior linemen Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey , who both benefit when attention is shifted elsewhere . Each makes life difficult in the run game , while linebackers Derrick Johnson and Josh Mauga do their part as well .
