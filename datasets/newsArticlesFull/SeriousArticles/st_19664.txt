So then you re just kind of cognizant of where you put your graspers , you try to intentionally go above and below the thorax , so that , you know , we ve been very good at getting heart , lung , liver , because we know that , so I m not gonna crush that part , I m going to basically crush below , I m gonna crush above , and I m gonna see if I can get it all intact . And with the calvarium , in general , some people will actually try to change the presentation so that it s not vertex , because when it s vertex presentation , you never have enough dilation at the beginning of the case , unless you have real , huge amount of dilation to deliver an intact calvarium . So if you do it starting from the breech presentation , there s dilation that happens as the case goes on , and often , the last , you can evacuate an intact calvarium at the end .
