Yes , Pete Carroll can t run the ball or make stops for the Seahawks , but you almost got the feeling like Carolina s Ron Rivera was one step ahead of Carroll , at least that is so through the first 30 minutes of play . It is rare to see a Carroll coached squad look so out of sync , especially early in a contest as important as this one was . While a pair of long flights in the last two weeks may have ultimately taken their toll on a team that many believed had a good shot of going into Charlotte and coming away with a victory , the bottom line is Seattle came up short . For Seattle fans , the first 30 minutes were surely not what they would have expected when a Carroll team steps onto the playing field .
