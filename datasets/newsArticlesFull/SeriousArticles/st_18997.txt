Romney said things during the primary that have come back to haunt him . His tone has now changed . He ' s gone from talking about self deportation to saying there will be no massive rounding up and deportations of undocumented people . Now , instead of promising to veto the Dream Act , he invokes Sen . Marco Rubio ' s plan . He is still not giving much detail on the thornier immigration questions . He talks about fixing legal immigration but doesn ' t say how he is going to address the 11 million undocumented people already here .
