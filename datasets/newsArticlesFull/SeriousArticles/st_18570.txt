To illustrate the absurdity of gun free zones , Goldberg dug up the advice that gun free universities offer to its students should a gunman open fire on campus . West Virginia University tells students to " act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter . " These items could include " student desks , keys , shoes , belts , books , cell phones , iPods , book bags , laptops , pens , pencils , etc . " Such " higher education " would be laughable if it weren ' t true and funded by taxpayer dollars .
