These days the Bushes live in Dallas , also home to the George W . Bush Presidential Center , which opened last year on the campus of Southern Methodist University . But they regularly make the trip south to Crawford , where the former president is just as likely to be found handling a fishing rod or paintbrush as he is a chain saw . The ranch remains an essential getaway for the couple , a place to unwind and spend time with their daughters , Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager , as well as Jenna ' s family , and to entertain close friends like Deedie and Rusty Rose , prominent cultural leaders in Dallas .
