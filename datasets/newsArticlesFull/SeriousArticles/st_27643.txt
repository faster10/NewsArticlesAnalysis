True , geography favours India . Transit is easier , cheaper and well established between these two countries . The reason why there is a richer history between these two neighbours , closer cultural and social ties . That may also be why India is happily playing this cat and mouse game . They are waiting for Nepal to be humbled , to surrender . Probably keeping fingers crossed too that the current , unyielding KP Oli government will fall under its own contradictions and India will be able to dictate terms again .
