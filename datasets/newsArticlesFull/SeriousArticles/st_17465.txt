DeadSocial covers all the post death social media options , scheduling public Facebook posts , tweets and even LinkedIn posts to go out after someone has died . The free service will publish the text , video or audio messages directly from that person ' s social media accounts , or it can send a series of scheduled messages in the future , say on an anniversary or a loved one ' s birthday . For now , all DeadSocial messages will be public , but the company plans to add support for private missives in the future .
