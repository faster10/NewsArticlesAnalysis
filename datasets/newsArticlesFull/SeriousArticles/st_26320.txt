Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers : Brett Favre will be the big name , as he returns to Lambeau Field with great fanfare on Thursday night , but it ' s all about Aaron Rodgers for me . This wasn ' t quite the " R E L A X " treatment last Sunday in Minnesota , but it was something . Green Bay showed life , they showed resilience , and they showed a defense that could rally when needed . The Bears lost a heartbreaker vs . the Broncos last week . I don ' t see them strolling into Green Bay and winning on Thursday .
