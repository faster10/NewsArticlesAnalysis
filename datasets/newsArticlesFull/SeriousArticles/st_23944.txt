Once the Royals ? so feeble against New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey through the first eight innings of Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night ? scored their first run in the top of the ninth to cut Harvey s lead to 2 1 , and had that tying run on second with no one out , that run was crossing home plate . It mattered not that Harvey got the hook and New York s closer , Jeurys Famlia , was now in the game . Familia has already blown two save opportunities during the World Series . What s another ? Sure , Harvey had struck out nine Royals ? through the first six innings . No Kansas City player had struck out since .
