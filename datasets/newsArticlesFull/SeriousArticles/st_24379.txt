PP : So , there has been a disconnect between what s been talked about in Washington and what a lot of the fighters or would be fighters on the ground are most interested in . To put it even more clearly : we , in Washington , are more interested in fighting ISIS . A lot of the fighters are more interested in fighting against the Assad regime and if you don t have that agreement on priorities , that s a major handicap to begin with . Another problem is , in any kind of turmoil like this , a civil war situation , moderation loses out to extremism we ve seen this again and again from Sri Lanka , to Algeria , to other places , when order breaks down and violence increases , and the civil war drags on , the extremists tend to push out the moderates . So the sole idea that moderate forces would somehow take over ground from the less moderate forces has always had a bit of unrealism to it , and that s not just in Syria , but elsewhere .
