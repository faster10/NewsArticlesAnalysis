While Clinton and I came to the Senate at the same time after the 2000 elections , I have known her for more than 30 years . I first met Clinton when I was serving in the Michigan State House of Representatives and she was serving as first lady of Arkansas and working as an attorney . We were both speaking on a panel at a national conference on children ' s issues in Detroit . I had just passed one of the first child abuse prevention trust funds in the country and Clinton was serving on the board of directors of the Children ' s Defense Fund .
