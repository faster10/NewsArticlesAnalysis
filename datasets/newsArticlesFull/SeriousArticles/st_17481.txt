Gordon saw the play unfolding and thought to himself : Crap . A great throw from Duda nails Hosmer , ends the game and sends the series back to Kansas City . A good throw is a bang bang play , a 50 50 proposition . The throw from Duda was neither . It sailed out of catcher Travis d Arnaud s reach and to the backstop , and the headfirst sliding Hosmer tied the game . He popped off the ground , his uniform dirtied just as his coaches like it , and emitted a giant , Wooooo ! , audible even amid the boos of a deflated , disconsolate Citi Field .
