One of the few positives in Sunday s game was Andre Roberts 99 yard touchdown on a kick return . The Panthers took a 14 7 lead on Cam Newton s three yard pass to fullback Mike Tolbert and it took Roberts 14 seconds to even the score . What was most impressive about it was that Roberts did not have much blocking in front of him . He found a seam on the left sideline , evaded a Panthers defender by cutting it back toward the middle and then found an opening on the right side . Three weeks ago , the Redskins decided to go with Roberts on kickoff returns instead of Rashad Ross . Ross speed makes him a dangerous returner , but Roberts brings more to the team as a complete receiver if the Redskins need it . On Sunday , Roberts proved that he is still a valuable kick returner , too .
