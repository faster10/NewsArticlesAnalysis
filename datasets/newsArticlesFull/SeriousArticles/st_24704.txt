This time around , however , the Republicans might have overshot their mark . Because when Hillary spoke out about the Umpqua massacre , she made a point of tying it to enacting " sensible gun control measures , " and promised to lead the effort after she took over the Oval Office in 2017 . This was the first time that the Democrats made gun ownership a campaign issue , and it caught the GOP entirely off guard . Let ' s remember it was Hillary ' s husband who decided that Democrats lost the White House in 2000 due to the power of the NRA . So I knew that , going forward , the GOP would have to come up with a revised game plan to avoid having to appear condoning gun violence while still keeping the gun nut vote on their side .
