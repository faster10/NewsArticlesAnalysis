Back in January , Vice President Joe Biden summed up President Obama ' s first term with : " Osama Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive . " At the time , the Obama campaign sought to emphasize the president ' s record in foreign policy and saving the auto industry . Last week , the campaign unveiled a new theme and sent Biden to Ohio to test it out . For the first time , Biden called the Republican contenders by name and said that they would " bankrupt the middle class . " The campaign is now more focused on the economy , highlighting the difference between the president ' s " promoting the private sector " and the GOP ' s " promoting the privileged sector . "
