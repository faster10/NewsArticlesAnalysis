Giving GOP leadership trouble normally doesn ' t trouble me . And I ' m tempted to agree with Cruz on some things , like the perfidy of the Republican donor class . But last fall , Cruz was invited to speak at an ecumenical gathering of Middle Eastern Christians who were lobbying for support from Washington to help their embattled flocks ( some of which face genocidal violence . ) For reasons I still can ' t comprehend , Cruz decided to offer this tiny effort a political decapitation . He goaded the audience about its lack of support for the state of Israel and then accused them of being anti Semites . And it is only more galling in that Ted Cruz knows the relevant history . And he knows that his evangelical audience in America is mostly ignorant of it . He knew how to get a rise out of both audiences , and raised his own profile doing it .
