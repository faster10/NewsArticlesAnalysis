DANIELLE PLETKA , AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE : I think we should be more concerned . The problem for us is we ' ve been disinvesting in missile defense . We ' ve been disinvesting in the military . And just because a missile can ' t reach the United States , doesn ' t mean that it can ' t reach our allies in Asia who look to us for their security , are increasingly concerned that we ' re not going to be there for them in the event of a North Korean breakout or , frankly , a conflict with China . So I think we need to be doing a great deal more . And you ' re exactly right , part of this is deterrence , part of it is causing our adversaries to believe that we are serious . Up until now , and maybe even maybe even including now , they don ' t believe that .
