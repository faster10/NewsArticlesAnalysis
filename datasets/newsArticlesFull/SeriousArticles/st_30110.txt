Ballack : To be honest it ' s not a pressure , it ' s an honor to be captain of Germany and when I became it in 2004 I was really proud that I could make the step to be captain after Oliver Kahn . There were so many good captains during the years , we have such a great history in the country and to be part of this makes me proud . Also it ' s pressure because you have to have success , you have to win games , you have to win titles and that ' s what it ' s all about in our country because it has a great history . Hopefully we can carry on .
