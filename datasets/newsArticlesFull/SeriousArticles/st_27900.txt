Our youngest son just transitioned from crib to bed . Since we don t plan to have any more children , we decided to sell the crib , a hand me down from his older brother . It s a nice , well made crib , made from real wood and bought from a reliable company . We could easily resell it for a handsome price , but we found out a few weeks ago that we can t . It s a drop side crib , and unbeknownst to us the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) banned the manufacture , sale , and resale of drop sides in 2010 , even though individuals can unadvisedly still use them . Drop sides were responsible for more than 30 infant and toddler deaths in the decade prior to their ban , along with thousands of injuries . We hadn t realized that our kid had been sleeping and playing in a death trap .
