The Broncos were in the Super Bowl just two years ago , so this isn t a new thing for most of them particularly not their quarterback . This group of Panthers , however , had made it only as far as the Divisional Round of the playoffs the past two seasons . Carolina managed to weather the pressure that went with a 14 0 start just fine , so it s unlikely Ron Rivera will let his team get distracted , but the reason so many Super Bowls have been blowouts is because of a focus gap , not a talent gap . The Panthers have to make sure they are not on the wrong side of that equation .
