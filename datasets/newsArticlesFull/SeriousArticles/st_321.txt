India is the world s third largest emitter and , as with China , its climate strategy must be seen through the lens of its economic strategy . In contrast with China , India s economic challenge is to reduce its reliance on the service sector , and to invest more in its core transport , industrial and energy sectors . This , in fact , creates an enormous opportunity to drive smarter and more energy efficient investment , including in the world s best , low carbon infrastructure and energy technologies . Working together , China and India could significantly increase renewable energy deployment worldwide , as in the Sino Indian agreement in May that resulted in a 22 billion investment in new energy projects , including possible Chinese investment in photovoltaic industrial parks in India and on broader R D cooperation in renewables sectors .
