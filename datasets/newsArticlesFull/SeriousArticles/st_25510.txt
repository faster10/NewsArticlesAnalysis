Even justifying trying to resurrect a woolly mammoth , or a mastodon , or the dodo bird or any other extinct animal gets ethically thorny . How many failures would be acceptable to get one viable mastodon ? Where would the animal live ? What would we feed it ? Who would protect it from poachers , gawkers and treasure hunters ? It is not so simple to take a long dead species , make enough of them so they don ' t die of isolation and lack of social stimulation and then find an environment that is close enough and safe enough compared with that which they once roamed .
