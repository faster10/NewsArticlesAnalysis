Scientists and engineers are working on making coal cleaner . One promising approach is carbon sequestration , in which carbon is separated out after burning coal . But once the carbon is separated , it is not clear what will be done with it . The best ideas involve storing it underground in former natural gas reservoirs . Making such storage facilities viable , however , will involve laying pipelines to transport highly compressed carbon dioxide hundreds of miles , likely against strong local opposition . Thus , for the foreseeable future , we are going to be using a lot of dirty coal .
