Kartheiser : All sorts of times . Something that Matt does wonderfully , is that he writes for his actors . He says : " What do these people deal with in real life ? " Pete feels emasculated , he feels a bit insecure about his place among the men of the world . . . . He doesn ' t have that machismo or the elegance of the men that surround him . I think I can relate to some of those things and some of the way Pete hates himself and worries that the world hates him for those things too . Now , granted , I ' m not trying to say I ' m Pete Campbell . Those issues reside in me as deeply as they do as him . But I have understood those through my life . I think most people can . I think if people took a fearless look at themselves , they ' d see a lot more Pete Campbell than they ' d want to believe .
