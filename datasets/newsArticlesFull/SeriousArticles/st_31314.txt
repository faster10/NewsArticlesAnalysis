With this in mind , there is doubt that the device that North Korea tested on January 6 , which had a yield of about 6 kilotons similar , although perhaps a little higher than previous devices was really a hydrogen bomb . But even if North Korea has not yet developed a true hydrogen bomb , it seems plausible that the country has developed what is often referred to as a " boosted fission " weapon , or even an old type of design called a single stage fission fusion bomb , both of which can produce a larger yield than traditional fission weapons .
