Say something does go off kilter you trip on your hem and faceplant into the cake , the wedding elephant has an accident on the floor or you fumble the name of your beloved a la Princess Diana . If people laugh , it ' s because it ' s all part of the grand story that ' s unfolding not because they ' re gleeful about a screw up . They ' re there because they ' re on your side and are grateful to be part of this momentous occasion , and if they ' re not , why the heck are they at your wedding ? Seriously , take a look at that guest list and snip , snip , snip .
