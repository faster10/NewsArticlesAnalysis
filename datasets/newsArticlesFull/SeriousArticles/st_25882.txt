" I see two central reasons for the tea party ' s rise . The first is the yardstick , and the second is the clock . First , the yardstick . Imagine that over at the 36 inch end you ' ve got pure liberal thinking more and larger government programs , a bigger government that costs more in the many ways that cost can be calculated . Over at the other end you ' ve got conservative thinking a government that is growing smaller and less demanding and is less expensive . You assume that when the two major parties are negotiating bills in Washington , they sort of lay down the yardstick and begin negotiations at the 18 inch line . Each party pulls in the direction it wants , and the dominant party moves the government a few inches in their direction .
