Racists in America , 2015 , cling to their cover story of color blindness . A lot of them have even convinced themselves . Openly admitting to being a white supremacist is just not much of a thing anymore . ? Even people who were accusing Barack Obama of being born in Kenya like pretending they re going to vote for Ben Carson to prove they aren t racist . Most people who make racist jokes would throw a tantrum if you suggested that they might have had racist motivations , rather than just a desire to be edgy . Modern racism is complicated , drenched in deniability , and focused more on suppressing people through economic and criminal justice systems ? than through overt discrimination .
