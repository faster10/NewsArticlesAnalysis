There are plenty of people in Kentucky right now who are better off because of the ACA . But many of them are beneficiaries of the law s Medicaid expansion ( which Bevin has promised to change , if not revoke ) and thus lack political influence . And the rest ? As far as many of them know , it s not the ACA or Obamacare that they now rely on . It s Kynect . And Bevin didn t campaign against Kynect . He campaigned against Obamacare . Kentucky Democrats got the policy right , in other words but it never paid political dividends .
