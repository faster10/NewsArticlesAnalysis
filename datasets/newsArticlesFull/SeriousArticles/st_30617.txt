Grillo : The frightening thing about this incident is the lack of reaction from Mexican society and Mexican authorities . You would expect that for an incident of this scale , that the military would be all over the place . Two days afterward , in the center of Cadereyta , there were no soldiers I could see . There was cartel graffiti in front of the town hall . All around the town , you see graffiti names of CDG ( Cartel del Golfo ) . It ' s blatant . And you don ' t see the authorities around .
