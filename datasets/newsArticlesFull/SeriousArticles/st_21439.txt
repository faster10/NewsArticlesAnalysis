Actors , let s remember , are trained at playing people different from themselves . When we see a great performance , we want to like and trust the person giving it . We tend to think they re brave , wise , perceptive , and everything else we value . But just as T . S . Eliot could be a great poet and a dedicated ant semite , an actor can be accomplished in front of the camera and politically na ? ve or selfish or whatever the rest of the time . ( If you ve known an actor , this is not news to you . )
