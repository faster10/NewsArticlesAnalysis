( EW . com ) Identity Thief ( CinemaScore : B ) fared even better than expected , bringing in 36 . 6 million over the weekend across 3 , 141 theaters . For comparison , Melissa McCarthy ' s last major film Bridesmaids ( though it was in a supporting role ) opened at 26 . 2 million , in 2 , 918 theaters . With an opening like this , big things are surely expected from Seth Gordon ' s R rated comedy which has already surpassed its 35 million production budget . Though Bateman and Gordon had a successful run with Horrible Bosses after a 28 . 3 million opening weekend in July 2011 , Bateman hasn ' t had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles . Universal ' s The Change Up ( with Ryan Reynolds ) opened at 13 . 5 million in August 2011 and went on to gross only 37 . 1 million domestically , on a 52 million production budget .
