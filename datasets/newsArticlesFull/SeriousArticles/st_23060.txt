But it s a complete disaster ( to use Trump s favored coinage ) in the long term : Wiser heads in the GOP have long known that Spanish speakers are the fastest growing demographic in battleground states ? and the GOP share of the Hispanic vote plummeted to 27 percent four years ago after cresting at nearly 40 percent in 2004 . Latino voters are a diverse group ( many are receptive to a wider discussion of reducing inflows of immigrants from the south border ) but they are acutely sensitive to tone , as Mitt Romney learned when he urged Mexicans to self deport in 2012 . Trump s tone , compared with Romney s dispassionate diss , is a two by four to the temple ? and rest assured Democrats will run a loop of his comments during the general election whether he s the nominee or not .
