It was Tim Wolfe who , in a very ? banal , ? ordinary fashion , put the football team in the center of the school s life so when the people who were responsible for actually playing football withdrew their labor , and when the head coach , Gary Pinkel , who makes 4 million a year , supported his players ? ? you re not going to win that fight . It is a demonstration of the social power the players ? have , and I guarantee that they have been meeting about this in NCAA headquarters in Indianapolis because I m sure it scares the living shit out of them .
