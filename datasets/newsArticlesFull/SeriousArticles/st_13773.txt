" When he was in high school now the rules are different , I don ' t think a high school kid would be able to do this ( Sixers coach ) John Lucas invited him to work out with our guys at St . Joe ' s . Then , our offices were at Vet Stadium , because we played at the Spectrum and the main place to work out was at St . Joe ' s . So Kobe comes and starts working out with guys like Jerry Stackhouse , Vernon Maxwell , Shawn Bradley , Sharone Wright . He would work out , hone his skills . One time he took off from the foul line and tried to dunk over Sean Bradley in a 5 on 5 game . He missed the dunk , but Shawn Bradley had nothing to do with it . He only missed it , because he tried to throw it down so hard . I think he was a junior or senior at the time . He could hang with those guys . "
