This year , I m most grateful for three nominations given to Mr Robot , Sam Esmail s engrossing psychological thriller about a disturbed hacktivist ( the mesmerizing Rami Malek ) and his mysterious partner in cyber terrorism ( arguably the best use of Christian Slater ever ) . I m biased , of course : I just picked Mr Robot as 2015 s best show . But the summertime cult fave wasn t widely watched , so I hope the nods generate more interest , and I d love to see Malek ( who was just nominated for a SAG Award , too ) get an Emmy nomination next year .
