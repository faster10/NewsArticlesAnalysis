After a few more days watching protesters take to the street and hearing pundits describe them as thugs , you begin to switch gears . You see the Rev . Jesse Jackson out there stirring up trouble , blocking the Magnificent Mile and disrupting Black Friday shopping . These race baiters care nothing about the economy , you say , all they want is to get people stirred up . Why aren ' t they protesting black on black crime ? I guess black lives only matter when one is shot by the police , you surmise .
