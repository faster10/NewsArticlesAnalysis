Kings 108 , Pacers 97 : DeMarcus Cousins had a career high 48 points and 13 rebounds to help Sacramento to its season high fifth straight win . The only glaring misstep in the Cavs last few games was a blowout loss to the Golden State Warriors , 132 98 . This is what Coach wants to do , and this is what we re going to do . He s averaging 11 . 3 points in 41 games . Bron came out early , Ky wanted to come out early , Kevin wanted to come out early , so I just don t think we re in good enough shape right now to play the style we want to play .
