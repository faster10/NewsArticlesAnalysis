Britain ' s security services have been haunted by the spectre of a Mumbai style terror attack on these shores for four years . In November 2008 , gunmen went on the rampage in India ' s largest city , attacking hotels and public buildings . They murdered more than 170 and injured hundreds more in four days of bloodshed . Since then , UK counter terrorism officers have been braced for a similarattack . They were forced to consider how to deal with terrorists fanning out across a city , in what two ex SAS commanders said would be akin to a ' slow motion 9 11 ' . Millions have been spent upgrading heavy weaponry available to armed response teams . More officers were trained , including a squad of 100 with automatic weapons inside the British Transport Police . It is also thought SAS teams not on duty overseas have been puton standby to deal with hostage situations . The two guns and the small amount of ammunition seized on the M1 does not bear comparison to the armoury available to the Pakistani terrorists in Mumbai . But if theywere unleashed on a British shopping centre or at a crowded sporting event the potential loss of life could be just as horrific .
