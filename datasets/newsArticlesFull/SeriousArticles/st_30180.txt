In the final days before the election , Prime Minister Netanyahu made a big push to energize his right wing base . He promised that there would not be a Palestinian state under his watch , backtracking from a commitment he made in 2009 for a two state solution . Now the right wing that helped keep him in office is going to be looking for him to deliver on his campaign pledge . It ' s not encouraging . Now that he has a new mandate , perhaps he will feel more confident to explore possibilities with Palestinians . However the unilateral moves Palestinians have taken since the collapse of peace talks last summer doesn ' t give him much encouragement either .
