I would be very surprised if Bowles sticks cornerback Antonio Cromartie ? on Giants star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr . one on one for the entire game . Yes , Cromartie will have to cover Beckham man to man at times . Yes , Bowles typically doesn ' t like to play a lot of zone coverage . But I think Bowles will give Cromartie safety help , and roll double coverage to Beckham at times ? certainly more often than Bowles would if star corner Darrelle Revis was playing . Unfortunately for Bowles , Revis is out with a concussion . Beckham will put up his fair share of numbers , and it ' ll be a struggle for Cromartie at times . But the Jets just need to hope they can limit Beckham ' s effectiveness . To that end , strong safety Calvin Pryor could be a Jets defender to step up , as you mentioned . He is known for game changing hits , and if he pops Beckham over the middle , then Giants quarterback Eli Manning would probably think twice about throwing there again . ?
