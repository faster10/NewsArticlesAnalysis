The R rated Hitchcock style , prescription drug thriller Side Effects ( CinemaScore : B ) ended up beating director Steven Soderbergh ' s January 2012 weekend opening of Haywire , earning 10 million weekend this weekend and averaging 3 , 845 per theater . We talked a little bit about stars Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum ' s box office history yesterday . Another star of Side Effects is Jude Law , and he ' s got a varied track record at the box office . He generally participates in ensemble casts Anna Karenina , the Sherlock Holmes franchise , Soderbergh ' s Contagion , The Holiday making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive . Side Effects has Soderbergh ' s name and another strong ensemble , and could go on to a respectable run , even though it won ' t reach Contagion heights ( the epidemic thriller eventually grossed 76 million ) .
