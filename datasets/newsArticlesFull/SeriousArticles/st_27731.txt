" I think it was a great overall experience just to be with that group of players , " Gase said of his time in Denver . " Now , the group we have right now , we ' ve got a different group of guys and some different type of players , so it ' s been fun trying to get us to kind of get up to speed . When you ' re in your first year , it ' s not going to happen we ' re not going to be what we were in 2014 . I see a lot of things the same as it was in 2012 . We made some mistakes . Then as the season went on , we got better . "
