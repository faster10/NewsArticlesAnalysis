In no way am I comparing the Chinese paramount leader to Nawaz Sharif but what I plead is the need for cautious , forward looking decision making by all relevant stakeholders so that Pakistan can look back from a point of progress , not that of despair . So far , the Sharif administration has made some very positive reforms , which certainly is a moment for cautious optimism . One of these is the willingness to reform the ownership of Pakistan s inefficient and overstaffed state owned enterprises . A state that struggles to provide the basic services of education , healthcare and security to its citizens has no right to linger on loss making corporations that need millions of dollars every year to sustain their otherwise failing operations .
