The most important thing , though , is that they work so well together . Doubles is a funny game : I used to match up really well with Tim Henman because we were both naturally attacking players and I understood his game well . Whereas , when I played with Andy , we never clicked because we were coming from very different places . But the Murrays have been magnificent as a unit , and they should revel in this unique occasion . A chance to play for the Davis Cup trophy with your brother ? What an amazing story .
