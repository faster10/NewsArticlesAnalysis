Over the past three weeks , no team has allowed more fantasy points to quarterbacks , and they re 31st over the course of the year . Bills Eagles has the third highest over under of the week , and Vegas wants us to be on this game . Buffalo is a 1 . 5 point favorite . Taylor went through a lull Weeks 9 11 , totaling just two touchdowns against three straight AFC East opponents . Heading into back to back Weeks 12 and 13 matchups against strong on paper defenses in the Chiefs and Texans , most were off Taylor completely and sent him to the waiver wire . He responded with two of his three best fantasy performances of the season . Taylor is scorching hot heading into Philadelphia . The Eagles are coming off a big upset win over the Patriots on the road , so this could be a letdown spot for them . Taylor should be able to continue his hot streak in a game he ll be way up in tempo .
