This is difficult to understand in the post Watergate landscape , when most elected officials spend their time railing against Washington , trying as hard as possible to have as little do with Capitol Hill as possible .

As a result of fundraising and cheap air travel , more politicians spend their time outside of the district or inside the halls of events filled with wealthy donors from whom they ' re trying to raise another buck .
