With a 45 . 5 point total , Steelers Bengals is expected to be the highest scoring game on the Wild Card slate . These teams played to a 33 20 result in Week 14 as A . J . McCarron replaced Andy Dalton ( thumb surgery ) and went 22 of 32 passing for 280 yards , two touchdowns , and two interceptions . McCarron impressed with his pocket composure and efficient delivery down the stretch , but recorded scant fantasy results , posting weekly finishes of QB14 , QB27 , QB21 , and QB19 in the final month . McCarron hasn ' t been a good fantasy passer , the Bengals ' team total is barely above 21 points , and the matchup is mediocre against a Steelers pass defense that finished 2015 ranked 15th in Football Outsiders ' DVOA , despite sub par cornerback play . A pass heavy shootout is possible , but ultimately I ' m viewing McCarron is an unappealing fantasy option this week . . . . The Bengals ran Jeremy Hill 15 times in their first meeting with Pittsburgh , but just 7 times in the rematch . Giovani Bernard managed touch totals of 3 and 9 on snap rates of 49 and 64 against the Steelers . I ' d like to say space back Gio makes more sense as the Bengals ' primary runner versus Pittsburgh ' s stout front , but OC Hue Jackson has stayed very committed to Hill in McCarron ' s three full games played , feeding Hill touch totals of 19 , 21 , and 18 compared to Bernard ' s 18 , 12 , and 7 . Bernard would offer big upside if we knew for sure he ' d be the feature back , but the roles will most likely be even in a difficult matchup .
