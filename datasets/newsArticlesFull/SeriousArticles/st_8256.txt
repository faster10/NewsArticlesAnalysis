Ke ha : On this record I wanted to maintain what I believe is who I am wild , filthy mouthed , very honest but at the same time , address the changes in my life , and bring the music I listen to offstage together with the music I make . For me , that meant working with awesome collaborators . There was a strict no guitar rule on Animal . I just had this vision of making everyone on the planet dance . I wanted to be the Dance Commander . On this record , I wanted to bring the music I listened to offstage Iggy Pop ' s The Idiot , The Slider , Electric Warrior both by T . Rex into my music , which is pop music .
