One of the obvious reasons for the Ravens struggles this season has been due to injuries . A plethora of players have been lost for the season due to broken bones and torn ligaments , but there are a few players who fall under that gray area . That includes players like tackle Eugene Monroe , who has missed time due to a shoulder injury , who hasn t practiced since suffering an injury against the Rams in Week 11 . Monroe has had a big case of the injury bug since his acquisition a few years ago . Luckily for Baltimore , LT James Hurst has filled in for him and done an admirable job . The fan base hasn t been very pleased with Monroe s lack of availability the past two years , but injuries are a part of the game .
