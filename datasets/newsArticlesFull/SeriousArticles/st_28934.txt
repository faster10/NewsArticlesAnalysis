" That day I remember really well , " Nicholas recalled . " It was shot at the Four Seasons Hotel and I was shooting all of them . I shot amazing pictures of Whitney and ( Bobby Brown ) too . It was a very good time in their relationship . And they were both in great spirits . But it was the way that Whitney looked at her in that picture and the way Bobbi Kristina was focused on her , I feel that it captured the connection , obviously some kind of karmic connection of not between just a mother and a child but between two souls . And I thought it was s such a poignant moment and it was so full of joy and they seem so content and so complete and I thought it was a nice way to end the book . That was her heart right there . "
