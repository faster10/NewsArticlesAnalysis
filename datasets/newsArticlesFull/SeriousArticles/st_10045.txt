One of the many fascinating aspects of John Seabrook s history of manufactured pop in the noughties , The Song Machine , is the way he touches on the occasionally complex feelings that big songwriters for hire have about performing in their own right . Many are pragmatic artists who ve realised their time in the spotlight is over , in some cases before it began . There were never many takers for Max Martin s early 90s outfit It s Alive , perhaps understandably ? there s nothing intrinsically bad about any of the individual words Wikipedia uses to describe It s Alive s sound , but taken together , they manage to suggest some of the most disheartening music ever made : Swedish glam style funk metal . Others hold fast to dreams of stardom , which seldom seem to come true . The songs Esther Dean has co authored for Katy Perry and Rihanna have topped the charts , but the millions who bought Firework or S M stubbornly declined to buy Dean s own singles : no place on the charts for Twerkin 4 Birkin or 2012 s call for procreation Baby Making Love .
