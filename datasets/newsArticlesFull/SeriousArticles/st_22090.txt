This taps into a wider thirst for political change . The Republicans gave over half their votes in the Iowa caucus to two neophyte Hispanic conservatives and a black surgeon who has never even held office . Jeb Bush , another potent symbol of the Clinton Bush era , is languishing in the New Hampshire polls and facing defeat at the hands of Donald Trump . The politics of that era is overfamiliar and tired . And younger voters resent constantly being told that ageing pragmatists know best ? especially when the smart technocrats are the folks who gave us Iraq , the credit crunch and the mess that is Obamacare .
