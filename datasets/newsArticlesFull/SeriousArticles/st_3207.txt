It ' s hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it . Because they ' re volunteer based , and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level , doing a nationwide study would be difficult . However , Klotz says it ' s possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don ' t . She says it ' s typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year . She ' s even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year . And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids .
