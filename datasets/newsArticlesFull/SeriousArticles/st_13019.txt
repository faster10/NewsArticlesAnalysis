" Men In Black 3 " held on to fourth place , dropping 52 percent ( after losing many 3 D screens to " Prometheus " and " Madagascar " ) to 13 . 5 million . The 230 million sequel has earned a lackluster 135 . 5 million after 17 days even without accounting for inflation , both " Men In Black " and " Men In Black 2 " ( neither of which had 3 D ticket prices working their favor ) had earned more money at the same point in their runs , with 158 . 9 million and 148 . 0 million , respectively . The Sony production may finish with about 165 million , domestically .
