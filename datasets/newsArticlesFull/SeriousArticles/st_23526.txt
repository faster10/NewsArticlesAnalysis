In one routine , Decoufle ' s dancers enact a " Barbarella " number as if it were " Solaris . " In another , they parade around in Beefeater bearskin hats and not much else . ( If the club had a uniform , it would be a thong though high heels and fishnets also feature strongly . ) The music is mostly a cheesy mix of classic bump and grind and ' 70s Italian sex comedy . Once or twice , the choreography does break the mold to push into the exploratory eroticism of modern interpretative dance but at heart , the sensuality celebrated here is as safe and conventional as a Playboy bunny .
