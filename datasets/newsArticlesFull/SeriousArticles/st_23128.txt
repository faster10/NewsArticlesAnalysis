The President is the main obstacle to progress in Paris . Contrary to his view that he is " dragging the world behind me to Paris " ( as he told Rolling Stone ) most U . N . delegates see the President and the U . S . as the main obstacles to a strong agreement in Paris . The UNFCCC has been working for a year to reach an agreement on the final text off a document The Durban Platform . This , while not binding , could possibly set a high moral and scientific standard for emission reductions and , like the Pope Francis ' Climate Encyclical , create a moral pressure on governments . Third World governments are proposing language based on what is called " common but differentiated responsibilities " that calls on the primary polluters to make the largest cuts . There is proposed language for what is called " loss and damages " that would require the large polluters U . S . , Canada , E . U to make massive payments , specifically100 billion a year , into a Green Climate Fund to " developing countries . " This would be used to facilitate their transition to less polluting and zero emission development and to give " technology transfers " from the " developed nations " to the " developing nations . " And yet , at every daily debate of the governments , the U . S . , the E . U . , and JUSCANZ , have blocked any language in the document in that direction . The last preparatory conference in Bonn , October 19 24 , was marked by bitter denunciations from many Third World nations of " powerful forces " who were blocking any strong statements .
