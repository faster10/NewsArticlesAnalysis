Next week : The Giants at least have a little extra time to prepare for their next game , which is next Monday night in Miami against a Dolphins team that is one of the few in the NFL with really no chance at making the playoffs this season . If you ' re looking for a fun storyline , though , the Dolphins ' coach is former Giants tight end Dan Campbell . He was a tough as nails player who had one of the toughest jobs in Giants history mentoring the sometimes out of control Jeremy Shockey . That probably prepared him for anything . Also , while the Dolphins are now only 5 7 they are also 4 4 under Campbell after their 15 13 win over Baltimore on Sunday .
