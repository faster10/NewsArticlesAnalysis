With a dozen nominations ? including big ones for picture , director , lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio and supporting actor Hardy ? " The Revenant " clearly announced itself as the favorite of a lot of Oscar voters . With the sort of sweep and spectacle members always respond to , its best picture win is a real possibility after years of being passed over , DiCaprio seems a near lock for best actor , even if his work seemed more about endurance than performance . ( The film ' s other races will be closer calls . ) Working against its best picture coronation ? A very brutal beginning and deliberate pace that may tempt members not to stick with their screeners to the very end . And then there ' s the competition , with " The Big Short " and the terrific " Spotlight , " directed by New Providence ' s Tom McCarthy , providing the strongest challenges ? although as similarly dense , downbeat and very verbal films about topical subjects , they may end up splitting the same pool of smart voters and letting " The Revenant " roar past .
