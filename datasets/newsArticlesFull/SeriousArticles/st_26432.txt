Netaji researcher and RTI activist Chandrachur Ghosh isn ' t expecting anything that will significantly change the narrative on Bose unless they include intelligence files . But he is sure the contents will be embarrassing for Congress . " It will not reflect well on the manipulations by Congress to keep the files under wraps . I expect a lot of muck being raised over PM Jawaharlal Nehru ' s note to the Indian embassy in Tokyo , seeking surveillance on Netaji ' s nephew Amiya Nath Bose , the working of the Shahnawaz Committee and how Suresh Bose was snubbed . And files containing communication between MP Samar Guha and PM Indira Gandhi over destruction of files , " said Ghosh .
