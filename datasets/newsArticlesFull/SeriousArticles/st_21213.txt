Built on the rim of the Grand Canyon in 1905 , El Tovar was once so far from civilization that fresh water had to be delivered by train . It ' s since become one of our greatest national park treasures , with plenty of civilized touches , including suites with sitting rooms . Bring your morning coffee out to the front porch or lounge deck and gaze at the play of light on the canyon . Then head back inside for a hearty breakfast of Sonoran Eggs , with beans , chorizo , an array of salsas , and fry bread .
