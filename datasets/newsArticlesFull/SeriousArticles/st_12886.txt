In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10 , 000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay ' s employment at Cardiff , in relation to other matters , it emerged that Malky had , it seems , sent a couple of one line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures . These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter . That said , Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions . The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete .
