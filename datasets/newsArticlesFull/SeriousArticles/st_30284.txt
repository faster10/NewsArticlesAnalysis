It is true that Carson never says in Gifted Hands that he formally applied to the academy just that he was offered a nomination and full scholarship , but decided not to apply because he did not want a military career . He reiterated in a Facebook post over the summer that he had received an offer from the school , writing , I was the highest student ROTC member in Detroit and was thrilled to get an offer from West Point . But I knew medicine is what I wanted to do . So I applied to only one school . ( it was all the money I had ) . I applied to Yale and thank God they accepted me .
