Zakaria : Nobody knows for sure , but it does seem to have confused the situation internally . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue , which were then attacked by the opposition , and he retracted it , which suggests that he ' s feeling the pressure . It suggests that there are divisions within the regime , there ' s some sense of vulnerability . . . . It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them , but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran .
