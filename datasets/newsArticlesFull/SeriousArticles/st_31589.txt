Sorry , Mom , but when your " polite " Muslim son is married to a woman you barely know , who hails from an area of Pakistan ( Punjab ) widely known for its violent Islamic extremism and from a politically influential family widely known for its radical Islamic connections , and who is radically fundamentalist in her own garb and demeanor , and you are not even allowed to access your son ' s " man cave " ( read : bomb factory ) in your own home , then , shame on you for your grotesque and enabling incuriosity .
