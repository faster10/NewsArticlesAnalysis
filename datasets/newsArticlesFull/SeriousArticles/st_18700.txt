I also understand the notion that we should have our own to recognize our own I am all for it , however in the United States of America , why must we have to do this for everything . If we are to fully realize the dreams of Dr King and the great trailblazers who fought , sacrificed and died in the name of the American Principle , equality , freedom and justice , we have to make our voices clear and honor them and let the Academy know that each of you represent the mission of the Academy . This may be a very difficult task so it was for Douglass , Truth , Allen , Tubman , DuBois , X , King and plenty of others , but if they can do it so can you . Be the change expose it and call for it day in and day out in the name of equality , truth , justice and the American way .
