This many people calling it bad means it has to be good . Not one of you nincompoops know what goes into an NFL gameplan or what type of anything Joe Philbin is . Your hero Dan Campbell couldn t get that crap roster to win either but he says cool stuff and looks mean so yay for him . And Dolphin fans weighing in negatively buoys my spirits because they wouldn t know a winner if Don Shulas almost corpse fell into their TV rooms . Vegas is rich because the public is stupid , always bet against the majority .
