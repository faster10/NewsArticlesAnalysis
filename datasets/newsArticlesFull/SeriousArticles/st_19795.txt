Whenever you become a fan of something or someone , you create a relationship with a bunch of people , often , who also have a similar relationship . So there s a lot of discussion about these people . Because of this set of social interactions you create , this person , or this team , becomes part of the group : They re a member of that group despite the fact that there s no two way interaction . They re donating their music or their artwork , and they become like a member of the extended family . Particularly , with people in arts that also communicate some sort of emotional response , that bond gets any deeper because you end up opening yourself emotionally to that individual . As a result , you can come to feel that they know something about you .
