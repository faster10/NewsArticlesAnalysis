They are still fighting over who actually won the fight , but the fact is that going into the bout , not too many gave former Middleweight champion Sugar Ray Leonard a chance against the current holder of the title , the brilliant Marvin Marvellous Hagler . Leonard had not fought for five years and was in semi retirement . He , however , came back with a brilliant display of ring craftsmanship , out thinking Hagler in perhaps the greatest fight of the twentieth century in terms of sheer skill . In the end , Leonard won the decision , but Hagler still feels he was robbed . No ? matter who you believe , it was as an upset of Titanic proportions .
