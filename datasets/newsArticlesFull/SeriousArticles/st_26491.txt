Tennessee Titans : Quarterback Marcus Mariota is healthy now , but it doesn ' t mean he ' s willing to share just how limited he was after he sprained ankle in Week 2 or after he returned from two games off following a knee sprain suffered in Week 6 . But as the team spoke of his work as a dual threat in the win over Jacksonville , it emphasized how he ' s as healthy as he has been since the start of the season . That could se the stage for a big four game finish to his rookie season . Paul Kuharsky
