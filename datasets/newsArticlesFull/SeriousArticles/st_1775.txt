I am an agronomist and I have two children , one boy and one girl . I work in the pharmacy at the health center of Gueckedou in southern Guinea . When my father was hospitalized at the health center I naturally volunteered to be at his bedside so other family members would not have to make the daily trek of tens of kilometers , traversing the trails between their village and the facility . I cleaned him when he vomited and also did his laundry . I also often gave him food and drink . He had diarrhea at least eight times per day but I did not know he was suffering from Ebola .
