Andrea Adelson : The biggest difference between the North Carolina offense last year , and the North Carolina offense this year is its ability to run the ball . A veteran offensive line has been a big reason but so has the emergence of Elijah Hood , who has 1 , 280 yards and 16 touchdowns this year in one of the more underrated performances across the country . His rushing total already ranks No . 3 in school history , and he has posted seven 100 yard games . Hood averages 6 . 7 yards per carry . No UNC back with 60 or more carries in 2014 averaged more than 5 .
