SM : ? I believe this is true , unfortunately , because the Saudis are going to do everything they can to prevent rapprochement between Iran and the big powers , after the Iranian nuclear deal . To my understanding , the Saudi ' s main issue , main problem , main concern is that Iran now has upper hand in the region and they have lost their influence on many critical issues in the region . You know , from 2005 to 2013 or even 2015 , for about 10 years , Saudis , they tried everything they could to prevent a possible peaceful nuclear settlement between Iran and the world powers . Even , they pushed the U . S . to attack Iran , however they failed . After 2011 , they tried to convince the U . S . to attack Syria and they were presenting the notion of " Assad must go " neither the U . S . attacked Syria , and today Assad is in power , and Europeans , Americans the Western countries now they understand that Assad is a part of solution and they have left the notion of " Assad must go " . They invaded Yemen , they have killed thousands of civilians and it is a quagmire for them , because they feel that really they are in a crisis .
