Maybe he needed to get his first playoff win out of the way , but Arizona s Carson Palmer looked more than a little jittery Saturday night , right ? Two interceptions , several close call scary throws and decisions . One of his touchdowns came on a bizarre lucky tip and another on a shovel pass . The throw to Fitzgerald at the start of overtime was a thing of beauty and reminds you what Palmer s capable of , but he didn t inspire confidence for most of that game . Cam Newton , meanwhile , is hitting Greg Olsen in double coverage with laser beams and looks like nothing has ever bothered him . At this point , Newton is the QB in this matchup you trust more .
