As for Hodgson , he now has a decision to make . Vardy has so far only played in wide positions in his four England appearances ( as he did for much of last season for Leicester ) . Given that Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane are ahead of him in the pecking order , you can see why . But if Hodgson wants his side to play with pace in attack and be dangerous on the counter ? useful against stronger teams ? then it makes sense for Hodgson to play him in his best position , as Leicester coach Claudio Ranieri has done .
