Food deserts . While not everyone agrees with the term food desert , the USDA still estimates 23 . 5 million people live in these urban neighborhoods and rural towns with limited access to fresh , affordable , healthy food . Without grocery stores in these areas , residents often have to rely on fast food and convenience stores that don ' t stock fresh produce . It takes a real toll on their health . Families who live in these areas struggle more with obesity and chronic conditions , and they even die sooner than people who live in neighborhoods with easy access to healthy food . More farmers markets are now accepting food stamps and many nonprofits have stepped in to try to bring community gardens and healthy food trucks to these areas , but so far it ' s not enough . Will cities offer incentives to grocery store chains to relocate to these neighborhoods ? How else can this system be helped ?
