Peter King , SI . com : " I think the NFL has a huge issue on its hands stemming from the unaffiliated neurological consultant on the St . Louis sideline Sunday missing the obvious play where Rams quarterback Case Keenum was knocked woozy . For those unfamiliar with how the program works , there is a brain trauma specialist with no tie to either team on the sideline of every NFL game . That medical professional s job is to monitor all players on the field for any evidence of a debilitating hit . It ' s stunning to try to figure how the Rams ' consultant missed Keenum s head slamming against the turf , and it s also inexplicable as to how the independent eye in the sky medical consultant upstairs missed it as well . What was startling to me is that so many on the Rams sideline saw it . Backup quarterback Nick Foles immediately began to loosen up as if he was going to have to enter the game . This loophole absolutely must be closed , or viewers and the teams themselves are going to lose faith in the system designed to protect players who ve undergone head trauma . "
