So sit back , close your eyes , and imagine hearing all those conversations trapped in a high speed metal tube flying between Washington and San Francisco , or New York to Paris . How many hours is that ? Do you really want to hear the chatter of people sitting right next to you or 15 feet away ? Even if the talks are muffled through your noise canceling headphones , that doesn ' t make it any better . What if you just want to sleep through the flight ? Or take a respite from the always on connected life you have on the ground ?
