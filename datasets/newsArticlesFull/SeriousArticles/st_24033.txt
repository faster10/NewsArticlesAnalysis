On this date in 1826 , James Fenimore Cooper , perhaps the first great American novelist published Last of the Mohicans , a thrilling tale set during the French and Indian War . Cooper s memorable characters and vivid descriptions of Upstate New York have captured imaginations for generations . The region where the novel takes place was settled by Cooper s family and Cooperstown , now home to the Baseball Hall of Fame , is named for them . As Literary Traveler describes : Cooper s inspiration to write was rooted in a fervid imagination and his boyhood memories of an earlier Cooperstown and his father s pivotal role in its settlement . James and his older brothers roamed and explored the interminable woods , sometimes with reckless abandon according to his sister Hannah . Although he seldom encountered Indians , he met and listened to the stories of white hunters and Revolutionary war veterans and observed wagon trains of settlers passing through the village on their way west .
