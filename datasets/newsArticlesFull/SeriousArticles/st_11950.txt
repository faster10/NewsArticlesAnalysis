I agreed with everything Sanders said , but still have reservations about his candidacy . Not once did he mention foreign policy , where the president has the most latitude to act . A Republican Congress would reject all his economic proposals . He d be a symbolic president , whose achievement would be moving the Overton window to the left , introducing radical ideas to public discourse , perhaps to be fulfilled by future administrations . Also , he s from Vermont , which vies with Utah for Least Typical State . Vermont is America s version of The Shire , the Hobbit populated land in The Lord of the Rings : a green liberal Zion with no cities , no minorities and no urban problems .
