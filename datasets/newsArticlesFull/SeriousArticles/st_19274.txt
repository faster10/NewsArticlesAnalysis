The government ' s tax clause argument is similarly flawed . It asserts that the individual mandate isn ' t really a restriction on freedom , it ' s just a tax violators are forced to pay a fine . If this logic is correct , it would justify any mandate enforced by a monetary fine , whether it be for broccoli , a car or anything else . Every lower court to have considered this constitutional issue has ruled that the mandate is not a tax but a penalty . As President Barack Obama acknowledged in 2009 , " for us to say that you ' ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase . "
