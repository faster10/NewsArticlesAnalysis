I ' m no libertarian . But there ' s still a lot for me to like in this vision . On the economic side , the Republican Party needs to have it kicked into its head that being the party of free enterprise is not the same thing as being the party of big business . And while I ' m a hawk on foreign policy , the GOP does need a useful realist corrective to a vision that only has the hammer of foreign intervention to hit every nail . Most importantly , the GOP is all too often quite cavalier about the dramatically important issue of civil liberties , and the imperial presidency .
