" Look , the more he gets to speak to a camera and speak to voters through that camera , the better it is for us , " Tucker Martin , a strategist for the pro Christie America Leads super PAC , told POLITICO on Monday . " Now look , ideally we would prefer he would be in the later debate , but the fact is he ' s going to be speaking to millions of voters . And we have no doubt he ' s going to do extremely well and millions of voters are going to see clips of that debate . So our goal is let Christie be Christie , speak directly to voters . It ' s all good . "
