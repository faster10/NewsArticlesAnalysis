But if I m coming up with reason No . 1 why I would pick LSU over Georgia , it would be Leonard Fournette . If you can find a quality grad transfer quarterback and expand the passing game to complement Fournette , you could strike it rich . Remember , it s not as if LSU doesn t have talent at wide receiver . Whether Travin Dural comes back is uncertain , but Malachi Dupre , John Diarse and Trey Quinn will all return . With Arden Key and Jamal Adams to build around , the defense will be fine , too .
