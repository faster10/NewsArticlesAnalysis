6 . ' The Battle of Algiers ' ( Gillo Pontecorvo , 1966 ) " A extraordinary film about the resistance against French occupation in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s . If you look at , say , Steven Soderbergh ' s ' Che ' or Paul Greengrass ' film ' Bloody Sunday , ' they owe a huge debt to ' The Battle of Algiers . ' One of the first films made anywhere in the world about war there weren ' t any goodies or baddies , just roving cameras following the chaotic day to day bomb attacks . It also shows the brutality that was then applied by the French police in an almost documentary way . It was just holding up a mirror and this was the first war film to do that . "
