Interestingly , and whatever differences existed among the twin military pillars of the GCC , Saudi Arabia and the UAE , it is fair to state that the war for Yemen has brought the two countries closer together than at any other previous time . In fact , GCC countries thwarted Iranian attempts to divide the GCC even if Oman retained its political distance from core military decisions . What the UAE wished to achieve was to guarantee the security of Yemen , persuaded that doing so protected the security of the entire Gulf region . Naturally , the preferred option was to reach a peaceful solution to get Yemen out from the dark tunnel that Al Houthis had dug , though the will to intervene militarily became inevitable after all possible political solutions were exhausted .
