A graduate of Stonehill College , Thompson earned a bachelor ' s degree in accounting . But his official biography at Yahoo and Paypal , where he worked previously , says that he also has a degree in computer science . Thompson probably could have gone further and claimed he had a master ' s degree in engineering and no one would have questioned it . Holding these credentials seems very plausible for someone with Thompson ' s job history . And since he was a well known and successful executive , a background check was probably put on the back burner . Why ? " Groupthink " is a possible culprit .
