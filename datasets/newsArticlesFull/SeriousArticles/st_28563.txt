Ohio State was astonishingly lucky to not lose a single player early to the NFL draft last season after winning the national championship . That was largely due to how much of the talent still wasn t even eligible for last year s draft , a perk that has caught up with the Buckeyes after this season . Nine Ohio State players are leaving early for the NFL , including star defensive end Joey Bosa , running back Ezekiel Elliott , linebacker Darron Lee and safety Vonn Bell . The Buckeyes will also lose left tackle Taylor Decker and linebacker Joshua Perry to graduation , among others .
