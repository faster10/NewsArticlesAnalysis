If the liberal agenda is less overtly mendacious and has more rational goals ? Reagan was quite right to observe that even a 10 percent decrease in gun murders means 1 , 000 Americans a year who are alive rather than dead ? that doesn t make it entirely honest . I support gun control . Every major Western industrial nation limits and regulates the ownership of handguns and military style weapons , and it s not coincidental that they all have drastically lower murder rates than the United States . The authors of the disastrously awkward Second Amendment were thinking about farm households with a musket behind the front door and a shotgun above the hearth it s ludicrous for anyone to pretend that they meant to grant an unlimited right to own military style weapons whose sole purpose is to kill large numbers of human beings .
