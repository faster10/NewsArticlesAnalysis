" We were at our dinner table on Deck 3 and were in the process of ordering our food , and we had just ordered our appetizers , " said Divya Sharma , who was celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary with her husband on the ship . " At that moment , there was a violent shaking of the ship , followed by loud crash noises as the plates and glasses broke due to the listing of the ship towards the starboard side . Lights went out immediately , but there was no announcement as to what had happened . It was pitch dark with no visibility . Everyone nearby started to scream , and a few minutes into the ordeal the emergency lights came on , and we observed that the ship is now listing on the port side . This is when the first announcement came on telling us it was nothing but an electrical failure , and that everything is under control . "
