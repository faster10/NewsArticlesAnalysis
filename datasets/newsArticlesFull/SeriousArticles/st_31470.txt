Reiss : No doubt about it , Jeff . Part of that is that they are limited personnel wise at running back , where Steven Jackson ( signed Dec . 22 ) is the lead power back , James White the top sub back and Brandon Bolden a versatile backup . But more than that is the fact they didn t have receivers Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola in the first meeting between the teams , and along with tight end Rob Gronkowski , they are Brady s go to guys . They ll play to their strengths and that s where they are strongest . I m curious to see if the Broncos can create enough disruption to slow them down .
