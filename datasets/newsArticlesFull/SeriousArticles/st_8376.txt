The next Democratic presidential debate is Thursday in Durham , New Hampshire and is hosted by MSNBC . Upset by a scant debate schedule , Democrats successfully urged the DNC to make a last minute addition , in addition to three other sanctioned debates in the coming months . It was originally thought that Clinton s frontrunner status would make her averse to more debates , but a closer than expected contest ( and well reviewed Clinton performances in the debates thus far ) has made her more agreeable , even eager . Sanders at first seemed reticent about this week s hasty scheduling , but he confirmed this morning that he ll participate tomorrow .
