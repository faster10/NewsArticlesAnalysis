The change that redirected the course of American pop was this : By 1965 , the year those two records appeared , the British Invasion had resegregated the charts and no one was comparing the Beatles to James Brown . They are remembered as rock ' n ' rollers , he is remembered as playing soul and funk . The Brits didn ' t do that on purpose they loved contemporary African American styles ( the Beatles told 16 Magazine that Brown was their favorite singer ) but they couldn ' t manage the tricky new rhythms , so they fell back on older varieties of blues and rock ' n ' roll .
