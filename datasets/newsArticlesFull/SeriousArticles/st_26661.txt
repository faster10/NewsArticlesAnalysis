At the press conference at the end of the annual session of China ' s legislature last month , I asked Premier Wen if he thought political reform was urgently needed so the leadership could better address the people ' s grievances and avert social unrest . The solution , he replied , was political reform but reform that is gradual and led by the Communist Party . " It ' s not easy to pursue political restructuring in a country of 1 . 3 billion people , " he said . " It needs to take place in an orderly way , under the leadership of the party . " Wen added : " At present , I think the biggest danger lies in corruption , and eliminating the breeding ground of corruption needs systemic and structural reform . "
