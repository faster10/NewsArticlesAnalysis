Technical experts said any rally should be sold into . " Technically , we have support at around 7 , 950 7 , 930 levels . Let us assume a scenario that we get a negative event . In such a case , we might open gap down and that could accelerate the selling pressure and we may test 7 , 800 level . Now suppose Nifty50 holds above the 7 , 950 level , and the market does not take the event very negatively and bounces back . Even then on the upside , anything beyond 8 , 100 looks extremely difficult . So rallies should be used to sell into , " said Mitesh Thacker of miteshthacker . com .
