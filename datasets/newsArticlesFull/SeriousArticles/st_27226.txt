When our shoot began in Toronto , I not only got to visit for a day or two every week , but was allowed to see the rushes online every evening . And something clicked for me . I realised that for our child star in particular ? Jacob Tremblay was just turning eight ? getting him to improvise along the lines of the dialogue was producing much more naturalistic results than making him stick word for word to the script . I found myself deeply enjoying the spontaneous , fly on the wall feel of his interactions with Brie Larson ( playing his young Ma ) .
