Ryan does not want to do all that boring fundraising that normally guarantees a hungry politician a job like speaker of the House . He ' d rather play with his kids . And who can blame him , really ? Take the kids to a football game versus call some plutocrat and beg for a fat check ? That ' s a pretty easy call . Ryan also laughably demanded that the Tea Partiers stop knifing the speaker in the back so often . However , we seriously doubt that the Tea Partiers are going to play nice , sit down , and shut up for very long . It ' s not really who they are , to state the glaringly obvious .
