Imagine a class action suit on behalf of the people of Flint , Michigan . There are plenty of available defendants . The Detroit Water Board , for cutting off the city ' s supply of water in a childish snit . Flint ' s own water department , for doing a lousy job of testing its only product . The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality , for ignoring claims that there was something wrong with the water and not overseeing the Flint department . Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder for appointing as head of the DEQ a person without significant environmental experience . Oh , and the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency , for doing . . . well , nothing .
