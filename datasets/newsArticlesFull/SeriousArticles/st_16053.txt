According to 2012 exit polls , 60 of young voters ( aged 18 29 ) supported President Barack Obama . Young voters also made up a slightly larger share of the electorate than they had in 2008 . This is a huge problem for Republicans for three reasons . One , people tend to vote with higher frequencies once they hit their 30s . Two , generational cohorts tend to stick with the party they supported in their formative years . And most obviously , young voters are more likely to be around to vote in the future .
