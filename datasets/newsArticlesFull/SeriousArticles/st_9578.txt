8 . Clearly , Packers coach Mike McCarthy has to put the Hail Mary in as a regular part of the offense for Rodgers . If the Packers had managed to win , Rodgers two throws at the end of regulation would have been instant classics . Even in defeat , they were pretty great . He completed a 60 yarder to Jeff Janis on a fourth and 20 from his own 4 . Two plays later , running to his left and letting it fly without being able to step into the throw , Rodgers launched a 41 yard TD to Janis . Janis had two catches during the regular season .
