Third , Obama stressed the unity amongst people of faith in America . In times when theological disagreements lead to harmful rhetoric , the right to religious freedom binds us together . The freedom of religion is a declaration of equality . No person , religious or irreligious , ought to be treated differently due to their beliefs . Religion has been mutated into dogma that separates communities . Instead , our core values ought to bind us together . It ' s afforded to all of us equally . That equality makes us family . As Obama concluded , " We are one American family . We will rise and fall together . It won ' t always be easy . There will be times where our worst impulses are given voice . But I believe that ultimately , our best voices will win out . And that gives me confidence and faith in the future . "
