Pickler : I just write about whatever I feel like that day . I don ' t ever sit down with a plan . ( Songwriter ) Leslie Satcher told me and I never had anyone say this to me before she said " you speak in lyrics . " And I said " huh ? " She said " you speak in lyrics . " The first time we ever wrote , she ' s writing down everything I ' m saying . I don ' t know how to write about anything else but what ' s going on . I can ' t just go in and make some bulls up . I can ' t do that . It has to come from a real place or I can ' t write it .
