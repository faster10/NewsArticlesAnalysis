This is just the most recent high profile example of the deeply misogynistic abuse , double standards and sexist attacks that women in the public eye experience on a daily basis . To correlate Kelly s question about Trump s misogynistic comments with a completely unrelated photo shoot is to try and suggest that a woman who dares to be photographed or care about her appearance automatically forfeits the right to challenge sexism . To ridicule Trump for refusing to enter into a debate with Kelly as moderator is to suggest that female journalists in general , and Kelly in particular , are lightweight pushovers ? playing into Trump s own sexist rhetoric . To bombard Kelly with misogynistic online abuse is to admit that there are no logical arguments with which to challenge her , as she has acted entirely professionally throughout .
