BACK ON TRACK ? Eugenie Bouchard s career has been like a roller coaster over the past two years . The Canadian made the semifinals of the Australian Open and French Open and the Wimbledon final in 2014 , when her year end ranking improved to a career best No . 7 ? at the age of 20 . Then she experienced a clump of mediocre results and first round losses which saw her ranking slump to 48 by the end of last year . A fall on a slippery floor in a dressing room at the U . S . Open and resulting concussion which led to a lengthy layoff didn t help . But Bouchard s start to 2016 has been good , advancing to the quarterfinals at the Shenzhen Open in China , then the Hobart International final last week . Her comeback faces its biggest test on Wednesday when she plays No . 4 seeded Agnieszka Radwanska in the second round . Radwanska beat Bouchard in straight sets on clay in their only career meeting at the Madrid Masters in 2014 .
