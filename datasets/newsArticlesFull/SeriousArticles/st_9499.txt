OK , stuff happens , right ? A three man rush doesn ' t get there . Not a shock . So now it ' s on the back end of the Lions ' defense to knock the ball down . However , why isn ' t there a defender running with Rodgers ? And who is teaching this technique in the end zone ? We should never see defenders playing behind the receivers in the end zone ( guarding the end line ) , even in a normal red zone situation . So , why now ? That allows the offensive players to box out , gain position and prevent anyone from knocking it down . Beyond that , the Lions opted not to use Calvin Johnson or even Eric Ebron , two huge bodies who would both have been the tallest players in the end zone .
