For the study , researchers at the University of Copenhagen recruited 61 sedentary and moderately overweight men , mostly in their 20s and early 30s , and randomly assigned them to one of three groups : a control group that remained sedentary with no changes to diet or activity another group that took up a 30 minutes a day routine of moderate exercise like jogging or biking ( each participant worked out for either half an hour or until he burned 300 calories ) or a third group that exercised more vigorously , for an hour a day or until they burned 600 calories .
