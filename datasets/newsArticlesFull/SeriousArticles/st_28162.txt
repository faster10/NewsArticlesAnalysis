Karl Marx was a middle class philosopher , economist , and journalist ( whose main employer was a New York newspaper ) . He was also flawed in the extreme . He drank excessively , behaved shamefully in his home life , and worked obsessionally , though he produced little that earned him money or recognition during his lifetime . These flaws , however , made him more interesting because , despite being in a state of near constant personal crisis , he was able to accomplish what he set out to do he changed the world .
