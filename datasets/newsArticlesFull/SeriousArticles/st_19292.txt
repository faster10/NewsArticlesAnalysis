There is , though , one major flaw in Bush s chosen analogy : For all the doomsaying about McCain s campaign , the Arizona senator had a polling floor of about 15 percent nationally in 2007 . In the nearly 150 national polls tracked by RealClearPolitics from the start of that year through the end of October of that year , McCain failed to crack double digits only six times , and never more than twice in a month . Bush , meanwhile , hasn t averaged above 15 percent since mid July , and has inched into double digits only once in the past 12 national polls dating back to mid September .
