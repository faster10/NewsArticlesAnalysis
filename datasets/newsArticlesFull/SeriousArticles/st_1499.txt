But on Sunday , a Southwest 737 crew mistook a runway at a small local airport in Hollister , Missouri , for the much larger runway at nearby , Branson Airport , and landed at the small strip by mistake . To make matters more hair raising , the 737 touched down on a relatively short runway even for light planes , never mind for airliners . To their credit , the crew members of the Boeing jet got it stopped short of the end of the runway , where an embankment separated it from U . S . Highway 65 , without doing any damage to passengers or the plane .
