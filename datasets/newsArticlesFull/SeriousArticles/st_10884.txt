Solidarity between France and India is natural . I would like to thank once again President Mukherjee and Prime Minister Modi for their messages after the Daesh ( ISIS ) attacks in Paris in November . French people have also been very touched by the numerous gestures of friendship received from all over India . I think in particular of a paper banner 24m long bearing the signatures and drawings of thousands of school children . The flow of Indian tourists and visitors continued to increase this winter , helping Paris to remain the Paris we love . They are warmly welcome , more than ever . We engage constantly with India . The Indo French working group on counter terrorism met just after the Paris attacks in November 2015 . That was the best answer to show our determination in front of jihadism .
