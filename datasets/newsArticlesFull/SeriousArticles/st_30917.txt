They ve got a new D coordinator , but Coach ( Pete ) Carroll s not going to change the defense , regardless of who he has calling the defense , Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said . We feel like we have some familiarity with them , but the same goes for them . They ve played us as well . Because it s happening in the year and it s so close to the likeness or the sameness of the defenses , as far as the scheme , you re kind of going Round 2 like you would with a division opponent . I think there s some similarity to that .
