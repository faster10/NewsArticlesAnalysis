Richard Robbins : I started reading about some of the new research about girls ' education in about 2005 , 2006 , and I thought at first that it was just information that was new to me . That somehow I had missed this incredible fact about how powerful educating girls could be . And then over the course of a couple of months in my research , it became clear that this is not a widely known fact . Although it was well known inside the development community , out in the general public , it didn ' t seem to be well understood .
