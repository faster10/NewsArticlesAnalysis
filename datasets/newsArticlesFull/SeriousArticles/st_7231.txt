Despite reports Rob Gronkowski ' s ( back , knee ) availability would come down to a game time decision in the Divisional Round , Gronk was a full go against the Chiefs with a 7 83 2 stat line on 91 of the snaps . Patriots tight ends ripped up Denver ' s backend in these clubs ' Week 12 date , with Gronk and Scott Chandler combining for 11 146 2 . As Gronk exited that game early due to a low blow from Broncos FS Darian Stewart and missed the next week , this is something of a RevengeGame . The Broncos allowed the eighth most yards to tight ends this regular season . . . . No NFL team consistently exploits opponents ' weaknesses better than the Patriots , who will almost certainly attack Denver ' s coverage in the middle of the field with Harris ailing . Although Danny Amendola had a slow Divisional Round ( 2 18 0 ) , he did log a robust 76 playing time clip and should see more Week 20 usage as New England ' s primary slot receiver . Although he does not offer the floor or ceiling of Julian Edelman , Amendola will be a significantly lower owned DFS play and could be a major part of the Patriots ' matchup based game plan . . . . Edelman will see lots of LCB Aqib Talib , but moves around more than any New England receiver and will get chances against struggling RCB Bradley Roby as well as banged up Harris . Edelman played over half of his 2015 snaps in the slot . Edelman was highly effective in his Week 19 return from foot surgery , catching ten balls and totaling 111 yards on an 88 snap rate . In Denver , Edelman is the favorite to lead the Patriots in receptions . . . . Brandon LaFell ' s target counts are 5 , 4 , 1 , and 5 in New England ' s last four games , failing to clear 40 receiving yards in six of his last seven . The passing game environment is favorable and LaFell ' s matchup isn ' t imposing versus Roby , but LaFell ' s recent usage and production don ' t seem to bode positively for his Week 20 results .
