Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards appeared before a congressional committee last month and insisted she was proud of the " limited " role the organization has had in facilitating fetal tissue research . In a written statement to the committee , she pointed out that just 1 percent of Planned Parenthood ' s nearly 700 clinics obtain fetal tissue for researchers seeking disease cures . She said that work is a " minuscule " part of her organization ' s services , which include testing for sexually transmitted infections and the provision of contraception and abortions .
