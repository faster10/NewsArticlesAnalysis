How would I guard him ? He ' s unguardable . Look , if he gets doubled , he can make plays for other people . There ' s no one way to guard Steph . I think you need to mix it up . He ' s figured it out now . A lot of teams would put bigger , longer guys on him . He ' s figured that out . A lot of teams would put smaller guys on him . Some guys hold and grab him and try to be physical . If you look at Steph after the game , he ' s got two arms full of scratches and welts and bruises because he ' s just getting absolutely mauled . We run him off a lot of screens so he ' s getting bashed . He ' s coming off a lot of double screens fast . Guys chasing him are always holding his shirt , or holding his arm , or grabbing him . We ' re hoping he can get more calls as the MVP .
