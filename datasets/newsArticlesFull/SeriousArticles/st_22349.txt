Things pick up a bit down on Earth , where little Kal El has crash landed in Kansas and been raised by the Kents ( Kevin Costner and Diane Lane ) . They ' ve rechristened him Clark , a boy who ' s taught to keep his special gifts under wraps especially after he saves a busful of classmates and draws the wrong kind of attention . Cavill plays the grown up Clark as a sort of existential loner who drifts from town to town , leaving a series of good deeds in his mysterious wake . . . until Lois Lane ( Amy Adams ) figures out his game . The 21st century Lois isn ' t the gullible gal Friday she was in the old comics or the Christopher Reeve Superman films , where she was played by Margot Kidder . Now she ' s a hard nosed , Pulitzer Prize winning reporter . That ' s progress , I guess . But there ' s a distinct lack of heat between Adams and Cavill , and their stabs at sub sitcom humor fall flat .
