And while I understand Bill Belichick s decision to go for it on fourth and one from the 16 , trailing by eight points with about six minutes left in the game , I don t agree with it . I would have attempted the 31 yard field goal and tried to cut the lead to five points , thereby taking the tricky two point conversion call out of the equation later on . The Patriots had a nice pass play called to Julian Edelman in the left flat , but Denver cornerback Chris Harris held his ground and made a tremendous play to deny Edelman the first down . Later in the quarter , on fourth and six from the Denver 14 with 2 : 25 remaining , it was obviously defensible to go for the first down and eschew the field goal . Both times , however , New England failed to convert .
