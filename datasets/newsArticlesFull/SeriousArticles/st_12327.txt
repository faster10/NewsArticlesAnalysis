Pro government legislators are arguing before the Supreme Court that Cunha abused his power in order to protect himself against the charges , adding that he also failed to give Rousseff the right to defend herself . It s not clear when any ruling from the court might come . If a two thirds majority approves there , it then goes to the upper house for an impeachment trial , where another two thirds majority would force Rousseff from office . Lawmakers said the reading is a formality required by law .
