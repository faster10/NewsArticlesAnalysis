Caregivers for the aging population . We are heading into a kind of caregiver crisis . The number of people 65 years and older is expected to rise 101 between 2000 and 2030 , yet the number of family members who can provide care for these older adults is only expected to rise 25 . This raises a series of related questions , not least who is going to step up to fill the gaps ? Will cities that don ' t traditionally have strong public transportation systems add to their routes ? Will developers create more mixed use buildings to make shopping and socializing easier to access ? Could the government create a kind of caregiver corps that could check in on the isolated elderly ? Who will pay for this expensive kind of safety net ?
