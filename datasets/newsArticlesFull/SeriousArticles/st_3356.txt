Ideal first single ? if you don t like Coldplay in this groove , chances are this is not the Coldplay album for you . There s so much to like about this single ? the carefree feeling , the tune that floats somewhere between Bob Marley and Daft Punk , the fact that it doesn t sound anything like a band on their seventh album merely going through the motions . They sound excited to be doing something new . An a list band taking risks like this is always to applauded . Plus this album is going to drop post Adele , so if it doesn t make No . 1 the Adele factor can be cited .
