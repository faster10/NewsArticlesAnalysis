They will interview former Falcons head coach Mike Smith on Monday .

He is 56 years old , so only five years older than Marrone , and he ' s well liked and respected around the league . Smith had a rough final two seasons in Atlanta and earned some measure of negative fame for some high profile game management blunders , but he may look a lot like Coughlin looked to the Giants when they hired him in 2004 .
