New York Giants : The Giants have reason to worry about 40 percent of their starting offensive line being ready for Sunday ' s game in Washington . Center Weston Richburg is dealing with a high ankle sprain and hasn ' t been able to run since suffering the injury two Sundays ago against New England . And left guard Justin Pugh , who missed that game with concussion symptoms , is in the concussion protocol and not yet cleared to practice . The Giants are off Tuesday before returning to practice on Wednesday to prep for a first place showdown with Washington , against whom they ' re 5 0 over the past three seasons . Dan Graziano
