Automotive executives began to act as foolishly as politicians , though , and Flint decayed into an American Beirut . The factories kept building V 8 muscle cars while Japan was churning out economy engines that got three times the gas mileage . The market shrank for " Detroit Steel " and now there are great concrete slabs with weeds growing through the cracks where industry used to build cars and trucks and parts that made America run . A few years ago I drove past the vast concrete foundation that is all that remains of the AC spark plug factory and I struggled not to cry because I thought of all the people I grew up with who had spent their working lives on that floor . I suppose they are grateful for the time and the jobs .
