I retired after teaching at the Quaid e Azam University is Islamabad for more than 42 years , and joined another varsity in Lahore . I was dismissed because the people running the place found my views on religion , science and political matters not acceptable . I often write in newspapers and am frequently seen on television , so I am in that sense a very public person . Anyone who puts himself in opposition , not just to the Pakistani State , but goes against the grain of society , has to face the consequences . I am fortunate that so far I am here .
