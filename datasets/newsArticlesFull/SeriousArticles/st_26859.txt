A recent New York Times front page featured an analysis by Climate Interactive on how the commitments that the world ' s governments are making in the run up to Paris are stacking up . Assuming countries follow through on their commitments , the maths tells us that we are on a trajectory to 3 . 5 degrees of warming a climate catastrophe that will cause mass extinctions , threaten ecological systems worldwide and trigger famine , drought and mass migration at a scale never seen before . The commitments currently on the table do reduce warming by one degree below the business as usual pathway that the world is currently on and this marginal gain is being celebrated as a breakthrough in the 20 years plus of stagnant climate negotiations . But this is not nearly enough to secure our future . Depressingly , we seem to be held captive by an addiction to fossil fuels that is entirely a result of human choice , but now seems to be out of our control .
