Association of Tennis Professionals ( ATP ) chief Chris Kermode said the timing of the report was " disappointing " and rejected any suggestion that match fixing had been covered up . " The Tennis Integrity Unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn ' t being thoroughly investigated , " Kermode told reporters . " And while the BBC and BuzzFeed reports mainly refer to events from about 10 years ago , we will investigate any new information , and we always do . "
