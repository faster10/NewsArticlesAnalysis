Well it s official the conventional wisdom is settled . A consensus began to develop last week and crested this weekend , ending with the nearly absolute conclusion that Jeb Bush s presidential candidacy is dead . But take heart Jeb ! Campaign . When conventional wisdom is this set against you with this much certainty this far ahead of Election Day , conventional wisdom is almost always wrong . None of this is to say Bush s campaign is actually strong . Everyone can see his weaknesses , but I ridicule the notion that Bush is completely done for . His campaign is not without some significant assets , including substantial commitments from party leadership , enough money in his campaign ? ? ? as well as plenty in his super PAC ? ? ? and the fact that , oh by the way , Jeb Bush isn t that bad of a candidate . Bush has not committed a colossal fatal blunder , such as running up a financial debt like Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker did . The bottom line , in Bush s case , is that it is still too early to take today s headlines and extrapolate out to the New Hampshire , South Carolina and SEC primaries .
