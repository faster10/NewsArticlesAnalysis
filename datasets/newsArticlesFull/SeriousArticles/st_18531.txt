After a disaster , there ' s a limited window of time to find trapped survivors . FINDER makes the process more efficient . It uses a low power radio signal to detect motion . Each movement caused by a heartbeat is like a " twinkle " reflecting back to the radar . What makes the system especially smart is software that can cut through all other movements and pinpoint which vibrations are signs of life . The system looks just for the signals that match human heartbeats , filtering out slower movements like tree branches in the wind , and faster ones like the heartbeat of a rat .
