Assistant chief constable Marcus Beale , who leads on counter terrorism , said : Tareena Shakil had self radicalised by viewing extremist material on the internet , before leaving the UK in October 2014 . Our assessment is that she was not naive she had absolutely clear intentions when she left the UK , sending tweets encouraging the public to commit acts of terrorism here and then taking her young child to join Daesh Isis in Syria . Photographs seized from her phone showed Ms Shakil posing with a firearm and wearing a Daesh balaclava . Another showed a rucksack with a Daesh logo and person holding a handgun . These were taken while she was in Syria .
