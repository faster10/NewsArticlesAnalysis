Some of our work last year included supporting a man who got a job as a fitness instructor on a cruise ship and then was fired two days later when he disclosed his positive status supporting a woman who was told by a leading national agency she could not avail of its services convincing a creche manager she did not have to inform all parents of one child s HIV status supporting a woman who was informed by a holistic therapy college that she could not practice reflexology and several dentists who refused to treat our service users , referring them instead to the Dublin Dental Hospital even for minor procedures .
