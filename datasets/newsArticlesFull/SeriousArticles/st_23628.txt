A centerpiece of Snyder s agenda , and one of his first actions , was a new law that gave the state dramatic powers to take over failing municipalities and school boards by appointing emergency managers with unchecked authority . Michigan voters killed that law in a November 2012 referendum , but a month later Snyder got the Legislature , in a lame duck session , to enact a law very similar to the one voters had rejected . This time , legislators attached it to a spending bill so it couldn t be undone by referendum .
