Don ' t make too much of individual polls HuffPollster : " A new poll , released Tuesday by CNN and WMUR , has some pretty remarkable results for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ' campaign in New Hampshire . It ' s also , most likely , a total outlier . That ' s not to say there ' s necessarily anything wrong with the way it was conducted . Pollsters vary in how they contact voters and in the assumptions they make about who ' ll end up turning out on Election Day . But the laws of statistics mean that even survey houses with almost identical methodologies will sometimes end up with results that just don ' t look like anything else . Our best chance of figuring out the actual state of the race isn ' t to figure out which of those surveys is most likely to be ' right , ' but to look at all that data together . " HuffPost
