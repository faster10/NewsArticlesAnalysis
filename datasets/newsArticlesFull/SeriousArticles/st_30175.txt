The Republican National Committee just gave the discussion a shove into the weekend . In a letter to NBC News Chairman Andy Lack , RNC Chairman Reince Priebus advised the company of an apparently stern action . In Priebus s words : P ending further discussion between the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) and our presidential campaigns , we are suspending the partnership with NBC News for the Republican primary debate at the University of Houston on February 26 , 2016 . In other words , this suspension could well be lifted if the campaigns so direct , meaning that this gesture could well be empty .
