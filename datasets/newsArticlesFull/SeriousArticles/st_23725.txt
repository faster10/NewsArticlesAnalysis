The clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief ( often reinforced by self serving interpretations of any number of religious texts ) that homosexuality is a disease . However , much like drapetomania ( the pseudo scientific " disease " an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid 19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape ) , homosexuality is in fact not an illness , but rather a fact of human nature . And rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche , demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here , it ' s homophobia , not homosexuality .
