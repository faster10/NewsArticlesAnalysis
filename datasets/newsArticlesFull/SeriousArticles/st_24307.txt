Most important , the agency pricing model levels the playing field for e book retailers . It prevents deep pocketed retailers or device makers from engaging in predatory price wars to harm competitors or discourage formation of new competitors . It would enable the marketplace to support more retailers , which would mean more bookstores promoting the joys of reading to more readers . And it would force retailers to compete on customer experience rather than price . Customers are best served when we have a vibrant e book retailing ecosystem .
