Chili peppers come in many colors , sizes , and shapes , but in all of them the chemical compound responsible for their pungent flavor and often intense heat is capsaicin , with the chemical formula C 18 H 27 O 3 N and a structure that has similarities to that of piperine the active ingredient in pepper : Both structures have a nitrogen atom ( N ) next to a carbon atom ( C ) doubly bonded to oxygen ( O ) , and both have a single aromatic ring with a chain of carbon atoms . That both molecules are " hot " is perhaps not surprising if the hot sensation results from the shape of the molecule .
