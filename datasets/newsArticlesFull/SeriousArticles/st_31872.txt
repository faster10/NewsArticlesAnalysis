A production the size of Furious 8 , which would likely include dozens , maybe hundreds , of crew , has yet to make its way to Cuba . A film has to get a special license to shoot in Cuba , which is no easy feat , even after Obama lifted some of the restrictions . A film like Papa got the exemption for the license because it was a Hemingway story which required them to shoot in places Hemingway visited . However , locations for any film are never set in stone and could easily change before shooting , and sources say the paperwork from the treasury department has not yet been approved for them to shoot in Cuba in the spring .
