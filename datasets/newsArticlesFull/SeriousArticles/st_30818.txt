For non tea party Republicans , this second outcome opens all kinds of ugly , ominous possibilities . If candidate Romney loses , tea party Republicans will claim that the GOP lost because it failed to nominate a " true conservative . " That claim may fly in the face of political math ( how would a more extreme candidate win more votes ? ) , but it will pack a lot of emotional punch . Intense partisans are always ready to believe that the way to win is to be more intense and more partisan . Back to back losses under John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 will open the way to an ultra conservative nominee in 2016 and a true party debacle .
