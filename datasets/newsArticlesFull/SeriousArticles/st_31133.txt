It has been said that the mere existence of Guantanamo is a recruiting tool for the enemy . However , recall that there was no Guantanamo detention facility when al Qaeda bombed the World Trade Center in the 1990s or blew up the U . S . embassies in East Africa in 1998 or attacked the USS Cole in 2000 . And I suspect that if the Bush administration had brought the Guantanamo detainees not to Cuba but to a detention facility in the United States , that facility would have been the object of their scorn and derision .
