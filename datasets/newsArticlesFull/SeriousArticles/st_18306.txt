The Bolli Anversa group and Marban ' s team both used cardiac stem cells , but Bolli and Anversa " purified " the CSCs , so that more than 90 of the infusion was actual stem cells . Marban , on the other hand , used a mixture of stem cells and other types of cells extracted from the patient ' s heart . " We ' ve found that the mixture is more potent than any subtype we ' ve been able to isolate , " he says . He says the additional cells may help by providing a supportive environment for the stem cells to multiply .
