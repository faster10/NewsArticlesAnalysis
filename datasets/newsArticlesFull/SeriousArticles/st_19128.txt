It does this through a little understood process called accreditation . To be eligible for those billions of research and financial aid dollars , colleges must be accredited . Technically , accreditors are nonprofit organizations run by consortia of existing colleges . But in order to make a college eligible for federal money , accreditors must first be approved by the federal government . Without that approval and the money that goes along with it , both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop . In other words , Uncle Sam ultimately decides who gets to be an American college and grant college degrees .
