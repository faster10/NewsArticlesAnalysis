" Beauty " seemed somehow insufficient a description for the sounds that came from Ravi Shankar ' s sitar in a concert hall . It was as if nature itself were being replicated on the stage , whether it was gentle summer rain or late autumn wind having its way with the landscape . There would be intense engagement between Shankar and his ensemble as they summoned into being tempests of interlocking phrases that seemed to coil and unravel at will . The audience would be enraptured , transported , energized into enthusiastic applause .
