" I went to bed at 5 a . m . this morning , " he said . " We ' ve played 23 innings in baseball in 24 hours . I got a third baseman ( David Wright ) who ' s got we have to worry about his back . The days off help him . I have a center fielder who has a bad shoulder . I ' ve got a right fielder ( Curtis Granderson ) who has a bad thumb . My second baseman lives and dies with his lower body . So , look , they play hard . So to have them out here today just to run around for ten minutes , to me doesn ' t make a lot of sense . We ' ve played a lot of baseball in the last three or four days . There are some guys in there , we ' re going to hit inside . We played games in our park . We worked out here three straight days . We know the infield , the outfield . We don ' t know the new Commissioner ' s boxes . So we ' re familiar here .
