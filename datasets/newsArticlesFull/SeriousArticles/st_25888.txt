As much as I love the Yankees , I love the game of baseball more . Which is why I always harbor a secret hope on opening day that the long suffering Cubs fans will finally get to see a World Series win in their antique jewel of a ballpark , Wrigley Field . I want to see baseball tradition and fan faith rewarded . Even when the Yankees ' archrivals , the Boston Red Sox , won their 2004 World Series after 86 years of waiting , I quietly cheered , because New England fans had waited long enough and deserved some deliverance . The love of the game comes first .
