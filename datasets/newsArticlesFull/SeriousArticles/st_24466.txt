At the same time , these cases from the shoe bomber to the underwear bomber show that there is remarkably little hostility to American culture or society . For example , the infamous Times Square bomber , a Pakistani American who tried to blow up a car in New York , specifically mentioned U . S . drone strikes that killed civilians in Pakistan . The Boston Marathon bombers , similarly , explicitly cited the U . S . wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as motivating factors . Almost none of the terrorists or would be terrorists had any problem with American society itself .
