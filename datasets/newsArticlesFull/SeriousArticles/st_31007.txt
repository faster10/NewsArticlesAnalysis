This question is really what it all boils down to , right ? The Jets are in the thick of the wild card race , at 6 5 with five games remaining ? Giants , Titans , Cowboys ( without quarterback Tony Romo ) , Patriots , and Bills . You ' ve got to think that once the Jets hit their eighth loss , they ' ll be in a perilous situation . A 9 7 record will probably be enough to land a wild card spot in the AFC this year , but I don ' t see 8 8 getting it done . I ' m picking the Jets to lose Sunday to the Giants , even though it ' s a toss up game . I also think they ' ll lose to the Patriots . They should beat the Titans fairly easily , right ? That means the Jets must win in Dallas and in Buffalo , in order to finish 9 7 ( in this hypothetical scenario ) . I think the Jets beat the Cowboys , but come up just short against Rex Ryan and Co . in the regular season finale . They ' ll finish 8 8 in Year 1 under Bowles , just on the outside of the playoffs . But that ' s ? just an educated guess , so don ' t put too much stock into it . I wouldn ' t be surprised if the Jets finish 9 7 . No matter how you slice it , Sunday ' s game against the Giants is a big swing game . ?
