Harry Reid to undergo surgery again
Harry Reid will have his second surgery of the year this week as he continues to recover from his New Year’s Day exercise accident. On Wednesday the Senate minority leader will have a follow-up surgery on his right eye at George Washington University. Reid underwent a nearly four-hour surgery to repair broken bones in his face in January, but his eye was so swollen that it will require another procedure as the Nevada Democrat fights to regain sight in his eye.

His recovery will require him to miss the rest of the week but he is not expected to miss any more time in the office beyond that,” said Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Reid. Reid injured his eye during a Jan. 1 workout when an exercise band snapped and sent him tumbling into cabinets, breaking several bones in his face as well as ribs. Reid has gradually spent more time in the Senate since the first surgery, and delivered a scathing speech on Monday that needled Republicans who are struggling to pass a bill funding Homeland Security. The Senate is expected to be on recess next week, which will give Reid additional time to recover.
