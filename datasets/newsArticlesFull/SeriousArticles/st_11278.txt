So Wipe Out Alzheimer ' s is stepping in . We ' re asking women to put together their own " brain trusts " in their communities groups that will go out and do some muscular fund raising . But equally important , these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and isn ' t . What are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents ? What ' s the difference between normal forgetfulness , dementia and Alzheimer ' s disease ? Can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline ? Do dietary supplements help ?
