Take Hillary Clinton for example . In April , Clinton announced that campaign finance reform would be one of the ? pillars of her campaign . In September , she ? released ? a robust policy platform detailing her plan for money in politics reform . This was a critical step that should be applauded , but Clinton can do more to champion this issue during her campaign . If elected , will she make these reform measures a priority in her first 100 days in office ? How will she help make sure these policy solutions actually take root ? Consistently lifting up her plans for reform and connecting money in politics to the issues everyday Americans care most about , from the environment to health care to schools , will show voters that she is committed to reclaiming our democracy from wealthy special interests .
