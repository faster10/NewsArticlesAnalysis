Norman is one of the most pick happy of Carolina ' s defensive backs . He came away with four interceptions during the 2015 season . But Kurt Coleman ( 7 ) , Charles Tillman ( 2 ) , and Robert McClain ( 1 ) all came away with at least one as well . The Panthers also forced turnovers on a greater percentage of their opponents ' drives than any other team in the league during the regular season . Because of that , the Panthers ' DBs have adopted the moniker " Thieves Ave . " They had a street sign hanging above their lockers in Carolina that bore the name , and they brought it with them to San Francisco for the Super Bowl .
