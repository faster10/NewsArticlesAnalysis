The BJP advertisement had questioned the Chief Minister ' s " silence " on " repeated insult " to cows by grand alliance leaders as the animal is revered by the countrymen and asked Kumar to come clean on the issue and stop playing votebank politics on cow .

Questioned by reporters about BJP ' s motive behind releasing the advertisement on beef in vernacular dailies in four districts , Sushil Modi said it was not his party that had raked up the beef issue during polls but RJD chief Lalu Prasad who had controversially said that the Hindus too eat beef .
