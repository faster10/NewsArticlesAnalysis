Super Bowl 50 is being played in Santa Clara , the billion dollar plus San Francisco 49ers ' stadium is located there , but it ' s being ' celebrated ' in San Francisco . The two are about 45 miles apart . Santa Clara bought into the ' we ' ll reap fiscal benefits from helping pay for the stadium ' in 2014 and San Francisco bought into the ' we ' ll reap economic benefit from hosting the Super Bowl ' in 2016 . Of course history is not on their side in either case . Most of the ' benefit ' numbers are compiled by folks who want the stadiums to be built and the events to happen . Independent studies show that the events bring in roughly 10 per cent of what the host committees claim they will and that communities that spring for public investments for major sports facilities never get their money back , let alone reap a significant financial benefit . St . Louis lost the Rams but dodged a huge fiscal bullet when it didn ' t opt to pony up for public funding for a stadium . In recent memory San Francisco bought into the hype behind the Americas Cup and lost 11 . 5 million dollars on the deal .
