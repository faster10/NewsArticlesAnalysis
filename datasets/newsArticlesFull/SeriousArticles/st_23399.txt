During his State of the State address Tuesday , Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder ( R ) said he would release emails from 2014 and 2015 related to the Flint water crisis , and on Wednesday , more than 270 pages of emails and notices were posted on his website . The emails show that the Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) first learned that there were elevated lead levels in children ' s blood on August 23 , 2015 , after a professor from Virginia Tech told the department he would be studying water quality issues in Flint " over the next few months . " Emails show on Sept . 26 , 2015 , Snyder ' s chief of staff , Dennis Muchmore , accused Flint officials of " taking the very sensitive issue of children ' s exposure to lead and trying to turn it into a political football claiming the departments are underestimating the impacts on the populations and particularly trying to shift responsibility to the state . " On Oct . 1 , Flint residents were told to avoid drinking the water , but a press release on Oct . 2 from the DEQ said the water was safe to drink . A message from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force to Snyder sent on Dec . 29 puts most of the blame for the catastrophe on the DEQ .
