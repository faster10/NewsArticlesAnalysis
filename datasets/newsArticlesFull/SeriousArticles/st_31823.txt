On Thursday the European Parliament tabled an urgent hearing on the hunger strike in Guantanamo . The debate is welcome . It is crucial that Europe realises that this is not just a U . S . issue it is our problem as well . European intelligence services worked closely with the U . S . in implementing the misguided policies of the so called " War on Terror " that saw so many innocent men swept up , " rendered " and tortured , simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time . Europe has tolerated for too long the U . S . departure from the rule of law with regard to people who deserve the support of European governments .
