Offensively I think we were able to play run and pass , Packers coach Mike McCarthy said . To simplify , that s what you have to do . It starts with the quarterback he has to be able to manage the whole thing and he Aaron Rodgers is exceptional at that . The guys up front did a good job of reacting to some of the things they started gaining . They went heavy base defense against us and tried to keep us out of running the ball when we had our fullback on the field . There were good adjustments on the sideline , good adjustments with the players and coaches and obviously we were very productive .
