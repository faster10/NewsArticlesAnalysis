Pup Snoopy has got the swagger and style Charlie lacks , serving as his foil and alter ego , as well as his most ardent tormentor and cheerleader . Snoopy ' s Red Baron fan fiction , in which he plays the Flying Ace , a WWI era fighter pilot , acts as a structuring device and metaphorical counterpart . The flying sequences liberate the film from the diminutive Charlie Brown world . However , they grow tiresome toward the end , when it becomes clear that these diversions are also being used to pad out the feature film running time , which isn ' t quite covered by the scanty Charlie story .
