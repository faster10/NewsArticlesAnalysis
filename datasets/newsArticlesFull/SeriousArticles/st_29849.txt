Cam Newton : Carolina ' s quarterback is playing at an elite level , making him hard for even the toughest defenses to stop as he showed with Sunday ' s 31 24 playoff win over a Seattle team that finished the regular season second in the NFL in total defense . Newton ' s ability to run and throw was big in last year ' s first round playoff win over Arizona . He had 35 yards rushing and threw for 198 yards and two touchdowns . His dual threat ability will keep the Cardinals off balance , just as Seattle ' s Russell Wilson did against Arizona in the regular season finale .
