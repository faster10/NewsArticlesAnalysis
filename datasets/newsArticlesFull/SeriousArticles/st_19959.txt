Indian Point receives its power from the same electric grid to which it contributes . If the power goes out and it briefly did only three weeks ago due to a utility technician ' s error backup diesel generators kick in to keep the plant functioning . That ' s exactly what happened during the recent outage . Each of Indian Point ' s two reactors have three auxiliary diesel generators , and then there are separately located backups to those backups as well as diesel driven fire pumps that can keep the spent fuel rod pools filled . It ' s all designed to avoid the kind of catastrophe that occurred at Japan ' s Fukushima Daiichi plant .
