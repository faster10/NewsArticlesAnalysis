Theo Riddick padded his league lead for catches by a tailback by hauling in another five grabs for 62 yards . He also got Detroit ' s scoring spree started by hauling in a 23 yard pass on its second series , then finished off the drive with an 8 yard touchdown . Though it seems somewhat insignificant now , with 45 points on the board , the play was a big one at the time because Detroit struggled so badly on its first drive a three and out that lost 10 yards . But Riddick got the Lions moving , got them on the board and Philly was toast after that .
