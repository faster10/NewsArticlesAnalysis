First , we ' re focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists . Since the mid 1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700 , 000 affordable units . But by 2020 , we ' re in danger of losing more than 125 , 000 because these mortgages are maturing , ending agreements to control rents in these units . So we ' ve launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come .
