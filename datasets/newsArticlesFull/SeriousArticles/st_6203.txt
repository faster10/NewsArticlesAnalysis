The Clinton campaign , meanwhile , saw Hillary Clinton making speeches in Iowa and former President Bill Clinton returning to the campaign trail in New Hampshire . Hillary Clinton started the new year with an event in Derry , New Hampshire , another southern suburban town , focusing on the high stakes in the election and the dangers of putting a Republican in the White House . On Monday and Tuesday , she will be holding events in Davenport , Cedar Rapids , Des Moines , Sioux City and Council Bluffs , Iowa , while Bill Clinton will be holding events in Nashua and Exeter , New Hampshire . The public entrance of Bill Clinton into his wife s campaign is a formidable development , because he is a huge draw for Democrats and has mostly taken a backstage role in the campaign thus far .
