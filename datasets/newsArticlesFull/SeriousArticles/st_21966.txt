Parker Posey as " Darla Marks " Then : Darla Marks was the senior with an attitude you did not want to piss off before first period for fear of being tarred and feathered . Now : Parker went on to become an indie film queen appearing in lots of films you saw at your local art house theater . I loved her the most in the Christopher Guest films " Waiting for Guffman " and " Best In Show . " You may have seen her on the small screen recently in " The Return of Jezebel James " and " Bored to Death " as Jason Schwartzman ' s love interest .
