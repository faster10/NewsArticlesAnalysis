Swinney and Saban know talent alone won t win a national title , but rather coaching up that talent and making sure players know how to put themselves in position to use the considerable skills at key moments makes all the difference between a big win or a disappointing loss . But not nine of them of any given team , and I think that s what separates those guys . Clemson is going to spread it out . We are who we are , they are who they are . Alabama is the epitome of what good football is about . And the team they are playing ? there are two things . Clemson has an uphill battle . Take shots with deep balls . Clemson has an ability to open up the field but will they be able to against the attacking defense of Alabama ? And then you have the x factor in this matchup , and that s Deshaun Watson and this system that they run . Alabama s defense held Michigan State quarterback and future National Football League draft pick Connor Cook to 210 yards passing , no touchdowns and intercepted him twice .
