Unfortunately much of the Innovation Act ' s proposals are ill considered from this perspective . For example , the act makes all patent litigation troll and non troll a " loser pays " system . The losing party must pay the attorney fees of the other side unless the loser ' s case was " reasonably justified . " So , if a PAE sues on a bad patent and loses , it may have to pay the company ' s attorney fees . By having more skin in the game , hopefully PAEs would think twice about asserting bad patents .
