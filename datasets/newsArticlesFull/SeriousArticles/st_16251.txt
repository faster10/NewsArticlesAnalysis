I ve been lucky enough to meet and even work with many of my heroes . But I never met Bowie . I have a friend who for years encouraged me to write a letter to David Bowie in the hopes of collaborating with him . My friend could guarantee that someone in his inner circle would deliver the letter , along with a glowing recommendation , to Bowie . I wrote the letter in my head a million times , but never committed it to paper . I think I was afraid to lose him . I love what he gave me , who he is in my life . What if that changed somehow ? Rejection , disappointment , who knows ? A human can t really be a North Star , can they ? I couldn t stomach the possibility of life without David Bowie .
