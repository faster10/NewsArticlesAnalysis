Drew Brees was an equal opportunity assassin , as he methodically ? victimized almost everyone on the defense . For a franchise that used to pride itself on defense , the offensive numbers the Saints piled up were breathe taking . New Orleans compiled 614 yards in total offense , with 511 yards in the passing game alone . Big Blue s defense must have thought that Jimmy Graham never left Bourbon Street , as they let Benjamin Watson run free to the tune of nine catches for 147 yards and a touchdown .
