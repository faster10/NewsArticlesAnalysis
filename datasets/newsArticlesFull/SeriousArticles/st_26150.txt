Oscar winner Lupita Nyong ' o , whose win in 2014 for ' 12 Years a Slave ' marks the last time a black actor won an Oscar , expressed her disappointment in the nominations in an Instagram post .

I stand with my peers calling for change in expanding the stories that are told and recognition of the people who tell them . " ?
