Added Bennett : " It s kind of ironic that Dez Bryant was telling him not to have an outburst , and he s one of the main guys in the NFL that has a lot of outbursts , so I guess he s changing , too . It s one of those things where I guess he s been there for two games , but I think people understand the type of player that he is , and they just want him to follow the type of ways that they do . You ve just got to learn who your teammates are and make sure that you don t step on any toes because at the end of the day you don t want to hurt any of your teammates . You still want them to play well . You ve just got to find out how to be a great leader . That just takes time . "
