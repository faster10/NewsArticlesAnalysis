Donald Trump definitely represents a dire threat to the future of the GOP elite , but not to the Republican Party . In fact , he may be the only candidate who can save the faltering contraption from itself . Far from being an outlier , he offers a chance for the party to rebrand itself . His most recent tiff with Fox News , where he refused to heed its debate ukase that he submit himself to the questioning of Megyn Kelly , is simply his latest swipe at the Politburo that has come to control the GOP . Probably only Trump can break with the political correctness that surrounds the GOP and return it to older , mainstream Republican traditions in the mold of Theodore Roosevelt or Richard Nixon . Whether it s foreign or domestic policy , the establishment candidates are retreads who piously mouth the shibboleths of the discredited George W . Bush administration : A return to a crusading foreign policy . Stepped up national surveillance at home . Massive increases in defense spending . And an even more punitive approach to social issues , including a ban on abortion in the case of rape or incest . This is supposed to be mainstream moderation ?
