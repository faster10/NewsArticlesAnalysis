After the taped interview , we continued to discuss Nelson ' s book . There were two single people on my crew and a married couple ( my husband and me ) . She asked my husband about whether men really are intimidated by more accomplished women . He said a secure man would not be . She agreed , saying the research for her book showed that a man was not intimidated by accomplished black women that men want someone with a great personality , who will treat them with respect and who will leave the baggage behind .
