I didn ' t have any gay role models until I got to college . At UC Berkeley , in the late ' 90s , I majored in English with a concentration on gender and sexuality . My professors were a wild pack of queer and feminist thinkers intent on dismantling social hierarchies and trying to reassemble the world for the betterment of the misfit and mistreated . It was like living in a John Waters film , where all the freaks got center stage and were made to relish their queerness and triumph in their status as outsiders . Being in a room with an openly lesbian professor and knowing that I was valued , rather than vilified , for the ways in which I didn ' t fit in was a soothing antidote to all those adolescent years of self loathing and doubt .
