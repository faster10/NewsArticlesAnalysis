5 . Host a bake sale : Remember when we were kids and our parents used to make cookies and brownies and stuff for school bake sales to raise money for a new flagpole or air conditioning in the gym ? Well , why not do the same thing now that we ' re grown ups and need to raise money for our vacations to Barcelona ? I say get a few friends together , bake up a storm , and then sell your goods at a local market , a festival , or even online at a place like Etsy . If you love baking , this is another great way to make money from a hobby . . . without inhaling all the extra calories eating the goods yourself !
