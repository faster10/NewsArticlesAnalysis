Born 1966 . Considered by many as one of the best lawyers of his generation . The Wisconsin native went to Harvard Law School where he was a classmate of President Barack Obama , and later clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia . He served as solicitor general under President George W . Bush and earned raves for his persuasive , conservational style at oral arguments . Now a private attorney , he has become the go to guy among conservatives to lead appeals on a variety of hot button issues : health care reform , same sex marriage , immigration enforcement , and gun rights . He personally argued seven cases in the 2011 term , including the health care petitions . He has been strategically coy about his chances for the high court , saying he would be honored but remains focused on his law practice .
