In an interview with NBC , Netanyahu said , " I haven ' t changed my policy , I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state . What has changed is the reality , Abu Mazen ( nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state , and he ' s made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel . And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace . I don ' t want a one state solution , I want a sustainable two state solution . "
