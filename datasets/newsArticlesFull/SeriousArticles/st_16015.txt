The Republicans , by contrast , have a more straightforward process . Supporters of each candidate are allowed to make a brief speech before each caucus meeting , after which voters cast their ballots , although in some cases votes are taken by a show of hands . Unlike the Democrats , however , the outcome is not final in deciding the number of delegates supporting each candidate that will be sent to the Republican National Convention . That is decided by county and district conventions that will be held later in the year .
