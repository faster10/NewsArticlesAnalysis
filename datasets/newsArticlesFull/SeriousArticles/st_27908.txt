We shouldn t take them away from people who currently own them , necessarily . That would likely cause just as many problems . I m sure there are more than a few disgruntled gun owners out there who would take a ban as an assault on liberty , and act accordingly . We should , rather , phase them out over time , similar to the way in which the CPSC dealt with drop sides . Allow those who currently own guns to keep them , but ban the future manufacture , sale and resale of guns and ammunition for personal use . Without a continually expanding and revolving supply of licit guns and ammunition immediately at hand , the hope is the gradual depletion of their circulation and utility . Calling it a contemporary version of beating swords into ploughshares .
