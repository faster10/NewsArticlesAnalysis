Part of the appeal of conspiracy theories is that they organize and contextualize chaos and trauma . JFK , 9 11 , Sandy Hook , the very existence of Alex Jones , all speak to a need we all have to explain ? and hopefully solve ? the real machinations behind the dreaded official story . But Making A Murderer shows us the guns that usually ? remain hidden behind the smoke . It presents a vast , evil conspiracy with actual names , flow charts and sweaty , furtive faces attached , along with clumsily planted evidence , coerced confessions , transcripts documenting said confessions , and caught in the act footage ? not to mention Perry Mason like courtroom reveals . Here , the guilty are clearly caught in the acts of their own malfeasance . And again , all this is strangely comforting . For if everyone in law enforcement in Manitowoc County , Wisconsin seems capable of framing two men , diligently covering up every aspect of their web of deceit , and then memorializing and celebrating their crime through a thoroughly corrupt and rigged legal system , well , anything is possible . The unexplainable may have an explanation , after all . The Universe may not be as random as we fear . Shit doesn t just happen , it can be made to happen ? by Them . Across ten grueling hours , we get to actually see Them in action , in all their malign yet clumsy glory . Oddly , both faithful Salon Reader and dedicated Fox News Viewer can find common ground in the resulting Murderer induced rage against a machine that we clearly saw breaking down .
