This policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable , rather than to condemn women ' s choices . In fact , the initiative clearly states that " Mothers who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to WIC ( Women , Infants and Children ) , a food and nutrition program for low income families . " I . e . the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can ' t afford to buy it . This is hardly an anti formula feeding campaign . ( But it definitely is a pro breastfeeding one ) .
