Dirty tricks or not , Cruz probably still wins Iowa , but we ll never know for sure . As I wrote earlier this week , Trump s national strategy was always unlikely to work in a place like Iowa . But Cruz was heavily invested in Iowa he had to win to stay afloat . He s also deeply disliked by his colleagues precisely because of his sleaziness . So it s no surprise he resorted to these tactics . And even if they didn t sway the election one way or the other , it does raise some serious questions ? about Ted Cruz and the process itself .
