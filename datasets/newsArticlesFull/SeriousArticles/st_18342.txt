This brings us back to the quote that opened this article : With great power comes great responsibility . As consumers , progressives have the power to compel Marvel and its business allies to change its racial and gender attitudes . If they refuse to hire more non white and non male writers , we can stop buying their comic books . If their movies and toys continue to omit or underrepresent racial minorities and women , we can refuse to see or purchase them . Because there are a great many fictional properties out there that do respect the diverse spectrum of their audiences , we are not beholden to Marvel or any other single company for quality entertainment . As such , when a consumer chooses to give money to Marvel after being made aware of these racist and sexist tendencies , they are implicitly expressing either sympathy for or indifference toward those problems .
