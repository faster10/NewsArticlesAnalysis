Mitt Romney has repeatedly and specifically said that he will not consider any plan that raises any increased tax revenue to pay down the deficit and the debt . During the Republican primaries , he famously joined with his competitors in raising his hand to say that he would reject even a 10 to 1 deal splitting spending cuts with tax revenue increases . The Bowles Simpson plan was based on an even less generous 3 to 1 split ( though of course , still weighted decidedly in favor of spending cuts ) .
