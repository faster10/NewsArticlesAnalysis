In this way as in so many others , Trump is the Republican id brought to gold plated life , in ways that are uncomfortably straightforward . Just as other candidates will talk about securing the borders but only Trump will call Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals , other Republicans treat the wealthy as moral exemplars whose wealth is but a byproduct of their virtue . They plead that we must help the job creators only because of how their benevolence showers down on the rest of us , and that we must relieve them of their crippling burden of taxation lest we punish success . They will defend to their dying breath the sacred right of plutocrats to pour cash into political campaigns on the grounds of free speech , and genuflect before even the most unsavory billionaires if they re willing to put enough money on the table .
