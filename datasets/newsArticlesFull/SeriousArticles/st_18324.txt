African Americans could not ( and why would they want to ? ) blend in the same manner due to their melanin rich skin color . Differing in physical appearance from the majority group is not problematic , but racism and discrimination continued post slavery , and the false belief that dark skin is inferior was perpetuated . Immigrants can assimilate in lifestyle , speak English , and accept other facets of American culture , but the shape of eyes , color of skin , and texture of hair cannot be altered through natural means . Assimilation can occur to a certain degree , but with some groups of people , there will always be a difference in skin color , hair texture , eye shape , etc , which should be celebrated ? not denigrated .
