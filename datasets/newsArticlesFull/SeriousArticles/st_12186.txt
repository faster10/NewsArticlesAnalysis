And here again , what got Romney into the trouble was his war room . It was the too fierce response to Attack 1 the adamant insistence that Romney had nothing , nothing to do with anything that happened at Bain after February 1999 that set up Romney for Attack 2 : Did he lie on SEC forms ? And now he will struggle through the rest of the election trying to reconcile his answers . Yes , it is technically true that Romney ended his operational role at Bain before he ended his titular role . It was also technically true ( as Josh Marshall points out ) that John Kerry did vote for the 87 billion before he voted against it .
