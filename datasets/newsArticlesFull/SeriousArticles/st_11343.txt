A British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago . The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east west divide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent . During the Late Cretaceous period , 66 to 100 million years ago , the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea . This sea , the Western Interior Seaway , ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean . Dinosaurs living in the western continent , called Laramidia , were similar to those found in Asia
