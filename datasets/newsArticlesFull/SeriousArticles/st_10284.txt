Maybe , through injury or whatever else , that ends up on display . In all likelihood , Osweiler takes in a final game or two from the sidelines before settling into the job next season and showing if he has what it takes to command the Broncos ' offense long term . It may not be nearly as pretty as it once was , but the football gods have demanded Brady Manning yet again , and we ' ll all be watching . Far be it for me to campaign against it , or for Elway and Kubiak to negate it though I can ' t help but wonder , once more , if the thought may have crossed at least one of their minds , if not both .
