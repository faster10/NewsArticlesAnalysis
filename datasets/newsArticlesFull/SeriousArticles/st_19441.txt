Another recent , and rare , sighting of a woman " leaning out " : A couple of weeks ago , I was sitting around a coffee table , eating Thai takeout with a circle of women in their 20s and 30s . Another high achieving friend showed us a photo of her young son , sitting on a hospital bed , smiling enthusiastically while holding out a big thumbs up . Turns out that while she was away on a business trip , he ' d fallen out of a tree and had to go to the hospital . The bowl haired little boy had asked his father to snap this photo with his iPhone to send to his mom so she could see how brave he had been , even and especially without her .
