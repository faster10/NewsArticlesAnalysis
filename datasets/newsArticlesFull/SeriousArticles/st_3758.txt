Coughlin is an offensive minded head coach , and he tends to trust Manning in almost every situation . This season , though , the Giants have had a lousy red zone offense , incapable of running the ball into the end zone ? they have three rushing touchdowns in 12 games . Three ! Manning is not a threat to take off and run , so that is never an option down near the goal line . The drive that got the Giants deep into Jets territory was not a crisp , well executed drive , it was a penalty filled mishmash and included a 9 yard sack of Manning on second down . Getting three points out of this slop would have been a great bonus for the Giants , not a consolation prize .
