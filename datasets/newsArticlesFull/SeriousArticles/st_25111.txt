My first political memories parallel my sports ones . Adlai Stevenson versus Dwight Eisenhower . I was hooked from then on , watched all the conventions , read all the position papers , couldn ' t wait to vote and have every time , every election at every level ever since . I ' ve covered city council races , mayoral races , sat in more living rooms with more candidates ' wives watching results than I care to count , covered conventions , and I ' ve even been kicked off a national Republican campaign press plane because the candidate didn ' t like one of my stories . A badge of honor . Besides it WAS funny darn it .
