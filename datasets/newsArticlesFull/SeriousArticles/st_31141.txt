There is a whole eco system focused on alleviating poverty . Perhaps this can be called the poverty alleviation industry . Obviously the intentions are good . Well designed schemes and subsidies do have an important place . But empowering the poor is far more effective than empowering the poverty alleviation industry . Our financial reforms empower the poor to fight poverty themselves . I can take the analogy of a house . The foundation and basic structure occupies some of the costs . Then come the fixtures , fittings and furniture . If the foundation and structure are weak any investment in nice fittings or attractive floor tiles or beautiful curtains is unlikely to last long . So also , empowering the poor through financial inclusion and social security will provide a more stable and lasting solution .
