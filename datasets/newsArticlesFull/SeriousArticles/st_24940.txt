" Ghost Protocol " brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time they ' re brought off with such casual aplomb that they ' re funny , too . Early on , Hunt and a fellow agent , the nattering tech nerd Benji ( Simon Pegg ) , have to penetrate the archive room of the Kremlin , and they do it in captivating silence by hiding behind a scrim that projects , to the security guard , an exact image of the hallway they ' re in ( minus the two of them ) . It ' s the spy equivalent of a magic trick , and that ' s the spirit of the whole movie . " Ghost Protocol " is fast and explosive , but it ' s also a supremely clever sleight of hand thriller . Brad Bird , the animation wizard ( " The Incredibles , " " The Iron Giant " ) , makes the leap to live action with the kind of skill Paul Greengrass brought to the " Bourne " films , only Bird , showing an animator ' s miraculously precise use of visual space , has a playful , screw tightening ingenuity all his own .
