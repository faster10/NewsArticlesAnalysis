Should David Petraeus have had to resign over an affair ? We ' ve all been reading about legendary CIA director Allen Dulles ' multiple flagrant affairs , so if you turn to history for an answer , no . But adultery matters more now than it did in Dulles ' day , and there ' s more of a social need to rake people over the coals for it . Thus we have to keep developing amnesia about how common adultery is , and about the previous 10 adultery scandals , so that we can be outraged all over again . Society needs its scapegoats , and unfortunately Petraeus offered himself up for the role .
