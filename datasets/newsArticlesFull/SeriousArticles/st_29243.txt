Don ' t expect U . S . ships to stop those of Iran . As State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said , " There are reports about these U . S . ships that have been moved and I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression . They are not there to intercept Iranian ships . The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe . I think there was some misreporting and confusion on this . I just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those Iranian ships . "
