This is a movie of gleaming surfaces veteran DP Roger Deakins turns a glass skyscraper at night into a funhouse hall of mirrors , and a floating Macau casino is like an oasis in the black sea . After all the globetrotting , " Skyfall " brings the action back home to Britain and Deakins finds a different kind of beauty in the crags and lochs of Scotland . Just on a pictorial level , it ' s enticing in a way few CGI spectaculars can match . ( The credit sequence alone is among the most lustrous in the entire 007 canon . )
