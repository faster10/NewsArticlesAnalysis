Over the next few months , I interviewed over a hundred entrepreneurs throughout East Africa who had received 100 to start or grow their microenterprises . I formed powerful connections with many of those entrepreneurs , all of whom were working hard every day to lift themselves and others out of poverty a seamstress in Kenya who used her business profits to send her daughters to school a goat herder in Uganda who could finally afford mosquito nets for his family a farmer in Tanzania who explained proudly how she could now , for the first time , feed her children three meals a day .
