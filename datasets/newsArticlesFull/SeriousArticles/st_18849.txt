Automatic registration is good for the country , and good for New Jersey , said Myrna P rez , deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center . The Democracy Act would have made our registration lists more accurate and up to date , and voting more flexible and convenient . We are extremely disappointed Governor Christie chose to veto a bill with these kinds of proven benefits . Instead of passing laws that make it harder for Americans to vote , lawmakers must work to modernize our voting system for the 21st century .
