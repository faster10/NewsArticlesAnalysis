1 . Buddy Hield may very well be the National Player of the Year favorite after his performance : I mean , the guy entered the night averaging 24 . 7 points and shooting 49 . 2 percent from three for a team that was ranked No . 1 in the country in the Coaches Poll and was undefeated in January . He already was deservedly in the conversation , which is why we had him ranked third in our Player of the Year Power Rankings for a couple weeks now . But after this ? He went into Phog Allen Fieldhouse and torched the Jayhawks for 46 points , eight boards and seven assists on 13 for 23 shooting from the floor and 8 for 15 from beyond the arc on a night where the consensus ( rightfully ) was that Kansas played him well defensively . To put it another way , Brice Johnson had 39 points , 23 boards , three steals and three blocks at Florida State tonight and I d argue that Hield s performance was far more impressive .
