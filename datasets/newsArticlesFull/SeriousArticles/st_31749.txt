The SOTU rebuttal is a famously awful duty because the rebutter is denied the theatrics that make it a worthwhile activity for the president . The rebutter does not get to enjoy an introduction , like a boss , from the House sergeant at arms . She is not met with laudatory applause and handshakes from members of Congress , senators , Cabinet members , and Supreme Court justices . The rebutter does not enjoy mandatory ovations at the end of each line . All the rebutter can do is give a shorter statement in an empty room and pray that she has not come across as hilarious in some way that embarrasses the party that s already out of power . This is not easy , because the rebuttal s viewing audience is comprised almost entirely of members of the press , who are forced to watch the stupid rebuttal as part of their jobs , and members of the press are unusually mean spirited creatures .
