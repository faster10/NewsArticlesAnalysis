I know enough of the history of my country to know that those racist attacks are only the beginning . That governments are ready to sacrifice freedom for the illusion of more security and keeping a tight rein on their Muslim communities . I learned from the attacks on January 2015 against Charlie and the Hypercacher that our governments and politicians are more likely to present populist measures on the headscarf in public or private places , or focus more on school menus with or without pork , than to think about and highlight the deeply embedded structural roots of the phenomenon of radicalisation which are to be found in decades of failure to " integrate " thousands of young people into our nation , or in a decade of foreign policy failures such as the invasion of Libya and the tragedy of Syria .
