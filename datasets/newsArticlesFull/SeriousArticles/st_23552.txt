Remember , a block grant is a fixed amount that by definition is unable to expand in times of need . In many ways , it ' s a fair weather ship that does fine in calm waters but founders in a storm . Welfare ( work based assistance for poor families with kids ) , for example , was block granted in the mid 1990s , and it worked adequately when the economy was humming . But when the recession hit , it failed as a safety net , especially compared with federal programs like food assistance or unemployment insurance that handily expanded to meet the recession induced need .
