Whenever the Super Bowl is played on natural grass , the NFL replaces the field . The practice started after Super Bowl XXVII at the Rose Bowl ( Cowboys 52 , Bills 17 the Leon Lett game ) . Pasadena had been soaked with 16 inches of rain that January nearly four times the average and even with tarping , the NFL had to patch ruined pieces of the field .

There ' s no grow in time . It has to be ready to go .
