As Anne Barnard of the New York Times notes , the troops are most likely to work with the Kurdish led forces currently fighting to reach ISIS s capital , Raqqa , in Eastern Syria . Since Russia began its air campaign to aid Bashar al Assad s forces in western Syria , and the Pentagon s program to train moderate rebels in that conflict proved a dismal failure , the White House has indicated that it is shifting its attention to the east , where Bashar al Assad s regime has little presence and where the Kurds and some allied Arab forces have had more success against ISIS . But U . S . efforts to supply these forces with weapons from the air have already gone awry , possibly leading to today s decision to send in hands on advisers . Given the dispiriting U . S . track record when it comes to training foreign forces , as recently discussed by my colleague Fred Kaplan , some skepticism is warranted .
