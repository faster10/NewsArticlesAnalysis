Today ' s luxury cars have about 50 computers and run more than 100 million lines of software code , more than a large passenger jet . But the wiring in cars is already strained and won ' t transfer data fast enough for advanced safety devices . Delphi will show off a new wiring architecture to handle 1 , 000 times more information , so cars won ' t be obsolete as soon as they leave the dealer . The technology will come to Audi vehicles first this year and handle radar and cameras for automatic emergency braking . But it also can integrate Lidar . Jeff Owens , Delphi chief technical officer , says data travels slowly on car networks now " inadequate for safety and other critical functions . " Literally every nanosecond counts , " he said .
