Wright : Well , if you look at it strictly in terms of basketball , I ' d say no . They can score inside or outside , and defensively , the Spurs are a buzz saw with the starters and the bench players . The Spurs do struggle somewhat from time to time against more athletic perimeter players , especially guards , but I don ' t see it as an issue that will sink them . What folks should pay close attention to is San Antonio ' s injury situation . Popovich has done a good job of managing everyone ' s minutes , and for the most part , the Spurs have been healthy . But remember how poorly Tony Parker performed at the end of last season and in the playoffs due to hamstring issues . And he already has been dealing with minor issues so far this season with his feet and hip soreness . Duncan has been held out some games due to knee soreness and will sit out Monday , and LaMarcus Aldridge has also spent time out of the lineup with ankle and back issues . With San Antonio utilizing such a veteran roster , the team ' s health as the season progresses is probably more of a concern than it would be for younger squads .
