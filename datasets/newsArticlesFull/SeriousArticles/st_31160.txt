DW : I think that is something to be asked of the Obama administration ? about why he waited so long . But we really as a community needed him to have come to a mosque and to been more vocal six years ago . Since the presidency of Mr Obama Islamophobia has increased dramatically in our country , and it would have been better if he came out , if not at his first term if he was scared about not getting reelected , but definitely at the beginning part of his second term . He would have been better if he would have come out , but as I said at the beginning , for me it is better late than never . ? ?
