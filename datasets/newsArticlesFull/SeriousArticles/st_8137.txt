While I wish the world would just " Stop " for there to be an end to innocent lives being killed or maimed by acts of terrorism or extreme conflict , I now realize , after years of deep thought , that all we can Change is ourselves . I hold onto the belief that If each of us , each " One Unknown " made a positive contribution to our own lives , that if we strived to grow to our full potential and truly honour the preciousness of being " here " then when multiplied , the acts of one become many and the acts of many can change the world as we know it .
