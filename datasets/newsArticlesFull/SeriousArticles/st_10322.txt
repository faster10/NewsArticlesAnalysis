BI : There have already been some indications that other media outlets will be targeted after the elections . I think after what happened in the last couple of days , if the AKP do get the majority , if they do get their stint at one party rule , I will have no doubt that they will continue these cleansings , as they call it . As I mentioned before they see it as a justified action . They see it as conspiracy within government to almost have a coup and they have accused Gulen very much of being at the forefront of it even though he is obviously in exile in America .
