The people of the world are coming to understand that there are no spectators on these issues . Citizens are marching , acting online , and burning up phone lines . We understand that what our governments do or don t do is on all of us . That s why the next two weeks , and the outcome of Paris , is a test of all humanity . Will Indians let their government shill for the coal industry ? Will Americans let their government skimp on the price tag for a clean energy transition ? Will Brazilians and Europeans demand that their governments refuse to accept a weak deal ? This is a moment where we show who we are as a people . What happens next , depends on all of us .
