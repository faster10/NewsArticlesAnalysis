Retail still works : Senator Ted Cruz s come from behind win over Donald Trump put another helmet sticker on the Full Grassley . inspired by Senator Charles Grassley s statewide tours . Cruz visited his 99th county on Monday , just hours before caucus sites opened . Unlike Trump , who traveled in his own jet and was rarely seen outside of crowded rallies , Cruz included traditional meet and greets at small town coffee shops and yes , Pizza Ranch restaurants . His pitch in the final days of the campaign asked supporters to reach out to their friends and family and bring them to the caucuses . This is a positive sign for the future of the caucuses , which would be stripped of their essential character if candidates decided they could put the retail campaign out to pasture .
