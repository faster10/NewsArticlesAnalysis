' My brothers weren ' t very good and I wasn ' t great but I just wanted to improve so badly so I practised for days and days . I used to go to fields with my brothers and my dad to practise . I used to go in a squash court with a ball and just kick , kick , kick . My dad was really sad when I quit for athletics because he would have loved me to be a footballer . But he always supported me because both he and my mum wanted me to be happy . So they were very proud at what I went on to achieve . '
