As the only film opening in wide release , James Mangold ' s dark take on the clawed mutant opened strong and walked away with about 21 million on Friday , which includes the 4 million it made in theaters that began showing the movie at 10 p . m . on Thursday night . Also , 3 , 063 out of its 3 , 924 locations are showing the X Men pic in 3 D . The 120 million Hugh Jackman starrer should easily make at least 60 million by the end of the weekend , slightly lower than some estimates including ours which placed it in the 70 million range . The opening is not quite as strong as 2009 s X Men Origins : Wolverine , which had a 34 . 4 million Friday , and did not benefit from 3 D surcharges . Out of all the X Men films , The Wolverine is tracking on the low end of the franchise , sitting between 2000 s X Men which opened at 20 . 8 million on a Friday in mid July , and X Men : First Class which had a 21 . 4 million Friday .
