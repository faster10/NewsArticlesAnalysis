Clark : From what I ' ve heard so far they agree that it feels spot on . What I was trying to do was capture more than the technical and procedural details , because sometimes I had to bend those rules , shorten time frames and things like that . If I have to start talking about the backlog at the crime lab or how long it takes to get a rape kit tested snore ! I need to tighten that up and make it sound like we can get our results as fast as we wish we could . Other than that , I wanted to share the feeling of camaraderie among prosecutors and police officers , the kind of humor they share , their dialogue , the way they ' re always needling each other , messing with each other , that kind of sense of sharing a world together , I wanted to convey that feeling . The people who have read the books who are in the business tell me it feels very real .
