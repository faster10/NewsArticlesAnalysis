A city park that can fit only one person at a time . Mill Ends Park , the world ' s smallest , is a 2 foot circle and , according to legend , houses the only leprechaun colony west of Ireland . It was dedicated on St . Patrick ' s Day 1948 after the light pole for which it was intended never appeared . Instead , newspaper columnist Dick Fagan planted flowers , and Patrick O ' Toole , the colony ' s so called head leprechaun , approved , at various times , such park installations as a swimming pool for butterflies . It even had a diving board and a miniature Ferris wheel .
