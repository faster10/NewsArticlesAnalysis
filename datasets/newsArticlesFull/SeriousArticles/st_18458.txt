Critics like to pretend that it ' s Tebow ' s football style that bothers them . Tebow hasn ' t yet proven to be a natural pocket passer , but in his last start he threw for more than 200 yards with two touchdowns , no interceptions and a passer rating near 150 , and he continues to lead game winning drives almost every week . There is always room for healthy criticism in sports , especially at the quarterback position , but Tebow is subject to something uglier . Sportscasters love to take extra shots at Tebow take Merril Hoge , who at one point tweeted , " It ' s embarrassing to think the Broncos could win with Tebow ! ! "
