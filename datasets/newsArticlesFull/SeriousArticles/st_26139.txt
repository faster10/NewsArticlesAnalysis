The Bush family might have a history of fighting dirty , but this is a different time and Jeb ! is a man running in the wrong era . It s kind of sad watching this campaign flounder through the minefield of presidential politics like a chicken with its head cut off still running around a barnyard . You just keep waiting for the chicken to realize it s dead and finally flop to the ground . It s a harsh assessment , but showing yourself to be a competent bureaucrat with a technocratic approach to government has been out of style in the GOP for quite a long time now .
