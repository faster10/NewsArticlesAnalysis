There are several problems with that argument . First , it was Bush , not Obama , who negotiated the original agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki that promised the full withdrawal of U . S . forces by the end of 2011 . The Obama administration would have had either to renege on a formal agreement , thus displaying contempt for the sovereignty of a democratic Iraq that the United States helped create , or somehow induce the al Maliki government to sign a new agreement allowing American troops to remain .
