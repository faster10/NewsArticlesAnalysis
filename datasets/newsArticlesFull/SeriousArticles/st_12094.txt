There are an estimated 151 million orphans in the world , which UNICEF defines as a child that ' s lost one or more parent . If they were a country , they would together form the 10th largest nation in the world . An estimated 18 million of those have lost both parents a figure which would represent 80 of the population of my home country , Australia . I try to imagine what that visual looks like , if one were to Google Map it and hone in on one face staring back at you , wondering if there is anyone out there that cares about them and their circumstance .
