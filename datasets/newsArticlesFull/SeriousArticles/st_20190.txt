Bayern Munich ' s exalted coach Pep Guardiola was here , settling down to watch his former club pass City off the park in a series of dizzying spells . Possession football is anathema to English football . City spilt their guts here , exposing the size of the task to turn the current champions of the Barclays Premier League into a team capable of living with a group of players who can change the pace of a game at will . Barcelona ' s tempo is soothing and reassuring . If City want to dominate in Europe , in a way that Barcelona did when they won the Champions League in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 , then Pellegrini is not the man . That much is clear .
