This year ' s ballot is the second consecutive set of Oscar nominees that feature no people of color . ? Some have argued there were no minorities worthy of nominations , ? another sign that studios haven ' t green lit enough diverse projects . Yet it ' s hard to argue that not a single person of color deserved a spot when the list looks like this : ? Idris Elba ( " Beasts of No Nation " ) , Samuel L . Jackson ( " The Hateful Eight " ) , Michael B . Jordan ( " Creed " ) , Tessa Thompson ( " Creed " ) , Mya Taylor ( " Tangerine " ) , Benicio Del Toro ( " Sicario " ) , Oscar Isaac ( " Ex Machina " ) and Will Smith ( " Concussion " ) . Each saw significant Oscar buzz throughout awards season , yet came up short when the nominations were announced last week . ? Lee ' s movie , " Chi Raq , " also yielded a worthy performance from Teyonah Parris . ?
