How does India achieve both substantive and political objectives coming out of Paris ? In brief , India needs to argue for a more , not less , effective agreement in Paris . This must strengthen obligations for all and promote equity . The agreement must also operationalise the oft cited principle of common , but differentiated , responsibility that tailors the obligations of countries to their responsibilities and capabilities . There are several components to this strategy . First , India needs to join the gathering consensus that the 2015 agreement will take the form of a legally binding treaty . A treaty signals the highest expression of political will , generates accountability and predictability in implementation , and typically survives national political changes . A treaty , however , does not necessarily imply that each country s carbon cutting pledge will lend them to enforcement this depends on the nature of the commitment ( procedural or substantive , obligation of effort or result ) and the precise language used . Instead , the agreement will commit countries to a process for the future . To address its concerns about safeguarding development options within a legally binding treaty , India can and should negotiate for flexibility , procedural obligations and obligations of effort for itself .
