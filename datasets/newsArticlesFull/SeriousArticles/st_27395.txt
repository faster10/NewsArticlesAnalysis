Gurley lived up to his enormous hype during a fabulous rookie season , finishing third in the league in rushing with 1 , 106 yards and scoring 10 touchdowns despite missing three full games . Gurley played half of his first season less than a year removed from major knee surgery , so he should be even better in 2016 . That ' s a scary thought for opponents after Gurley became the first running back in history to rush for at least 125 yards in each of his first four career starts . Gurley also managed to put up big numbers despite facing opponents geared to stop him due to the team ' s lack of weapons on offense . St . Louis had the league ' s worst passing attack at 175 . 3 yards per game and also ranked last in total yards ( 297 . 6 ) . ?
