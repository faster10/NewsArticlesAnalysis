Due to the parameters set by the film there s no time spent on Jackson s troubled later years or indeed his actual evolution into a global megastar which came with his next album , Thriller . Lee delivers what the title promises , but it feels very much like a film that s been made to coincide with an album reissue . In a period of top quality , inventive music documentaries ( Amy and 20000 Days on Earth , Montage of Heck et al ) this feels like late night BBC4 fare or for those in the US , something Showtime would broadcast ? and indeed the cable channel has bought it and is showing it on Friday 5 February at 9pm ET .
