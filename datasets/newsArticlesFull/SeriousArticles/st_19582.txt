Burfict will miss a critical stage . While the Bengals would prefer Burfict miss the first three games instead of the last three , they still have to be troubled that he will be unavailable for such a critical stage of the season . Just like this past year , Cincinnati will want to come out strong in 2016 and string together a series of early wins to jump out to a commanding lead in the division . True , the Bengals won their first six games without Burfict in 2015 , but this upcoming schedule could have a less favorable start . The full schedule will come out in April , but there is a chance the Bengals could see the Denver Broncos , Steelers ( at home or away ) or New England Patriots ( away ) at the start of the season .
