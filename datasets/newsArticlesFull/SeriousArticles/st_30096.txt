" I grew up on David Letterman , " Meyers , who just recently took over " Late Night , " told his audience . " I was a little too young for ( Johnny ) Carson , I discovered Carson in later years online and watching videos that way . But Letterman for me was a show that you had a cool uncle , or one of your friends had a cool older brother that told you to watch . . . . If it wasn ' t for David Letterman , this show wouldn ' t exist . If it wasn ' t for David Letterman , I wouldn ' t be here . "
