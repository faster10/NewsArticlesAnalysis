Stoking fear is the goal of terrorist organizations , but New York City will not be intimidated . The NYPD is the most capable police force in the country , with a robust counterterrorism operation that was just strengthened with an investment of 500 additional officers . While Times Square and Herald Square appear in the video , the NYPD in conjunction with all of our partners are taking all necessary security precautions in these areas and areas across the City . New Yorkers won ' t live in fear and people should continue to go to work , live their lives , and enjoy the greatest city in the world . ?
