I realize that Jeremy Rosado was a mostly personal emotional choice for J . Lo , but I ain ' t mad at her because I love watching people cry , and because his high notes on Carrie Underwood ' s " I Know You Won ' t " sounded perfect to me even through the tears . If Jeremy is as popular with the other singers as he seems , I think he ' s a good one to have around during these first few weeks . It ' s always better when the cast can be at ease with each other and have you heard Jer Bear gives the BEST hugs ? " Something ' s going through your body right now , " suggested Ryan as Jeremy shook with emotion after his performance . If this was Ryan ' s way of begging for a hug , he should consider being more direct . Just get in there . Nestle , quick !
