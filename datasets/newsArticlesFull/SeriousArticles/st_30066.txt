Maybe we in the journalism business were initially clueless too . How quaint a conversation between this reporter and a Washington Post colleague , at a rally launching the Bush campaign in Miami last June , now seems . We had just received word of a Trump press conference the next day in New York . Could he possibly be declaring for president ? We agreed he probably was , before getting back to what we thought more important , reporting on Bush . He would be unstoppable , Trump a mere distraction .
