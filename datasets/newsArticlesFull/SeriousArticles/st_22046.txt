The Cowboys hung 30 points and 401 yards on the Seahawks in a surprising win at CenturyLink Field last season . My suspicion is that the Seattle defenders haven t forgotten . . . nor will they have as much to worry about today with DeMarco Murray and Tony Romo no longer part of the equation . The Seahawks also have the luxury of rotating their six regulars through the line ? and who knows where Michael Bennett will position himself on a given snap ? probing Dallas front five , which hasn t performed as well in 2015 , for mismatches . Look for them to target RT Doug Free and rookie G La el Collins .
