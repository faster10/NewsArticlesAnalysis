Knowing what happens on video after it happens is totally different than knowing what the cop was thinking and what he will say he was thinking , said Eugene O Donnell , a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former assistant district attorney in New York City . The video obviously could be damning in terms of a criminal case , but the ultimate question is , is there malice towards the kid ? Is it totally unwarranted under any view of the evidence ? The video does not speak for itself .
