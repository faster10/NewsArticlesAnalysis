The XL pipeline extension went from obscure energy project winding its way through the tortuous path of local , state , and federal approvals when it came to the attention of the environmental community which brought it to the forefront of public awareness soon after the BP well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico . Hydrocarbons form the basis of amorphous products that are virtually invisible to the American public . They come out of the ground , go to a refineries or plants , then transported to market and burned without anyone every actually seeing them . The public generally never thinks about hydrocarbons until their water is fouled or prices go up . The collective consciousness of the American public is generally oblivious to the issues of energy , environment , cost or safety , except during some gigantic crisis that hits the mass media . And , after said crisis is removed from television screens , energy issues rapidly fade back into the background and Americans go back to their lives , blissfully ignorant of the risks and costs of living in a hydrocarbon based economy .
