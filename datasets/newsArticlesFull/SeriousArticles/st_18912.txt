On why " Girl Meets World " almost didn ' t happen : When execs at Disney first approached Jacobs with the idea of revisiting Boy Meets World , he promptly nixed the idea . " There ' s a natural reticence to want to try and attempt something that you ' ve been really lucky enough to do once , " explains Jacobs . But after mulling it over , Jacobs decided that he wanted to create a show for the " new generation of kids that live in a much more difficult world . " The only catch ? Jacobs was dead set against doing a sequel , which he felt would amount to nothing more than a reunion show . " A reunion show that ' s one and done , " says Jacobs , who instead suggested centering the pilot on Cory and Topanga ' s daughter , Riley . " But to actually take the children of Cory and Topanga and watch on two levels as they grow up and as Cory and Topanga keep growing up , I can ' t resist that . I can ' t resist that and I ' m very hopeful the audience won ' t resist it either . "
