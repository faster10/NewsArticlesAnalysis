KAHN : Well , that picture of Penn shaking hands with this dapper looking Guzman is on the front page of nearly every paper and website here today . There ' s been quotes in some news outlets that Mexican officials want to talk with both actors about their clandestine meeting and communications with Guzman . NPR actually contacted the U . S . Justice Department spokesman who had no comment about whether anyone else is the subject of a U . S . investigation . But it ' s getting a lot of play here . There ' s been some quite interesting posts on social media , a lot ridiculing of Penn , making doing these twists on words with his name , which could be twisted into a bad word . And there ' s also some that have been ridiculing him for his forays into journalism . In one tweet by journalist Alfredo Corchado really brought it home here . Given the violence that , you know , Mexican reporters face more than 30 have been killed here since 1992 he said to describe Penn ' s meeting as an interview is an epic insult to journalists who have died in the name of truth .
