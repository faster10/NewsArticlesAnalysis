Mr Erdogan will be strengthened by his new mandate to influence events in Syria . He has clearly not suffered in the minds of Turkish voters from his failure to overthrow President Bashar al Assad , an unchanging priority for Ankara . The past three years have also seen the rise of a de facto Syrian Kurdish state in north east Syria controlled by a branch of the PKK . This has an army of some 25 , 000 fighters who act in close cooperation with the US air force , despite being repeatedly denounced by Mr Erdogan and Mr Davutoglu as terrorists . Mr Davutoglu has threatened a Turkish military response if the Syrian Kurds advance west of the Euphrates . ?
