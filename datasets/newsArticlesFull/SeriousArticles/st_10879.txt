One reason why the DEQ didn ' t take the aide seriously is that its own lead tests didn ' t show any problems . But these tests were based on an absurd EPA standard that requires that taps that have been sitting overnight be flushed for five minutes before water samples are collected . Never mind that ' s not what most people do before making their morning cup of coffee , so such samples don ' t accurately reflect the actual quality of water they are consuming . As if this was not bad enough , even after realizing last summer that the DEQ really should be doing phosphorous treatment , the EPA didn ' t go public with its concerns and warn residents for fear of stepping on the toes of local authorities . The regional EPA head , Susan Hedman , who opted to do nothing , resigned yesterday .
