As Brienne and Jaime make their way to King ' s Landing in the finale , the Lannisters are in a state of flux . Does Jaime even still love Cersei , who he dedicated his life to , now that he ' s developed a new relationship based on mutual respect ? " His relationship with Cersei is not a very healthy relationship , because it ' s all on her terms , " Coster Waldau noted . " And for the first time in his life , he ' s been together with another adult who is so unlike the world of King ' s Landing , who says what she means , who does what she says , who walks the walk . He sees something in Brienne that he might have feared or lost in himself . " A sense of honor , perhaps . A sense of dedication . " Losing his hand , he ' s been forced to reconsider everything . " But don ' t expect that relationship to be resolved in the final hour of this season , because as any good season finale will do , Coster Waldau said , " it will provide closure , and it will set up next year . But it will make for a tricky homecoming , that ' s for sure ! "
