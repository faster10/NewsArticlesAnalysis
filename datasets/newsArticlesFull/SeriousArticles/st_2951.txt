Curry didn ' t even take a shot on Golden State ' s first six possessions . His 25 point first quarter took nine minutes , five seconds . In that span , he took 10 shots and missed just one . Three pointers accounted for seven of those makes and eight of those attempts . Somehow , not a single one seemed forced . The Warriors were riding the hot hand , sure , but none of Curry ' s teammates would dare call him selfish . When you can make the sort of shots he does , what would a heat check even look like ?
