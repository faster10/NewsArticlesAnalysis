Kansas City has taken a 2 0 World Series lead over the New York Mets thanks in part to a lineup filled with hitters who can turn around a fastball and keep the strikeouts to a minimum . It all starts at the top . Escobar , 28 , dives in head first without so much as dunking a toe in the water . Zobrist , 34 , packs the sandwiches , picks out a comfortable spot on the beach , crams an umbrella into the sand , slathers on sunscreen and takes his sweet time before wading into the surf one body part at a time .
