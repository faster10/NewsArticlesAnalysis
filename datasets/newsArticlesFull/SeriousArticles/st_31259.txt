Assuming the Cardinal beat USC , they ll before more deserving of a playoff bid that Ohio State , North Carolina and whichever of Clemson or Alabama loses its conference title game in this hypothetical . Stanford would have three quality wins ( Notre Dame , USC twice ) to Ohio State and North Carolina s one ( the Buckeyes win over Michigan , the Tar Heels hypothetical win over Clemson ) , and both of the Cardinal s losses are reasonable , something that definitely can t be said of UNC s defeat to South Carolina . Stanford is already the top ranked two loss team in the playoff rankings , and an extra win and a conference title should put it past Ohio State . The only way the Cardinal wouldn t deserve a playoff spot if Clemson or Alabama loses is if the Tar Heels so thoroughly dominate the Tigers that they pull a 2014 Ohio State and leave the committee with no choice but to include them .
