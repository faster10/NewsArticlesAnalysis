Clemson doesnt have great defensive line depth and has leaned heavily on first string defensive ends Lawson and Kevin Dodd this season . Only a few schools such as Ohio State are now at that level and Clemson , after posting its fifth consecutive double digit win season , continues to seek a breakthrough to the next plateau with a win . Shaq Lawson should be healthy for the championship game , and he will only improve a defense that held Oklahoma to 378 yards ( and only 67 of those yards came on the ground ) .
