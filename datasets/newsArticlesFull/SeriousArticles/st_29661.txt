The rise of Buddhist nationalism , led by groups such as 969 and Ma Ba Tha , could pose a direct challenge to the NLD . Since 2012 , the Buddhist nationalist movement has gained tremendous public support and influence in parliament , as seen in the recent passing of controversial legislation on race and religion . The NLD has remained quiet on the issue due to its sensitivity as well as its broad support among the electorate . Followers of the movement have distributed pamphlets targeting the NLD , saying the party supports Islam and would fail to protect Buddhists . Ma Ba Tha and 969 have also publicly thrown support behind President Thein Sein and the USDP . The USDP has capitalized on this and may garner support among voters who value religion over politics . Ma Ba Tha and 969 ' s core supporters in rural and impoverished regions of Myanmar may be draw votes from an NLD victory .
