For years , I was in denial that I had MS . I thought if I didn ' t focus on my MS , then maybe it would just go away . It took the Nashville flood in May 2010 for me to " wake up " and decide it was time to take responsibility for what is , and what will be , my life with MS . My Mom , my sister and I lost our home and almost everything we owned in the flood . When we were rescued by boat , we were given another chance at life . I realized then that things can be replaced , but life and good health are invaluable .
