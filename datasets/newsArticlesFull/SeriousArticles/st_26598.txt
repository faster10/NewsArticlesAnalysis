Everybody in all walks of life know people who are out of work presently or are about to be out of work . And the same is true for artists . I know so many artists for example visual artists , the gallery has closed or it ' s cut back . Theaters that are no longer going to do productions with more than five actors . And so on . So I know a lot of people out of work : costume designers , makeup people . And let ' s not forget all the ancillary jobs from having an arts organization in your neighborhood . That includes restaurants , taxicabs , whatever .
