Veteran publicist and Academy member Bruce Feldman expressed outrage that the organisation would move to change the rules without consulting its own membership . I think they have an obligation to represent us and not to act unilaterally , he said . As a long standing member , I find these actions very , very discouraging . While I understand that changes are necessary , it s disappointing that the Governors never communicated what they were considering with members and never asked for feedback before they made a decision . I would like to point out that we elect members to represent us and they have very simply failed to do so .
