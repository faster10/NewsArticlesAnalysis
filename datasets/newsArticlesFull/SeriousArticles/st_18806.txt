Obviously , there will be unforeseen challenges in such a huge endeavor . But they shouldn ' t deter us from the attempt . If we never put our collective efforts together to do this , the human race will never fulfill its dream of living on another planet . We owe it to future generations , who will be left with the problems of Earth , to try to find new homes throughout the solar system . As long as there are volunteers like me willing to make the sacrifice , we will find ways to survive in space and beyond .
