Christie used almost the entire debate to focus on Clinton , sounding like a general election candidate . But it was in his closing statement that he really zeroed in . " I saw the most disgraceful thing I ' ve seen this entire campaign a few weeks ago , " he started . " Hillary Clinton was asked , the enemy she is most proud of and she said Republicans . " Christie was in the undercard debate for the first time , but it was clear he doesn ' t intend to go home . " In a world where we have Al Qaeda and ISIS , the mullahs in Iran and Vladimir Putin , the woman who asks to run and represent all of United States says that her greatest enemies are people like you in this audience and us here , " he said . Of the 18 times Clinton was mentioned in the debate , 13 of them came from Chris Christie , according to an ABC analysis .
