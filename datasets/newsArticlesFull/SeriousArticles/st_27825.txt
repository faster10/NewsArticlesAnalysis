That is looking at politics today as a zero sum approach . And what I am trying to do in this country is to say , You know what , in the last election , 63 percent of the American people didn t vote . 80 percent of young people didn t vote in the midterm election emphasis mine . That is why the rich get richer . And that is why billionaires are able to buy elections . What we are trying to say is that in an American democracy , maybe it s a radical idea , but Congress should represent the working families and the middle class rather than just wealthy campaign contributors . So Chuck , what I am trying to do now is change the dynamics of American politics . Bring millions of young people , working class people , in to stand up and fight for their rights M reaction is that if Donald Trump and Mr Bloomberg gets in , you re going to have two multi billionaires running for president of the United States against me . And I think the American people do not want to see our nation move toward an oligarchy where billionaires control the political process . I think we ll win that election .
