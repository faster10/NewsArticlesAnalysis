Green Bay Packers : ? We don ' t know yet who will be playing the all important left tackle spot for the Packers on Sunday , but at least we know who won ' t be : Josh Sitton . Coach Mike McCarthy moved his Pro Bowl guard there for last week ' s game against the Vikings , and it didn ' t work . Sitton will go back to left guard this week . Perhaps regular starter David Bakhtiari will return after missing the past two games because of a sprained ankle , but McCarthy said it will take all week to determine whether Bakhtiari is ready to return . ?
