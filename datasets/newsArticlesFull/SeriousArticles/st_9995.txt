" ( The locals ) showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone . He had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull . He was past his breeding years and very close to death , " she said . " They asked me if I would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival . . . . I chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and I do not regret it for one second . ( The locals ) did not waste a single part of him . I am grateful to be a part of something so good . "
