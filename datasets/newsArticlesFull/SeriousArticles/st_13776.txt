Brooklyn , New York ( VBS . TV ) Back in the mid zeroes , I remember reading a lot of stories about a buildup of trash in the Pacific Ocean so massive that it had formed a floating island of waste the size of Texas . Its colorful nickname was the Great Eastern Garbage Patch , and what was even more mind boggling than the purported scale was that pretty much the only places you could dig up any substantial info about it were in minor oceanographic and environmental publications . You also couldn ' t find a photo of it to save your life . It was like Garbage Brigadoon .
