Former special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis came under fire last season for lousy performances . The Bears racked up a lot of penalties on special teams and there were breakdowns on a regular basis . But they allowed only one return touchdown and one in 2013 under DeCamillis . Under the watch of special teams coordinator Dave Toub from 2004 to 2012 , the Bears surrendered a total of three return touchdowns . You have to go back to 1997 for the last time the team allowed two return scores in one year and 1996 for the last time there were three . The Bears have allowed 18 return touchdowns on special teams since 1990 and five have come since 2013 . ?
