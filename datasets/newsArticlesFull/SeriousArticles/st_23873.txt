What a brilliant line up of speakers and discussion . And how honoured and lucky we are to have the legendary Prof Robert Gifford on the programme , all the way from Canada thanks to all the technology we have available these days . " Psychological Dragons " explain so much about why we have made such little progress on the challenge of cooling down the planet . ABC RN you continue to amaze me ! Just on the question of how developing countries can power themselves too : as per Science Show and many other RN segments , the answer is clearly solar at micro ( Solar Lanterns replacing kerosene lamps in Africa because they are cheaper pay for themselves in one year and healthier for people living in their hut and shanties ) and macro level . On the latter , with all the advances in solar and wind power these days , plus advances in battery technology , when combined with improving energy efficiency of our buildings and production , it ' s actually really easy to cool down the planet . It ' s just that there are too many vested interests in coal and oil and too few politicians who understand all the job growth and cleaner air , there for the taking by switching to solar wind . . . . and stop building too close to the sea .
