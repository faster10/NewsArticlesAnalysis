Estefan : I ' ll tell you what I love : I ' m a musician first and foremost . Music has been a really big and healing part of my life . I studied psychology so I tend to analyze a lot of things . But if you go back to WWII , you had musicals and happy things and escapist things because that ' s what entertainment does it takes you away . You couldn ' t have done this before because we were all too cheeky back in the ' 80s and ' 90s and would have snubbed our noses at something so whimsical . Now , people need it ! It ' s fun . Great music . My favorite so far was " One Less Bell to Answer House is Not a Home . "
