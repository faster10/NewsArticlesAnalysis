A no fly zone is a vaguely liberal way of calling for the air invasion of another country . It s a position , though embraced by Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio , both Sanders and Obama have dismissed out of hand for being irresponsible and unrealistic . Even here Clinton attempts to weasel out of this neocon stance by insisting , as she did to ABC moderator Martha Raddatz in December s democratic debate , that implementing a no fly zone in Syria would not require shooting down Russian planes because Russia would join us . This , to anyone who has a cursory understanding of the Syrian conflict , is absurd . Why would Russia betray its ally of 44 years and become a US client state on a dime ? They wouldn t , which perhaps explains why Clinton dropped the no fly zone rhetoric altogether in the subsequent debate on Sunday night .
