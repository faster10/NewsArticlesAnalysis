All of which makes Jeb Bush s behavior in the days before the Colorado debate seem myopic and self destructive . Americans may not like angry candidates , but they are utterly allergic to whiners . If there are a lot of really cool things Bush can do instead of running for President , perhaps he should go do them . That would be a shame . Bush has emerged as the candidate for the opposite of those who are low information voters ? perhaps we could call them too much information voters . He has laid out some heavy duty policy proposals , some with real merit , but none with the zing of a bumper sticker . He seems a thoughtful guy , but without fists or elbows . With Bush and Trump on the wane , Marco Rubio seems poised to be the flavor of the next month .
