RD : A guy like Coppola , you know , as a director , he wants to see what you bring , without dictating . He ' s not a dictator . He has a definite vision , but he ' s not going to get in there and say it has to be my way or the highway . He really wants to see what you bring . He ' ll say , ' Come on guys quit fooling around we gotta make a movie ! ' You branch off into laughing and making jokes , but that ' s good for the set and he knows that too . It ' s his own gift and it ' s his own way of working .
