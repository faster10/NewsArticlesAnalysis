Ms . Clinton was pointed in her critiques of Mr Sanders but relatively restrained in tone and words as she sought to raise doubts about what many liberals see as Mr Sanders greatest virtues : his integrity and consistency on policy issues . She chose not to accuse him of flip flopping on gun control bills as she had earlier on Sunday , but rather said at the debate that she was pleased he had reversed himself . For Ms . Clinton , it was enough to note Mr Sanders changes in policy : by doing so , she raised doubts about his consistency , but stopped short of eviscerating his positions and potentially alienating a restless liberal base that largely favours Mr Sanders .
