Considering that the Vikings are going up against the Seattle Seahawks and Legion of Boom this weekend , it s tough to imagine that this is the week things get fixed for Teddy and his crew .

The Steelers haven t gone more than five years between playoff wins since Richard Nixon was president . They have been in a lot of shootouts this year so that is a risky scenario against Aaron Rodgers , but they are flying high on confidence right now and anyone that wants to bet against them now is just asking for it . He s just not quite there yet .
