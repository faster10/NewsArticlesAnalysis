" Across the country no fewer than 3 . 2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37 , 000 high schools , " McCullough said . " That ' s 37 , 000 valedictorians . . . 37 , 000 class presidents . . . 92 , 000 harmonizing altos . . . 340 , 000 swaggering jocks . . . 2 , 185 , 967 pairs of Uggs . But why limit ourselves to high school ? After all , you ' re leaving it . So think about this : Even if you ' re one in a million , on a planet of 6 . 8 billion that means there are nearly 7 , 000 people just like you . "
