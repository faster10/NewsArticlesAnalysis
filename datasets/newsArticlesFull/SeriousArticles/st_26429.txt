Pitt : This is a good friend of mine , the writer and director , Andrew Dominik , he ' s from Australia , and his view of America was very interesting to me . His feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance . This is what he was trying to tell with this story . He finds this book about a crime syndicate , and he makes these comparisons to not politics , per se , or not just politics , but . . . the financial crisis itself , and it was a good subject matter .
