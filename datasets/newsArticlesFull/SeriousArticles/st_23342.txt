In more recent years , stars have taken big money from dictators in exchange for private concert performances , including Seal and Hilary Swank appearing at Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov ' s multimillion dollar 35th birthday bash ( Swank later apologized ) , Nelly Furtado performing for Moammar Gadhafi ( she later gave the money back ) and Mariah Carey , Usher and Beyonce performing for Gadhafi ' s sons in St . Barts . ( My colleagues at The Daily Beast put together a useful gallery of these and other " stars who hang with dictators . " )
