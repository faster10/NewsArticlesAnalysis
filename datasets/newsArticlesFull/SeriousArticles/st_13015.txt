Dreamworks 145 million 3 D sequel " Madagascar 3 : Europe ' s Most Wanted , " which features the voice work of Ben Stiller , Chris Rock , Jada Pinkett Smith , and David Schwimmer as lost Central Park Zoo animals , handily won the weekend with 60 . 4 million , 45 percent of which came from 3 D ticket sales . That ' s a touch behind 2008 s " Madagascar : Escape 2 Africa , " which started with 63 . 1 million , despite the fact that " Madagascar 3 " earned more on its opening day than " Escape 2 Africa " ( 20 . 5 million vs . 17 . 5 million ) . It looks like this threequel may suffer from a slight case of sequelitis , when franchise films become increasingly front loaded at the box office as the franchise continues .
