I read a lot of science fiction , but I also mixed it up with a lot of other genres : crime , literary fiction , as well as nonfiction . Author wise , I ' m a fan of Stephen King , Lauren Beukes , Robert McCammon , Raymond Chandler , Greg Rucka , Ed Brubaker and Gail Simone , among many others . Comics are a hugely important part of my life , particularly crime and mystery comics ( including Criminal , Stumptown , High Crimes ) and superhero comics ( both the Marvel and DC varieties ) . I have to say I prefer television to film . We ' re in a bit of a golden age of genre television , I think , with the likes of " Person of Interest , " " The Walking Dead , " " Game of Thrones " and many others . Not to mention an age of great TV writing , period ! Just look at " Justified , " " Longmire , " " Boardwalk Empire , " " House of Cards . " The old writer ' s advice to throw your TV out the window is looking more and more outdated .
