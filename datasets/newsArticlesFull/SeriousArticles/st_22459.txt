This is what s great about Thomas Sowell . Most writers would be satisfied with just the Hitler reference . They d drop Adolf in there , maybe go BOOOOSH ! with a co worker and , you know , bump fists and blow it up , but this man is committed . There is no contemptibly implausible nightmare scenario that Thomas Sowell can t shoehorn into any topic next to another contemptibly implausible nightmare scenario . After all , a world where Barack Obama is basically Hitler is just as plausible a world in which a nation with no nuclear weapons could become an existential threat to a nation of about 320m people virtually overnight .
