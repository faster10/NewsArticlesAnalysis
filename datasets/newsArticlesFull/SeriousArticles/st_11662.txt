In the U . S . , mental health treatment is largely delivered by specialists who are not integrated into primary care clinics . It is reimbursed separately , often with restrictions on the number of visits and at a high cost to patients . The best I can do with a depressed patient who is not responding to initial treatment is to say , " I can give you a referral , but you need to check with your insurance company to see if it will pay for this . " Often the patients do not follow through either because the wait time to see a mental health provider is too long , they cannot afford the treatment , or they are simply too depressed to act on the referral .
