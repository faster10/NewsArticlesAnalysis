For instance , in 2004 , the Rev . Al Sharpton ran for president of the United States . Now , we know he ' s black , but a ton of black folks didn ' t even think of supporting him during his run or send him a dime . I recall betting a black New York media executive a big steak dinner that Sharpton would not win the primary in South Carolina , where nearly half of the voters are black . He was adamant it would happen , citing the Rev . Jesse Jackson ' s win there in 1988 . Sharpton didn ' t win .
