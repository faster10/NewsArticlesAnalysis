Unfortunately , the field is still led by xenophobic demagogues and flat out morons with no experience in government . Which is what the primary voters seem to want in a candidate this cycle . And isn t Donald Trump , in his own way , promising to fix things that are broken ? Our immigration system is broken , so he ll build a wall ! Healthcare is broken , so he ll replace Obamacare with something terrific ! Ask what he has ever accomplished and he ll point to one of his buildings and brag about the great deals he made with local politicians and zoning boards to put it up . What s Jeb ! Bush going to point to , some esoteric change to the Florida tax code he pushed through the legislature in 2003 ?
