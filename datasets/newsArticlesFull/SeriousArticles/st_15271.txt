Let ' s be clear here : climate change is a clear and present danger . Deniers are anti science idiots who use the issue to whip up their own political bases . However , though , the XL pipeline became the sin eater in this global debate . Approving or rejecting the pipeline , contrary to hyperbolic howling , is certainly not " lighting the fuse on the carbon bomb " as asserted by some . It ' s an infrastructure project that would have more safely provided additional energy security to the US , which is not insignificant . Climate change is a global issue to be handled through international comprehensive energy policy , not killing projects through politics and hysteria . XL was a casualty in the climate wars for all the wrong reasons , and killing this project just delays the serious discussion of how we handle our energy needs while protecting the environment .
