Suddenly , women like Marlo Thomas ( from " That Girl " ) , independent with careers , were on the scene . There was Agent 99 from " Get Smart " and Emma Peel from " The Avengers " not just career women , but spies . Who kicked ass ! There was Samantha in " Bewitched , " who had immense powers just like Jeannie , about whom I indeed dreamed . And most ground breaking of all , there was " Julia , " which featured a leading African American character who was a single mother . Nick at Night introduced me to the 1960s Technicolor menu of gender roles and role models unheralded in the narrow black and white confines of the 1950s . I could watch TV and see women with personalities and problems and potential . I was hooked .
