But this isn t about which team is better between the Cavs and the Warriors . At least for now , the answer is quite clear that Golden State which has beaten Cleveland five games straight and has a 38 4 record compared to the Cavs 28 11 mark holds the edge and then some . Sure , the Cavs won t always be 34 points worse than the Warriors when they play as evidenced by Cleveland ' s much better effort at Oracle Arena on Christmas Day but comparing them to the league s elite at this point is an exercise in futility .
