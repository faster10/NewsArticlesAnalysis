The more satisfying , and more damning , explanation is that Trump is reckless . He escalated this fight with Fox News because he wants to make a big show of how nobody ? Roger Ailes , Reince Priebus , Jeb Bush , whoever ? can push him around . He knows he has some leverage ( Trump is a reliable ratings draw ) and he wants Fox News to back down . He wants Rupert Murdoch to call him up and politely ask to reconsider his decision to skip . But an action this brash carries with it the potential for serious political damage .
