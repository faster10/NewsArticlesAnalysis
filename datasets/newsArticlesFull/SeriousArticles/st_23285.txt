People everywhere are in uproar . Online I keep reading about people who , for some reason , consider this to be hugely offensive and rude . An entire religion of 1 . 6 BILLION blamed for the actions of a fringe , extreme two or three people ? Another baseless generalization of an entire group of people as terrorists and threats ( but not white Christians , no matter who they shoot up for whatever purpose ) ? Muslims are tired . They are frustrated . They are sick of having to constantly defend their right to be American when no other group of people is asked to do so .
