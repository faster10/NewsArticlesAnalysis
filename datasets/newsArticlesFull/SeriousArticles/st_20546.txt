In the old cowboy shows you had the marshall and his deputies in charge and they were the arbiter of all conflicts . But then , somewhere in the plot , they would start abusing their power , claiming it was what was best for the town until creeping authoritarianism was strangling free thought . It would take an outside person , who hated bullies and wanted justice , to come in and save the day . There would be a stand off either in the saloon or on the street and the whole town was rooting for the new guy because they knew status quo had to go .
