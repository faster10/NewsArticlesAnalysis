The parade ? not officially a second line parade as it wasn t thrown by a social aid and pleasure club ? was put together at the last minute by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Arcade Fire s new ish New Orleans residents Win Butler and R gine Chassagne . It was a testament to the lasting influence of Bowie , at the very least visually . Pink and blue lightning bolts decorated faces everywhere , or gold circles painted dead center on foreheads . Men in space suits , women in Bowie drag , mod suits , shag wigs . Drag , drag , drag everywhere , but then again Bowie was the drag queen and king .
