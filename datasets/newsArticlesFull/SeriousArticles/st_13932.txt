MINNEAPOLIS ST . PAUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT , Minneapolis , Minnesota : Another interactive touch screen concept has just recently been introduced in Minneapolis , but instead of ice cream , it dishes out movies . At 11 Digiboo kiosks , travelers can download , via flash drive , digital versions of more than 500 movies ( from classics to new releases ) , that they can then watch on their laptop or tablet while in flight or just hanging around the terminal . The flicks can be either rented or purchased , and since the service is digital , new releases are always in stock and there ' s nothing to return . In addition to Minneapolis , there are kiosks at the airports in Portland , Oregon and Seattle , Washington . www . mspairport . com
