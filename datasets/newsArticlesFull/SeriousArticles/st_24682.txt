Michigan State is a respectable run defense at 118 . 2 yards allowed per game and held Ohio State to just 86 yards , but Iowa has seen better run defenses in Wisconsin , Nebraska and Northwestern over the course of conference play . Iowa rushed for substantially more than each those run defenses averaged throughout the season . There s reason to think the Hawkeyes will be able to establish their run game and set things up for quarterback C . J . Beathard against a Spartan secondary that has been suspect at times this season . Jordan Canzeri leads the way with 964 rushing yards , good for No . 5 in the conference .
