A white actor in Hollywood seemingly has a responsibility to speak out in support of their colleagues : take Bradley Cooper standing up for Jennifer Lawrence s right to equal pay , for instance .

They are duty bound on behalf of their children to work for change in an industry that overlooks , justifies and perpetuates the notion that whiteness and white talent , however extraordinary or mediocre , is more worthy of celebration .
