Walt wants them to " make it right , " but of course , he knows he can ' t trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone , so he brought backup two " hitmen " who shine sniper style red lights on the Schwartzes to lend credibility to Walt ' s threat that if for any reason his children don ' t receive the money , " a kind of countdown begins , " in which they would be killed . It ' s a bluff , but they don ' t know that , so it ' s a win win . Walt ' s children will get the money in a semi legal fashion , and no one will actually die in the process .
