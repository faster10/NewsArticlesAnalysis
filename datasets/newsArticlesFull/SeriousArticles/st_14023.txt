Andy Murray has been the driving force behind Britain s run to this weekend s Davis Cup final and it was the 28 year old Scot who kept his team on course here on Friday for their first victory in the competition for 79 years . After Kyle Edmund had agonisingly let slip a two set lead in losing 3 6 , 1 6 , 6 2 , 6 1 , 6 0 to David Goffin in the opening rubber , Murray steadied the ship by beating Ruben Bemelmans 6 3 , 6 2 , 7 5 in a feisty encounter to leave the final against Belgium perfectly balanced after the first day .
