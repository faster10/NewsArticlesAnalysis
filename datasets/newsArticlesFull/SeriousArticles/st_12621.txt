When some of us hear Jeb Bush s new slogan , Jeb can fix it , we don t think of a mechanic getting under the hood and fixing the nation s problems . We don t even think of Jimmy Savile , the notorious British pedophile , whose show was called Jim ll fix it , although some people sure will . No , we think about Election 2000 and the Florida recount , where Jeb proved that his slogan isn t all hot air . Whatever else he did as Governor of Florida , when it came to that election , ? Jeb fixed it .
