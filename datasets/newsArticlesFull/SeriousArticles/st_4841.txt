Colbert s TED Talk parody sends up the self seriousness and background condescension of the popular educational series . The talks Colbert supposedly found in TED s rejected pile are pointless , long winded , and delivered by goofy characters , like a wrestler overexplaining the transformation of a simple , everyday cage into a decadent palace of suffering or a kid ? describing ? what he did over his summer vacation . The jokes thus far have been a little hokey , and , like their inspiration , rely on drawing out an idea for several beats too long . ( Was anyone really clamoring for a how can you have any pudding if you don t eat your meat Pink Floyd joke in 2015 ? ) But the premise is solid and flexible enough that it s worth seeing how this one shakes out .
