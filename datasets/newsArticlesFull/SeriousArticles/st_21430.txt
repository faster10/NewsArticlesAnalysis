After it was revealed Thursday that Malcolm Jenkins had played the second half of Sunday night ' s game against the Cowboys with a concussion , the narrative was that the Eagles safety had been irresponsible and placed his health in serious jeopardy . Jenkins apparently received an earful from team doctors , his coaches , his mother , and his wife , and they were all justified pleas for him to be smarter if there is ever a next time . On the other hand , Jenkins did the wrong thing for the right reasons . He kept playing because he knew he was in an important game the Eagles could not afford to lose and he did not want to let his team or teammates down . That mind set needs to change , but it can still be admired , too . It ' s called courage .
