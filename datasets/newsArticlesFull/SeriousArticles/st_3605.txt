I will jump ahead here and suggest that you don t get to ask that leading question about Islam and democracy , which has been the subject of considerable scholarly debate , without asking a number of corollary questions . What do we mean by Islam , and what do we mean by democracy ? Is democracy , as we currently understand it and experience it , actually compatible with the idea of democracy as it was handed down from antiquity and reconceived by the Enlightenment ? But it does no good for people on the left who claim to stand for democracy , and for its associated values of human rights and civil liberties , to pretend that the questions about Islam and democracy do not exist or do not matter , or that they have been settled . The killings in the 11th arrondissement , and the reaction throughout the West , should be enough to tell us that isn t so .
