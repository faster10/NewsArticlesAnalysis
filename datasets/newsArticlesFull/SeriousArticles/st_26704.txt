It was ? I don ' t know . I feel like I was very much 19 on that . And then the experience of my relationship when I wrote 21 , it felt like a coming of age record ? but I feel like you always think that when you turn 21 . All my friends felt like they were coming of age when they were 21 , but nothing really happens other than you ' re legal to do a few more things . Now I have a kid , and I ' m someone ' s mum forever . So I feel like this album really is my coming of age album . I ' m sure I ' ll say that every album , but right now that ' s how I feel .
