Right from its introduction , the 108 ambulance is doing a commendable service . Of late , it functions as a mobile clinic with a physician and a paramedical staff visiting various locations . In this context , I would like to appeal to the authorities concerned to include one more service . There are several bedridden senior citizens undergoing palliative care in houses where they are familiar with their surroundings and comfortable in their home environment . Their needs are many , like blood and urine tests , with sample pickup from home . Portable ECG , nursing assistance for wound inspection and care , dressing , bedsore dressing , diabetic footcare , injections , nebulisation , catheterisation , bladder wash and enema and service of physiotherapists are required for them .
