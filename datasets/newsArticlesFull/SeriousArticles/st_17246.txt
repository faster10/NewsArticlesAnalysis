I m sure it s a demographic question , says the writer . I remember how I used to say about the Emmys that you really felt like most of the voters were people who rooted for the Munsters in the 60s . I don t know what the turnover has been at the Oscars to recognize that kind of work . I loved that movie . I think it was startlingly well done . You watch it and go , Oh my God , ? they completely nailed it . It s so hard to do . It s very difficult to do music biopics . I m fascinated by that . They found a way to talk about the music , talk about the culture , the politics , and the emotional conflicts to the band , the business . It s a much more difficult movie than people understand . I am never surprised about the nominations being ridiculous , because it s always silly . I don t look at it as a fair judgment on anybody s work , so I don t actually care . I know most of those people don t see half of the movies . I haven t seen every single movie being discussed . Who has that kind of time ? Especially when you gotta watch Making a Murderer .
