To a person who steadfastly refuses to apply the barest minimum of critical thinking , How come no one is talking about bomb control ? probably sounds like a compelling counterargument to liberals who advocate gun control . But then those neurons start firing and you realize that , wait a minute no one is talking about bomb control because we already have bomb control . Explosives are regulated and controlled . Anything that could be reasonably considered a bomb is obviously illegal , which is why anyone who wants to bomb something has to build their own and risk several years in prison merely for possessing it . It is much ? more difficult and dangerous to obtain a working bomb in this country than it is a working firearm .
