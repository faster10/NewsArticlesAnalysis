When asked to name the one person they would most like to see win the election , about one in three respondents chose Trump . The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 . 6 percentage points . In addition , 63 percent of respondents said they favor Wisconsin s concealed carry law , although just 31 percent favored a plan being circulated at the state Capitol that would let people carry concealed guns on school grounds . If the current favorite , Trump , were to fade , it appears majorities of GOP voters would be willing to back Cruz or Carson , perhaps especially if Clinton turned out to be the Democratic nominee .
