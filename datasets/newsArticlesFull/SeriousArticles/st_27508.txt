Any of the three might be fine coaches . But it ' s odd that all have strong ties to coaches they pushed out : Pederson is an Andy Reid protege ( and Reid has reportedly given a strong recommendation ) , Shurmur coached the last three years with Kelly , and Staley played for Reid and coached for Kelly . That doesn ' t mean any of the three wouldn ' t succeed , it would just be strange to sell the Eagles fans on hiring someone so close to one of your last two coaches . A poll on Bleeding Green Nation said 84 percent of Eagles fans say they don ' t want Pederson as their next coach .
