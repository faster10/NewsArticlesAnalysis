Less than a year later , another Perry class frigate , the USS Samuel B . Roberts , was struck by an Iranian mine , wounding 10 of its crew , blowing a 15 foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate ' s keel , damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom . The crew of the Roberts , however , was able to save the vessel , in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship ' s superstructure together . The Roberts was then loaded onto another ship , the Mighty Servant 2 , in Dubai and transported back to the U . S . , ship on ship .
