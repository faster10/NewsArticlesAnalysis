I ' d just like to say that while its great that climate change is being discussed about so much over the last few years but I really feel that despite all these talks meetings and targets , at grass roots level there still seems that same inertia as always . There is no hydrogen fuel at the bowser , or fast charge electric option . I am not encouraged to purchase a hydrogen or electric car that matches my families needs so fossil fuels remain the only option . Oil companies still retain so much control .
