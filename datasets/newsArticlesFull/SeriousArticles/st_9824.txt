CLINTON : I have for many years now , about 30 years , supported the idea of charter schools , but not as a substitute for the public schools , but as a supplement for the public schools . And what I have worked on through my work with the Children s Defense Fund and my work on education in Arkansas and through my time as first lady and senator ? is to continue to say charter schools can have a purpose , but you know there are good charter schools and there are bad charter schools , just like there are good public schools and bad public schools .
