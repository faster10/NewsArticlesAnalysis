Greening said : We have got a choice . Is the focus of our interest going to be a political discussion in Europe about how we deal with people when they are here , or will we recognise that we have to do a better job for them in the first place in the region ? In the absence of an end to the civil war , it is the only way to solve this problem . That s not just the right thing to do , because that is what most of the refugees want , but it is value for money . A pound or euro goes so much further in Jordan than if we are spending it here processing refugees in Europe .
