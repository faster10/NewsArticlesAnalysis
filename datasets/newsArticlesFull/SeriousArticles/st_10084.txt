Remember Andrew Evans ? He was the bloke who had a birdie putt to take Peter Senior to a play off in the Australian Masters last week only to finish as joint runner up after signing for a bogey . Unfortunately , you won ' t find him on the fairways of The Australian this week after he couldn ' t force his way into the field via qualifying on Monday . But it hasn ' t stopped an online petition circulating to garner support for his inclusion after the " Cinderella story of the decade in Australian golf " . " How can someone who came second in a tournament not be given a start for this or next week ? ? Give the battler a go , " reads the petition , started on change . org . ? " Come on Australian golf , support your own who have served their time . " Evans ' exemption into the major Australian features won ' t begin until next year .
