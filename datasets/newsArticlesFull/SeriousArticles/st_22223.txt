Under that bill ' s proposed rules , the League of Women Voters of Michigan , which has conducted voter registration drives for decades , would need to attend mandatory , state approved training sessions . But the law did not say how widely those trainings would be available . The law also would have required volunteers to sign an intimidating form threatening them with criminal prosecution for vaguely defined offenses . ( In May , U . S . District Judge Robert Hinkle stopped a similar requirement in a Florida law , saying this can have " no purpose other than to discourage voluntary participation in legitimate , indeed constitutionally protected , activities . " )
