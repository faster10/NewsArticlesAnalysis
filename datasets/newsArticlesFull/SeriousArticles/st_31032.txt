Nepal s evolution as a modern nation state , even during the 44 years as a Hindu kingdom till May 2006 , never witnessed an incident like the Dadri killing , or the Kalburgi murder , or Sudheendra Kulkarni being thrown ink on the face . The secularists with a fundamentalist mindset didn t appreciate this legacy , nor did they show any concern about retaining this secular character of Nepali society . They didn t anticipate that communal and other forms of emotions could come into play during the switch to secularism . Thus , without a debate , they declared Nepal a secular country .
