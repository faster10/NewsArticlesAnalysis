Though I was raised secular a rarity in my community I ' ve had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist . However , my journey is far from tragic . In founding my organization , Black Nonbelievers , in 2011 , I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself , or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind . And they have done so bravely , defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion .
