Yeah . Very . But I have the same morals that I ' ve always had , and his dad is a really wonderful man . You know , we believe that our children should have opinions , and that they should have a choice , so we ' re kind of instilling that now . He will always know why he gets to live such a wonderful life , ' cause I don ' t want him thinking that it just happens . And he will always know about my upbringing and the struggles that my mum had and that my aunties had . I have struggles too , which are very different to the struggles that my family had , but I don ' t want him to only know my struggles . In terms of the most things that people worry about ? which is being able to support themselves ? I don ' t want him thinking that comes for free .
