The 2000 election is one that George W . Bush should have lost and it was only because he had certain post voting day advantages in his favor that allowed him to massage the results enough to get declared President : The state with disputed votes was run by his brother , the Supreme Court was dominated by Republicans , and angry mobs of conservatives were able to prevent election officials in Florida from completing proper recounts . Those advantages have only grown since then . Most swing states have Republican leadership . The Supreme Court is still dominated by conservatives . ? Voting irregularities that hurt Democrats are preordained , due to Republican legislation ? that suppresses votes . And angry conservative mobs are a lot easier to form these days , especially with the internet , than they were in 2000 . If it s close , the Republican ? has all the advantages .
