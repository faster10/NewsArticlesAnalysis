That means Trump could earn solid victories in the upcoming Iowa caucuses , as well as the New Hampshire Primary eight days later , but still fail in capturing most of the delegates . Imagine that Trump wins 35 of Iowa caucus participants , with the rest of the field ? Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio , Chris Christie , Ben Carson , Jeb Bush , John Kasich , Rand Paul , Mike Huckabee , et ? al ? each below 20 and splitting the remainder of the vote . If that happened , Trump could win , but end up with only 10 of the Hawkeye State s 30 delegates .
