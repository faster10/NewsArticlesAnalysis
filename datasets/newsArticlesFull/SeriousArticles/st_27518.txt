The fact that the only nomination for Creed went to Sylvester Stallone is just about comprehensible : in the film , Stallone reprises his career defining role as Rocky Balboa , and voters love a good comeback . Choosing to honour Straight Outta Compton s four white screenwriters rather than its black cast and black director , F . Gary Gray , seems borderline pathological ? and while it s no one group of voters fault ( the writers branch of the Academy chooses the screenplay nominations , the actors branch chooses the actors , and so on ) , the bigger picture it paints doesn t look good .
