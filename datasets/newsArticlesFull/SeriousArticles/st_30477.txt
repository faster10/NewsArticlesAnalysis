Shoot to edit : Regardless of your deadline , you want to shoot video and stills , or gather audio , of exactly what you need for your story . You do this so that when its time to edit , you will spend less time looking for what you need . When you have more time to work on a story , shoot multiple takes of the same subject for editing variety and for a more creative and narrative approach to the story . The basics for your story should include the subject , and any other elements that help explain the story , externals of a building , streets , the scene of an accident , etc .
