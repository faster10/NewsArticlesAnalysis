Before the protests of the 1970s Thanksgiving was a holiday that was really a continuation of special days that were a part of the culture and traditions of many Indian people . For example , the Lakota had celebrations called " giveaways " in which an individual or family gave away gifts to members of the tribe and in some cases the gifts were to give thanks for an occasion or event that was special to the individual or family . So accepting a national holiday like Thanksgiving Day was really an incorporation of an ancient traditional celebration . The same could be said of Christmas because gift giving was always a part of the indigenous culture .
