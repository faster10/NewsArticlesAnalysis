I do sense he is picking up a lot of steam in Iowa , said Royce Phillips , who is founding pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Coralville and has been plugged into conservative politics in Iowa for three decades . I don t think many people think deep down that Donald Trump is going to be one of the final players . I liken him to a blocking fullback ? clearing people out of the way , but he s not going to be the one that scores the touchdown . A smaller , faster player walks through that hole .
