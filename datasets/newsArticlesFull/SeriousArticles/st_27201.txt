Sheikha Lubna : First of all , I think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere . Liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad . We ' ve learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad . And we ' ve seen this where the UAE invests in the Far East , Australia , Asia as well as in Europe and the United States .
