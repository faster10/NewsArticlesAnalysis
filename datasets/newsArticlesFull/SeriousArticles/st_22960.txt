Still , it ' s fun to speculate on how such a major change would have altered the book series . Rowling doesn ' t specify in what context she was picturing Ron ' s death , but it ' s easy to imagine that he might have bit the dust relatively early . Lots of people were shocked when Rowling killed off Cedric Diggory in " Goblet of Fire , " but Diggory was a minor character who , in hindsight , was always kind of a handsome readymade corpse think of how much freakier the latter Potters would have felt without good ol ' Ron around to relieve the tension .
