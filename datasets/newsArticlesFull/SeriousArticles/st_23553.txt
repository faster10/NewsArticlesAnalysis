I hope the storm is a good reminder that when we hear candidates ' soothing words about shedding federal government functions , whether it ' s FEMA , Medicaid , or safety nets in recession , we must think about what that actually means in practice . Disasters happen , recessions happen like it or not , there are market failures and natural disasters in our future . If anything , it seems as though these 100 year storms come about every six months these days . ( Which reminds me here ' s a great idea for a big , national infrastructure project that will create millions of jobs for white and blue collar workers and save billions in lost output : Bury the power lines ! )
