Many will be tempted to use the United States Oil ETF USO , 0 . 50 ? to play rising oil prices . The problem with this strategy is that unless oil prices move quickly and substantially , the contango will largely defeat the price gains . Modern Trader magazine showed in its September edition that the United States Oil ETF had a tracking error of about 24 vs . the futures it held over the preceding year and that was in a falling oil price environment . In a rising price environment , the tracking would likely be worse . If you don ' t know what that all means , you better look it up before trying to use USO , which is really only appropriate for experienced short term traders .
