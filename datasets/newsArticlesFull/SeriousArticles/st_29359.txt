Don Banks , SI . com : " So , they meet again . Naturally . As if pre ordained by the league office or an even higher power , for the 17th and most likely final time we ll have a Brady versus Manning matchup to hype this week in the build up to next Sunday s AFC Championship Game . And you really thought we were going to sit the 2015 season out on that front , missing our annual Tom and Peyton palooza ? ! No chance . ? The faint hope , of course , is that they re saving the best for last , and the final chapter of this epic quarterback rivalry is a summation for the ages . But honestly , I m not too optimistic about that . Not after watching the Denver Broncos and Manning squeak past an injury depleted Pittsburgh Steelers squad 23 ? 16 late Sunday in an AFC divisional playoff game at Sports Authority Field at Mile High . Manning did little to inspire confidence that he s ready to trade touchdown passes with Brady and a Patriots offense that suddenly looked back in form Saturday in a 27 ? 20 win over visiting Kansas City in the other AFC semifinal . Yes , Manning hung in there against the Steelers and gritted out a crucial 13 play , 65 yard fourth quarter touchdown drive to win the game . But ? five field goals and just one touchdown drive ? Denver s first in the postseason in 23 possessions ? won t cut it against New England . Manning will have to summon a performance that would represent by far his best of the season if the Broncos are going to upset the defending Super Bowl champions and earn their second trip to the big game in the past three years .
