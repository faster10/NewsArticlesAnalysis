The Supreme Court struck down the law . It observed that the " great and controlling purpose " of the law was " to deny to pardons granted by the President the effect which this court had adjudged them to have , " namely protecting those pardoned from legal consequences of their earlier disloyalty . The court then framed the problem as one of the separation of powers . It said it could not apply the law " without allowing that the legislature may prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department of the government in cases pending before it . "
