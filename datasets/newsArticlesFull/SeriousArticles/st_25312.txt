The bigger news on the Republican side was the throwdown now happening between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . Up until very recently , Cruz has been consistently sucking up to Trump , in the hopes of picking up Trump ' s base of support when he fails . Since Trump hasn ' t shown any sign of doing so on his own , Cruz has realized it may be up to him to make this failure happen . Trump , for his part , has mostly ignored Cruz up until now ( while saying kind things about him occasionally ) , but since Cruz has caught him in the polls in Iowa , Trump is attacking right back . In fact , Trump has gone " full birther " on Cruz , which political pundits have been predicting ( for a long time ) would happen if Cruz ever claimed the lead . Trump ' s already the biggest birther around ( over Obama ) , so it ' s only natural that he would play the " born in Canada " card at some point .
