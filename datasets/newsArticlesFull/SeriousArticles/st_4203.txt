Golden State made its final 11 free throws to hang on for a 112 109 win at Toronto on Saturday , riding 44 points from Stephen Curry to its 25th straight win in the regular season dating back to 2014 15 and securing the best start in major professional sports history . The 25 game run leaves the Warriors two victories behind the 2012 13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history , and eight from matching the 1971 72 Los Angeles Lakers . It nearly came to an end much sooner when the Nets stormed into Oakland on Nov . 14 and pushed Golden State to overtime before dropping a 107 99 decision . Brooklyn fell to 1 9 that day but has gone a more respectable 4 5 since , although it offered little resistance in a 17 point loss at New York on Friday .
