So if U . S . veterans like McCain and Rieckhoff who fight for their fellow veterans all the time can take a stand on principle and give the straight arm to what is clearly another contrived Trump publicity stunt , can ' t a group of television journalists take a stand , too ? Can ' t they agree to forgo the ratings race for one night and show the candidate who ' s disrespected all of them this week that they will not be marionettes on a billionaire ' s string ? There ' s a big world out there to cover . There ' s plenty of important stuff to sandwich between commercials instead of another segment on the star of The Apprentice . Don ' t let the inmate run the asylum . Take a stand , together , on behalf of every one of you who ' s been pushed around for the last six months . Bump Trump . Cover the debate .
