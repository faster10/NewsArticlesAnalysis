When I spoke with League he was beaming yuletide happiness , drinking a can of Four Loko ( an energy alcoholic beverage he calls the " perfect Christmas drink " ) . We discussed his all seasons ' heroes Kroger Babb and William Castle both razzle dazzle movie promoters of a bygone era . By turning " The Interview " into a Happening , in ' 60s parlance , League was carrying forward the iconic Babb Castle torch . " I ' m no stranger to wearing costumes or being patriotic , " League says . " And everybody who bought tickets today is a goddamn , super duper , American hero . "
