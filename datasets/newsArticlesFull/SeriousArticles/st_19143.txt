Then there were the angry messages from very angry men , accusing me of being anti men , of male bashing , of being on the side of women , of not being willing to let a man be a man . Well , my personal definition of manhood is that it should be rooted in self love and respect for all people , including women . We should view women and girls as the equals of men and boys . And the foundation of manhood needs to be about peace and nonviolence and communication , not anger , hatred , violence and ugliness .
