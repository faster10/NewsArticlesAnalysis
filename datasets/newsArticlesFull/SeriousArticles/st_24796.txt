What we have seen over the past 12 months in the U . S . economy is likely to be the story of the next 12 months . Incremental , slow improvements as both consumers continue to pay down debt , and repair their household finances . The posh word for this is deleveraging . Business may have lots of cash but with so much uncertainty and worry they are not about to spend it . Hoarding money will continue until there is tangible solid evidence that growth is sustainable ( we are seeing some signs consumer confidence , house prices , housing starts , durable numbers etc but it is still tentative ) .
