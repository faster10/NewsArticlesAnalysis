Princess Anne , a former British eventing champion , said : ' I really hope eventually that technology will make a difference . If we had a better form of identification it would give confidence to owners and dealers alike that they know where their horses were going . ' Thousands of unwanted horses a year are sold at UK markets such as Kirkby Stephen , Cumbria , Henley in Arden , Warwickshire and Llanybydder , Carmarthenshire . Dealers can pick up a pony for as little as 5 but sell its meat on the continent for up to 250 . A larger horse may sell for less than 75 but the meat can make 600 .
