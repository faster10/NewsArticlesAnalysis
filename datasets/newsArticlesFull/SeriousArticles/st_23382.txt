I am not a fan of either team tonight . So I have no skin in the game as to who won or lost . However , if the NFL wants to get things right and stop everyone from second guessing officials , which is clearly called for in every NFL game then , at the very least , everything and I mean everything including penalties should be reviewable during the last two minutes of every game . All they need is a guy in the booth and when he sees the same thing that we as viewers see on TV , that clearly is a questionable call , all he needs to do is buzz down so the play can be reviewed . That way we don t have endings that don t follow the NFL rulebook . The game is just too important to be officiated like it s a grade school game !
