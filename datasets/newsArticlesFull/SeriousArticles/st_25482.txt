Pete Thamel , SI . com : " Nick Saban arrived in Tuscaloosa , Ala . , in 2007 to rescue the University of Alabama football program from a stunning stretch of mediocrity . The Crimson Tide had recently endured the scandal of Mike DuBose , the quick exit of Dennis Franchione , the quicker exit of Mike Price and the underwhelming tenure of Mike Shula .

Prior to Saban s arrival , those were distant memories at Alabama , as it fought NCAA sanctions , got passed in the SEC hierarchy and made national headlines mostly for its futility . "
