Kasandra Perkins is the victim ' s name . Let us always say the names of women who are the victims of violence . I would also add it does not matter whether the man is famous , a professional athlete , or someone nobody has ever heard of . Violence against women is unacceptable . However , when it involves a high profile individual like Belcher , perhaps the tragedy can be a teachable moment so that more people will pay attention to domestic violence . Otherwise Kasandra Perkins ' death will truly be in vain .
