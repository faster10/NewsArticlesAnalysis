If there ' s another boycott in the near future , though , I doubt it will be over " getting paid . " In general , it ' s been my observation that adults in cubicles are much more passionate and perturbed about pay for play than most football players themselves . Most really enjoy playing college football and aren ' t inclined to meddle with that experience . It ' s going to take a particularly extreme situation ? like the Grambling boycott in 2013 over decrepit conditions ? to cause a group of football players to voluntarily deprive themselves of a playing opportunity . Or it ' s going to be another hot button social cause .
