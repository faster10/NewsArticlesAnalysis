When the Wampanoag considered the many possible threats posed by the pilgrims , my guess is that they weren ' t being na ? ve , but simply chose to accept physical threats over spiritual ones . They chose to protect the life of the soul over the life of the body . While the relationship between Native Americans and Europeans would become increasingly complicated and tragic over time , the Wampanoag chose empathy over indifference , compassion over cruelty , and generosity over hard heartedness . They overcame evil with good , darkness with light .
