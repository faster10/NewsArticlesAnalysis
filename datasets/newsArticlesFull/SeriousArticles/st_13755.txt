In Staten Island , where some residents have been without power for weeks , our relief workers are going door to door delivering sleeping bags to families without heat . And in Long Island , where thousands of people have been temporarily displaced , we delivered medical aid to a shelter housing hundreds of families . When our relief workers arrived , shelter officials were grappling with how to care for a large population with chronic illness . About one third of the shelter dwellers are diabetics and the shelter had no way to safely store insulin , so we bought them a refrigerator . We also delivered wheelchairs , medical cots and 1 , 400 pounds of medical aid everything from cough and cold medicines to first aid supplies .
