People can t underemphasize vigilance and good security . Tim McVeigh simply parked his truck in front of the Murrah building and casually walked away , as if heading towards some other activity and his bomb took out a building a bunch of people inside that quick . Even in Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia , a terrorist did the same thing , and even with a lookout on the roof who ran down through the building to warn others it was still not enough time . So here , some dirtbag pulls into a stadium parking lot , gathers his belongings and , and casually strolls toward the stadium , still with plenty of places to escape , and it can happen that fast . So again . look around , report stuff that is suspicious probably get the hell away yourself .
