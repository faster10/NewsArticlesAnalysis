" The root of the problem is that genocide and ethnic cleansing often represent state retaliation against a sub state group for rebellion , or armed secession , by some of its members . The emerging norm , by raising hopes of diplomatic and military intervention to protect these groups , unintentionally fosters rebellion by lowering its expected cost and raising its likelihood of success . Intervention does sometimes help rebels attain their political goals , but it is usually too late or inadequate to avert retaliation against civilians . Thus , the emerging norm resembles an imperfect insurance policy against genocidal violence . It creates a moral hazard that encourages the excessively risky behavior of rebellion by members of groups that are vulnerable to genocidal retaliation , but it cannot fully protect these groups against the backlash . The emerging norm thereby causes some genocidal violence that otherwise would not occur . " Alan J . Kuperman
