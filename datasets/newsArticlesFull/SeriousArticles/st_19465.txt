The fans in attendance at the NFC Championship game were all chanting MVP , and they had good reason to . Cam Newton has had one of the best years of any quarterback in the NFL by not only throwing the ball better than ever , but by running the ball and putting the entire team on his back to carry them to victories . He was masterful in this game , outside of his one interception . Newton completed 19 of 28 passes ( 67 percent ) for 335 yards and two touchdowns . He also ran for 47 yards on 10 carries for two more touchdowns , giving him four for the game . Newton scored more points by himself than the entire Cardinals team did in this game . ?
