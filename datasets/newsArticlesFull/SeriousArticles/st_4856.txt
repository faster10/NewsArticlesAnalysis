Fantasy watch : The Broncos had piled up 168 yards rushing by the time there were just two minutes left in Sunday s game , and that was a season most , topping the team s 171 yards rushing against the Green Bay Packers . And while the Broncos will face better defenses down the stretch , if things go as the Broncos hope , the team s running backs will be worth a long look for fantasy football owners once again . Ronnie Hillman had 102 yards rushing with two minutes to play while C . J . Anderson had 56 yards rushing at that point in the game .
