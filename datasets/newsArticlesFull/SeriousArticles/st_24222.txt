Last month I sat in the same auditorium at the Ronald Reagan Building for a conference of American Indians and Alaska Natives , who make up 2 of the US population . They told me they had received a pitch from only one Republican candidate , Ben Carson . Jews similarly make up 2 of the US population , and 70 of those vote Democrat , yet 13 GOP candidates showed up for them . Or rather , for Adelson s patronage ( the man himself was travelling , so they found themselves like actors auditioning for an absent director ) .
