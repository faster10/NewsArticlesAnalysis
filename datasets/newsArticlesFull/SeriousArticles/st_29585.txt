The first time these two teams met ? a 34 20 Chiefs victory on Dec . 6 ? Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware combined for 61 yards in 16 attempts , a little less than 4 yards per carry . That s not great , but the Chiefs might have a little more success at home . It will be interesting to see how the Chiefs fare , especially since there might be some upheaval this week at right tackle , where Jah Reid is questionable because of a knee injury . The Chiefs offensive line has generally done a good job working together amid multiple lineups , so that will need to continue .
