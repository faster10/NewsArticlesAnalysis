The heady scent of smoked meat beckons hungry travelers the moment they step off the plane , and plenty of people have even been known to get to the airport early to enjoy some pit smoked ( obviously not on premises ) brisket and sausage . Of course , it ' s nowhere near the same experience as you ' d get driving out to to their decades old , cash only , BYOB restaurant in the Texas Hill Country , it ' s a darned sight better than having no barbecue at all ( plus the line may be just a smidge shorter ) .
