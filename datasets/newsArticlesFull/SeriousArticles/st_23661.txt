The Kubiak running attack uses the way the defense reacts to run action against it , not so much opening holes as allowing creases to unfold naturally . This requires great vision on the back s part , a successful double team on the side the play originally heads and successful cut blocks on the backside . As for downfield blocking , for the most part the corners will be left unblocked under the theory they won t tackle effectively , while the wide receivers and tight ends ( of which at least two will be on the field the majority of the time ) block the safeties .
