Stone : I think the film is quite satisfying in that it shows you the marks for Iraq . It ends at the moment he goes to war . We know how things turn out . It ' s not a film about those eight years . It ' s a film about the character of a man . There ' s a first act when he ' s in his 20s , a second act in his 40s and the third act when he ' s in his mid 50s . It ' s a character study and we get to the place at which we know the way he ' s going to behave . It ' s a father son story because a lot of his actions are motivated by , let ' s call it , rivalry to be stronger than his father . And that ' s part of the reason he goes to Iraq .
