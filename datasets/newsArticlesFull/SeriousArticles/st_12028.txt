Uneventful ( the dog gets sick , and , uh , that ' s about it ) , " Greenberg " resembles the kind of films Gerwig has been making ( " LOL , " " Baghead " ) , but on a bigger budget and with one of Hollywood ' s most accomplished cinematographers on board ( Harris Savides , whose credits include " Zodiac " and " Milk " ) . That is , it coalesces around tentative , half formed ideas about how to be a person in the world . " Greenberg " shows that young people aren ' t the only ones wondering what they ' re to make of themselves and whether it ' s already too late .
