Flanking Mayfield again figures to be one of the best running back tandems in the country next season . Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon combined to rush for more than 2 , 100 yards this last year , and fueled a ground game that led all Power 5 offenses after Oct . 11 . The thunder and lightning duo complements one another perfectly , too . Perine is a power runner capable of wearing down defenses between the tackles . Mixon is a terrific pass catcher who can break off big plays . As a result , Oklahoma ' s split back shotgun formation was deadly during the final two months of the season . And should be again in 2016 .
