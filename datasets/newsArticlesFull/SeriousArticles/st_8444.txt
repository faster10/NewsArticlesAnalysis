" Since the release of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry ( BICI ) report in 2011 , Bahrain has made a commitment to address all grievances , as well as well reform the institutional landscape to ensure historical errors are not repeated . In regards to grievances pertaining to any accusation of mistreatment , independent bodies have been established to investigate and address any incident of misconduct that may undermine public confidence in the Ministry of Interior ( MOI ) , even if no formal complaint is filed .
