That brings us to the second major trend , which is the world ' s ongoing dependence on fossil fuels . WRI recently released an analysis showing that there are nearly 1 , 200 new proposed coal plants worldwide . While not all of these will be developed , even a fraction of them would drive up global emissions . Oil , likewise , remains a dominant fuel source . And , despite the enormous profits , the International Energy Agency has reported that government subsidies for fossil fuels were six times those for renewable energy in 2011 . This dependence on fossil fuels keeps pushing up the global emissions . ( 2011 also broke the record for greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere . )
