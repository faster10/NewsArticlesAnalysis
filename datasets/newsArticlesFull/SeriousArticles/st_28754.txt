Personally I wouldn t have him on the team , Charley Casserly , the former general manager of the Redskins and Houston Texans , said this week . But Dallas is a little different situation . They do a great job there with their player assistance programs . They re willing to sign players with issues and they think they can help them . They trust in it . Hardy is a talented player . It s why he has a job now . It s why he ll probably have a job when he moves on from there . There s an old saying : You tolerate until you can replace . Talented players are harder to replace .
