1 . Non Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in the United States : According to the FBI itself , 94 of terrorist attacks carried out in the United States since 1980 have been by non Muslims . This means that an American terrorist suspect is over nine times more likely to be a non Muslim than a Muslim . According to this same report , there were more Jewish acts of terrorism in the United States than Islamic , yet when was the last time we heard about the threat of Jewish terrorism in the media ? For the same exact reasons that we cannot blame the entire religion of Judaism or Christianity for the violent actions of those carrying out crimes under the names of these religions , we have absolutely no justifiable grounds to blame Muslims for terrorism .
