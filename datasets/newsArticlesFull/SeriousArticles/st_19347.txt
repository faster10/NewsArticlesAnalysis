Nanci Griffith : It was very difficult for me . I was hurt by the direction my country was going in . And then , after the 2008 election , everything came spilling out . Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case ( " The Loving Kind " ) , where Mildred died , and I read her obituary . The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time . That was such an inspiration . . . . Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage . Little things . Bit by bit , my heart started to open up again , and I could write !
