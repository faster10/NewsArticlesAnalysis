The largest cottage is Alltnaguibhsaich Lodge , which sleeps up to 13 people and sits farther away from the castle on the shores of Loch Muick . Rent for the cottages start around 750 a week ( 480 pounds ) , and vary depending on which cottage you choose and the time of the year . And you don ' t have to leave your dogs at home , they are welcome during your stay . The cottages are closed for most of August , September and early October for the royal family ' s official visit . The cottages are charming , comfortable and fully equipped , but don ' t expect crystal chandeliers and marble bathrooms . Although you ' re at Balmoral , it ' s more rustic than the Ritz .
