Connelly : I don ' t think I was one who looked at anniversaries and numbers much , but for some reason this one was significant for me . When you ' re starting out you never believe that you might accomplish writing twenty five books in twenty years . It ' s really bizarre to even contemplate . Twenty years was significant as well because of what happened in Los Angeles in 1992 . My first book was published in January of that year so it was kind of a new world opening up to me . A few months later the city was torn apart by riots after the Rodney King trial . I really did weigh all these anniversaries and years when writing this book . I think it ' s the first time I ever really thought about that . The book ' s about the death of a journalist and during the riots I almost got killed . That ' s something I worked out in a lot of my books . So that all played into it , there ' s a lot of nostalgia , all of it was really important to me and I never really had this kind of stuff inspiring me before .
