SENATE DEMS PUSH WHEELER ON EQUIPMENT FEES ? A group of seven senators ? including Ron Wyden , Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey ? are pressing FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler for information on how the agency protects consumers from unfair equipment rental fees , like the fees cable companies charge for modem rentals . We are troubled upon hearing complaints of consumers being charged the modem rental fee after they have returned the rented equipment to Comcast or being charged the rental fee having never rented a modem in the first place , the lawmakers wrote in a new letter today . They note many subscribers have automatic monthly bill pay set up and even if they see the erroneous charges , many consumers report having to call and remedy this problem throughout several billing cycles .
