The rub in this game is how the Patriots offense deals with Chiefs defense , said Boomer . The Chiefs defensive coordinator is Bob Sutton , who has been around a long time . He was a part of Rex Ryan and Eric Mangini s defense when they were with the Jets . He has had success against Tom Brady and we saw that last year in Week 4 of the regular season . It isn t the best matchup for the Patriots , but what it all comes down to for the Patriots is are they healthy ? Are Julian Edelman , Sebastian Vollmer and ? Dont a Hightower going to play ? If they have all their guys on the field and are ready to rock and roll , I can see the Patriots do what the Packers did Sunday : Flip the switch and play like you haven t played the last six or seven weeks and really put a beat down on a Chiefs team that has been struggling offensively .
