So building these cities in the areas where they have been chosen to be built is to bring development to these areas , not to avoid any specific objection from any society . And who is going to come to these cities once they are built ? It is the whole fabric of the Kingdom the conservatives and the modernizers and the liberals and other groups of people that are part and parcel of the Kingdom . And more importantly I think , from somebody who is outside government now looking on these developments , is the fact that all of these developments are concentrated on job opportunities for the young . We have a very young population . In five years time , in ten years time , all of these people are going to come on stream looking for jobs , looking for opportunities and wanting to have a family and children and so on . So you have to provide for that now , you cannot wait five or ten years , hence the King ' s hurried pace in putting these things on the ground .
