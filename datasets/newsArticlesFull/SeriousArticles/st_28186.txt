Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush both had great nights , but Bush got the better of their exchange on immigration . Bush picked the right time to shine in a debate . Ted Cruz also occupied much of the oxygen in the room , and seemed to take incoming from all sides . He handled it fine and I think probably cemented himself in second place ? at least for the moment . Governors Chris Christie and John Kasich had good moments , too . In fact , on the main stage , absent Donald Trump , everyone did pretty well .
