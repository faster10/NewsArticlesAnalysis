I thought this was damning enough , but then later in the debate , Santorum stepped in deeper when he said he voted for No Child Left Behind even though it was against his beliefs , calling politics a team sport and saying he had been supporting President George W . Bush in that vote . I don ' t think he understood that he fed right into the critique Paul was making about Santorum ' s credibility and sticking with principle . ( Did anyone find it ironic that the one word Santorum used to describe himself in the debate was " courage " ? )
