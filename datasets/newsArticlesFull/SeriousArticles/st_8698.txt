For those seeking even more of an adventure , Choquequirao is the ideal trek . This nine day eight night trek passes the two largest Inca sites in the Cusco region : Machu Picchu and Choquequirao . The latter is a huge archaeological complex that is only about 30 percent excavated and thus has endured minimal tourist foot traffic . Surrounded by the Salkantay mountain , the trek dives into the Apurimac River canyon and passes waterfalls , villages , Inca ruins and frequently condors . It does have one major drawback : before continuing on to Machu Picchu , trekkers must backtrack the two days ' journey it takes to arrive at Choquequirao , resulting in some repeated views .
