4 . Silver and Black and Desperate : I know , I know , calling the Spurs " desperate " is just a huge round from the hot take cannon , right ? But hear me out . The Spurs signed LaMarcus Aldridge , and by their own admission , did so because they feel Tim Duncan needs to take a step backward from his burdens as his career winds down . Manu Ginobili very nearly retired . Tony Parker has everyone quietly scared that his expiration date has passed . This team was not put together for slow maturation and long term growth .
