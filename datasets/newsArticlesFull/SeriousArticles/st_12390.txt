No , the bigger problem is that we d be shutting out innocent Muslim refugees who sincerely need help . And that s why I m ultimately not in favor of having a religious test for accepting Syrian refugees . The same vetting process that would separate out real Christians from fake ones can be used to separate out genuine refugees from imposters . Over the course of a year and a half ( or more ) , we should be able to figure out which Syrians are part of communities that were fleeing violence , and which are potential threats .
