Chicago at St . Louis : Say what you want about Jeff Fisher ' s win loss record or late game decisions , but there are few things more damning in today ' s football world than calling a coach dirty . I can also tell you that there are few guys in the league who are more reasonable and transparent than the Rams head coach . Remember , Fisher plays a prominent role on the competition committee , and his chief concern there is player safety . Rodney Harrison has the right to say whatever he wants ( it ' s a free country ! ) , but Fisher also has the right to publically bludgeon him with a defense that lists all of Harrison ' s unsportsmanlike instances , penalties and suspensions , as well . Give me the Rams on Sunday .
