I ' ve now had the letters " MTV " in front of my job title for 24 years and can tell you that this is a network that doesn ' t grow up , or old , with its audience and neither do the VMAs . The show is constantly evolving , and our audience expects change , innovation , risk and creativity from us . It takes the effort of hundreds of people combined with dedicated artists to plan , create and share amazing moments like when Pink ! sang " Sober " from a trapeze high above the VMAs ' stage or when Taylor Swift sang " You Belong With Me " as she ran up from a New York subway car to take over 6th Avenue .
