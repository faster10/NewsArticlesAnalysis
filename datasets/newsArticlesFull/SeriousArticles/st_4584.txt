A cynical person can point to the pragmatism in this . If Pinkel did not back his team , he could have lost his team . He could have lost recruits . Taking it a little further , he could have lost games and perhaps , eventually , his job . There was a lot to gain by joining with his players , and relatively little to lose . He has been quite successful here , winning consecutive division titles , so even if he were somehow fired for daring to support a student movement , he would not have been looking for work for long . He empowered his players , and empowered himself as well .
