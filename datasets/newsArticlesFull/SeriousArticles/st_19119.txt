I see a guy that ' s immature , and I see a guy that just doesn ' t get it . I ' m hoping he gets it and somebody can be man enough to pull him aside and give him the cold , hard facts : Listen , you ' re a talented player , but there ' s plenty of talented players in this league , and the league will survive without you . Once the owners and the NFL decides to say they ' ve had enough of you , they ' ve had enough of you . It doesn ' t matter what you can do as far as rushing the passer . Ask Ray Rice .
