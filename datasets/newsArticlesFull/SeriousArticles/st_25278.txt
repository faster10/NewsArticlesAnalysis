Nick Carter ended up getting second place on the last season of Dancing With the Stars . He lost the show to Bindi Irwin , but did a great job of even picked up some new fans . Nick Carter actually put out a new album after his time on the show and the fact that he had picked up popularity again . Nick is scheduled to head out on tour in February and hopefully this will not mess with his big tour plans . Nick is best known for his time in the group Backstreet Boys . He is still very close with the guys from this group and they were even supporting him while he was on Dancing With the Stars .
