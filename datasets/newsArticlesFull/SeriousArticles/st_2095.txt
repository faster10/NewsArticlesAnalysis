Get RB Zac Brooks involved : Clemson s 1 2 punch of Watson and RB Wayne Gallman is a potent one . The two killed Oklahoma , rushing for nearly 300 yards and three touchdowns . But they also took 50 of the Tigers 55 rushes in that game . That s a heavy load to ask two guys to carry against a team as physical as Alabama , and the Tide showed in LSU that a limited offense is one it will contain . Brooks is no slouch ? he averaged nearly 6 yards a carry in 2015 ? and Clemson must use every weapon in its arsenal to keep players fresh and Bama defenders eyes on multiple targets .
