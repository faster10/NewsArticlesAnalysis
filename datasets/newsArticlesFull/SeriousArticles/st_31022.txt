The story of how Spain ' s King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella funded Christopher Columbus voyage to America : Before Columbus set sail to discover America , his request for funding his voyage was rejected by Portugal , France and England . It was Spain who ultimately bankrolled his trip . King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella took a risk and changed the world in the process . America ' s first settlers from Europe were Hispanic . This would be an epic film that could be directed by Cuar n or I ? rritu . Think Ridley Scott ' s " 1492 : Conquest of Paradise " meets Shekhar Kapur ' s " Elizabeth " starring Cate Blanchett . The story of the discovery of America has never been told from the Hispanic perspective . Javier Bardem plays the King and Pen lope Cruz plays Queen Isabella , directed by Alejandro Gonz lez I ? rritu . How about that ?
