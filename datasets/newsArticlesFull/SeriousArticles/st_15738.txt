Last August , Tom Brady was raving about White , telling reporters , " I knew when we drafted him everyone really liked him , so that ' s why he ' s here , because I think everyone thinks he can contribute to the team and he can make a big impact on the team . ? He ' s done that . He ' s definitely someone who has come every day , and he makes really impressive plays for a young player . The more of those guys we have , the better we ' re going to be collectively , and that ' s what training camp really gives everybody an opportunity to do because you get the chance , and you want to try to go out and show people what you ' re capable of , you want to go out and surprise people that they didn ' t think you ' re capable of something , and you show them that you can do it . That ' s where you really gain the trust of your coaches and your teammates . "
