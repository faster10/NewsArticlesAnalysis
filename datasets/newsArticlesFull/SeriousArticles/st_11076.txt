Clearly , those divergent voices and I admit there are many failed even the most basic fourth grade geography lesson and likely couldn ' t even find India on a map , which is why they mistakenly think you are Arab . Perhaps they have you confused with Rima Fakih , a Lebanese immigrant from Dearborn , Michigan , who in 2010 was the first Arab American to win the Miss USA pageant . Must be hard keeping up with a changing world when you ' ve spent so much time trying to ignore and reject all those people who look different from you .
