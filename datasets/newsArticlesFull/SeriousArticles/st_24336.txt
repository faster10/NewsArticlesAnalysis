In rummaging deep through files from my previous 32 Super Bowls , I found a great photo of me and my mom that was taken the day of Super Bowl XIX at Stanford . We ' re standing outside the Mercury News hospitality tent on what is now the university ' s soccer field . It made me a little emotional seeing it because both my folks died a few years ago , and I remember that day well and how excited they were . For being a host committee sponsor , the Merc received a ticket allotment , and I bought two for them . They sat next to Ken Kesey , the " One Flew Over The Cuckoo ' s Nest " author and infamous LSD prankster . The Mercury News had made a deal with him to write a piece for us in exchange for two Super Bowl tickets , so he took his son . Mom and Dad had no idea who he was but said he was a very nice man . And for those wondering . . . No , the paper has no hospitality tent at this year ' s game . So don ' t ask me for tickets .
