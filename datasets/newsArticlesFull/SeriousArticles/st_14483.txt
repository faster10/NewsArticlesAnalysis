NdP : All drivers will be permanently employed staff there ' s more than enough people looking for quality work around here . I want to build up a team of really strong drivers . We ' re putting successful drivers through a formal tour guide training course , which will benefit not only us , but ideally develop them into small business owners later on . We ' re also equipping them with communication and client interaction courses . What we ' re also thinking of doing is transferring ownership of the vehicles to the drivers after a period of successful operation . . . enabling them to become semi owner drivers .
