I do not condone violence . I believe in the power of protests to confront the ugliness of inequality and injustice with the beauty of people peacefully coming together and simply but strongly demanding change . Then again , I understand that when people are angry , it ' s hard to be quiet . In La Puente , California , Rose Mary Gudiel is facing foreclosure and ejection from her home after falling on hard times . Gudiel is staying in her home until she , her brother and her elderly parents are forcibly removed by One West , the bank to which she has repeatedly appealed for lenience . Gudiel is actively resisting the orders of police and government officials . Is that violence ? Will it be violent when the bank and cops remove her ? Where do we draw the line ?
