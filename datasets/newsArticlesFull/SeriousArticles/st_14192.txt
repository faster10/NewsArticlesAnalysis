This was not as much of a rout as the final ? scoreline ? suggests . In fact , both sides fielded weakened squads , with Arsenal giving ? Mesut ? Ozil ? a rest and Sam ? Allardyce ? keeping some powder dry for what looks to be a prolonged battle against relegation . ? And for much of the first half the game reflected those reduced circumstances . ? Arsenal had more of the ball but did less with it with ? Ozil ? and the injured ? Santi ? Cazorla ? absent Sunderland put on a lot of huff and puff , but only midfielder Duncan ? Watmore ? really looked like a man playing for a spot with this team .
