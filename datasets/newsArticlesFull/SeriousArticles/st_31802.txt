Miller : Flea came out to a show in New York City and somebody introduced him to me . He was like , hey , I ' m Flea . I obviously knew who he was . He was incredibly nice and he was like , would you guys be interested in playing shows with my band ? I was like , you mean the Red Hot Chili Peppers ? Sure ! It was literally that simple . There was no politicking , no agents or anything . It was just dude to dude . I really appreciated that . I think they ' re all going to be really great people and I ' m pretty psyched on it . They ' re one of the biggest touring bands on Earth , which is a strange sentence . They ' re , like , top two or three on the planet . I ' m interested to see how a production like that works .
