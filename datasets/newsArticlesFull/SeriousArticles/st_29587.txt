Derek Carr , a second year pro , is an ascending player in this league , and he s had a breakthrough 2015 . He completed 31 of 48 passes for 283 yards and two touchdowns against the Chiefs a month ago , but he was also sacked four times and intercepted three times . That s all part of the learning process for a young quarterback . He throws a lot of short passes and primarily operates out of the shotgun , and he s got some great targets in Amari Cooper , Michael Crabtree and Seth Roberts . They combined for 13 catches , 165 yards and a touchdown the first teams met , but the Chiefs corners matched up pretty well with them .
