It ' s important to remember , says Ewer , that " there are different personality types . " Organized " is what works for you . There are filers people who love folders . They want the serenity of knowing where things are . Pilers like to keep their eyes on their stuff . Deniers have bags of paperwork shoved into closets . Instead of using a " What does it look like ? " yardstick , it ' s a " How will it work ? " question . Know yourself , and come up with solutions that reflect who you are , she says .
