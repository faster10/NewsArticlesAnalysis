For the record , we should make the real immigration distinctions clear . Both Rubio and Bush were in favor , at one point , of a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the U . S . Bush wrote a book in which he stepped away from this position at the beginning of the campaign , saying that he favored legal status but not full citizenship ? you can stay and pay taxes , but you can t vote ? for the undocumented . Cruz also favored legal status but not citizenship . But both Rubio and Cruz have since scampered away from any plausible answer for what to do with the 11 million , in response to the nativist craziness in the GOP . Bush has remained in favor of legal status , which has made him a wimp and an easy mark for Trump , who wants to ship them all back to Mexico .
