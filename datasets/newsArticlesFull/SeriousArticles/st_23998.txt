This is really about political statements and maintaining a certain social hierarchy . Demanding that innocent Muslims always make new statements about crimes they could not have stopped , from which they do not benefit , and have always condemned anyway , is an act by the powerful assigning collective guilt against the powerless . The critics who want Muslims to " speak out " only grow more demanding when Muslims actually do speak out , because by doing so Muslims have publicly affirmed the right of others to blame them collectively , regardless of whether they are accountable or not .
