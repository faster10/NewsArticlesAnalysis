I looked around the changing room and everyone ' s head was between their legs . No one spoke , and I kept even quieter than usual . I was paralysed by the silence , and resolved to sit there until someone else made a move . It took 20 aching minutes before the first people started stirring and having quiet conversations , and with that the tension began to ease off . Everyone was just bracing themselves for the press and the public . It ' s bad after any loss , but we knew that one would be particularly gruelling .
