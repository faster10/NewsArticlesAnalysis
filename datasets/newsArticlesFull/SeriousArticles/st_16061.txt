Sollecito ' s defense lawyer Giulia Bongiorno also said during closing arguments to remember that the true evidence points to who they believe is the sole killer : Rudy Guede . Guede , who was convicted earlier of the crime , has admitted being in the villa where Kercher was killed , but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room during his trial . He later implicated Knox and Sollecito . During his trial prosecutors introduced evidence that showed Guede ' s handprint in Kercher ' s blood was found in the room along with his DNA inside her body as well as on her clothing and on her purse .
