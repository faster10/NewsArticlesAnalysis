Iowa looks like a two man contest between Trump and Cruz , but the caucus will still go a long way toward shaping the race within a race that will happen in New Hampshire eight days later between the establishment favored foursome of Rubio , Kasich , Bush , and Christie . Rubio , in particular , is banking on a strong third place finish in Iowa to propel himself to second place in the Granite State ( followed by , in his mind at least , a first place finish in South Carolina later in the month ) . His party approved rivals trail him by nearly 10 points in the Iowa polls , but they don t need to best Rubio in the final caucus standings , they just need to blunt any momentum he does have coming out of Iowa . Thursday night offers a chance to pre emptively do that ? particularly for Kasich , whose current New Hampshire hot streak would be in danger of going cold if Rubio outperforms expectations in Iowa .
