During Hanukkah , we do a Yankee swap , a gift exchange . It has always been great fun , but a few years ago my husband and I decided to make it even more interesting by sneaking decoy gifts into the mix . They look like normal presents from the outside we wrap up things like CD cases , gift card envelopes , and wine bottles but once you look inside , you see that the original item has been replaced with a note card bearing an instruction , such as " Switch gifts with a person of the opposite gender " or " Choose a new gift and no one can take it from you . " This little twist was a surprise to everyone the first year , but now it is our favorite part of the ritual . Christine Gritmon , Pearl River , New York
