Living her career on fast forward meant that , within four years , Rihanna had sailed past the point where most artists would have released a greatest hits . But she kept her foot down ? in 2011 alone , she had 11 UK hits ? and drove her career into the current era where greatest hits albums don t even exist . This release strategy is most commonly associated , in the modern age at least , with a pop artist terrified of transient fanbases .

And there were collaborations , too , with Coldplay , Drake , Eminem , Nicki Minaj and Kanye West .
