For anyone with even a passing interest in baseball the past 20 years , it s still hard to believe : The Kansas City Royals are World Series champs . Baseball s exploding economics , and rampant team mismanagement , had long left this small market franchise behind . Before last season , the team hadn t made the playoffs since 1985 , the last year the Royals won the Series . You laugh your ass off , said Royals Hall of Famer George Brett , a team VP , remembering some of the team s comically inept moments on the field . But after awhile you re going , Man , what are we doing ? This is embarrassing .
