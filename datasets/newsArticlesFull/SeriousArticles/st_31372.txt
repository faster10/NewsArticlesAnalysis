Another key debut last night : The CW ' s " Arrow ' ( 4 million , 1 . 3 rating ) got off to a fine start . This may not be a huge demo rating for the network , but " Arrow " marks The CW ' s most watched series debut in total viewers since " The Vampire Diaries " in 2009 . The CW ' s mission this season is to attract a broader audience than just the " Gossip Girl " " 90210 " female 18 34 crowd , and hitting 4 million viewers certainly helps . The performance is also impressive considering the network ' s numbers have been soft the past couple weeks . It ' s always tougher to jump start a cold engine . " Arrow " also gave " Supernatural " ( 2 . 6 million , 1 . 0 ) a boost at 9 p . m . , spiking the veteran drama to its biggest audience in two years .
