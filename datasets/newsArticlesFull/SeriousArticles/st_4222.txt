I had hoped the national debate might expand to include a deeper discussion of what is really happening with gun violence in America . So far , it has not . The conversation did not change much , even after Hadiya Pendleton , who marched with her Chicago classmates in President Obama ' s second inaugural parade , was shot and killed in a park while talking with her friends . She was only 15 years old . The truth is that her story is tragically common in America . And the most disputed ideas out of Washington , like an assault weapons ban , wouldn ' t do much to change that reality .
