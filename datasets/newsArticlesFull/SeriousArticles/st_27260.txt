Cisneros : What ' s always a challenge for me is that my Spanish is not the level of my English . Nor do I read in Spanish the way I read in English . I want my Spanish to be like that of a newscaster . . . . That ' s a different kind of Spanish . I feel comfortable in Spanish , I chat like a parrot , but I don ' t have the confidence in Spanish that I do in English . I ' m perfectly fine in the mercado , and I can make people laugh and tell a story , but my vocabulary is limited . For example , I don ' t know the Spanish word for " contractor . "
