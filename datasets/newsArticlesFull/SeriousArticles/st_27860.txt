The White Americans who love Donald Trump finally feel like they can breathe free oxygen again , like there might be a return to some semblance of an America they know . Ultimately I believe that many of these people don t actually want political discourse to look this unruly forever . Many of them claim to be fervent believers in civility . One of their biggest critiques of the Black Lives Matter proclamation is that it lacks civility . However , these are desperate times , times in which progress has come too fast in the person of Barack Obama . Thus I think many conservatives who a decade ago would have understood Trump to be rash , gauche , and a liability to the march of conservative values now stand by watching this train wreck of public discourse in order to restore white equilibrium .
