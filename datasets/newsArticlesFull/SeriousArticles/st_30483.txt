For the Warriors , they have internal and external motivation . From the internal perspective , they ' re on the verge of something historic . They won 67 games last year , and no one expects them to reach that high again this time . But . . . what if they did ? What if instead of coming back to earth , they simply demolished the league again on their way to 65 plus wins and another title ? Back to back championships in the ridiculously loaded Western Conference , during the LeBron and Duncan era ?
