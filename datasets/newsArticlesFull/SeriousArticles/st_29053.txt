Lewis : Well , it ' s a really exciting time to be honest with you . When the films finished I obviously had a degree of sadness about it all coming to an end . Having done something that you ' ve loved so much for such a long time , it ' s obviously going to be sad when it comes to an end . But it ' s also an exciting time because for the first time in a decade , I don ' t know what ' s coming next . And really , it ' s the opportunity now for me to show that I ' m not just Neville Longbottom , there is more that I can do , and I really just want to sort of push myself . It ' s a transitional period at the moment , and we ' ll have to see what happens next .
