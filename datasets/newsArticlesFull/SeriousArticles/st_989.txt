The weather plays an important role in this mission . Starting at the ground , conditions have to be very calm winds less than 2 mph , with no precipitation or humidity and limited cloud cover . The balloon , with capsule attached , will move through the lower level of the atmosphere ( the troposphere ) where our day to day weather lives . It will climb higher than the tip of Mount Everest ( 5 . 5 miles 8 . 85 kilometers ) , drifting even higher than the cruising altitude of commercial airliners ( 5 . 6 miles 9 . 17 kilometers ) and into the stratosphere . As he crosses the boundary layer ( called the tropopause ) , he can expect a lot of turbulence .
