One further thought . I write these words from Stockholm , where I have been doing a series of climate related public events . When I arrived , the press ? was having a field day with a tweet ? sent by Sweden s environment minister , ? sa Romson . Shortly after news broke of the attacks in Paris , she tweeted her outrage and sadness at the loss of life . Then she tweeted that she thought it would be bad news for the climate summit , a thought that occurred to everyone I know who is in any way connected to this environmental moment . Yet she was pilloried for her supposed insensitivity ? how could she be thinking about climate change at a time of such carnage ?
