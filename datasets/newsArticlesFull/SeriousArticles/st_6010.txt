If Planned Parenthood changed abortion practices to get specific fetal organs , it might be a violation of the 1993 federal law . Planned Parenthood denies that it did so , saying the " comments of one employee " do not reflect the organization ' s practices . The organization also says it did not profit from the transfer of fetal tissue to researchers , and that it charges only 30 to 100 for transportation . The tissue donation program exists in only six of its 700 clinics , in California and Washington state . ( To counter charges that it ' s selling tissue , Planned Parenthood has announced it will henceforth absorb those costs itself . ) Defenders of the fetal tissue donation system argue that if the tissue from legal abortions were not used for lifesaving research , it would simply be discarded . Critics say positive outcomes cannot justify a practice that is itself immoral . " You ' re basically taking the life of one member of human society to use for the life of another , " says Kathleen Schmainda , a professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin . " It corrupts the science . "
