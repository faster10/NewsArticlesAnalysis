So you ' re stuck with the 1 label . But rather than wax nostalgic for the honorific categories of yesteryear " global elite , " " electronic herd " and " mass affluent " try to remember that " sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you " while waiting calmly for the rhetorical storm to pass . And please don ' t succumb to self pity for suffering the indignity of guilt by association name calling is nothing like stop and frisk , job discrimination or profiling . Toughen up !
