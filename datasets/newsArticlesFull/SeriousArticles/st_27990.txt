The western powers and their allies are right that Al Assad s brutality has served as a rallying cry for Sunni Arabs and helped the extremists cause . But the Russian response also has merit . Their argument is that any vacuum after the fall of Al Assad is likely to be filled by violent chaos ? a situation that could be designed for Daesh to thrive in . Conditions on the ground in Syria and the experiences of Iraq and Libya make this Russian analysis hard to refute . Without really acknowledging it , the US has in any case moved gradually towards the Russian position , dropping its insistence on the immediate departure of Al Assad . The very real threat that both Russia and the western powers face from Daesh may now concentrate minds enough to force them to bridge their remaining differences over the fate of Al Assad .
