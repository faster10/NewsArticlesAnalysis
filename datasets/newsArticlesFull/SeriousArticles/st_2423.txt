Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for some time been alienating his liberal supporters . He seems out of touch . Last year , he characterized abortions and even cesarean sections as " secret plots " to hinder the country ' s growth . In January , Erdogan called on Turkish women to have " at least four or five children " in the name of the country ' s " grandeur " and faster economic growth . He assigned four government ministers to work on population policy and proposals for family expansion .
