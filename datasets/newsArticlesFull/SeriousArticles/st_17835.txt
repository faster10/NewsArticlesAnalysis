John Kasich appeared on Stephen Colbert ' s show ( YouTube has the relevant segment ) , and Colbert forcefully asked a question we ' ve been waiting a long , long time to hear asked of any politician who ever admitted to marijuana use in their past . The question ? " How do you think your life would be different would you be where you are today if you had been caught and arrested for using marijuana back then ? " We ' ve been waiting pretty much ever since Bill Clinton tried his whole " didn ' t inhale " shtick , back in the 1990s , in fact . Kasich absolutely ignored the question , trying to lump marijuana in with heroin , but we certainly applaud Colbert for even asking it .
