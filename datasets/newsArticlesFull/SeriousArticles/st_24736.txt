Hospitals are supposed to take care of the sickest members of our society and uphold the highest standards of patient care . But hospitals are also charged with teaching doctors , and every doctor has a first mistake . The only thing we can do is learn each time one happens , and reduce future errors in the process . Having a consistent gathering to talk about the mistakes goes a long way toward that goal , and just about any institution , public or private , could benefit from a tradition like M and M . It is not enough to stop the practice of defensive medicine , but when doctors are asked by their colleagues to justify the tests they ordered and the procedures they performed , perhaps they will be reminded that more is not always better .
