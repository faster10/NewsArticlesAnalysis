And then there s the dark horse , Senator Ted Cruz . I ? have been tracking his campaign here for some time as well ? and have been impressed with how methodically and strategically he s gone about it . Yesterday , ? Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post ? took note as well . He pointed out that Cruz announced before everyone else and that he made his announcement at Liberty University , showing his social conservative credentials up front and proudly . ( It was an effective announcement , too , although at the time the pundits dismissed him as a joke , which , considering what has since unfolded with Trump and Carson , was actually a joke on them . )
