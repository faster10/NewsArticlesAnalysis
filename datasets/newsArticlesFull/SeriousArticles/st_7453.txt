" There ' s definitely a question of timing and floor time for these kinds of debates , and then there ' s also the political question , " said Gramlich . " You just had a fiscal cliff deal where the House speaker really alienated a lot of the members of his own party , because he was seen as making too many concessions towards the Democrats , and if you ' re talking about an issue as powerful and emotional as gun control , is the speaker really going to meet Democrats halfway on something like that and risk offending his own party even more ? I think that ' s a really important question . "
