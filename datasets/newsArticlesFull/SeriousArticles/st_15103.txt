Anderson : I ' m up for reading into it . I like to hear people reading into it . I tend to try to keep it very abstract from myself . I like to put things and work things in to these stories that feel like symbols to me . But I don ' t really want to know what they symbolize . I ' d rather have someone say , " I got this out of it . " I want to feel like I ' m working with some subconscious stuff that could be stronger because we don ' t simplify it too much . Let it be open to different connections . I ' m sorry I ' m sounding a little cosmic about it . The storm should feel like it ' s about a lot of things . Now I ' m going to try one : It could even have to do with what ' s coming in America or something like that . 1965 is sort of an end to a period . I ' m just trying this out , though . That ' s my first time to have that thought .
