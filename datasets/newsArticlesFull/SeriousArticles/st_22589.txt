Frieden should have known the closest equivalent to the level of personal protective equipment required by Ebola in American hospitals is found in operating rooms , and even that doesn ' t compare . In ORs we ' re mostly concerned about not infecting the patient , and we ' re able to remove garb with little fanfare . Now we ' re learning that doctors and nurses treating Duncan didn ' t wear the recommended protective suits for two days while they suspected Ebola but didn ' t have the diagnosis confirmed . Why wasn ' t the CDC guiding them ?
