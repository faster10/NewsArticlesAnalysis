" Guys like Charone Peake , Artavis Scott , guys who were recruited to come be the guy , in order to go with that rotation , you have to share some reps , and those guys haven ' t batted an eye , " Jeff Scott said . " They ' re the first ones down there to celebrate when the other guy goes in and makes a big play . It speaks a lot for those guys ' attitude and work ethic . We ' ve said every year whenever we ' ve lost guys from time to time , ' Hey , next guy up . ' Really , there ' s not been any concern because of the depth that we ' ve been able to play with . "
