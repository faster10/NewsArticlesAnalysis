It got me thinking , hopefully in the upcoming months we ll be able to talk about our fears and acknowledge that we re all frightened , for our lives , for the ones we love , and even for people we ll never meet . We cannot just bury these fears inside , merely saying we re lucky it does not happen every week as it does in Syria or Iraq ( and a thousand other places ) . Not talking about our fears is exactly how we end up trusting people who promise there s nothing to be afraid of in this life or the next like jihadi recruiters .
