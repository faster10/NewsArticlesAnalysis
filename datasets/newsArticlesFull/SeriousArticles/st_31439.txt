You can play this game for the entire debate . When Cruz went on his anti media rant , it was following a substantive question about his rhetoric and approach : Congressional Republicans , Democrats , and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit , prevent a government shutdown , and calm financial markets that fear of ? another Washington created crisis is on the way . Does your opposition to it show that you re not the kind of problem solver American voters want ? Again , this wasn t unfair . Cruz just didn t want to answer it . The entire night , Republicans trafficked in half truths and falsehoods , from Christie s misleading claim that Social Security was bankrupt ( which came directly after he promised to be honest with the people watching at home ) to Carly Fiorina s invented fact that 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama s first term belonged to women .
