( Save The Children ) Tiny baby Banaz sat sleeping peacefully in her car seat , unaware of the hubbub around her . Her beautiful 2 month old face was the picture of calm . We sat on an old mattress in the heat and spoke with her parents , who had left Syria just one month before . They fled the violence and instability in the province of Hasakah in northern Syria to come to this teeming , garbage strewn spot near the northern Iraqi mountains . Her young father spoke of the day they decided to leave Syria , when the fighting got to be too much . The family of four mother , father , 2 year old Zahraa and 1 month old Banaz left with nothing but what they could carry on the walk to Domiz camp .
