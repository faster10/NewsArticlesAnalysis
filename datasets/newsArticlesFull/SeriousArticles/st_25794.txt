A commentator from South Asia who has tried to understand the psyche and motivations of Pakistan with some success may be utterly unfamiliar with the wider Islamic world , but ISIS will not be unfamiliar because ISIS speaks a radical form of the same language one hears from hyper nationalists . The difference is that Pakistani hyper nationalists are less daring , less bold , more fearful in their interpretation of the doctrine that motivates ISIS . They are limited in thinking to the geographical region that Pakistan occupies on the globe and to the people who inhabit this region . They are concerned with the continuity and success of the state of Pakistan within the Muslim narrative , for they haven t the courage to take upon themselves the responsibility for the larger purpose that they are well aware of , something that Islamist militant organizations have stepped up to do .
