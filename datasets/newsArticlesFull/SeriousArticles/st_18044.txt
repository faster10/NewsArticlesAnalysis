I think , what Mr Trump represents is racialised populism , which is an issue for democracies around the world . . I was recently in France . For me Jean Marie Le Pen and Trump are the same . On economic issues , they are populist . Mr Trump supports social security and medicare , He disagrees with a lot of Republicans who want to undermine these programmes , Le Pen is a big believer in the welfare state . Her populism and his populism are both racialised ? both don t like immigrants , and Muslims . Now , what happened in France ? She is a majority of conservatives , in a multi party parliamentary system , others voted to keep her out of power . Mr Trump may well be the Republican nominee , but may be the moderate Republicans may vote for Hillary . . I don t know . A majority of a minority is not a majority of the country .
