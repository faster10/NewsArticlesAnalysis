West Coast Turf ' s field didn ' t have any special signifier as it grew it was just called Field No . 2 . " We didn ' t want to jinx ourselves , " Marman says . But everybody knew the field might be used for the Super Bowl , so it was treated with more care than many newborns . Workers covered it with a gigantic custom made blanket on cool nights and a series of tarps on rainy days . Too much water is the enemy . It can lead to pythium , a form of root rot that covers a field with brown spots . The warning sign of pythium is mycelium , a white thready vegetation . If you see something that looks like dirty cotton in your grass , you ' re screwed . West Coast Turf got 3 inches of rain the first week of January . Workers obsessively checked the tarps . No dirty cotton .
