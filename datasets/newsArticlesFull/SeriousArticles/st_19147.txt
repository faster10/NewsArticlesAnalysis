All deaths that come about as a result of this conflict are tragic . But who is taking steps to limit casualties ? Israel . Who is apologizing for the loss of life in Gaza ? Israel . Hamas , on the other hand , tries at every opportunity to inflict as much pain as possible on Israel , trying to kill more Israeli civilians by firing rockets at large population centers , by sending suicide bombers across the border and sacrificing the lives of their own children . They make no apologies for their culture of death .
