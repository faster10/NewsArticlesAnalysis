SK : They are looting all the ancient antiquities and precious artifacts from Palmyra , Syria as well as Iraq which obviously has wealth of ancient treasures . Obviously , these are flowing into Turkey , also . And I would suspect that Israel is also involved in this . And certainly , there are people on the black market that are probably paying enormous amounts of money to come into these possessions . And certainly the sale of Christian women for sex slaves has to be bringing in the certain amount of money .
