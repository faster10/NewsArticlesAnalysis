Over the years , many other top players , including Phil Mickelson , have also decided to skip this tournament despite qualifying . Before these PGA Tour pros became stars , if you would have told them they could take a trip to Hawaii , play a great golf course and have to beat only 31 other players to win a million bucks , don ' t you think they ' d take that every single time and twice on Sunday ? Augusta National is sacred ground , and I would never compare the two events , but players who skip an event like the Tournament of Champions need to change their mindset . There is no excuse for skipping it if you win on the Tour , this has to be your first tournament of the calendar year . If for no other reason , you have the opportunity to earn FedEx Cup points and pocket a guaranteed paycheck regardless of finish .
