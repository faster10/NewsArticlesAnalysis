The fact that this new Bowie belonged to everyone complicated my relationship to his body of work but didn t diminish it . Yeah . It s cool , I d say . But I m really into his older stuff . When the Serious Moonlight Tour rolled through Dallas s Reunion Arena , my girlfriend s big sister got us tickets . Our seats were in the lower bowl , directly stage left . We watched the show through the rigging , looking at the band in profile . I thrilled with anticipation as each song drew to a close . I imagined him constructing the setlist , testing the audience with new album tracks and deep cuts , rewarding the audience with old favorites and the hits that currently owned the airwaves . I clearly saw what he was doing that night as a job , with logistics and strategies and responsibilities .
