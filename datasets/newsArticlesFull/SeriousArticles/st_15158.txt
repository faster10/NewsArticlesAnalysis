Don t get me wrong . The North Koreans may know a lot about the outside world , but they don t know everything , even about the US , their main adversary . In one meeting , an official asked , Why do the president and secretary of state keep saying that the United States will not allow North Korea to have nuclear weapons when in fact you are not doing much to stop us ? He deduced that there must be a hidden agenda . It s because you want us to have nuclear weapons as an excuse to tighten your grip on South Korea and Japan , your two allies . We responded that there was no hidden agenda and that the United States really did not want the North to have those weapons . I m not sure we convinced him .
