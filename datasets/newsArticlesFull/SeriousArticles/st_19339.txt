At least on that point , Trump is consistent , having previously announced that nothing beats the Bible , not even The Art of the Deal . But otherwise , in a smattering of interviews , he has spoken of religion in a dismissive way : I m a Sunday church person , and When I go to church and drink my little wine . . . and have my little cracker . All in all , he evinces little use for the Lord and all His heavenly bounty . Worldly things are good enough for him ( and rightly so : there are no others ) . Even when orating in the Falwell family s fiefdom , he could not make himself pay more than lip service to God . Which is a good thing .
