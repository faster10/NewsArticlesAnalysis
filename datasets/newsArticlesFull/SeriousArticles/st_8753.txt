Well , no on a technicality . The Patriots might have made their way to 9 0 on Sunday , but they lost another offensive weapon when Edelman left the game with a foot injury and did not return . Edelman was diagnosed with a Jones fracture , similar to the injury suffered by Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant against these same Giants in the season opener . Bryant received a bone graft for the injury , and despite suggestions that a four to six week return timetable was " impossible , " Bryant indeed missed just six weeks before returning against the Seahawks in Week 8 . A similar time frame would get Edelman back for the Week 17 regular season finale against the Dolphins .
