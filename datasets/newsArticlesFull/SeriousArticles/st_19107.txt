Ken Kratz told People that there were phone logs that proved that Steven targeted Halbach , that while in prison Steven told fellow inmates of his plans to torture women , and that evidence of Steven s sweat was found in the hood of Halbach s car , among other things we didn t see in the series . Other accounts have brought up a pair of Brendan s pants that were bleached and the bullet that was found in the garage . Whether these things can be explained away as further manipulation or represent proof of Avery s guilt is probably still a matter of opinion .
