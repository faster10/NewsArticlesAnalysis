There is more than a thematic connection between Santorum and the age of Buchanan . Santorum ' s campaign manager is Mike Biundo , who worked for Buchanan in 1996 . His statewide staff is peppered with former Buchananites ( Jim Finnegan and Ted Maravelias of New Hampshire , Michael Phillips and Craig R Bachler of Florida ) , and his list of endorsements is a roll call of ' 90s Christian conservatives : Gary Bauer , James Dobson , Phyllis Schlafly and Richard Viguerie . Just to complete the picture , Mitt Romney touted an endorsement from Buchanan ' s old rival Bob Dole .
