Scientist stand beside a new carbon capture test unit at Longanet power station on May 29 , 2009 in Longanet , Scotland . The new technology being tested at the coal fired power station removes carbon dioxide using chemicals and turns it into a liquid which is stored underground . The most direct way to curb emissions of carbon dioxide , if not necessarily the simplest or least expensive , is to catch it before it enters the atmosphere . That process , called carbon capture and storage , traps the carbon produced by combustion of fossil fuels and then stores it , often in deep geologic formations . The primary targets for CCS are large , stationary sources , chiefly coal and natural gas fired power plants , as well as industrial facilities including refineries , cement plants and petrochemical facilities .
