Sanders is the wrong choice for Democrats and the nation at this time . His stump speech , much of which he repeated in the debate , doesn ' t tell the whole truth to the American public or his supporters . Waving your hands and yelling doesn ' t make what you say any more feasible . He is still the politician who made a deal with the NRA to win his seat . As a member of Congress for twenty five years he knows perfectly well the chance of having his proposals come to fruition at this time is zero . Only in an alternate reality would congress pass legislation to raise everyone ' s taxes which he calls for to make college free for all and pass a national single payer healthcare system .
