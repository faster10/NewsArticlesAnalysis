American audiences have never been particularly receptive to political comedies . " Team America : World Police " ( 2004 ) has found a huge cult following , but it earned just 32 . 8 million in its theatrical run . " American Dreamz " ( 2006 ) gave the " American Idol " format a political spin , but it topped off at 7 . 2 million . Political tales " Man of the Year " ( 2006 ) and " Swing Vote " ( 2008 , an election year ) , grossed only 37 . 3 million and 16 . 3 million , respectively . The highest grossing political comedy in recent memory is actually Sacha Baron Cohen ' s " The Dictator , " which was widely perceived as a misfire when it earned 59 . 7 million against a rumored 100 plus million budget and massive advertising campaign .
