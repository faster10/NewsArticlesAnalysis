As five point home dogs versus Seattle , the Vikings ' team total is just barely above 17 points . . . . Those who lean heavily on first matchup data to make DFS lineup decisions will shy away from Adrian Peterson , who managed 18 yards on eight carries when these teams met in Week 13 . Seattle ' s defense held Minnesota ' s running game as a whole to 31 scoreless yards . This is a Vikings offense that finished 2015 fourth in rushing yards per game ( 138 . 2 ) . The strongest pro Peterson argument is that he easily has the highest carry projection on an ugly running back slate and therefore may be worth paying up for just to secure that workload . The anti Peterson arguments are more numerous . My guess is most DFS players will aim for lower priced backs and pay up for three elite receivers , or two elite receivers plus Jordan Reed . . . . If you ' d prefer to go all in on the Vikings falling behind and thus fade Peterson , give explosive change up back Jerick McKinnon a look . Minnesota began lining up McKinnon at wide receiver in the final three games and he responded with 231 total yards and three touchdowns during that stretch . . . . Teddy Bridgewater ' s play has picked up in recent weeks , but he finished the Week 13 game with a 4 . 2 yards per attempt average and dead last in weekly quarterback scoring against Seattle . I suppose there is some possibility the Vikings change up their approach this week and attack the Seahawks with a quick passing game , in an attempt to catch Pete Carroll ' s defense by surprise . Ultimately , that would indeed be a surprise . The Vikings have been devoutly run committed all season and probably dreamt this week about a game script that allowed them to feed Peterson 25 plus carries . I can ' t get behind Bridgewater as a DFS option , even in tournaments .
