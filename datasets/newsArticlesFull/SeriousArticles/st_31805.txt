So , in principle , I agree with every bit of that . All of it . I also agree with the heart and sentiment from which that opinion comes . I agree with the specific ideas that African Americans in the film industry don ' t " need " the Oscars . Indeed , African Americans also already have a slew of respected awards shows to acknowledge accomplishments in the arts . Those awards were created , in part , as a response to this very familiar problem . And , yes , I agree , as would every actor and director in the world , that issues around entertainment aren ' t the number one issue facing black America or anybody at all for that matter .
