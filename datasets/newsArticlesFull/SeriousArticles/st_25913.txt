" Sometimes you ' re just happy playing . Some media , unfortunately , don ' t understand that it ' s okay just to play tennis and enjoy it . They always think that you have to win everything , it always needs to be a success story , and if it ' s not , obviously , what is the point ? Maybe you have to go back and think , ' Why have I started playing tennis ? ' Because I just like it . It ' s actually sort of a dream hobby that became somewhat of a job . Some people just don ' t get that , ever . "
