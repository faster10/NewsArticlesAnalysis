The prediction : I have no idea how Florida ' s offense is going to score touchdowns against Alabama , and given the state of the Gators ' field goal kicking , I ' m not sure there are any sure fire scoring opportunities outside of defense or special teams . Now , will Derrick Henry be a little gassed after 46 carries against Auburn ? Maybe . Will Jalen Tabor or Vernon Hargreaves III force a turnover against Jake Coker ? Sure ! But even with those scenarios , I still see Alabama winning this game by three touchdowns . Alabama 31 , Florida 10
