The Republican presidential candidates don ' t seem to realize it , but they ' re in the process of seriously undermining their own " tough guy " brand . Republicans have always seen themselves as " the Daddy party " ( as opposed to Democrats ' " Mommy party , " of course ) , which has always meant no nonsense toughness in the face of any opposition to their agenda . But how can American voters square this with the collective hissy fit the GOP candidates are now throwing over debate moderators ? To put it the most obvious way , why should any voter believe that any of these folks will be able to get tough with ( for example ) Vladimir Putin , when they can ' t even handle snarky questions from journalists ? Republicans seem to have now embraced what was ( ironically ) a major political problem for Jeb Bush ' s father the wimp factor .
