French officials had linked Abaaoud to Mehdi Nemmouche , the French man who shot up the Brussels Jewish Center in May last year , killing four people . He was also implicated in the foiled attack this past August on the high speed train that links Brussels and Paris , which was thwarted when three American holidaymakers wrestled an armed gunman to the ground . Police sources have also told French journalists that a jihadist they arrested over the summer had mentioned Abaaoud to interrogators , and suggested that there were plans to attack nightclubs in Paris .
