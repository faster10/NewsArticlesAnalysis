I am a professor of economics and I do not discourage people from taking higher education courses , but there are so many opportunities to do that over time . I met , for example , in Germany , a sales person in a steel mill . Before he went to college , he went through a three year apprenticeship at the steel mill in sales management . When we went to college , college was a lot easier . He had all that background . He was probably more mature then . He could recognize which things were going to be helpful to him .
