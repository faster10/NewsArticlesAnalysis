The much prized Persian carpet is weaved out of a fusion of China ' s silk and Iran ' s sophisticated techniques . And the exquisite blue and white porcelain is produced thanks to a mixture of Iran ' s " smaltum " ( a type of material containing cobalt , unique to Iran ) and China ' s advanced skills . Via Iran , China ' s lacquerware , pottery , as well as papermaking , metallurgical , printing and gunpowder making skills were spread to the west end of Asia , and further on to Europe . And from Iran and Europe , pomegranate , grape , olive , as well as glass , gold and silver ware were introduced into China .
