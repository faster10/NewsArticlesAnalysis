" There ' s a reason their head coach and quarterback have been there for as long as they have , because they ' ve both been outstanding at their respective jobs , " Manning said . " You have to give a lot of credit . When the season schedule comes out and you know you ' re going to play against them in the regular season , every time after that final second ticks off , you have good feelings you probably will see them again if you do your job and get to the playoffs . That ' s been the case certainly a number of times for me . "
