Generally speaking , December is way too early for dramatic declarations , but here goes : The 2015 ? 16 Warriors might be the best NBA team of all time , in addition to the most familial . Golden State opened 24 ? 0 , the longest undefeated start in the history of professional sports , and the Warriors did not lose until last Saturday in Milwaukee ? on the final night of a seven game road trip and the second night of a brutal back to back , following a double overtime victory in Boston . Still , the Warriors are pulverizing opponents with a point differential ( 13 . 1 ) larger than that of the 1971 ? 72 ? Lakers , than the ' 95 ? 96 ? Bulls , than the ' 85 ? 86 ? Celtics , than . . . anybody . The Warriors won the championship last season , going 83 ? 20 , and they are making that version of themselves look like chumps . Point guard ? Steph ? Curry captured the MVP with four times as many first place votes as anyone else , and he apparently wasn ' t even loose yet . Curry , now leading the league with 32 . 3 points per game and turning 35 ? footers into ? layups , might as well collect the trophy on Christmas Day .
