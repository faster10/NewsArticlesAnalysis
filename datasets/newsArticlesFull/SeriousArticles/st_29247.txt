As for whether the LA chapter will do business again with Sterling ? President Leon Jenkins says yes . " At some point when there has been proof , I think that would be a legitimate time for the NAACP to sit down with Sterling and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future . God teaches us to forgive . And the way I look at it , after a sustained period of just proof to the African American community that those words don ' t really reflect his heart , I think there ' s room for forgiveness . "
