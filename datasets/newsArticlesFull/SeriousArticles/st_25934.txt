There ' s still a lot of football left to be played , of course . After 10 games last year , the Panthers were 3 6 1 , and there was serious talk that Carolina should have considered shutting down a clearly battered Newton for the remainder of what was clearly a lost season . ( I know , because I was one of the people doing the talking . ) The Panthers then lost their next two games . . . and haven ' t lost a regular season game since . That ' s a remarkable 14 straight . Maybe Newton will run the table and dab deep into January . Maybe Watt will actually consume a quarterback whole . Or maybe Brady will overcome the injuries and take home a third trophy . I think Brady is currently the deserved favorite , but with six weeks to go , there ' s an awful lot left in this race .
