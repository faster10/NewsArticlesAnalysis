I am no stranger to death threats and hate . And so I understand what they are going through . After 9 11 , three men threatened my life , one even threatening to murder my children . My daughter , then a freshman in college , received a death threat on the phone in her dorm room . I recall that what bothered me most during this frightening period was that like the rest of my fellow Americans , I was angry at the murderers who abused the hospitality of my country to kill my countrymen . And I too was mourning at the loss of life and the unspeakable sadness of so many whose loved ones had been taken from them . What the hate crimes did was to deny me and my family our mourning and our shared sense of grief , as Americans , because we were forced to look over our shoulders in fear of those whose misdirected hate had targeted us .
