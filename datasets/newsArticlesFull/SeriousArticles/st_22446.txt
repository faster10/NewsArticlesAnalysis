This would be a great hire for the Niners . Shanahan got a raw deal in DC . He had Griffin forced down his throat , and even when he publicly stated that Griffin was years away from being a competent pro quarterback , able to operate within a pro system , the ownership made him play Griffin . He correctly stated that Cousins was the right quarterback for the Skins , and never backed away from that . The guy is smart , a great game planner , and will bring in a very quality coaching staff . Just do not let him have anything to do with the personnel side of things .
