ISIS is an expression and symptom of the political disenfranchisement and humiliation that many Sunnis , in particular Sunni Arabs , feel in today s world . Such feelings arise from a complex set of factors . Among these , certainly , is Western intervention , such as the U . S . invasion of Iraq and its devastating effects on Iraqi society . But perhaps more important has been the decades long brutalisation of , and the provision of a poor education for , Arab populations by their own governments , who also have not delivered on promises of economic development . In addition , though more difficult to describe and apprehend , is a civilisational sense by the Arabs ( and Muslims ) of having been bypassed by history and left behind while other peoples advance and enjoy the fruits of progress . Addressing such grievances and structural problems cannot be done militarily . The answer must involve finding political solutions for the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts , and engaging in cultural and educational efforts to defeat ISIS s ideology that sanctifies violence as the only means for Sunni empowerment and glory . This is not something Western governments are equipped to do or capable of accomplishing . It is an effort that must emerge from within the Arab and Muslim communities . Thankfully , there are increasingly important voices , even in places like Saudi Arabia , that are courageously speaking up against the ideology of jihadism and its cul de sac promises . Until such persons prevail , and this won t happen anytime soon , we must remain vigilant and expect the persistence in our lives of this violent feature of global politics .
