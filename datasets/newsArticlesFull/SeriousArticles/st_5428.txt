The Turkish political system is a party list , proportional representation system . Leaders have absolute authority over their parties . They pick the candidates and determine the nature of the parliament . The members of the parliament are selected from 85 electoral districts that elect different numbers of MPs depending on the size of their population . In south eastern cities , the Kurdish HDP dominates the polls . But each party has to get over the national 10 per cent threshold to be elected . For this reason they need to win votes from across the country . If they fail , their seats will be lost to other parties . This would benefit the governing AK Party , as it is in second place in many Kurdish cities . In 2002 the AK Party won 34 . 28 of the vote but this gave them nearly 2 3 of the seats .
