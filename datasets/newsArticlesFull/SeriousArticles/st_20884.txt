One of the most vivid memories of the trip was a visit to an acting school where young Iranians learned the very idiosyncratic style of acting for the Iranian screen . Men and woman shouldn ' t touch each other in suggestive ways , like hugging or dancing cheek to cheek , and of course onscreen kissing is strictly forbidden . There hasn ' t been a filmed kiss in Iran since the Revolution . But the actors in this acting class were incredibly expressive , huffing , puffing , crying on cue and expressing pain and love and happiness through the cracks in the code . Watching them , I felt like I was like watching silent film actors of a hundred years ago .
