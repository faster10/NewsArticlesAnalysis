All season long , kicker Stephen Gostkowski has not missed a single field goal his biggest one was the 54 yard game winning kick he made with : 01 seconds left in the game . The punting game was fair , with Ryan Allen getting only one of his four punts inside the Giants 20 yard line , and Giants punt returner Dwayne Harris ? averaging 10 yards per return . ? Amendola had a shining moment when he returned a punt 82 yards for what looked like a sure touchdown until he was inexplicably tripped by his teammate ? Duron Harmon at the Giants 7 yard line . Fortunately , New England got the touchdown on that drive , anyway .
