If that doesn t put you in mind of Trump s success in the Republican debates , how about the viral sensation of Mr Farage describing Herman von Rompuy as having the charisma of a damp rag , and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk ? Cigarette smoking , beer swilling , tweed wearing ? Nige is as much a parody of Englishness as Trump is of Americaness . And in the same way that even the most Left wing of commentators ( which is nearly all of them ) now concede that Farage speaks for an alienated minority , so someday it shall be grudgingly said that Donald Trump had a point ? about immigration , terrorism and the fear that America is punching way below its weight .
