There is no single practical solution to the radiation problem . One strategy I helped develop was to optimise the internal layout of the equipment and structures in the Mars habitat module to minimise exposure placing existing bulk in all the right places . This reduced exposure by about 20 , without adding any mass . Even taking empty sandbags , packing them with Martian soil and putting them on the roof would be a simple and effective measure on Mars . Radiation is an issue to tackle , but it ' s not a deal breaker .
