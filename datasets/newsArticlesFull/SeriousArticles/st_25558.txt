In the spirit of building a world with more partners and fewer enemies , I ' ll be traveling to Hong Kong this December for the first meeting of CGI outside of New York . This meeting will include leaders and issues of importance in Asia , an increasingly important part of the 21st century world . Asian leaders have a large and growing capacity to shape our economy , climate , health and security , and I ' m honored that Lee Kuan Yew and other leaders already have confirmed their participation .
