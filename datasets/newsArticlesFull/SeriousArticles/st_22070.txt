Ross Klein , a Newfoundland professor , has written four books on the cruise industry and maintains a database online . At the congressional hearings in March , he told the Senate committee there were more than a dozen incidents of passenger ships sinking and 99 ships running aground between 1973 and 2011 . Klein also testified that 79 ships experienced fires between 1990 and 2011 . Even so , given the rapid expansion of the industry , the number of fatalities has been low . And cruising remains popular . The industry is now worth 25 billion a year . Most of its customers are Americans , with 13 million U . S . bookings in 2011 . The industry also is tapping into new markets , especially in Asia .
