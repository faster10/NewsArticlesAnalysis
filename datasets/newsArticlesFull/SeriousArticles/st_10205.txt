Dr Guenther Hasinger , the recently appointed Director of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii , began his career working on the ROSAT project . His planning kept the satellite working long after two gyros failed early in the mission , and he developed as a scientist using ROSAT to make very deep pictures of the X ray sky , so he found the satellite ' s demise an especially poignant moment . " We recently moved to Hawaii from Germany , " he said , " and while unpacking the family ' s shipping container " he found his miniature ROSAT model . It now sits on his desk at the Institute , next to a piece of the spare detector housing . " I definitely felt an emotional attachment to this project , " he admitted .
