This is the key nightmare driving most denialist positions . They also , ( privately of course ) recognise that AGW can t be adequately addressed within the neoliberal capitalist framework , ( all the atomistic vested interests wouldn t allow it ) , so that massive state intervention is the only workable response ? hence their nightmares over government intervention , and the exaggerated scare campaigns about central control , loss of freedoms ( mainly the freedom to f k ? up the planet ) , conflating political variables with the scientific findings , claims of left wing conspiracies , and such like desperations .
