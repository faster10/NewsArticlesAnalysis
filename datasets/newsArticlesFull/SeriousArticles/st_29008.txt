Similarly , the U . S . and Russia should , at a minimum , coordinate their actions in Syria . Rather than merely staying out of each other ' s way in the air , they should synchronize their air campaign planning so as to ensure they both hit the maximum number of targets in the most efficient and timely manner . It would be too much to imagine the two nations sharing intelligence on Syria at this juncture , but if they were smart , that is exactly what they will end up doing . The two nations joined forces to defeat the Nazis when neither liked each other very much . Why can they not do so now ?
