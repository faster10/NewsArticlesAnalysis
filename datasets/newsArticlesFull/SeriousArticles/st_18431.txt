The Sooners ( 12 0 ) were undefeated and an overwhelming No . 1 heading into the Orange Bowl . They were matched against No . 3 Florida State ( 11 1 ) in the BCS title game , a controversial choice since No . 2 Miami had beaten the Seminoles , and each team finished the regular season with a loss . Nonetheless , Florida State was an 11 point favorite with a high scoring offense led by Heisman winner Chris Weinke , not to mention a decided home field playing in South Florida . OU ' s defense rose to the occasion , and the Sooners led 6 0 entering the fourth on their way to a fifth AP national title .
