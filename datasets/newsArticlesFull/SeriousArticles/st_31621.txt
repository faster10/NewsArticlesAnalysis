Mike Williams played early , not often , and Scott Chandler made a cameo appearance , but this was about Rob Gronkowski . Denver bottled him up for 31 ? 2 quarters by being physical at the line of scrimmage or by double and triple covering him so Tom Brady couldn t get him the ball quickly . He finally exploded at the expense of backup safeties , getting 77 of his 144 yards on the final two drives . Life would not have been so easy if T . J . Ward and Darian Stewart stayed in the game . Still , Gronkowski made a circus catch over the shoulder when he ran by Chris Harris and Josh Bush , the latter forgetting he had deep responsibility . Gronk couldn t handle one fourth down throw in the end zone in heavy traffic , in part because cornerback Aqib Talib held his jersey and in part because the throw was high . In those jump ball situations , it s every man for himself . Gronk knows that , even though he complained . Later , he scored the final touchdown on a leaping catch in the back of the end zone between Harris and backup safety Shiloh Keo by pushing Harris out of the way . No call is the right call on those plays .
