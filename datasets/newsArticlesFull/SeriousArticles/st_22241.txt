A woman in Ohio recently wrote us about her struggles in finding the time and the money to take care of her health . Billie wrote , " I am 33 years old and without Planned Parenthood I would have never found out in time that I ' m a woman with precancerous cells in my uterus and cervix . I cannot afford to pay for my health care , and by them having a sliding scale I could afford it or else otherwise I may have died from cervical cancer . I wouldn ' t have found out about it in time . . . . ( Now ) I can see my children grow up . "
