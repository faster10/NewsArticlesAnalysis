If you watched ( Russell ) work out , if you heard what our scouts said about him and what they said about Okafor and other players , it got to the point where we could not pass on him . He ' s that special in a lot of people ' s books And I think we might have made the right move with D ' Angelo Russell . I think he might be something special . And if he is , then that ' s what I ' m talking about . Somebody special is going to want to play with someone special , and then the dominoes fall . So yeah , I ' m extremely confident .
