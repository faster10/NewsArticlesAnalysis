It s the Muslim community as a whole which Pope Francis is intent on meeting . It s clear that everyone is focused on this particular part of the Holy Father s visit to Bangui . It will provide the opportunity to reiterate loud and clear the Catholic Church s respect for Muslims and of our commitment to interreligious dialogue . At the same time his meeting with the Muslim community will serve to show the rest of the population here in the CAR that a them and us situation cannot be tolerated . The different communities can and must live and work together , as they always did it s better this way , much better . It will be a very important sign for all Central Africans to see the Pope going to the heart of the Muslim district .
