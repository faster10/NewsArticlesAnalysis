It may be more disturbing to learn that kids can be poisoned by the pills , powders , and supplements that parents use to keep them healthy . Unlike blood pressure medication and pacemakers , the FDA has no authority to review supplements for safety and efficacy . Unsurprisingly , a 2003 study of 95 commercial dietary supplements , purchased from D . C . area stores , found that 11 contained enough lead to be hazardous to children and pregnant women . The offending supplements contained bee pollen , spirulina , and shark cartilage , but the worst offender contained something called pseudo ginseng root which had 81 times the tolerable lead intake for a child . FDA scientists found similar results in 1993 and 2004 analyses .
