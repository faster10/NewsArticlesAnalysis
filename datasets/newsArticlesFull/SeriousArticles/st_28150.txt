" I sat at home over and over again trying to call Mary Pat and not finding her . And as it got near the time to pick up my children at school our children at school , I started to think about these things . If I don ' t hear from her , what am I going to tell the kids when they ask about mom ? Because so many of the children at their school had parents that worked in lower Manhattan , that the school called us and told us they had informed them of the attack . So they were going to ask about their mom as soon as they got to the car . So I started to think about what kind of life was I going to have without my best friend ? And what kind of single father was I going to be to three young children ? Those thoughts replicated over and over and over again , tens of thousands of times where I live . . .
