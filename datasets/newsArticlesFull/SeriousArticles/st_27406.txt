Not that he doesn t care about basketball . Kobe doesn t care about anything beyond basketball . He wanted to be great on the court . That s it . That s all . He didn t want to be anyone s friend . He didn t care if his team mates loved him . He didn t want to be the friendly face of a global brand . He was a single minded basketball assassin . A stone cold killer who believed he was the best and wanted to drain shots in every opponents face until they were humiliated and forced to admit they were , indeed , pathetic in comparison . If that made him an asshole , fine . Nice guys finish last and all that .
