We scoped for dudes to crush on like Mitch ( Wiley Wiggins ) or Pickford ( Shawn Andrews ) . The movie struck a nerve with us we were caught in the jaded whirlwind of 90s grunge , la Nirvana . The kids of Lee High elicited a magical nostalgia of what it must have been like to be a teen in the 70s , when times were simpler and we could have made bongs in shop class and gone to KISS concerts . I thought my love for the film may have been a " high school thing , " but when I caught it on TV this past weekend , it was just as magical as ever . In fact , it was even better .
