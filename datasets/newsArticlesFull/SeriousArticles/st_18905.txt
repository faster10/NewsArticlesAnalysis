What is the purpose of sport ? Sport is an artificial world . The rules of a game , the distances we run , the criteria for inclusion are all made up , and we change them regularly . We can either have pitchers in professional baseball bat , as in the National League , or have a designated hitter as in the American League . Neither is " right , " no matter how passionately some feel about it . Sports work through convention . The great symbolic power of the Olympics is that we all agree on the same rules and then abide by them .
