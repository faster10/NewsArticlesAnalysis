It s likely that a goal of the attacks was to discourage those involved in the war against ISIS from continuing to work with the U . S . in waging war against it in Iraq and Syria . The French joined the U . S . led bombing campaign in September and are the second largest contributor to the U . S . led air campaign . And while the Russians and Hezbollah , the Lebanese terrorist group , have been more concerned with attacking the moderate opposition to Bashar al Assad in Syria , they , too , have also taken action against the terrorist group . The Paris attacks are likely to provoke both the U . S . and its European , Russian , and Middle East partners to intensify the current form of military action against ISIS and work to settle the Syrian conflict so that all parties can focus on ISIS .
