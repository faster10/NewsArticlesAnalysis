Mike Tanier , Bleacher Report : " That sense of fun is what the Cam bashers loathe , of course : the dabbing , the jumping jacks , the goofy grin . Self styled football purists hate that stuff . But the Super Bowl and the two weeks of hype that lead up to it are not for football purists . The Super Bowl is for casual fans , young fans , new fans and pop culture observers who wander in to see the spectacle . Newton ' s fashion sense , gift for unusual gab and actual willingness to express joy are going to be catnip to the entertainment press and world media that descend on the NFL in the next two weeks . Those qualities will also open some windows and let in a little light for those of us who eat and breathe the NFL and have grown weary of the predictable , approved non personality quarterback personality . Newton ' s act would be tiresome if he hadn ' t proven so emphatically that he has earned this spotlight . Newton threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more against the Cardinals on Sunday . He threw just one interception against a turnover happy defense . In the playoffs , he has completed 70 percent of his passes , thrown for 496 yards and rushed for 50 more against a pair of opponents that were darling Super Bowl choices , largely because a big segment of the football watching public kept waiting ? and sometimes wishing ? for Newton to screw up .
