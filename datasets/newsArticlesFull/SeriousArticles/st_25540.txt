A : It ' s a term that ' s very hard to nail down , which makes it very useful for the people who throw it around . I think a fair , extremely rough definition of the establishment is office holders especially high office holders consultants who ' ve been around a long time , lobbyists and donors . But even that definition that ' s somewhat legitimate is highly simplistic because you have all sorts of fissures among all of those people . It ' s really a slippery term . Our role is to try to represent the conscience of conservatism . At times we ' re hell on the establishment at other times , we defend it when we think it ' s being attacked unfairly .
