Director Huston had barely begun his career in Hollywood when he joined the Army and started making documentaries , intended to keep the home front informed on how their taxes were being spent during World War II . At the time , Huston ' s work was censored by the government for being too raw , but when the movies were finally restored and released decades later , critics hailed them for their unusual frankness about the courage of soldiers and the ramifications of violence . Olive ' s Blu ray set collects four of those docs ? including the title film , about shell shocked veterans talking through their problems in therapy . These are terrific films , which laid the groundwork for the hard bitten skepticism of later Huston classics like " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre " and " The Asphalt Jungle . "
