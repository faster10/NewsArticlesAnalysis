Take " TheBus . " TheBus yes , it ' s actually called TheBus is Oahu ' s public transportation system , and it has stops throughout the island . One way fares for adults are 2 . 50 and 1 . 25 for kids . ( You can also get a four day pass for 25 . 00 and a monthly pass for 60 . 00 ) . TheBus is a great way to get around Oahu without busting the piggy bank on a rental car . Plus , because it ' s the driver ' s responsibility to worry about traffic , all tourists have to do is soak in the sights .
