The open field tackle : With a little less than 3 minutes left in the first half , the Packers seemed headed for a touchdown , even after a questionable offensive pass interference penalty against James Jones pushed them back 10 yards . On third and goal from the Bears 15 , offensive coordinator Tom Clements dialed up a well designed screen pass to James Starks . And when Starks caught Rodgers dump off just behind the line of scrimmage , he seemed to have a convoy leading him to the end zone . From safety Chris Prosinski s vantage point , there was 636 pounds of steamrolling equipment coming right at him with offensive linemen T . J . Lang and Josh Sitton ahead of Starks . Yet Prosinski made an instinctive and agile move to dodge Lang and tackled Starks at the 5 . The Packers settled for a 22 yard field goal and held a 10 7 lead instead of a 14 7 advantage . It was another of those little things that add to big results for a gritty Bears defense .
