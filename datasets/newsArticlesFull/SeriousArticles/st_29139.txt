Frozen beauty : Francesco Riccardo Iacomino submitted his photo Dreamscape , showing the pinks of a perfect summer sky in Iceland reflected in the stillness of the Jokulsarlon Glacer Lagoon . He said : ' It was a typical cloudy day in the Icelandic summer . The day was not hoping for a nice sunset , but I still decided to go on the spot , hoping to finally see the sun once the same had left behind the clouds . When the sun went down , in fact the sky burned out in an incredible vanilla tone . The scene was so peaceful and placid , so I decided to capture it with a long exposure , to bring out the amazing sense of peace that this amazing sunset created . It has been like living in a dream . '
