Democrats no longer know how to make a case let alone on issues as complex and tender as these . They once exposed illegal military and intelligence operations . No more . Republicans have issued seven reports on Benghazi Democrats not one on the lies that lured us into Iraq . The Center for Public Integrity found 260 false statements made by Bush in the ramp up to war . He told Congress our intelligence sources told him Saddam tried to buy aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . Our intelligence sources said no such thing and our nuclear weapons experts said the opposite . His claim was thus a lie . Pardon him if you like , but establish the record , and with it the principle that henceforth , lies of such magnitude and consequence will be deemed impeachable offenses .
