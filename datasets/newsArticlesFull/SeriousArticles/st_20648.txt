The Thunder were once in the very position the Jazz are now ? a young , team that many view as being on the cusp of contention . It came to fruition for them with a Finals trip and three appearances in the Western Conference Finals , but there are countless other young teams that have been declared future contenders and never made it . I m on record as a bit of a Jazz skeptic for this particular season , but I think Snyder is taking the right approach here if he wants to get his team to buy in and build something sustainable . ?
