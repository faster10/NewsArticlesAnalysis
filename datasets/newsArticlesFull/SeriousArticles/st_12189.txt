There may or may not be any oil and water in the car , despite me repeatedly telling him to make sure it was maintained , I believe he thought this meant sitting in it on the driveway listening to his music whilst having a smoke , he would have washed it occasionally , but said ' not really worth it now is it dad ' , as it ' s got a big dent on it ! ! ! And anyway , surely I would know if it needed oil , the red light would come on ! ! Still he does have a brand new set of mats in the boot , bought when he first had the car .
