The establishment is more fearsome when it s a talk radio and Trumpbart bogeyman than it is in practice . The party doesn t pick the candidate , contrary to popular myth . The party is legally and politically bound not to put their finger on the scale in the primary . It has to be won . Trump is splitting off the Troll Party faction from the GOP , but at the end of the day , the process of a shock like this will bring about political equilibrium . It s under appreciated that what folks wanted from RNC chairman Reince Preibus when they elected him was for him to be an honest broker , and he has been . The Party will survive . What s the alternative ? A constellation of venal , kleptocratic scamPACs conning granny of her 10 and keeping 9 it for consulting ?
