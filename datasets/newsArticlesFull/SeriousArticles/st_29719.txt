This is not really a pick against the Panthers , who are legit . But I feel this is a coin flip game ? if the NFL had a playoff series , this would go seven games . So I ' ll take the points and the Cardinals and hope the coin lands on their side this Sunday night . It wouldn ' t surprise me if the Panthers got their running game going and Carolina ' s defensive front affected Arizona ' s offense . It also wouldn ' t surprise me if the Cardinals ' pressure defense created some big plays and their offense hit some of the vertical passes they like .
