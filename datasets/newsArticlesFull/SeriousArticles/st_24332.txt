Wait , who am I kidding ? The most popular stop in Super Bowl City will obviously be the Bud Light beer booth . Really , the whole point of Super Bowl City is to promote the brand names of the companies attached to each pavilion or tent or booth or whatever . It ' s basically a larger than life commercial break of any NFL game . To some , this is a travesty . To me , it ' s just the NFL following through on its two mottos : One , anything worth doing is worth overdoing . And two , any idea that makes more money off the Super Bowl is a good idea .
