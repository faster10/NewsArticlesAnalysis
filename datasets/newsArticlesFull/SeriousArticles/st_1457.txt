Using a max protection against a four man rush can be perilous because it leaves seven defenders guarding the remaining three eligible receivers . ( These seven on three advantages are what the Giants used to capitalize on with their NASCAR pass rush . ) In the Broncos case , it s extra valuable because they play so much man coverage . Ask yourself : When the Panthers go max protection , what happens with the man defenders who are assigned to the No . 2 tight end and running back ? In Denver s scheme , this is generally linebackers Danny Trevathan and Brandon Marshall . If the tight end and back stay in as blockers , Trevathan and Marshall , instead of just standing and watching , could blitz . ( In football parlance , this is known as a green dog blitz ? the Broncos do it often . ) Or when the tight end and back block , Trevathan and Marshall could spy Newton , eliminating the quarterback s scrambles . That would force Newton to stay in the pocket that Ware and Miller are collapsing . Newton would surely have to hold the ball here because not only would there be two linebackers eyeing him underneath , but there d also be two safeties playing over the top . That s in addition to three superb corners ? Chris Harris , Aqib Talib and Bradley Roby ? shadowing the wide receivers .
