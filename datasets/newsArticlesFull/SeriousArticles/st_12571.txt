Since so much of US campaign politics revolves around symbols , rather than policy , there is a clash over what images and ideas Republicans should embrace today . This leaves ? Midwestern and Southern white Republican voters feeling embattled , and hence , more defiant towards the looming demographic and political changes . The resulting power vacuum has been seen in the inability for the Republicans to field serious candidates that appeal both to the base and to the wider masses . The Republican power vacuum can be seen even in Congress , where House ? speaker John Boehner , frustrated in his efforts to bridge the wishes of the defiant Republicans ( government shutdowns , Benghazi probes ) with more moderate reps , found there was no immediate successor willing to jump into his place . With ? uncertainty about the future direction for the Republican Party , an internal civil war broke out ? and the more extreme voices seem to be winning .
