Miller : Lyrically , I worked through a lot of the stuff that was f king my head up on " Reign of Terror " and it helped me grow . This is borderline corny , but it was really therapeutic . It was like one long therapy session for me , just sort of working out some things . " Hysteria , " the Def Leppard record , had a really strong grip on me . I love the songs , but especially the production as well . What Mutt Lange put on that record , I was obsessed with . But I ' m moving away from those influences . I ' ve been working on a ton of new stuff and branching out so it ' s an exciting time . I ' m in a much better headspace and I think that that ' s reflected in the new stuff , which obviously won ' t be out for a little while , but the spark is there .
