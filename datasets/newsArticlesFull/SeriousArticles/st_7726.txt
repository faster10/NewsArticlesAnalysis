The report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century , based upon four different carbon emission scenarios . Those range from a low end which would require significant cutbacks in emissions , to a worst case scenario in which carbon emissions would continue to climb unabated . The projections will provide more details about sea level rise , for which observations show rates increasing , and should give a more precise estimate of the levels we will see at the end of the century .
