But there are some things that are just intuitive . Did you know , that if you ' re going 100 mph , directly at a very , very thick , reinforced concrete wall , and you speed up , so you ' re accelerating right when you hit the wall that the accident you have is going to be much worse than if you ' d jammed on the brakes as soon as you saw the wall at the end of the street ? Did you know that ? It ' s exactly what everything you know and feel would tell you , and it ' s exactly true . Most times when you ' re driving , or playing with fire , or handling money , the thing that makes sense to you is also true .
