O ne should not underestimate the difficulties of intelligence collection in Europe today . France s intelligence services are being overwhelmed by the many individuals who have gone to join jihadi fronts in Syria ( some of whom have returned ) , those suspected of preparing to go , and still others suspected of being involved in plotting or supporting terrorist plots . The total number easily runs into the thousands . Keeping every one of them under close surveillance is not possible . Choices have to be made . Some plots will be thwarted . Others will inevitably evade detection .
