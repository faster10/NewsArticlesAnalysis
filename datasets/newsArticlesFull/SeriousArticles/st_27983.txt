Special teams giveth and taketh away as well . Dwayne Harris 80 yard punt return jump started the scoring for the Giants , when the offense could not get going . Unfortunately , normally reliable Josh Brown missed a makeable 48 yard filed goal in overtime so in essence , Brown lost the game for the Giants . His kickoffs gave the Jets four separate opportunities for returns , including a 35 yard return by Antonio Cromartie . Four of Brad Wing s five punts landed inside the 20 yard line , so Wing did his job and never relinquished field position for the G men .
