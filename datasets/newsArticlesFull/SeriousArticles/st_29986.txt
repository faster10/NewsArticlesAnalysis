But change is possible . The transformative benefits of HIV treatment have meant that people living with HIV are living longer , healthier lives . Fear has ebbed . Many of my friends are still around . Earl and I are growing strong . He used to pester me for a sibling , but I knew I had to plan , and to be careful . And with availability of treatment to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their babies , Earl ' s sibling needed not be HIV positive . In 2013 , I got pregnant . Earl was my treatment support partner , reminding me to take my drugs to prevent infecting the baby . When Emmanuel my second son came last year , he was free from the virus and has stayed so . Our family of three is pressing on . We are happy and healthy despite the fact that Earl and I live with the virus . This is a story of progress that is repeated in many other places around the world .
