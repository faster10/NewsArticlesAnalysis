There are so many " firsts " with Rosetta that make it an amazing , ambitious , and potentially rewarding mission . As a cosmochemist , I ' m eager for the chemical and isotopic measurements . Comets preserve the first solids , including ices , formed in the solar system , so the Rosetta measurements will tell us a whole lot about how the solar system formed . Our comet samples from the Stardust mission contained abundant high temperature minerals . How these rocks formed so far from the young Sun is a major cosmochemical puzzle . As a human , I want to know the internal structure of comets .
