President Obama has made climate change the signature issue of his final two years in office , but went into the Paris summit handicapped by the political opposition he faces at home . American delegates will be pushing for a climate plan that is not a formal treaty because the Obama administration knows it cannot get the two thirds vote in the U . S . Senate needed to ratify a treaty . Anything less than a binding treaty , though , weakens any deal . Obama will also have a tough time following through with the inevitable pledge of American dollars to help pay for action on climate change . That spending would also need the approval of the Senate , as well as the House , and both houses of Congress are in the hands of a political party that pretends climate change is not real .
