For promotional purposes , plaster casts of the bird were made upon the film ' s release , and Elisha Cook , Jr . , a character actor who played a henchman in the film , got his hands on one . His copy of the bird was later acquired by John ' s Grill in San Francisco , a restaurant dedicated to Hammett , who often wrote and ate there in the 1930s . The replica bird was on display for years , sitting on the second floor in a display case for all to see . That is , of course , until the day it disappeared in 2007 .
