That means that we now have double the amount of people ( 70M ) making the same 9 of all income in the lowest bracket ( the fastest growing group ! ) and we have 50 more people in the middle class fighting over a pie that has shrunk 33 . ? Who has gained from all this ? ? Do you really need to ask ? ? The upper class ( 125 , 609 yr to join this club ) , has grown from 20M to 50M working people and their share of the income has grown from 28 to 49 all at the expense of the 190M people who are less fortunate .
