Palin is now charged with fourth degree assault , fourth degree misconduct involving a weapon and interfering with a report of domestic violence . The AP also notes this isn t his first brush with the police ? In September 2014 , Track and other Palins were involved in a brawl that broke out at a party in Anchorage . No arrests were made in the melee , and no one wanted to press charges . But according to a police report , Palin had blood around his mouth and his hands . He was belligerent until his mother told him to talk to a police officer . ? The full police report is a thing of epic insanity .
