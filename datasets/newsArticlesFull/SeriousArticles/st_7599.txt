Tamar Abrams , a senior communications manager at a global development firm in Virginia , says she never allowed her daughter to drink when she was in high school . " The line for me was what was legal versus what was illegal . It seemed like a slippery slope to bend the rules , and I was not going to break the law . " Her daughter is currently a rising sophomore at Drexel University and hasn ' t had any alcohol related problems .
