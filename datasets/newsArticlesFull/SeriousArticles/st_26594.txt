Beyond pointing out Hillary ' s Republican arguments , Bernie should absolutely hammer Clinton on how , when she talks about compromising and do able achievements , she always seems to move towards the Republican position . The best example of this is the family leave issue . Bernie ' s right when he points out that he already supports an existing bill in the Senate to provide family leave , and that the costs would be minimal ( " 1 . 61 per week " ) to working families . Clinton , almost echoing Grover Norquist , has taken a very hard line : no new taxes for " the middle class " ( which both she and Bernie astonishingly define as any single individual making up to 250 , 000 a year not exactly what I think of when I think of the " middle class , " but that ' s a side issue ) . Bernie could point this out by offering Clinton a tough choice : " If you were elected president next year and Congress passed the exact same version of family leave that I am now supporting in the Senate , would you sign it or would you veto it ?
