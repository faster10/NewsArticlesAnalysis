We experience this where we work and live . And then we turn on the nightly news and see more hatred . Like the church in Florida that ' s planning a Quran burning event on the anniversary of 9 11 . Like the sad irony of the Anti Defamation League ( a group actually formed to " secure justice and fair treatment for all against . . . hatred , prejudice and bigotry " ) now speaking out against the Islamic center to promote interfaith dialogue and education being proposed for near the former World Trade Center site .
