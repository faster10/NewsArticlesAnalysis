As for Rubio , we have already seen Bush s campaign champing at the bit to claim Rubio is the GOP Obama . Many observers think Rubio , ironically , would love to be associated as a two time presidential election winner and easily can distinguish his experience and understanding of the world from Obama s . The notion that Bush might go after Rubio or that the Right to Rise super PAC might do a search and destroy ad operation against him ( as Mitt Romney did against hapless challengers in 2012 ) may seem enticing to Bush loyalists , but it may be the least productive and most dangerous tactic of all .
