For each of these complaints , however , there ' s the same easy answer : Put it in an AUMF , and get it passed through Congress . Think you can run the war better ? Then lay it out in a document . Write your own war plan . Set out goals and ways to achieve those goals . And put the idea before Congress and before the public . Republicans don ' t really want to do this , because they know ( 1 ) that things could go very wrong with any war plan , and ( 2 ) that they really don ' t have much of any answer that is better than what Obama ' s already doing .
