THE DEAL PRETTY much happened that way a few months back at a place called West Coast Turf in Livingston , California . The buyer was a man named Ed Mangan , who has worked 27 Super Bowls and has been the Super Bowl field director since 2000 . ( The rest of the year , his main gig is maintaining Turner Field in Atlanta , home of the Braves . ) Mangan uses fancy tools like Clegg hammers ( which gauge the firmness of the turf ) and torsion testers ( which measure the traction that cleats get on a field ) . But sometimes it comes down to the senses . He really does take a deep whiff . He really does pinch off a bit of the soil and taste it . " Pulling on it , touching on it , feeling it , smelling it , " Mangan says , " everything is involved . "
