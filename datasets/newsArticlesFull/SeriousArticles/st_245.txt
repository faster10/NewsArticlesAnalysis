LN : I grew up in a world where the majority of people were black so that wasn ' t the defining quality of anyone . When you ' re describing someone , you don ' t start out with " he ' s black , he ' s white . " No , I was a girl , I was my ethnic group Luo , I was middle class , I was many things before I was black , so it was like a rearrangement when I came here and realized that in America that ' s the first thing that people notice about me . You don ' t hear that word , " black , black " very often in Kenya to tell you the truth , so that was definitely jarring .
