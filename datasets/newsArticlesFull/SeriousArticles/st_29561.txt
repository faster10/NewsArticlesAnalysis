PH : This is an issue that federal government absolutely will not negotiate . Clearly , they don t want to negotiate with anybody making a political or economic stand . And the fact that there is a lot of militia involved Sadly , there are people who , for reasons of self promotion have inserted themselves in this controversy and maybe are not so on board with the deep core issues here which is public land rights . But the media in the US has used a militia aspect to demonize the public lands issue and to demonize small farmers or anybody who is protesting on their behalf . It has been a really messy situation in Oregon from the media point of view , from the protesters point of view and also from the federal government s point of view . It is going to be really hard to clean up now after this .
