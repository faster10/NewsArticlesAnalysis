1 . Tony ' Bomber ' Brown , born in Oldham in 1945 and brought up in Manchester , snubbed Manchester City to join West Bromwich Albion at the age of 15 after accepting the offer of a trial . He recalled : ' The very first time I stepped foot inside The Hawthorns I knew this was the club for me . At the time I was on the verge of signing for Manchester City , who were my local club , but I felt so instantly at home with Albion that I decided to sign for them instead . It was the best decision I ' ve ever made in my life . '
