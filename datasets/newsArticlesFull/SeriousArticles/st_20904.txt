They work across cultures too : I first learned of the Women ' s War which took place in eastern Nigeria in 1929 ( an anti taxation and anti colonialist protest which ended with reports of up to 100 Igbo casualties ) , when I was at school in Lagos . I learned that some of these women stripped naked to make their case an admirably thought out and executed case of naked protest , in a non Western culture , from more than 80 years ago . It was effective , too administrative reforms were carried out , bringing an end to the Warrant Chief system ( introduced by British colonialists ) and women were appointed in local courts .
