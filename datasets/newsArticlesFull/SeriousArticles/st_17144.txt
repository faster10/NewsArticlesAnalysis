Of course , there are things that are difficult for outsiders to accept . I have had to live through the sights and stories of little girls going through female genital cutting , which has led to hemorrhage and even death . And you feel outrage when seeing this . But with outrage alone , you can maybe save one girl , possibly a few girls . You need to understand fully and involve villagers to find a culturally relevant strategy that can reach a critical mass of people who can collectively make such practices disappear .
