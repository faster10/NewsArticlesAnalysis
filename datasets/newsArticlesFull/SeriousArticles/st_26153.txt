A nominee for best actress this year for ' 45 Years , ' Charlotte Rampling called the diversity outcry " racist against whites . " " One can never really know , but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list . . . . Why classify people ? These days everyone is more or less accepted . . . People will always say : Him , he s less handsome Him , he s too black He is too white . . . someone will always be saying You are too ( this or that ) . . . But do we have to take from this that there should be lots of minorities everywhere ? Later she walked back her comments , saying in a statement , Diversity in our industry is an important issue that needs to be addressed . I am highly encouraged by the changes announced today by the academy to diversify its membership . ?
