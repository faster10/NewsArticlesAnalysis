Or , what if one of the passengers , already high as a kite , had wandered up front and distracted the pilots ( chartered planes don ' t usually have the same secure doors as airliners ) . . . just enough that they missed an important radio call or failed to notice another nearby airplane ? If you were on an airliner headed for Newark or LaGuardia , how would you feel knowing the guys in some nearby business jet are loopy ? Or imagine if the airplane had slid off the runway during landing , or sailed through the airport fence because the crew wasn ' t really in control ? The profit the charter company made carrying the Bieber entourage would not even cover the attorney ' s fees in a lawsuit .
