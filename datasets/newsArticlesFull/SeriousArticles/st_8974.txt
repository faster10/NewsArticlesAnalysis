VACCHIANO : As the Giants have searched desperately for a dependable second option to Beckham in their offense , they have sometimes overlooked running back Shane Vereen . I don t think they will on Sunday . He s second on the Giants with 40 catches ( for 342 yards and three touchdowns ) and there are signs the Giants are beginning to use him as a passing game weapon more and more . They don t think he s just good for dump offs either . They think he can be a downfield threat . Sunday might be the day for that .
