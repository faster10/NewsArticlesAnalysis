The second largest carbon trading system exists under the United Nations Kyoto Protocol . The Protocol which sets binding emission targets for 37 industrialized countries permits emissions trading in order to help countries meet their agreed upon targets . Countries have agreed to an average 5 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions , compared to 1990 levels , by 2012 and carbon trading is one way to meet this quota . By December 2008 , the EU ETS will link up with the UN trading system to create a more global scheme .
