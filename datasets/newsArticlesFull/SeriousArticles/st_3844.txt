A stronger national security policy . Robert Joseph , President Bush s senior adviser on proliferation , says that North Korea will be deterred only if Washington pursues a national security policy based on principle and strength instead of appeasement and weakness , pointing to the Iran nuclear agreement as an example . He urges the next administration to reinvigorate such counterproliferation programs as the Proliferation Security Initiative , agreements among states to board and seize ships carrying illicit nuclear related goods and equipment , and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism , both Bush initiatives . He and several others also support a controversial program to protect America with a missile shield , a concept advocated by President Reagan which arms control advocates call technically infeasible , or programs that would provide what Hanham calls a false sense of security . But shield advocates complain that President Obama has scaled back funding for missile defense research from some 9 to 7 billion ? a year . As Mr Joseph argues , 4 of every 5 dollars now go to theater defenses , not to protecting the American homeland .
