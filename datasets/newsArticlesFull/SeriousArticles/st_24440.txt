MASHAL : Well , we know that this fighting season , the Taliban have been deadlier than in previous years . And it ' s been a surprise to many people to think that their strength is so high after 14 years of fighting . But the bigger question it raises is that yesterday , Afghan and American and Chinese officials were in Pakistan trying to restart a peace process .
