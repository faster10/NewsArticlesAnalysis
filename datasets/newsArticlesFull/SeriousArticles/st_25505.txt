We need to chose well , said ? Family Leader President and Iowa evangelical heavyweight Bob Vander Plaats , condemning the rival candidate for saying he doesn t ask God for forgiveness and saying he d use his deal making skills to work with others . I am here to tell you that the sanctity of life is not up for the Art of the Deal . God s design for marriage and family is not up for the Art of the Deal , our religious liberty is not up for the Art of the Deal , our Constitution is not up for the Art of the Deal . ?
