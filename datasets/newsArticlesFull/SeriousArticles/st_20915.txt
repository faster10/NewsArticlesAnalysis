Fiji had their own war dance last weekend , but the less said about that game the better . It was a tough day for everyone involved and we know we didn ' t perform well . Warren Gatland was like a disappointed dad in the changing room afterwards . It was one of those ' I ' m not angry I ' m disappointed , ' moments . Our basic skills weren ' t there and we got turned over 22 times . That ' s not acceptable in international rugby it was schoolboy level and we let ourselves down . Now we pick ourselves up and get ready to raise our game against the All Blacks .
