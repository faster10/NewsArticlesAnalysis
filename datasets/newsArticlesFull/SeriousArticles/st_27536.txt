The data leave not the slightest doubt that our seniors , far from spending it all on a big going out party during their retired years which they surely are entitled to and could do give trillions of dollars to the young in gifts . A study conducted by John J . Havens and Paul G . Schervish of the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College predicts that between 1998 and 2052 , a minimum of 41 trillion will pass from one generation to the next . They estimate that more than half of these funds will be transferred through bequests to heirs , about a quarter will go to estate taxes and fees , and the rest will be given to charities .
