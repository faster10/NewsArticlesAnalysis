This time last year if you asked people who they would rather have in their team , it would be Aaron Ramsey all day long . But Jordan Henderson has come so far it is now a 50 50 call . These are the midfield marathon men and whoever wins this battle in the engine room should end up on the winning side . Ramsey can grab a goal , and Liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box , but Henderson will press hard and make sure Ramsey and the likes of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla have no room to breathe .
