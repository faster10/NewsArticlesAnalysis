But it is sometimes hard to determine when the line is crossed . Artists and their estates have sued in the past when they believed their copyrights were being infringed upon . In 2001 , Margaret Mitchell ' s estate sued author Alice Randall and publisher Houghton Mifflin over Randall ' s " The Wind Done Gone , " a parody of " Gone With the Wind " told from the point of view of a slave . That case was eventually settled out of court , though an appeals court had upheld Randall ' s right to create the book .
