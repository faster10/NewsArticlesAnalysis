Let me start with the financial reforms . We talk often about interest rates and credit policy . Changes in interest rates are debated for months . Tons of newsprint and hours of television are spent on it . Interest rates are no doubt very important . But are they important to a person locked out of the banking system ? To a person who has no prospect of ever lending or borrowing from a bank ? And if large sections of a country are in this position then how important are interest rates ? It is for this reason that development experts have been advocating financial inclusion . What we have done in the last 17 months is to bring one hundred and ninety million people into the banking system . This is more than the population of most of the countries in the world . Now these millions are part of our banking system , and words like interest rate have a meaning for them . Not only have these people been brought into the system but they have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid . Believe it or not , accounts opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana today have a total balance of almost Rs . 26 , 000 crores or nearly four billion dollars . Clearly our financial inclusion reform has been transformational . And yet this quiet revolution has hardly been noticed .
