Now , it s entirely possible that Trump has considered all the angles here . Maybe he arrived at the reasonable conclusion that he d be the target of a multi candidate pile on at the debate given his lead in the polls and the proximity to the Iowa caucus , and determined that it would be better to sit it out rather than spend the entire evening defending himself . Maybe he thinks he actually can extract what he wants out of Fox and agree to participate in the debate on his own terms . Maybe he just doesn t care because he ll continue being Donald Trump regardless of what happens . Whatever the explanation , he s clearly not scared .
