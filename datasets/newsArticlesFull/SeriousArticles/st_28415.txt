7 . ' Dear Diary ' ( Nanni Moretti , 1993 ) " Moretti is a film maverick who first emerged in the mid 1970s , whose films are always in some way autobiographical . He ' s probably , the closest thing Italy has to Woody Allen , except his films have a more political slant . He ' s a great comic actor and merges politics and comedy in his films . ' Dear Diary ' is just a diary in three episodes . One of those films that manages to be incredibly rich and satisfying , but when you describe the story it sounds inconsequential . It ' s just him riding around in Rome on a Vespa with a voice over where he ' s talking about films . It transmits a great love of place and cinema as well as riding around Rome on a Vespa being brilliantly cinematic . "
