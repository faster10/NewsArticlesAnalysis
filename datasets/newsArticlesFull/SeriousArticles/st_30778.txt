After Fox Business Network announced Rand Paul didn ' t qualify for the prime time Republican presidential debate on Thursday , the senator from Kentucky rebuffed an invitation to attend the earlier debate . The " undercard " debate doesn ' t have as many viewers as the prime time one , and Paul said he thinks the network has " made a mistake . I ' m not willing to accept a designation as a minor campaign . We ' ve raised 25 million . We ' ve gotten on the ballot in every state . It ' s kind of ridiculous to arbitrarily rate the campaigns based on national polling . " The network said it would give prime time slots to the six candidates polling the best in national surveys and anyone polling in the top five in Iowa or New Hampshire .
