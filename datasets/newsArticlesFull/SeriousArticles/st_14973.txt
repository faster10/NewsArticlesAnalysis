Jennifer and David Speidel , an adult couple from New Hampshire , worry their children ' s student loans will hit shortly after they pay off their own . " There ' s no break , " Jennifer said . They are not the only adults who , for one reason or another , are dealing with student debts . About a fifth of households headed by people 45 to 54 years old have them , according to a 2014 study from the Government Accountability Office . For students already enrolled in college , though , the debts are mounting even as the candidates campaign . " I try not to think about that too much , " said May Mullen , 19 , another freshman at SNHU .
