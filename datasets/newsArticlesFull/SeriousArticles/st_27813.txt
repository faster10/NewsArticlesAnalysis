A senior Pakistani intelligence official said that Mansour had been very seriously injured in what he described as a heavy exchange of fire at a gathering of militant commanders near Quetta . An Afghan intelligence official and multiple insurgent sources close to Mansour s group confirmed the account to AFP , adding that the firefight on Tuesday left at least four Taliban members dead and several others wounded . The shootout also threatens to derail a renewed regional push to jump start peace talks with the Taliban . Mansour is believed to be a proponent of talks with Afghan authorities , a deeply contentious issue that has prompted much rancour within hardline insurgent ranks .
