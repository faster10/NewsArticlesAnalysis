Anyway , now would ' ve been a fine time to drop all that baggage and back story and just send Craig ' s definitive Bond on a fabulous globetrotting adventure . Any of the journeymen directors responsible for the majority of the 23 previous Eon Productions Bond pictures could ' ve handled this . ( The ones who aren ' t dead are long retired , but you know what I mean . ) But because Mendes is a fancy pants artiste with an Oscar on his mantle ( for the loathsome American Beauty ) , he feels obligated to proffer a sluggish metacommentary on the iconography of classic Bond . It ' s suffocating .
