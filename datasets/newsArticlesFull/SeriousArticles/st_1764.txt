Even as they came up empty inning after inning against Mets ace Matt Harvey , who held them to four singles over eight scoreless innings , shrewdly alternating the fastball , curveball , slider and changeup with the instincts of a jazz soloist . Even as they entered the ninth down 2 0 and three outs from defeat as Harvey sprinted to the mound to take his place in history , nearly all of the 44 , 859 spectators that had packed Citi Field in his thrall . Even after they forced it to extra innings but , as Sunday night turned to Monday morning , failed to crack a New York bullpen hell bent on forcing the series back to Kansas City .
