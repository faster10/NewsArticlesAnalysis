Cruz made that statement while attempting to take the high road , but he s unfamiliar with such heights and it showed . It s also been reported that he was registered as an independent and a woman and transgendered leftist activist , if that s what he is , he said . I don t think it s fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left . This is a murderer . Apparently , he believed people would walk away from his statement thinking , It s big of Cruz not to blame leftist rhetoric for a man shooting up a Planned Parenthood clinic ? which says quite a bit about how intelligent he considers his audience .
