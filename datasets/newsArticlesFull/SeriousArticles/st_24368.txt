Gahan : I ' m glad you heard that . There was no torture at all . It really came easy , this stuff . For me , that doubt and that faith are so close . It ' s impossible to deny that happening around you when you really kind of let go of trying to control things . But it ' s not hokey in any way . I ' m not trying to tell you what to do . It ' s purely my experience of feeling like I really belong , and then moments of really what the f k am I doing ? We all have that . I tried to keep that as open as possible without directing . I don ' t want to direct you . I want you to listen and conjure up your own thoughts .
