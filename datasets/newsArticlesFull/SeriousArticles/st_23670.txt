At night after the kids were asleep , my husband and I nibbled on the jumbo cookie and watched some Olympic slopestyle , waiting for Lucie to work her magic . She was to be my masseuse by pot proxy , easing my tired and aching body into a blissful , peaceful state . After all , I never can break away to a spa on a family ski trip . It ' s too time consuming and it ' s tough to grab an alone moment when we are away . But Lucie , well , she ' s conveniently sitting on my nightstand waiting to be appreciated .
