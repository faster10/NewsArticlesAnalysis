In the scheme of Couch s ? and his mother s ? irresponsible acts , nothing comes close to Couch getting behind the wheel and leaving four people dead and two seriously injured . But these latest developments do offer a little extra insight into the mindset of these two . They seem to have set off with no apparent thought of what would happen to the animal Mrs Couch claims to be so concerned for if they were apprehended . Was it a particular kind of ego , that they assumed they wouldn t be caught ? A neediness that decided what they wanted trumped what would be best for the welfare of the animal ? Or was it more likely that they just didn t think at all , about the consequences of their actions , and who might get hurt ?
