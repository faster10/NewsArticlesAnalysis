Tai O is separated from the rest of Hong Kong by steep , rocky hills . Before 1990 , the only way to get to Tai O was by boat . Permits to drive on the town ' s single road are only granted to villagers and public buses . A sense of isolation still pervades the village ' s tight knit community , which many locals say they are keen to keep to themselves . As visitors are drawn to the Venice like village with homes largely built on stilts , the pathways are dotted with signs warning " Private Property " and " No Entry . " To circumvent the signs , tour guides now row tourists on boat down the river and having a look at the houses from the water .
