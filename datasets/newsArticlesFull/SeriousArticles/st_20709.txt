In Ahmedabad , India , Steve attended the annual kite festival , where fliers dip their strings in glue and powdered glass and try to slice through the lines of other kites . This takes a terrible toll on birds as the lines slice through their wings like cheesewire . The terrified creatures are bundled up by volunteers and rushed to a makeshift clinic to be patched up . The first challenge is to give them a transfusion . It takes great skill to find the artery in a bird ' s leg and insert a tube . Only then can the surgeon sew up the wings .
