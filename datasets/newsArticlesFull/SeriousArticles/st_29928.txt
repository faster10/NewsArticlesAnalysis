At other times , the movie is a girl group biopic that never quite delivers the charge of success that we ' re longing to see . Jordin Sparks ' big , climactic on stage number is supposed to do that , but to me it ' s just a testament to the way that too many " Idol " graduates , with their how many notes can I cram inside a note technical bravura , short circuit any true connection with the audience . " Sparkle " is never more than an overheated mediocrity . The one thing it isn ' t , however , is dull . Grade : B
