I won t bother harping on the fact that the amount of death dealt out in Arab and Muslim countries by the United States and its allies , whether through military means or less directly , is on a completely different scale . Nobody much cares , or wants to think about that . We are conditioned to believe that people unlucky enough to be born in some nutty Allahu akbar country pretty much accept that their lives and their children s lives are worthless . Who is to say they aren t all terrorists anyway ? No , what has changed the ideological climate around Islam is not the looming threat of Sharia rule in the Mall of America ? enjoy those Wendy s Bacon Fondue Fries without bacon , infidel dog ! ? but the endless torrent of fearmongering and propaganda feeding into our national slough of cultural stupefaction . This is the sense in which , as I have repeatedly argued , ISIS and the Republican Party are effectively pursuing the same agenda .
