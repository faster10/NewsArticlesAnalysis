Let me tell you about one boy , let ' s call him Will . One day , some 30 years ago , Will , a 14 year old boy at the school at which I was headmaster , told his home economics teacher to f off . She marched Will along to my office . I promptly beat him . This was the punishment which his teacher desired . It was the punishment which the rest of the class expected . It was what Will expected . He did not swear at her again . I might add that every now and again my deputy and I beat boys for bullying , damage to property , insolence to staff and petty theft . My deputy , who hit much harder than me due to my injured wrist incurred during military service , claimed that boys never came back for more , but this did not prevent him from being widely liked and respected .
