Haley shows veepstakes strength in rebuttal David Drucker ? writes ? that South Carolina Gov . ? Nikki Haley s rebuttal to ? President Obama s State of the Union should put her in the top spot for a vice presidential pick . Drucker says , Haley was praised for her delivery and her eloquent and sharp rhetoric . She displayed an ability to marry an aggressive pitch for conservative values , such as stating that illegal immigration must be stopped , with calls for inclusiveness and respect for people with which Republicans disagree . For a party that is simultaneously looking for strong leadership and a messenger that can help the GOP appeal to an increasingly diverse electorate that has increasingly sided with the Democratic Party in presidential elections . The performance should immediately elevate the second term Indian American governor , who is just 43 years old , into top consideration for her party ' s vice presidential nod .
