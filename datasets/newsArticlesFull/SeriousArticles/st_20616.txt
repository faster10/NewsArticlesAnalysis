Pete Carroll ' s formula of success , with new coordinators year after year , has been to run a simple but stifling defense , win the turnover battle and eventually get a quarterback who can win games in the fourth quarter . Sunday ' s 10 9 victory over the Minnesota Vikings illustrated that if a team can be good on defense , it can also be lucky ( or quite lucky in the case of a missed field goal ) and win on a day when little else seemed to go right , especially with Wilson ' s offense without Marshawn Lynch .
