When Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan , I cheered not because I agreed , but because it was a principled attempt to educate the American people on drone strike policy and because Paul pursued the filibuster the traditional " Mr Smith Goes to Washington " way , taking the Senate floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver . But this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways , blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it .
