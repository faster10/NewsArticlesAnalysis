The Bears are loaded with injuries from Alshon Jeffery to Matt Forte , but Jeremy Langford has been unstoppable , taking over the starting RB position the past two weekends . As long as Forte remains out , he is a solid play . Don t forget that it will be absolutely freezing out there , with wind also a factor , which means more drops and fewer completions . That s why the Broncos really need to get their running game going , as well . Ronnie Hillman could see a few more carries , it seems as though he has taken over the starting spot from C . J . Anderson .
