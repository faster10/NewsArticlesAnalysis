9 . Age alone isn t enough on its own , but with the success of Minnesota hiring now 59 year old Mike Zimmer as head coach in 2014 , Arizona hiring now 63 year old Bruce Arians as head coach in 2013 , and Carolina hiring now 64 year old Dave Gettleman as general manager in 2013 , it makes me wonder why we haven t heard of more later career candidates for some of the NFL s current openings . Maybe Zimmer , Arians and Gettleman are the exceptions more than the rule , but the younger up and comers still seem to dominate the discussion .
