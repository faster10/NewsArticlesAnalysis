That s why I m dubious about this line of attack from the Democrats on Trump s economic record . They re essentially planning to call him an asshole , pointing out that he cost people their jobs and refused to give them raises . He s a landlord , one Democrat told Politico . Everybody f ? ing hates their landlord . The problem is that a lot of Trump s appeal is based on ? the fact that he s an asshole . He embraces it and he s good at spinning it ? as a sign of toughness , and the Democrats should be wary about helping Trump make his point for him .
