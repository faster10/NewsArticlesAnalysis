Once the woman began sympathizing with the Islamic State , it seems that the French authorities placed her on a watch list . However , they would not uncover the group of her ISIS confidants in time . The mastermind behind the Paris terror attacks would take up residence with Hassan after , and possibly before , the attacks . Though the woman was found in the flat in Saint Denis along with Abdelhamid Abaaoud , where she subsequently detonated her suicide belt , it is currently unknown what involvement she had in the Paris attacks or if you she was just involved in the planned attack on the Charles de Gaulle airport and shopping center that police say was thwarted by the Saint Denis raid .
