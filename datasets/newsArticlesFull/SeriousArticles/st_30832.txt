Remarkably , this is the first time Heisman Trophy winning quarterbacks have squared off against each other in a conference title game . Palmer , who captured the honor in 2002 , needs a better all around performance against the Panthers than the one he had against Green Bay . Newton ' s strength against Seattle was efficiency . Newton , the 2010 Heisman winner , completed 72 . 7 percent of his passes ( 16 of 22 ) for 161 yards and one touchdown without committing a turnover . That ' s something to dab about .
