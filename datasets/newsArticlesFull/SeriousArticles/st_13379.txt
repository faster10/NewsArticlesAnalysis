No one swans around the pitch better than Ballack , who , at 32 , is still Germany ' s star player . Having impressed at Bayer Leverkusen during their brilliant but ultimately fruitless 2001 02 season , Bayern Munich swooped . By that time , Ballack had become the key man for the national side for his ability to control play from the middle of the park and score goals . He did the same for Bayern until 2006 when Chelsea signed him on a free transfer . Ballack has never replicated his international form in West London , but he has been confirmed as Germany captain for the 2010 World Cup .
