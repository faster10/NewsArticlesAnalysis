France cannot afford an emotional descent into prejudice , ostracism and racism . Nor can Europe . In Germany , in Britain , in Poland and elsewhere , rightwing extremist parties that habitually target and scapegoat Muslims , particularly Muslim refugees from Syria , would like nothing better than to see France lapse into polarisation , recrimination and deepening division . It would suit the purposes of Isis and al Qaida , too , should Friday s events serve further to radicalise and divide . How else may fanatics of their ugly stripe hope to impose their will ? For these reasons , all of Europe s political class must now stand with France .
