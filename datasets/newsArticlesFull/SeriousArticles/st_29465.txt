DiOrio : We need to enforce background checks , not just at commercial retailers but also at gun shows . We need to limit the sale of dangerous weapons to people who have no record of criminal history . We need to perhaps consider enacting some kind of mental screening or wellness testing before people are allowed to purchase weapons as well . It might offend people because it would infringe upon their rights , but we need to consider if that would outweigh the benefits brought to society by not allowing weapons to go into the hands of the mentally ill .
