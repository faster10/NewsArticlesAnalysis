The general consensus seems to be that Sanders is going more negative on Clinton than the other way around . That seems generally right , but ultimately , none of this stuff is really a big deal , at least not yet . The candidates gain from as robust a debate as possible . And by the way , both of them almost certainly know this . It has been suggested for months that Clinton was expecting a coronation . But all of the available evidence suggests otherwise ? it s far more likely that Clinton s team always anticipated the possibility of a very tough battle . And as her strong debate performance and series of surprisingly ambitious , detailed and progressive policy positions suggest , she s the better for it .
