There are a couple things on this list to enjoy . It s nice to see a well earned director nomination for George Miller , who spent three decades bringing Mad Max : Fury Road to the screen , while his film reaped a bid for Best Picture . Charlotte Rampling , my personal favorite performance from last year , is a welcome entry in the Best Actress race ? the veteran British actress first nomination at the age of 69 . Their respective nominations set frontrunners Brie Larson ( Room ) , Rooney Mara ( Carol ) , and Leonardo DiCaprio ( The Revenant ) up for their first Oscar wins , and all of those kudos will be deserved .
