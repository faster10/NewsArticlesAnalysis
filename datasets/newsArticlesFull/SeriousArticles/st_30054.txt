Casagrande : I did have Mark Addison an expert on South Africa ' s shark diving sites with me . There was another situation that happened with Mark , just before this . Mark saw the shark f ing with me , and Mark swam over and was trying to tell the shark , like , chill out . But Mark is scuba diving . He doesn ' t have a camera , he ' s got nothing in his hands . I might have this shot somewhere : The shark swims up at Mark . Mark swims at the shark like I was saying you do . But instead of backing down , the shark just keeps swimming . The shark is opening his mouth and all Mark can do is makes motion like you ' re pressing yourself flat against a wall as the shark goes by . If he would have put his hands out , the shark would have bit his hands . So I did have Mark , but Mark is a crazy f ing person . I ' m a bit of a dare devil , but I don ' t want to win a Darwin Award . Like if my family can read my obituary and laugh because it ' s embarrassing , that ' s not a good thing .
