All Muslims accept the Qur ' an as their reference point . Historically there has been considerable agreement on the general principles of morality , social justice , and Divine benevolence . The Qur ' an is analogous in the religious sphere of Islam to the Constitution in the American political system . However , to avoid a possible understanding , we should clarify that the Qur ' an does not prescribe any one political system . It does not , for instance , propose that people should be governed by religious authorities . Traditionally , even in lands that had a large majority of Muslims , political and religious authority were separate and distinct . In general , Muslims have been counseled to be good citizens and follow the laws of the land .
