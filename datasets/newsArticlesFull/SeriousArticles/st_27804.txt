The second objective , and a much longer term one , is to take out Trump . Trump s Iowa win would likely ice his New Hampshire victory . But if Cruz s Iowa loss takes him out of the running for second place in New Hampshire , that silver medal would likely go to Sen . Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Gov . John Kasich , or Gov . Chris Christie . Rubio would seem to have the edge following a likely third place Iowa finish that Bush s super PAC has been trying so hard to deny him . And if Rubio finished second in New Hampshire , the other three establishment acceptable candidates who ve pinned their hopes on New Hampshire would face overwhelming pressure to drop out . Rubio consolidates that voting bloc , holds his water against Trump through the South , scoops up the larger , more moderate winner take all states beginning March 15 , becomes the nominee , and crushes Hillary Clinton by a trillion electoral votes .
