Denver s vaunted running game was held to 3 . 3 yards on 30 carries , and only two plays really hurt . One was a surprising Peyton Manning scramble for 12 yards and a first down when end Chandler Jones rush got too far upfield and created a wide gap in the lanes . C . J . Anderson also had a critical 30 yard run that led to a field goal . Right guard Louis Vasquez pulled and leveled end Rob Ninkovich while the left side knocked down safety Patrick Chung . End Jabaal Sheard didn t apply much pressure on Manning but had six run stuffs . Tackle Alan Branch beat center Matt Paradis with a bull rush to sack Manning . Ninkovich seemed to be in coverage more than the norm , and that didn t always go well . On one of tight end Owen Daniels touchdowns , he and linebacker Jamie Collins seemed confused as to what their assignments were . Collins let Daniels get deep on him and Ninkovich covered air . End Chandler Jones was in attendance , but he went unnoticed .
