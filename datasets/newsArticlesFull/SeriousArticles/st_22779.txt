Leslie Oakley of Davenport , Florida I grew up in a small town in Kentucky where opera didn ' t exactly fit in the scheme of things . My family wasn ' t at all musical either but seeing as though I took an interest in it , my parents indulged me with opera recordings . One of the first ones I received was The Three Tenors . Luciano Pavarotti was to me what Michael Jordan was to other children . He was my hero . I even did a report on him one year in high school . I can remember sitting in my room listening to his voice , closing my eyes and seeing the operas unfold in my mind . He inspired me to teach myself to sing , and I went on to win awards in high school and to sing for three professional groups out of college . Singing has enriched my life immeasurably , and I owe it all to that beautiful voice that so entranced me as a child . I have many fond memories of Pavarotti . His voice always moves me to tears . It is the feeling of being given a glimpse of the divine that I will most remember about him . My prayers and thoughts are with his family and friends . There will never be another Pavarotti .
