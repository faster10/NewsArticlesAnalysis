On immigration , the answer is obvious : Both Cruz and Rubio favor border security and measures to eliminate visa overstays . Both favor expanding high end legal immigration ( to his credit , Cruz has favored a huge expansion of the H 1B visa program ) . The only difference is that after all that , Cruz is refusing to level with voters . Unless he ll endorse a plan to round up and forcibly remove those who remain illegally , he will have to put forth a plan to deal with their legal status . Rubio is being honest in putting out such a plan , and Cruz is not . Amnesty is one of those meaningless phrases ( government cartel is another ) that Cruz tosses to low information voters to keep them fired up and sending him money .
