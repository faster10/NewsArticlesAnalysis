Ed asked Howard if he believes that head coach Jeff Fisher is overrated . Howard acknowledged that while he hasn t made many playoff appearances in his coaching career , that has more to do with his quarterbacks over the years , he is highly thought of , yet there are those that believe he is overrated . Nobody believes his job is in jeopardy , but there are many that think it should be . When you look back to his days in Tennessee he had Steve McNair at quarterback and he fared much better . In fact the Titans during a five year stretch had one of the best records in the league along with the St . Louis Rams .
