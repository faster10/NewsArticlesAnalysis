The Young Guns program Tisei recently joined was started in 2007 by three Republican rising stars Reps . Eric Cantor of Virginia , Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Kevin McCarthy of California . The three were concerned their party wasn ' t doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the GOP lost in 2006 . The program grew to support 90 candidates in 2009 and became part of the National Republican Congressional Commitee . Those selected for the program received financial and political support from the national party , and 62 of them won in 2010 , helping to return the House gavel back to the GOP .
