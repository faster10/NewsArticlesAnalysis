Overall , yes if you look at the conflict between the Alexandrians and our guys , I think it ' s exemplified in that heated argument between Michonne and Heath , like , " you don ' t know what it ' s like out there . " And honestly , thinking back to what Sasha went through last season , and seeing what that was , you ' re thinking , " life is pretty cushy in Alexandria you really don ' t know , and you should be thankful that you don ' t know . But now that it ' s at your door , you should really be thankful that you have these people with you . "
