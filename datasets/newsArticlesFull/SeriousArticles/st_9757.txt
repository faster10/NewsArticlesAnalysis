While nuclear has flat lined in the marketplace , statistics demonstrating solar ' s growth actually underestimate the total contribution to our country ' s electrical supply from solar . This is because nonutility and small scale residential and commercial rooftop photovoltaic systems don ' t show up as electric generation in the industry ' s statistics . The utilities that compile generation statistics view rooftop solar electricity , used on site , not as power generation but as a reduction in demand ! If it ' s not sold by a utility , it ' s not " real " power .
