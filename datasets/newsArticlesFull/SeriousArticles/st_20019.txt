Bill Kenwright , Chairman of Everton Football Club , said : ' Words cannot describe my feelings of loss primarily as a friend but also as an Evertonian . Sir Philip was simply a giant . . . a great man a great leader and the very best friend and colleague anyone could ask for . I never once met him without calling him Chairman . I never will . That title was his by right . He will always have a major place in our great club ' s history . To his wondrous Lady Rita and his family we send the deepest of condolences together with our undying love and gratitude for his life . '
