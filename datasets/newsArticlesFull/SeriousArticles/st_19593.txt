London Tony Benn , who has died in London aged 88 , was an inspiration to all of us who wanted to make the world a more peaceful and more equal place . He came from a privileged and political family , his father and grandfather both MPs , and he would have become Lord Stansgate in the early 1960s if he had not fought to renounce his hereditary peerage . Luckily he won , stayed an MP instead of mouldering in Britain ' s upper House of Lords for the next five decades , and dedicated his life to socialist ideas and most importantly to campaigning for change .
