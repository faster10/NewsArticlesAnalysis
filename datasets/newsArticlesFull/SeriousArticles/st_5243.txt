An instant antidote for a bad mood is an evening curled up in front of a movie based on a Jane Austen novel . I ' m a huge fan of the BBC miniseries Pride and Prejudice , but my favorite scene is from the 1995 made for TV adaptation of Persuasion . When Captain Wentworth professes his love for Anne Elliot , giving her a letter that reads , " You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope , " I always smile . It reminds me that good girls can win in the end . Lauren DeBueriis , New York , New York
