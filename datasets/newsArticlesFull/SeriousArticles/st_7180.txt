Still , despite Boone Isaac s efforts , there is no question that the Oscars have taken a significant hit in public relations . Both director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett Smith ( whose husband Will Smith was seen as a potential nominee for his role in Concussion ) have announced that they are boycotting the show . And documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has said he will also skip the awards ? in solidarity with them . ? They are not looking for tokenism or symbolism ? they want this thing fixed , and I believe they will accomplish that . This is not a PR move on the part of the Academy , Moore told The Wrap on Monday . ? But the idea that we could go two years in a row , where 40 actors could be nominated and none of them were black , is just crazy . So if it will help to lend my name to what Spike and Jada are doing , I m hoping to be a symbolic participant in this boycott .
