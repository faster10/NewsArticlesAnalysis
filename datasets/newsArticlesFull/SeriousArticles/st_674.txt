Next week , a special committee of the lower house will convene to evaluate the impeachment request and will ? in time ? make a recommendation . A two thirds majority in the full lower house is required for it to pass to the senate . If it does , Rousseff will be removed from office for 180 days while the senate investigates . A committee would produce an indictment , which would then need to be endorsed by two thirds of the whole senate . If that happens , Rousseff would lose the presidency and be banned from public office for eight years .
