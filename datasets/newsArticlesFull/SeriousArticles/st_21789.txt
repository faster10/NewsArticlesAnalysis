A Democrat in South Carolina sees Rubio s youth as particularly worrisome : Rubio excites audiences that hear him ? he s an optimistic face on regressive policies ? which makes him very dangerous . There s some truth to this , but it s likely overstated . Rubio no doubt has some political skill , and so long as he speaks in sound bites , he does quite well . But he s still inexperienced and mostly untested ? that would hurt him in a long general election campaign , especially if it s a veteran like Clinton on the other side .
