There is a risk . The fact is , we ve got seriously aging infrastructure and the infrastructure has a series of potential dangers with it . A series of actions need to be in place regular monitoring , for instance , and attention to needs like treating water so it is not corrosive as it goes through old pipes and the infrastructure that delivers water . We need constant vigilance , and we need people in positions where they actually respond to the signals if there s a problem . A number of years ago , in 2011 , there was an identification of heightened lead in the water in parts of Chicago . The response was OK , we need to act on fixing that , and that happened . But the fact is that this is not something that once you fix it , it s fixed forever .
