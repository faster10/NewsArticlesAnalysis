Second , ball movement . Toronto was an efficient offense last season but they played way too much iso ball . A telling stat : The Raptors picked up assists on just 54 . 7 of their makes last season , third lowest in the NBA . In the preseason , that number dipped to 51 . 1 . The hope is that once Toronto fully integrates Carroll ? who is coming from the Hawks share the wealth system that number will improve . I think it will , and I think the Raps recent early playoff exits will fuel a resurgent season .
