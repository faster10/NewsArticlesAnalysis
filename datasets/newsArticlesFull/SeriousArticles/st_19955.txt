I do not have a concern with an appropriate police presence , and I believe police should act to stop destruction of property or the use of the protest for personal gain or profit , such as looting stores . That said , nothing justifies use of an aggressive police presence without proper cause . There was no basis for a military style response , even though the law enforcement could justify it by looking at their textbooks . This did not warrant a textbook response . This warranted demanded a response that carried the respect appropriate in such difficult times . We also now know that a lesser response , as has happened since estate police took over , worked to lessen tensions .
