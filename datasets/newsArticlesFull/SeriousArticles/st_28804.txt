Tyler Clippard is a free agent , and while he didn ' t have his best season , he ' s worth bringing back , if only for the fact he ' s their best reliever getting out lefties ( lefthanded hitters batted . 138 against him this year ) . They return Jerry Blevins , a lefty who didn ' t allow a baserunner this year before going down ( hitters were 0 for 15 against him ) , and should probably give talented Jenrry Mejia a third chance with a contract tender after his two unfortunate drug bans . He isn ' t a bad kid , and he has a great arm .
