Harry admitted that he was more at home in an aircraft cockpit than a classroom . " I don ' t know . . . I am one of those people that during my flying course especially . . . I would be fine at flying , probably should have done a lot more reading . But I was fine at flying . Then every now and then a written test would come up and I would be absolutely useless . . . exams were always a nightmare . Anything like kicking a ball around and playing Playstation or flying , I do . . . I genuinely find a bit easier than walking sometimes .
