One key player who has been cleared to play for the Jets is quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick after he practiced with his surgically repaired thumb . Fitzpatrick is a Harvard graduate and knows the Texans very well from his time as their signal caller last year . He will be ready for his former team , unlike Houston quarterback Brian Hoyer , who was not cleared to play due to a concussion suffered against the Bengals . That means T . J . Yates is likely to start in his place and face a New York defense which will pressure him and force him into mistakes . The Jets have won five of the past six meetings straight up and ATS and will make it six of seven .
