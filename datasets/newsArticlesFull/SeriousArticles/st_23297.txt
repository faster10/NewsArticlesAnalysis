The Rubio campaign was prepared to counter Cruz . Two young volunteers stood at the entrance of Cruz ' s event on Tuesday , braving freezing weather to distribute leaflets full of opposition research aimed at undercutting Cruz ' s assertion that he ' s a " consistent conservative . " They noted Cruz ' s swift turn from wanting to expand legal immigration to wanting to cut it . As Cruz stepped out of his campaign bus , one of the men waved a sign that read " Ted Cruz : Political Calculator , " and the volunteers handed out actual calculators to make their point .
