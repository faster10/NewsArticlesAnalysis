Idris Elba , who received both movie and TV nominations , said in a statement , " Wow thank you to the HFPA , who have always been so amazingly supportive of me throughout my career . I ' m so excited , in particular , to be recognized for both ' Luther ' and Beasts of No Nation . For ' Luther , ' what better way to celebrate the end of a great run than with this stellar acknowledgement . As for Beasts , I can only hope this attention will get more people to see the brilliance of all that is Cary Fukunaga and my extraordinary co star Abraham Attah . I share in this exciting moment with everyone who poured their hearts into these projects and who I could not have done this without . "
