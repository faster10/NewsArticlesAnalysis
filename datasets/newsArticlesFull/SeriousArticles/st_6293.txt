Again , I find this astute . If Hollande is a Second International socialist I must have lost the plot at some point , but we can set this aside . The chronology here reveals an intent on France s part one never reads about in U . S . media . One , Europeans ? and I think we can include many or most of its leaders ? have long been restless , if irresolute , within the frame of confrontation the U . S . superimposes on relations with Russia . Two , Hollande appears to understand that Russophobic Washington could now prove an impediment to the united front strategy to counter the Islamic State , not to mention all that could flow from it .
