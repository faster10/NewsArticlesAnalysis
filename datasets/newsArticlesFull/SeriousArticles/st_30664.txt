Nearly 20 years ago , when I was working for the defense on the O . J . Simpson case , much was made about the racial makeup of that jury ( made up of nine blacks , two whites and one Hispanic ) . But again , it was not just the skin color of those jurors alone that determined that verdict . Three quarters of those jurors had personal experience with the police profiling , planting evidence , and engaging in other mistreatment . Their experience , derived from their racial reality , obviously made them more receptive to the defense ' s arguments about police misconduct . We see what we have experienced . So we see what we want to see , whether we are a white juror in Sanford , Florida , or an African American juror in Los Angeles .
