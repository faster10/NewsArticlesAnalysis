David when he was here with the Knicks , he was a central point of that team . And he goes out ( was traded ) to Golden State and very similar ( to us ) , they go out and get some guys where it forces David into more of a role that maybe he was unfamiliar with , Wright said . David just like Michael Cuddyer and a few other guys on this team that probably should and would be playing elsewhere are bench players for us . That s when players see that type of unselfishness and that s when you truly form that team .
