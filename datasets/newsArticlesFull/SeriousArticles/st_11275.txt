Why women ? Back in 2010 , when we published " The Shriver Report : A Woman ' s Nation Takes on Alzheimer ' s , " we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer ' s and nearly two thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it . Now those numbers are far worse . Today nearly two thirds of those with Alzheimer ' s are women that ' s more than 3 . 2 million women . And more than 60 of caregivers for people with Alzheimer ' s and dementia are women , with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones .
