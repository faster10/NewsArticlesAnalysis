Next up on June 23 we had Wales at Waikato Stadium , a tough but much more manageable assignment . Hamilton ' s a rugby town , and the whole city was humming . This doesn ' t always happen in bigger cities , where a test can get a little lost . My parents , aunt and uncle flew up for the occasion , which made it all the more special . Brad Thorn was making his debut , too , and he was carrying some anger about not having gotten on the previous week . The pair of us were seriously up for the game .
