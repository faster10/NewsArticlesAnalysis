The Broncos quarterback , who will be feeling the love from all fans not living in Charlotte the next two weeks , is the sentimental favorite to win his second title . He turns 40 years old on March 24 , is the oldest QB to take a team to the Super Bowl , has been through difficult injuries the last two seasons , has lost his fastball , missed six starts late this season and came back a game manager , looks just about finished and it s been assumed he will retire and not subject his body to the physical punishment of playing another season ? if any team even wants to pay him to be its starter .
