Meanwhile , the National Security Advisors of both countries are said to have been in almost daily contact since the Pathankot attack , and they were said to have met on Thursday , a day before the FS talks were to have taken place to work out a plan to carry forward a dialogue in face of not only Pathankot , but several other attacks since relations began to improve . Both countries consulates in Afghanistan were attacked subsequent to the Pathankot attack ( supposedly by their respective boyzes ) , and an attack on a polio prevention center in Quetta was also being alleged to have the Indian hand in it .
