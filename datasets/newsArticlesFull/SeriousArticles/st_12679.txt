They said Rajan ' s criminal network of smuggling , extortion and other illegal businesses is still very much in business in South East Asia and he had plans to settle in Bali . " He even carried cash equivalent to Rs 10 lakh and 15 sets of clothes when caught in Bali which suggests that he wanted to operate his business from there after spending 12 years in Australia . He had applied for renewal of his residency in Australia but he got a sense that the country will not renew it so he decided to shift , " said a government official .
