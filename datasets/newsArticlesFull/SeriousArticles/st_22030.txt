Mr Cameron s chances of winning a parliamentary vote have been dramatically improved in the wake of Paris . If the price of dealing with Isis is co operation with Russia , and by extension Assad , then I find most Tory MPs and a significant number of Labour MPs willing to pay it . Smashing the bastards was the overriding priority for one Conservative MP with a military background to whom I talked recently . They will follow Winston Churchill s example when he justified the wartime alliance with Stalin by saying that he would make an ally of the devil if that was what it took to defeat Hitler . Crispin Blunt , the chairman of the foreign affairs select committee , has made an important intervention by suggesting that the Tories on the committee will now reverse their opposition to air strikes because their pre conditions have largely been met . Friday night s unanimous support at the UN security council for a French resolution calling for all necessary measures to beat Isis has further strengthened Mr Cameron s hand . Even the Scottish Nationalists are now suggesting that there could be circumstances in which they would back the prime minister . Things are coming into alignment , says one of his inner circle . Number 10 will not yet absolutely commit him to bringing the question back to parliament . His aides say that he has to be sure that he will win because a second defeat would be a propaganda gift to Isis , hugely damaging to Britain in the eyes of its allies and , as they don t quite say , a personal humiliation for the prime minister .
