? ? The NFC Championship Game is a tremendous coaching matchup , and one you can root for on either side . Both of them definitely paid their dues , Bruce Arians and Ron Rivera . They waited longer than they should have for coaching jobs , but at least the NFL knows now what they were missing . Score one for the coaching veterans , because Arians , 63 , and Rivera , 54 , have the Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers advancing to next Sunday s title game , giving them both their first chances as a head coach to play for a Super Bowl berth .
