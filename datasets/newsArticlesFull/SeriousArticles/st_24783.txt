It is necessary , first of all , to be clear what is not being proposed . If David Cameron brings this matter to a vote in the House of Commons , authorisation will be sought for air strikes alone . Unlike Iraq , a ground invasion involving large numbers of British troops is not contemplated in Syria at this time . Nor are Britain s allies , including the US , proposing such an invasion . Furthermore , any military action would be aimed at Isis and its collaborators , not the Syrian state or its government and leaders . This would not be an exercise in regime change .
