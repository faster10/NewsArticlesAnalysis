Since the attack , feckless Republicans have hatched one hare brained scheme after another : closing borders to Muslims ( Ted Cruz ) opening them , but only to Christians ( Jeb Bush ) closing down mosques and even requiring Muslims to register with the federal government ( walking , talking ISIS recruitment poster Donald Trump ) . And yet they re winning the debate . All evidence says the GOP bill won t make us safer , that even debating it makes us appear foolish and weak . But if it dies in the Senate it will be by parliamentary maneuver , not popular mandate .
