The Raiders ' defensive reaction and execution on the Lions ' first touchdown of the game , early in the fourth quarter , was not spectacular . On first and goal at the Raiders ' 5 yard line , Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford spread the field with multiple wideouts , then ran up the middle when he saw both Raider safeties lined up far outside the tackles . Someone in a Silver and Black uniform should have been there or should have adjusted and run to the middle immediately after the snap . Instead , Stafford practically waltzed into the end zone .
