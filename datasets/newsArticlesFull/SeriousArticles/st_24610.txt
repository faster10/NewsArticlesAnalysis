There are some who wonder what we mean when we say " recovering " from autism . They confuse the word recover with cure . While you may not be able to cure an injury caused in a terrible car accident , you can recover you can regain many skills that you once lost . In the case of autism , we think there are treatments that often bring about such healing , so that the observable symptoms of the condition no longer exist . Even though we may no longer see any symptoms of autism , we can ' t say a child is " cured " because we do not know what they would have been like had they never been injured .
