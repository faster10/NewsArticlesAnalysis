Tour Elmwood Cemetery . There are no more calming places anywhere than cemeteries , but Elmwood is special because of the haunting , Gothic monuments among lush , tree lined paths . The founding fathers of Detroit and Michigan are buried here . And while you ' re on this side of town , head over to Indian Village , the city ' s premier historic district that once served as home to some of the area ' s wealthiest auto barons where houses still are maintained and occupied by many of the city ' s power brokers . Or stop for some coffee at one of the cafes in nearby West Village .
