MJ : I m never that good at doing that . The same way someone asks what my favorite memory is as a player . I m amazed when Jeff says , Do you remember third quarter in Game 3 when we were playing you guys in Indiana ? And I m like , I have no clue . There s nothing specific that stands out . We ve had tremendous games . The opportunity to call the NBA Finals , the trophy presentation , the opportunity to watch all time greats battle , there s been too many for me to pick one specific one . It s just a privilege and an honor for me to have the platform . I m just thrilled to be a part of it . ?
