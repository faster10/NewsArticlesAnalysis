Strength of The Revenant : Coming off a surprise Golden Globes win for Best Picture , The Revenant showed impressive strength again here with 12 nominations , more than any other film . In an Oscar race which has been hard to predict all year , this bleak revenge thriller may be emerging as the favorite . It certainly has a head of steam ? terrific box office numbers , lots of free press generated by star Leonardo DiCaprio s physical endurance on the set , and enough critical consensus to push it over the edge . That said , its director , Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu , just won last year , for his innovative character study Birdman . No filmmaker has directed two Best Picture winners in a row , but there is a first time for everything .
