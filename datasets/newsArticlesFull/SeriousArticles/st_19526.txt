" I still talk to my therapist twice a week , " he said . " It helps me . . . if I ' m frustrated and I ' m dealing with something , to vent and say what I ' m going through so I can hear from an actual clinical person , ' This is how you should react , ' or ' It ' s good to feel this way because feelings , emotions , and energy and emotions , are supposed to come and go . It ' s not supposed to stay there , you ' re not supposed to keep it inside , because it ' ll just bottle up and you ' ll become a monster . ' "
