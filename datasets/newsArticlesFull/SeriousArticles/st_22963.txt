? Cardinals taking risks : I ll admit that I had fallen under Bruce Arians s spell during the regular season for his devil may care attitude in terms of coaching and play calling . But against the Packers , that was exposed as just a fa ? ade to not have to make the kind of nuanced game management decisions needed to win in the postseason . Anybody can say , No risk it , no biscuit , and go for everything and never be second guessed . The best coaches weigh every decision and play the odds when needed . Maybe it just a one time thing because this was really the first game Arians had coached in the postseason where his team had a chance to win . People grow from each experience , and maybe he ll coach differently on Sunday against the Panthers . The Cardinals better hope so .
