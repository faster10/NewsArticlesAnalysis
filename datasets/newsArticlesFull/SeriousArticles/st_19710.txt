New England also excelled when it came to kickoffs this season , registering the second best average start for opponents in the NFL . Push the envelope and go all out to ensure each game for New England will be played at Gillette Stadium over the next month , or be conservative and try and take a shot at beating the woeful Dolphins with the bare minimum in terms of personnel and keep the rest out of harms way . It s all connected . If Edelman steps in and is his same old self , this entire offense will look much better .
