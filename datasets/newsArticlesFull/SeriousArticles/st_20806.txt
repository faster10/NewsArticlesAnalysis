Sadly , I have to wonder if Charlie Hebdo had been attacked for cartoons insulting Christians , whether there would be a similar outpouring in support of the magazine , especially in the United States . After all , many of the same people outraged just a month ago about the alleged " War on Christmas " have no qualms about launching a " War on Islam " because , well , it ' s not their religion being mischaracterized and insulted . It unsettles me to think that the reason so much of the outpouring of support for Charlie Hebdo is driven not just by the violence suffered or a defense of free speech , but by the opportunity to implicitly support jabs at Islam . But judging by some of the coverage , it seems a fair assumption to make .
