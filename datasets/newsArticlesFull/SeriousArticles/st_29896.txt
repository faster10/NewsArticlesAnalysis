The year s first major atrocity : Saudi Arabia s execution by beheading on Sunday of 47 people , including an important Shia ayatollah who led Shia protests against discrimination by the Sunni majority but never committed an act of violence . Even Islamic State ( IS ) does not behead 47 in one day . Although beheading is swift it strikes most of us as being grotesque as well as medieval . The Saudis are aware of their image in the outside world but nevertheless persist , as if they want to tell the rest of the world : Back off . Our Wahhabi ( ultra puritanical ) morality is our morality . We are a belief system unto ourselves .
