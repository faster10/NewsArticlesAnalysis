The Browns aren ' t a great job on the surface . There ' s no quarterback of the future ( Mike Garafolo of Fox Sports 1 reported that Jackson made it clear he ' d want to move on from Johnny Manziel ) . The previous two coaches got fired after three combined seasons . The Browns haven ' t won one playoff game since re entering the 1999 season . They ' ve been to the playoffs only once in that time . The entire organization , from owner Jimmy Haslam on down , is considered to be very dysfunctional , to say the least .
