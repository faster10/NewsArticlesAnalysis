Same questions , no doubt , that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama , and same questions they asked when , as first lady , she ran for the Senate in New York . In that race , she ended up spending a lot of all ears quality time in upstate New York . In this race , she could be spending a lot of all you can eat time at Diners , Drive ins and Dives just like the TV show . ( Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle . Just sayin . ' )
