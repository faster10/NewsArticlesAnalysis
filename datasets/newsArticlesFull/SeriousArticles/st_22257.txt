Steven Avery , whose murder conviction was examined in the wildly popular documentary Making a Murderer , has filed another appeal in which says a biased juror bullied the rest of the panel into finding him guilty . Avery was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of early release for the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach . The case has generated a fresh wave of publicity since the film ' s December release on Netflix . Avery , who was representing himself when he filed the appeal , last week secured a powerful new defense team . His original defense team said local law enforcement officials planted key evidence to convict Avery , who had already served 18 years for a wrongful sexual assault conviction .
