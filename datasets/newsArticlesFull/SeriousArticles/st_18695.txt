Those states with stricter gun control laws obviously still have gun violence and obviously still have gun toting criminals , and the San Bernardino shooting is a tragic example of that unfortunate reality . But it s nonsense to argue that gun control and bomb control is ineffective because guns and bombs will still exist . It s a deliberate attempt to mislead and argue that the existence of violence is a reason to do nothing to prevent violence . The logic is completely backwards and carefully spun to make it seem like it makes sense .
