Trump is , in one human size and poorly coiffed package , a better argument for public interest journalism ? la BBC News , except here in the States ? than any lefty socialist s coffee shop ramblings ( though call us any time , that s available , too ) . Trump knows that there is no news , just infotainment he can throw his weight around about Kelly because he knows he can juice the ratings on Saturday Night Live , Good Morning America , The Apprentice , or Thursday night s debates , depending on what he feels like doing on that day .
