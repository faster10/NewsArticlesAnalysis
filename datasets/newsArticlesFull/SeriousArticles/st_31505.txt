Fourth set : Djokovic 6 1 , 6 2 , 3 6 , 5 3 Federer ( denotes server ) : Djokovic suddenly ups his level , reaching for a forehand and drilling it past Federer , who had elected to serve volley . That s ominous . Very ominous . Federer then doesn t do enough with a volley and Djokovic raps a backhand past him for 0 30 . If Federer s not careful , the match could be settled in the next few points . Yet he gets it back to 15 30 and then , just when all seems lost , he offers a searing reminder of his greatness by winning an astonishing point . Djokovic appeared to have won it wrapped up on several occasions he had two smashes , for crying out loud ? but Federer somehow stayed in it . Djokovic speared a volley into the left corner ? and Federer incredibly flicked a backhand down the line ! That s one of the shots of the tournament . But it s not enough . Federer comes to the net on the next point and Djokovic wallops a backhand past him , though he did get lucky with a net cord ? Federer might have been able to win the point with a volley otherwise . Break point . It s effectively match point . Federer tries to serve volley . Djokovic s forehand is too good . He ll serve for a place in the final .
