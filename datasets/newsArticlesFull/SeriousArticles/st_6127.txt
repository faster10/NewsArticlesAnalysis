Age : As compared to Western countries , more women in India are afflicted with breast cancer at relatively younger age . It is important , therefore , to stay alert . Monthly self examination is important to keep a check on any lump , or change in shape or size of your breast area . Along with monthly self examination , a clinical breast examination every three years is recommended . After the age of 40 years , an yearly mammography is advisable . For women who are at a higher risk by way of family history or genetic testing results that indicate a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes ( these are tumour suppressor genes ) , an yearly mammography is recommended earlier after consultation with oncologist .
