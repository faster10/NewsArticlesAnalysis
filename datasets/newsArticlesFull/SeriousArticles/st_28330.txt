Why are people choosing to buy digitally rather than in person ? For one thing , it s much easier to stay in bed or at least in one s pajamas the morning after Thanksgiving rather than running out to the store . Not to mention that online shoppers don t have to face huge crowds of people . Orders can typically be placed immediately , without having to stand out in the cold in the middle of the night waiting in Black Friday s infamously long lines just to get a good deal . Granted , the weather was a lot nicer than usual in most states on Black Friday 2015 , but the lines themselves are enough to still drive people to seek out alternatives .
