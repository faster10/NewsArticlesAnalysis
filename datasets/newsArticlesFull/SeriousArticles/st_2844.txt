Massive illegal fishing of the totoaba has resurged in the past three years because its swim bladder is used as a very expensive traditional health food in China , especially in Guangdong and Hong Kong . Dealers along the isolated beaches of San Felipe and El Golfo de Santa Clara , two small fishing towns close to the U . S . border , buy swim bladders from fishermen by paying several thousand dollars per kilogram . Thousands of swim bladders are likely then smuggled across the border to the United States and shipped to China where a kilogram can be reportedly worth much more on the black market leaving thousands of dead totoabas and tens of drowned vaquitas to rot .
