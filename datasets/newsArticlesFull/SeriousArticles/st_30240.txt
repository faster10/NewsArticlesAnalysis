The Flint water crisis should embarrass both political parties . Michigan governor Rick Snyder , a Republican , appointed the " emergency managers " who approved and implemented the city ' s decision to use the Flint River as a water source . ( The river ' s corrosive properties caused dangerous amounts of lead from plumbing materials to leach into drinking water . ) The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ? run by a Snyder appointee ? failed badly in many ways as well ? in its obligations to protect the state ' s residents . ? But the city of Flint , long run by Democrats , also deserves blame it was Flint ' s municipal government that failed to properly treat the new water and to properly conduct the tests that would have immediately found problems with it . The EPA , which is ultimately under President Obama ' s supervision , has been rightfully criticized for its reaction to the crisis as well .
