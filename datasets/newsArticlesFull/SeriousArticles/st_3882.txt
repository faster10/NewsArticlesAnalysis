Unfortunately for the Patriots , Hightower hasn ' t been the only linebacker to deal with injuries this year . ? For the third consecutive season , former All Pro Jerod Mayo was placed on ? season ending injured reserve with a shoulder injury . ? However , Pro Bowler Jamie Collins ? who missed the Week 12 debacle and is dealing with a back injury ? has participated in practice this week , albeit in a limited capacity . If Collins can play , it would be a welcome addition to New England ' s defensive front seven . ?
