As a digital technology writer , I have had more than one former student and colleague tell me about digital switchers they have serviced through which calls and data are diverted to government servers or the big data algorithms they ' ve written to be used on our e mails by intelligence agencies . I always begged them to write about it or to let me do so while protecting their identities . They refused to come forward and believed my efforts to shield them would be futile . " I don ' t want to lose my security clearance . Or my freedom , " one told me .
