Rich Roll : I feel fantastic and I continue to learn and refine and try to do it better . Like most people , my life is busy , and recently with the book I haven ' t been able to train as regularly as I ' ve become accustomed to over the past several years . So when I ' m not on my schedule the way I like to be , then I don ' t feel as good . But in the balance of things looking back from 5 years ago to where I am now , it ' s nothing short of remarkable . If anything I am more a believer than I ever have been in the program that I talk about in the book and have every intention of continuing on this path . At the time , five years ago , all I wanted to do was lose a little weight and feel better . I had no idea it would lead to the life that I ' m leading now . It ' s crazy .
