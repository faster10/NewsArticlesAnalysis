10 . ' Pane , amore e fantasia ' ( Luigi Comencini , 1953 ) " Starring Gina Lollobrigida and Vittorio De Sica , this is a wonderfully innocent , sexy comedy set in central Italy in a little village that is incredibly backward and rural . It ' s about a young woman who is courted by a lot of admirers , including a local police chief . It ' s really about the feisty , unputdownable spirit of Italy . When we think of Italy , even in a slightly cliched way spaghetti , sun and the whole cult of love , the feisty women and the men playing lotharios this film just embodies that vibrant life force and energy . It ' s a very funny romantic comedy . "
