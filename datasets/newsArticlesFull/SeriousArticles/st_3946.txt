Cybercrime is an issue that needs more attention . According to one European intelligence service , there are 20 to 30 criminal gangs in the former Soviet Union that have hacking skills as good as most nations . There are many other groups with lesser skills . These criminals are nimble and inventive , and there are thriving cybercrime black markets where you can buy the latest hacking tools . This means there are highly skilled criminals who live in safe havens but can use the Internet to commit crimes that can earn millions of dollars , for which they will never be arrested or tried . Why would they stop ? While there is good cooperation among Western countries against cybercrime , Russia has little interest in stopping these groups .
