That ' s because to my parents , it wasn ' t enough for me to just go to college . There was only one school they saw as a fitting goal , and it was the reason they came to America , my mother said , hoping that one day they would have kids who would grow up to attend it . That was Harvard University , the only school whose brand name shone brightly enough to reach across the waters to Taiwan . Other schools might offer a more dynamic curriculum , better access to senior faculty , a greater amount of financial aid . None of that mattered . To them , it was Hafu Daxue or bust .
