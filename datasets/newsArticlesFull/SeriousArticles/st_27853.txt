Next up , Konta has another very winnable match against an even more surprising quarter finalist : Shuai Zhang of China , who beat a hobbling Madison Keys in three sets . Ranked No 133 in the world , Zhang had never even won a grand slam match until this event , which she had to qualify for by coming through three preliminary matches last week . She may be in the groove , after seven victories in 13 days , but Zhang is also likely to be feeling those miles in her legs when she returns to the court on Wednesday .
