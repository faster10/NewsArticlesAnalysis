EW was on set for the filming of the game changing scene , and scored an exclusive interview with co creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas . The pair revealed , among many other things , that we likely would have met the mother in May 2013 no matter what : The original plan was for the show to end after just eight seasons ( meaning it would have been over . . . now ) , with the mother briefly introduced in the series finale . Only after HIMYM was extended to nine seasons did Bays and Thomas make the decision to reveal the mother before the final season in tonight ' s episode . ( Though it seems Ted won ' t be coming face to face with her until much later next season . )
