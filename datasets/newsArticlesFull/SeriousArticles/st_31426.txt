Over the last four and a half years , I was told al Ajlani had traveled all over the country , filmed many battles , spent time with soldiers , interviewed their commanders and talked to refugees . I told my contact that of course I was interested , but I would prefer to come to Damascus , meet al Ajlani and do more than see his footage . " We ' ll see , " I was told . I was surprised when , within a matter of weeks , I had an invitation from the president ' s office . The Ministry of Information would support the trip . But I would not have a minder , and our visas would be open ended .
