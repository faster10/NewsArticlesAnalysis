The Dingle Peninsula is worth exploring by bike or car . It ' s 10 miles wide and runs 40 miles from Tralee to Slea Head . The top of its mountainous spine is Mount Brandon , at 3 , 130 feet , the second tallest mountain in Ireland . While only tiny villages lie west of Dingle Town , the peninsula is home to 500 , 000 sheep . The weather on this distant tip of Ireland is often misty , foggy , and rainy . But don ' t complain as locals will explain , there is no bad weather . . . only inappropriate clothing .
