Fowler : Backups do backup things . Since you ' re no backup , Coley , you know what ' s up . Good starting quarterbacks can ' t be overstated in the NFL . The Steelers have elite weapons all over the field , yet couldn ' t score more than 25 points in any of their last four games . Roethlisberger , though hobbled , will get the Steelers into their offense , make the proper checks , throw with accuracy and run the no huddle he loves so well . He ' ll also inject new life into receivers that have waited patiently for his return . The biggest issue is lateral movements . Can he protect himself from the rush while moving side to side ? Only live game reps can tell that .
