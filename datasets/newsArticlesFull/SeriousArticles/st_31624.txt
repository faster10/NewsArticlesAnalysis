Jamie Collins had the oddest of days . He made some truly spectacular plays , both against the run and twice sacking Manning , but he was beaten by Owen Daniels for two touchdowns . One of his sacks was a direct result of his running partner , Dont a Hightower , barreling into Matt Paradis and knocking the center into running back Ronnie Hillman . The second sack was a result of a perfectly timed delayed blitz , as Collins ran past rookie guard Max Garcia untouched . But Collins was badly turned around by a head fake from Daniels and beaten up the seam for a 21 yard TD , then was beaten by Daniels double move for a 12 yard score . So he had eight tackles , two sacks , three tackles for losses and gave up two TDs . That s a negative net . Jonathan Freeney made the kind of heads up play Bill Belichick teaches when he picked up what Hillman thought was an incomplete pass in the flat . After a challenge , officials confirmed it was a lateral . That was a key moment as it handed the Pats the ball at Denver s 22 , setting up their only touchdown until the final minute of the game .
