HB : You can only pray so if you don t take it into account the sheer numbers . The Greek debt is about 320 billion 240 billion in total was paid as bailout money . The vast amount of that money comes from Germany . In the end it will be the tax payers , the small earners who will actually have to foot the bill . There is no question about that . On a footnote so to say , I don t really understand why Merkel truly is the Person of the Year . I mean , TIME Magazine is an American magazine . On the Statue of Liberty it says : Bring me your poor , bring your tired , bring the huddled masses So , why doesn t TIME magazine take Ms . Merkel to America , because it is exactly what she will do . She will open the gates , there is no control , throw away the passports , then you can t be sent back , here is 500 , if it is not enough here is 700 , bring your friends , bring your family . And one million refugees will turn into five million . I know that Donald Trump is not exactly a friend of this kind of policy . I d love to see Angela Merkel and Donald Trump as a circus act . And I am sure people would pay to see that .
