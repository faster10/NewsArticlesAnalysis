On December 1st , over 100 " prominent " African American pastors had a private meeting with GOP Presidential Candidate Donald Trump , to supposedly hear his vision of what he would do to provide upward mobility for the African American community in the U . S . Now being a New Yorker all my life and having an understanding of politics since I was 7 , I can say that Donald Trump has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the African American communities here in the City of New York . One of the most prominent events I remember is when Trump launched a personal campaign to really destroy the lives of the Central Park 5 without knowing the full story behind the case . Now what I find very mind boggling is that there are over a dozen GOP presidential candidates that these " prominent " pastors could have met with : Cruz , Rubio , Pataki , Christie , Bush , Carson , Fiorina to name a few that I am very confident would have a realistic plan in addressing this issue , but Donald Trump ? You pastors that met with him are a disgrace to the progress of our communities and to use the " calling " of the ministry to seek your own personal gains is not the work of God .
