Position group you need to know : Clemson ' s defensive line . You will hear a bunch of justified praise for Alabama ' s defensive front , quite possibly the best collection Saban has ever had . But Clemson ' s line shouldn ' t be overshadowed by any group . The Tigers had to completely reset after losing All American Vic Beasley and others , but they held up well this season . Their depth showed up in the semifinal after All America end Shaq Lawson ( 23 . 5 tackles for loss , 10 . 5 sacks ) suffered a knee injury in the first quarter . Lawson says he will play in the title game , but get to know names such as end Kevin Dodd ( 18 . 5 tackles for loss , nine sacks ) and tackle Carlos Watkins ( 6 . 5 tackles for loss , 3 . 5 sacks ) . They will be big factors as Clemson faces Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry .
