Black Catholics have a heightened awareness of what W . E . B . Dubois called " double consciousness . " This emerges from the tension between one ' s awareness of self and how others perceive one . Dubois used this term to speak of the experience of black people within the segregated United States . Today , a particular form of double consciousness is experienced by black Catholics : as a religious minority within the broader black Church community , who defend our religious affiliation to our black Protestant brothers and sisters while also confronting discrimination and ignorance from those within our own Catholic churches .
