Hence , we get Donald Trump s massively impractical immigration plan . His supporters don t seem to care that deporting 12 million people is impossible , while immigrants unlucky enough to be ensnared by Trump s goon squads would be frog marched back to Mexico in a visual spectacle resembling some of the worst chapters in human history . Combine that with his border fence featuring , somehow , one big beautiful door , and it s a plan so ridiculous that it might as well include jetpacks made of beef for all border patrol agents . ( Trump : My jetpacks made of beef will be terrific ! Believe me ! ) We also heard about a spate of equally loopy GOP tax plans ? including Ben Carson s biblical tithing tax plan . Each tax plan balloons the deficit more than the other , even though every single candidate denies it in the face of nonpartisan scoring . Ted Cruz s tax plan , for example , involves submitting our tax returns on postcards . Where do we send the postcards ? No clue . Cruz wants to abolish the IRS , there d have to be a replacement agency to collect the cards and the tax due payments , then enforce the tax law against anyone who refused .
