Mark Ronson : I just think that because my own albums are more collaborative affairs . . . I ' ve got this tag of master collaborator , but I don ' t think it ' s necessarily true . If this was a report card from school , it would say " Plays well with others . " That ' s one of the things that helps and more importantly I grew up liking such a wide range of music that I love working in different genres . Not being stuck in one genre definitely widens the palette of the kind of people you can work with .
