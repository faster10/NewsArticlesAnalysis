Hewitt was perceptive of his similarities with Warne , certainly when it came to their competitiveness and drive . His sporting philosophy sat at odds with the staid world of tennis . I get pumped up on the court , I like to show emotion and not everyone likes it , he told tennis writer Neil Harman back in 2001 , when the worst of his on court behaviour had mildly scandalised the sport . But it s me . When I was a kid playing footy , if one of the boys kicked a goal , we d be in a hug in the centre of the ground . Then it was back to your position . It s the only way I know to play sport . If I was playing cricket , I d be just like Shane Warne . I need to be in that mood to play my best tennis .
