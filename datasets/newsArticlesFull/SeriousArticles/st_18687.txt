In the absence of any effective conflict resolution forum , the mutual conflicts between the states are tending to be full fledged confrontation in the Middle East . In the past , the OIC , the collective voice of the Muslim world , has been an effective forum to debate and discuss the issues confronted by the Muslim countries . Regrettably , owing to multiple reasons , this forum has become quite inactive and ineffective . Therefore , Pakistan s current diplomatic efforts directed towards seeking the peaceful solution of Middle East crisis should also be appreciated and supported by the other Muslims countries . Presently , the so called D8 countries possess the considerable economic and military muscles in the Muslim world . Besides Pakistan , these countries should also play their respective role in easing the conflict between two Muslim states . China has also announced similar peace initiatives to help resolve the current crisis in the Middle East . Therefore , Pakistan should launch a concerted diplomatic campaign in a systematic and synchronised manner in collaboration with China and other D8 countries to ease tension in world s most volatile and troubled part .
