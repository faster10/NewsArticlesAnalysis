Aaron on Jackie Robinson : " Of course , back then ( when I was a youngster ) , my mother expected me to go to school , but I had read the Dodgers were going to play an exhibition game in Mobile . Jackie was speaking at a drugstore and I said , ' I ' m not going to get this opportunity again , so I better take my chances and listen to Jackie Robinson now . ' Little did I know , I got front row seats , and next to me was my father . It was worth it , and I don ' t need to tell you what happened after that ( a spanking ) ! But it was worth it . ( Jackie ) was my hero , always had been and not only because the baseball player he was , but for the person he was . "
