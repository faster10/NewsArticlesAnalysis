Running back Dalvin Cook , whose 7 . 4 yards per carry average ranked second in the country this season , will be a Heisman frontrunner , and he gets an experienced line blocking for him , anchored by left tackle Roderick Johnson . Quarterback Sean Maguire showed notable improvement over the season but could also lose the job to Deondre Francois if the freshman developed in his redshirt year . The Seminoles defense could be the best in the ACC even with Ramsey s departure , as Derwin James , DeMarcus Walker and Josh Sweat all appear poised to become stars .
