The story s main threads involve Charlie Brown ( Noah Schnapp ) dealing with his crush on a new neighbor ? a little red haired girl , of course ? as well as the unfamiliar attention he gets for surprisingly acing a standardized test . Meanwhile , Snoopy s WWI flying ace also gets a lot of screen time , as the movie gets wrapped up in dazzling aerial visuals , and willfully ignores our tendency to dismiss the Red Baron stuff as tedious Great Pumpkin filler . ( Archival recordings of late , signature Peanuts animator Bill Melendez are used for Snoopy s voice . )
