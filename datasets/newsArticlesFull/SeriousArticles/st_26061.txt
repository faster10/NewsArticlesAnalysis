On issues of race , gender , and sexual orientation , it too often seems that achievements to promote equality are met with challenges and setbacks in other areas . As an African American man , and as a gay man , Rustin faced discrimination from many fronts , including from within the movement he did so much to build . Controversies about his sexual orientation forced him to resign from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , where he was a head organizer with Dr King , in 1960 .
