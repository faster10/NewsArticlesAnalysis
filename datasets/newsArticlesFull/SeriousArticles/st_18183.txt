But isn ' t the U . S . military even more capable than the Turkish military ? Yes , the U . S . military could go in and initially smash ISIS and the other Islamist groups , but as I said in my book , The Failure of Counterinsurgency , in the long run ( and it will be long ) , if the United States is using U . S . forces , instead of local or regional forces , to battle guerrillas , it will be much less likely to win . Such forces know the local culture better than U . S . forces and have better intelligence on who is a guerrilla and who is not .
