I know that if you take a look at what s actually in the TPP , you will see that this is , in fact , a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first , Obama wrote in a blog post on Medium on Thursday .

And if we don t pass this agreement ? if America doesn t write those rules ? then countries like China will . And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world .
