I guess it s with the prestige films and the big studio films . There are independents that have a wider array of ethnicities and races represented . But it s everywhere in Hollywood . It s at the talent agencies , in the studio hierarchies , it s true here ? as I pointed out in the story ? here at Variety . We re a mostly white newsroom here . It s throughout the industry . If you don t keep after this goal , inertia is a powerful thing , and it will win the day if you don t make a conscious effort to change things .
