Florida Gov . Rick Scott claimed the purge was necessary to get noncitizens off the registration rolls . Of course , if a state confirms that noncitizens are on the rolls , it should take appropriate steps to remove them . But that is not what the Sunshine State was doing . Rather , the state created a list rife with errors that many local election officials warned from the start was inaccurate . This flawed list was used to send purge notices to hundreds of eligible citizens , disproportionately Hispanic and members of other minority groups . Among them was Bill Internicola , a Brooklyn born 91 year old WWII veteran , who said he was " flabbergasted " when he received such a letter .
