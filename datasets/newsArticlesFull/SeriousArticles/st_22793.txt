Those suggesting that the decision to rest Duncan in some way constitutes the Spurs punting on Monday ' s game should perhaps pump the brakes . San Antonio ' s 7 0 without Duncan this season , and has been nearly as dominant on both ends of the floor when Duncan has been off it . Plus , Duncan ' s expected replacement in the starting lineup ? veteran big man David West ? isn ' t exactly a slouch , averaging 8 . 6 points , 5 . 9 rebounds and 2 . 1 assists in 23 . 6 minutes per game as a starter this season , with San Antonio winning all nine contests .
