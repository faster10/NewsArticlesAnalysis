The House on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill that would increase scrutiny on people traveling to the U . S . from 38 so called visa waiver countries , from which people can visit the U . S . without visas . Travelers from these countries who have visited " high risk " nations , including Iraq , Iran , Syria , and Sudan , since March 2011 , or who have dual citizenship , would have to submit to an interview at a U . S . consulate , like travelers from other countries do . The goal , House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R Wisc . ) said , is to " help neutralize the threat from foreign terrorists entering our country . "
