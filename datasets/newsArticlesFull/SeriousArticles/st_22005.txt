Before she gets to a possible match up with Sharapova , or even the fourth round , she must deal with another Russian , the teenager Daria Kasatkina , who beat Venus in Auckland . Kasatkina defeated the Croatian Ana Konjuh 6 4 , 6 3 . I don t think it s gonna be easy , the world No1 said of her world No69 opponent . Any time someone is beating Venus they are more than likely playing really good . I definitely will be ready for that . I will ask Venus what she thought of the match , and I m sure Patrick Mouratoglou , her coach will know everything about her match . He s really good at studying .
