The Republican candidates for president , obviously , have no answers . Marco Rubio scoffed that I don t hear anybody talking about bomb control , noting that Farook and Malik apparently put together an arsenal of pipe bombs . But none of those devices was successfully detonated . It s hard to build a bomb , even harder to make it explode when and where you choose . The San Bernardino victims all died from gunshots the assailants were armed with semiautomatic assault rifles that had been modified to make them more lethal .
