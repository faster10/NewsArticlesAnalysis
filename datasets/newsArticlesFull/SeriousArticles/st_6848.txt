Martin : Marty Scorsese would want the song , say , " All Things Must Pass , " which is a classic track from a classic album , but it ' s made for vinyl . And if you played it in the cinema , it wouldn ' t be the way you remember it sounding . It would sound small . So you ' re ripping everything apart and putting it together so it sounds how you think you should remember it . And that ' s a challenge , because you have to pay utmost respect to the original creation , and at the same time , you have to rub everyone ' s memories the right way .
