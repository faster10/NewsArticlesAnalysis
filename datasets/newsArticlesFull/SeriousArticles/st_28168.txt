Marx died in 1883 , before his books gained a wide readership and before the workers he had been fighting for took their places in government as representatives of labor and socialist political parties . It had taken decades of struggle largely nonviolent for this to occur . But Marx knew the path to progress would be slow , and that ultimately the best way to re balance society was through the ballot box . He also believed , however , that the working man had the right to revolt if those in power tried to deny him such political expression free speech , free assembly , freedom of the press and the vote .
