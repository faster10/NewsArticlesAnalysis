We are also in a political era when politicians are more in the public eye than ever before . Like it or not , appearance matters . When William Howard Taft weighing in at over 300 pounds was president , most Americans rarely saw him , though jokes about his weight still circulated . But it was still a very different world . In the early 20th century , there was no television or Internet broadcasting constant footage of the president in action . Other than the occasional still image in the newspaper , or the footage in the newsreels before movies until the 1940s , politics was still a medium of words and print .
