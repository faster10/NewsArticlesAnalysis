The splashy TV buy isn t entirely unprecedented , but it is certainly unusual , especially during a primary . It s also a reminder that the Bush super PAC has so much money that it barely knows what to do with it . The group brought in more than 100 million in first half of this year , a total that ? even with Jeb s struggles ? has continued to grow this fall . It s hard to overstate just how much of an advantage in outside money Bush has over his more popular rivals . Through the end of June , Bush aligned groups reported bringing in 108 . 5 million since the start of the year , roughly 70 million more than his closest outside money rival ( Ted Cruz ) and more than the combined total of every Republican not named Jeb still in the 2016 race . Even before a recent spending binge last month , Bush and his allies were outspending their rivals on the airwaves by more than a 2 to 1 margin and still had plenty in the bank .
