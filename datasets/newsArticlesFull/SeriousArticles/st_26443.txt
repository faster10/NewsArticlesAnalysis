Whether we ' ve got a trade surplus or deficit must , as a matter of mathematical necessity , equal out with whether the government is running a surplus or deficit , plus whether Americans are saving or borrowing more on net . It ' s complicated , but the takeaway is we can counteract the trade deficit at different levels of national economic output , i . e . higher or lower GDP . So we can address it in a way that delivers full employment , or in ways that deliver a chronic lack of employment . Probably the best way to balance out at full employment is to get everyone ' s currencies back on an even keel .
