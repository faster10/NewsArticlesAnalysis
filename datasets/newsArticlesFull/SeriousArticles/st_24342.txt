" In twenty years , all my experience of Alan was like this , " he said . " He ' d be on a mad press trip round the world , having just finished a broadway show and be about to start shooting a film with several other projects as an actor , director , writer , board member , mentor bubbling away in the background and if I needed anything he would immediately spend hours of his time helping me . AND , amazingly , I know of at least a dozen other people who had this same relationship with him . "
