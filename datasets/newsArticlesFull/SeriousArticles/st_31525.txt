Sanders has now proposed a lot of major tax increases on the wealthy . He has proposed the 2 . 2 percent premium , the expanded estate tax , the elimination of special treatment for capital gains , and the increased marginal rates mentioned above . He also has laid out an additional 6 . 2 percent hike in payroll taxes and a 6 . 2 percent surcharge on capital gains for those earning at least 250 , 000 a year to fund his plan for Social Security . And he wants to impose a tax on financial transactions . It seems probable that such a tax would be paid mainly by the rich employees and investors whose bread is buttered on Wall Street .
