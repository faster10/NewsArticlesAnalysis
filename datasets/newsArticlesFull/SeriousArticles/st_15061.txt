Star Wars also features Oscar winner Lupita Nyong ' o as a wise Yoda like creature a rare opportunity to see a young beautiful actress do wildly inventive character work in a mainstream movie . This also parallels another groundbreaking achievement for Nyong ' o who will soon star in the play Eclipsed , the first Broadway production ever to have a writer , director , and cast entirely comprised of women and women of color at that . With Eclipsed , Broadway audiences will experience the riveting stories of resilient African women based on true events during the Second Liberian Civil War . The play is a window into lives that are very real and rich but which have rarely been subjects of mainstream entertainment until now . It is no surprise that the director is Liesl Tommy , whom I have praised for putting into practice her keen understanding ofhow telling stories with diversity in mind always expands the audience ' s experience .
