Mezrich : Yes , the same producers from " The Social Network " are making " Sex On The Moon . " Scott Rudin , Dana Brunetti , Mike DeLuca , Kevin Spacey . They are unbelievable talents and it ' s amazing to have them making this . It ' s with Sony Columbia Pictures again , they ' ve done such great things with my previous two movies . It ' s going to be awesome . And hopefully " Sex On The Moon " will be my first movie that keeps the title of the book ! How can you not love " Sex On The Moon ? "
