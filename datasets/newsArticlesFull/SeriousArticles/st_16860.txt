And that s perfectly OK . Supporters of either candidate , which represent two poles within the party , shouldn t downplay these differences in favor of the concept of theories of change . I don t believe that Democrats are debating the best tactics for getting to the same place . I think the two leading candidates , and more to the point the two coalitions they represent , just want different things . The presidency , which leads the executive branch and its bureaucracy , allows you to accomplish a sliver of those things , irrespective of the other two branches of government . And voters are making choices based on their preference of which of those programs they would like to see put into action .
