For once I m not beating up Obama from the other side I get it . It never seemed like the right moment . Why get the haters and the birthers all stirred up again ? We have an election to fight , a budget bill to pass , and so on . But the fact that one of the world s major faiths has become so toxic , as an element in American public discourse , that the contamination reached the daily strategic planning of the Obama White House , however indirectly , is remarkable . And no , the Muslims did not bring this on themselves , by being all weird and crazy and beheading people on YouTube . The number of Americans killed in the name of militant Islam since 9 11 barely registers as a statistical asterisk . Add the more serious attacks in Paris , London and Madrid over that period , and Western casualties from Islamic terrorism are still less than one week of highway fatalities in the United States .
