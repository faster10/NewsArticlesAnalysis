AS : I got the idea to weave with cassette tape when I saw Tibetan Buddhist prayer flags for the first time many years ago . It was explained to me at the time that the flags often have images of sacred sounds , or " mantras , " block printed onto them . Colorful strings of these flags are hung in auspicious locations where the wind can " activate " the sounds , sending " good vibes " out around the world on the breeze . This immediately reminded me of experiences I ' d had racing small sailboats as a kid . When sailing , it ' s imperative to remain aware of subtle variations in the direction and speed of the wind at all times .
