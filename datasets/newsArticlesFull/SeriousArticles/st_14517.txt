A few paces into my sprint , I heard a barking German shepherd barreling down on me . My arms pumped hard as I stretched my stride and ran faster than I ' d ever run before . The barks got louder . I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in . He leapt and latched his teeth onto my leg . I looked down . The dog hung from my calf . I shoved his head with both hands . He snarled and gnashed violently as I struggled to pry him loose . The dog ' s jaw unlocked , taking a meaty chunk with him . Blood spurted on my prisoner uniform , the dog ' s mouth everywhere . I tried not to cry . Not in front of my father , not in front of the other men and boys .
