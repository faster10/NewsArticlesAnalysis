" I think if his teammates saw it as a distraction or something that was out of what they deem to be a team player and deem legitimate , then I think they d say something , " said cornerback Richard Sherman . " Until his teammates say anything , I think it s fine . His teammates rallied behind him . They understand where he s coming from . It was a tough point in the ballgame , there was frustration . When you re in a ballgame , there s passion . If you have a guy sitting there with his helmet down and just walking out there with no passion , you d be complaining , too .
