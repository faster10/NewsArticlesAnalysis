It s a little strange that Clinton would choose to go down this road , given past experience . In a 2007 Democratic primary debate , also held in Charleston , South Carolina , Barack Obama responded affirmatively to a YouTube question about whether he would be willing to meet without precondition with the leaders of countries like Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba , and North Korea . The Clinton campaign seized on the answer as evidence of Obama s lack of foreign policy qualifications , with Clinton herself calling it irresponsible and frankly na ? ve . As you ll recall , that line of attack didn t quite pan out for Clinton . ( The concerns also proved mostly unfounded as the Obama administration waited until midway through his second term to change the status quo with Cuba and Iran . Syria is a whole other ugly story . )
