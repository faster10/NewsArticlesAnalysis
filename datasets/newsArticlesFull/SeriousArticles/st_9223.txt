Beautiful relationships between NBC and stars often begin in that famous interrogation room . Just look at Hayden Panettiere ' s two roles ramping up to Heroes , and Maria Bello ' s significant role last season en route to Prime Suspect ( which really is getting better save that show ! ) . Even though Knight ' s return to TV was welcome in my eyes , I found his performance weirdly unsatisfying . He didn ' t get to sink his teeth into his role ( s ) as much as I ' d hoped because a lot of the episode was devoted to initiating new detectives Nick Amaro ( Danny Pino ) and Amanda Rollins ( Kelli Giddish ) plus , his characters ' Southern accent sounded a bit inconsistent anyone else notice that ?
