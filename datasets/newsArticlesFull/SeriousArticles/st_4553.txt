O Malley had harsh ? even hyperbolic ? criticism of Clinton , whose ? main climate proposal ? is to offer extra incentives to states and individuals to ramp up solar energy by 700 percent in 10 years . ? Her goal would be to reach 33 percent of clean energy in the electric grid by 2027 , up from 16 percent today . ?

Her approach is much more incremental . ?
