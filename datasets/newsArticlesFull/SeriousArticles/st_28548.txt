After seven movies spanning thirty nine years , Stallone has taken his most pivotal role and given it a lick of paint , as well as a breath of fresh air . Balboa is no longer a star , a champion , he s a shell of his former self , trying to realize old glories by training Adonis Creed , the son of his former friend , Apollo Creed , who died at the hands of Ivan Drago in Rocky IV . Along the way , he faces some personal struggles of his own , which inspire the younger Creed to strive for glory . Its an outstanding performance from an actor that has been a part of the Hollywood echelon for so many years .
