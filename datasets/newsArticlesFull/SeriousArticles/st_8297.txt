Mulder ' s phone . There has been much made of Mulder and Scully ' s integration of , and lampooning of , modern day technology . " Mulder , the internet is not good for you , " Scully tells him as he uses his phone to reference a fact to bolster his creature theory . But mostly Mulder can ' t quite get the hang of the camera app he ' s trying to use ( does he mean the phone ' s actual camera ? ) and proceeds to flash the hell out of the body of a victim , and later take a selfie video of his own horrified face , completely missing the monster . " Go to settings ! " pleads ? " X Files " fan " Silicon Valley " star Kumail Nanjiani , who , as an animal control officer , seems here to lightly reference his programmer character from the HBO show . But all is forgiven when we hear Mark Snow ' s familiar " X Files " theme , which is somehow , in this parody of parodies , Mulder ' s actual ringtone .
