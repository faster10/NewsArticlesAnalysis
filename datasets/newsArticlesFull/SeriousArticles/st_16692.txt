The other issue was that the announcement seemed to cheapen the legacy of the band s farewell shows , a finale that seemed special because it was , well , final . The band had made a pretty big deal out of this , going so far as to ask fans to dress in black because it was a funeral . Any LCD fan worth his skinny black tie could think back on it and think , I was there . In the years that followed , the band never backed off on this , releasing the show first as a concert film that premiered at Sundance , then as a DVD , and then in 2014 as an official live album called The Long Goodbye . Whether you really were there or just heard it later , the point of the show was that it was the last time , and that line meant more than ever because this time it was actually true . ( In fact , it got one of the biggest cheers of the night . )
