Along these lines , on Monday , Republican members of the Senate ' s Gang of Eight pushed to augment the period of time that an undocumented person would have to maintain legal permanent residency before applying for citizenship . The proposal extends the current waiting period from eight to 10 years . The negotiated time frame would permit applicants to naturalize three years after gaining legal permanent residency for a total of a 13 year path to citizenship . This proposal is on par with the current citizenship process , except that it would extend the period for permanent residency and shorten the period for naturalization .
