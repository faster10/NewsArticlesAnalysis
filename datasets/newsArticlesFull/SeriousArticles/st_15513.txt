Every year at this time she travels to the heart of the Cairngorms National Park in Royal Deeside , just outside the small town of Ballater . Here , behind large metal gates that keep the public outside for most of the royal family ' s visit , she has the privacy to stroll with her corgis around the gardens , catch up on correspondence at her Honka Hut ( a pine summer cottage that was a gift from the Finnish government and is one of the queen ' s favorite spots on the estate ) , go fly fishing on the river Dee , or take in a round of golf on her private course .
