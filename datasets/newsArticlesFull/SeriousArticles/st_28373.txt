And if you ' re like most people , you ' re not immune to arrest . Police can potentially arrest you for minor infractions like littering , jaywalking , and traffic offenses . And just because they arrest you , should they be able to swipe through your pictures and text messages ? Police can search containers on your person without a warrant if they contain evidence that might be destroyed , or a potential weapon . Unless you can throw your iPhone like a ninja shuriken , it ' s probably not much of a weapon .
