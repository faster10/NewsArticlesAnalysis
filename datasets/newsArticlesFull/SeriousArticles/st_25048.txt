Stone : Of course it ' s an anti war movie , because I happen to be an anti war person . That ' s not to say I ' m a pacifist . I believe you fight for the right reasons . This man has us in three wars right now Iraq , Afghanistan , and basically , the war on terror . We have a foreign policy which is a very preventive one , a pre emptive one . It ' s a Bush doctrine . It ' s a very dangerous place . Whoever wins the election , Obama or McCain , I think is going to live in the shadow of the events of these last eight years . This man . . . will be around , his influence will be felt for 20 years , 40 years .
