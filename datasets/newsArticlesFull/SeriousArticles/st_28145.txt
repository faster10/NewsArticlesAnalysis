Glasgow won the game and will take the four points on offer but that was just about all they will take from this . They stay second in the league and on course for a home play off but they will need to play a whole lot better if this is to be achieved . Worryingly , one of their most consistent performers this season , Rob Harley , went off with a nasty looking leg injury which will definitely keep him out of the return match at Murrayfield and time will tell how many other games . His work rate has laid the platform that has allowed the Warriors to perform and , although they have strength in depth in this area , the injuries are mounting with Adam Ashe and Chris Fusaro and he will be missed .
