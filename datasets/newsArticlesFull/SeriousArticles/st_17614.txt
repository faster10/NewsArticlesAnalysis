People are going to be moved from tax credits to universal credit ? a new system that rolls six benefits into one ? over the course of this parliament . That is a long planned ( and long delayed ) policy , rather than an innovation : but in July the chancellor made the universal credit less generous at the same time as he announced cuts to tax credits . These cuts went relatively unnoticed because few people have been moved to UC yet , and even fewer understand the system . However , those cuts remain in place , which means that as people shift to the new system , the Treasury s savings will start to come through . The Resolution Foundation think tank estimates that about 3m families on UC will be about ? 1 , 000 a year worse off in 2020 , suggesting the pain of the chancellor s welfare squeeze has been delayed rather than cancelled or redirected on to a different group of people .
