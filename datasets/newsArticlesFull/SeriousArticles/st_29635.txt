One does not need even to look as far back as Libya in 2011 to see Clinton embracing wreckless , hawkish positions in the Middle East . As of this moment Clinton is calling for a no fly zone in Syria ? an act that would by definition , involve the US potentially shooting down not just Syrian planes but Russian ones as well . If this looks like regime change , that s because it almost certainly is , According to one 2013 Defense Department estimate a no fly zone over Syria would entail bombing Syrian military infrastructure and would require over 70 , 000 servicemen ? and this was before Russia entered the war last fall . The costs are almost certainly much higher now .
