It means that I have to get off the ball a little quicker and I need to get to him in 1 . 8 seconds , to be honest with you . With a guy like Brady , you have to be able to have good corners , which we have that can give the pass rushers a little extra time to get there . If he s getting the ball off in 1 . 9 seconds , nobody is ever going to get to him . You can see that from the Kansas City game , in which they had Kansas City LB Tamba Hali and they had Kansas City LB Justin Houston and they still couldn t get there . You have to be able to have those corners to buy you just a little more time to get to him .
