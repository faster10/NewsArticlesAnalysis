Chile is today a far more prosperous country than it was 50 years ago . Its economy is considered the most dynamic and advanced in all of Latin America even though still ravaged now by a grossly unfair distribution of income . This relative affluence of Chile ( the GDP today is 15 times more than in 1960 ! ) leaves us better equipped to deal with our current catastrophe , as we have human and scientific resources that we could scarcely have dreamt of back then , to the point that our wonderful outgoing president , Michele Bachelet , initially informed the international community that the country would not require foreign assistance ( she has since modified that stance and aid from abroad is starting to arrive ) .
