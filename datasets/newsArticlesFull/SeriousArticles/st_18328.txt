This is also true for people who are prediabetic . According to the CDC , 79 million Americans are prediabetic , which means their glucose readings fall between 100 and 125 while fasting . According to the American Diabetes Association , normal glucose readings are 100 and below when a person has not eaten anything . Numbers above 125 while fasting are considered to be in the diabetic range . So when you ' re prediabetic , it ' s easier to turn those numbers around . And that ' s important , because once you become a diabetic , even if you drop your numbers , you will always be classified as a diabetic , making it difficult to acquire good insurance .
