MR : I ' m sort of lucky to live in New York where I live a pretty anonymous lifestyle anyway . I ' m a bit more aware of it when I come to London and sometimes I think I ' m almost naive to think it doesn ' t exist . I ' d still like to think that I could just live the same life I did 3 years ago , going on the Tube , or going to see a band and walking around the front to watch and realizing that I ' ll probably just have to stand here and take pictures with people ' s camera phones , which is fun . I ' m not mobbed , nobody really cares that much about my life and I just get to live it how I would otherwise .
