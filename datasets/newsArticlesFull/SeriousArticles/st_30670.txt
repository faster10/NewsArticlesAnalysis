But while the underlying point is fair ? plenty of voters are not yet engaged , and many early state voters make a final decision fairly late in the process ? I think it s a mistake to discount polls like these entirely . Those other candidates may have briefly led national polls in previous cycles , but none of them dominated in state and national polling , for months on end , the way Trump has this year . Indeed , looking back , candidates who tended to dominate consistently the year before the primaries ? George W . Bush comes to mind ? ended up doing quite well .
