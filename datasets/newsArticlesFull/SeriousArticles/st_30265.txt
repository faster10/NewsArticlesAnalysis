At 39 . 5 points , the game total on Seahawks Vikings is the lowest of Week 18 . As five point road favorites , Seattle ' s team total is a hair above 22 points . . . . The biggest Wild Card Weekend storyline is the return of Marshawn Lynch from a seven week abdominal injury , which followed recurring calf and hamstring woes that cost Lynch two early season games and parts of others . It ' s fair to speculate Lynch ' s 29 year old body might ' ve refreshed during his time off , and that Lynch could return with " fresh legs . " After Lynch averaged 3 . 76 yards per carry and spent the majority of 2015 on the shelf , however , it ' s also fair to wonder if he simply may not have much left . Lynch ' s full week of " full " practices bodes well , however , while the Seahawks ' coaching staff has been adamant Lynch will return capable of handling a full workload . The matchup is slightly above average versus a Vikings run defense that ended 2015 ranked 18th in Football Outsiders ' DVOA . I ' m not quite comfortable projecting Lynch for over 18 touches , but I do expect him to play well in his opportunities . On a weak running back slate , Lynch is a top two DFS running back play this week . . . . Minnesota ' s defense held the Bears ' offense to 17 points in Week 15 , the Giants to 17 points in Week 16 , and the Packers to 13 points in Week 17 . With FS Harrison Smith and SLB Anthony Barr back near 100 , and NT Linval Joseph ( foot ) expected to return against Seattle , this is not remotely the same defense Russell Wilson shredded for 325 all purpose yards and four touchdowns in Week 13 . My guess is Seattle will score between 20 and 23 points in the rematch . I also wonder if Lynch ' s return could negatively impact the rhythm of Seattle ' s passing game , which finished as hot as any offense down the stretch . It should be noted that the Seahawks are a West Coast team playing in Minnesota at 1 : 05PM ET on Sunday .
