On one level , Schulz is completely right . We don ' t need to see the Little Red Haired Girl to understand Charlie Brown ' s feelings for her . Peanuts is sometimes dinged for being too depressing , but when I was a kid around Charlie Brown ' s age , it never felt that way to me . Peanuts felt like it was channeling emotions I felt deeply , but didn ' t have the maturity or experience to unpack myself yet . When it came to the Little Red Haired Girl , Charlie Brown ' s wild mix of terror and euphoria mirrored my own yo yo of feelings whenever a crush was around ? and for an inexperienced child , that recognition made me feel a little less awkward and alone .
