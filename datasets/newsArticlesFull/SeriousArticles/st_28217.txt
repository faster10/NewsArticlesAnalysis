1 . New recruits : how many new recruits in fact arrive each month ? Where are they on the battlefield ? One thousand is the official Western estimate but is this number likely ? Some of these would be new foreign fighters , others are fighters switching from Al Qaeda to ISIS for salaries and prestige . Poignant media stories about susceptible young people caught on their way to Syria have become rare . The charisma of the caliphate story is weakening . And even if there are so many recruits , what ' s the military quality of newly arrived untrained fighters ? With the exception of Chechen fighters ( and how many are there of these ? ) the new arrivals lack experience . They ' re apparently first put into support and guard positions but a mere few weeks training with weapons means they are likely to get killed early on . Their major asset is bravery , not fighting skills .
