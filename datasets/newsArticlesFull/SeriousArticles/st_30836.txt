Indeed , one of the GOP campaigns ? that of Jeb Bush ? is actually protesting the decision to cancel the NBC Telemundo debate , and demanding that Telemundo be reinstated , presumably because Latino outreach would be good not just for Jeb Bush , but for the GOP overall . Guess which GOP candidate is opposing a reinstatement of Telemundo ? Yep : Donald Trump . All this comes after GOP establishment types went into full scale panic earlier this fall over the damage Trump ? with his call for mass deportations and suggestion that Mexican immigrants are rapists ? may already be doing to the GOP brand among Latinos . And it comes as incoming House Speaker Paul Ryan is renewing his pledge not to act on immigration reform while Obama is president .
