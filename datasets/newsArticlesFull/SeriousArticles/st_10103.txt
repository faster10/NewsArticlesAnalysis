ATLANTA , Georgia Recently , at 48 years of age , I was diagnosed with Asperger ' s syndrome . For most of my life , I knew that I was " other , " not quite like everyone else . I searched for years for answers and found none , until an assignment at work required me to research autism . During that research , I found in the lives of other people with Asperger ' s threads of similarity that led to the diagnosis . Although having the diagnosis has been cathartic , it does not change the " otherness . " It only confirms it .
