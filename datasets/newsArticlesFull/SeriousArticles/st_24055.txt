As I left the chicken factory , children swarmed around me , giggling and wanting to show me how they slept like chickens packed into a room . As much as I wanted to , I couldn ' t spare the time . I had already stayed dangerously long and the risk that someone hostile to my presence had noticed whether ISIS or a militiaman was just too high . I left the factory and its tenants behind , just as they remain out of reach and abandoned by the international community , the authorities in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government .
