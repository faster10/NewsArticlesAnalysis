Unless you ' ve been living under a rock , by now you ' ve heard about Liberty University President , Jerry Falwell , Jr . , son of the late Moral Majority founder , making anti Muslim remarks and gesturing to the handgun he was carrying during a chapel speech to Liberty University Students . Referring to the 2015 San Bernardino shooting , Falwell Jr . said that if those who ' d been attacked " had what I have got in my back pocket right now . . . we could end those Muslims before they walked in . . . " He added his personal confusion that President Barack Obama ' s answer to repeated incidences of mass gun violence was to appeal for stricter gun control laws , then let students know they could take free " concealed carry " classes offered by the university . Several days later , Falwell Jr . authorized concealed weapons in dorms at Liberty University .
