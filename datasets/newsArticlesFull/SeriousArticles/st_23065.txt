The most commonly used drug for PrEP is Truvada , produced by US firm Gilead Sciences , which is also used as key component in treatments for people who have contracted the virus . But while Truvada has been given the green light by Australia s Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) for use by people who HIV , there is no approval for its use by people aiming to protect themselves from the virus . Without TGA approval , PrEP can t be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule ( PBS ) meaning it can cost more than 1000 a month to access the brand name medicine .
