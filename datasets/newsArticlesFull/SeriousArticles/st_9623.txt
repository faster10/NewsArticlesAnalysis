Currently , state troopers usually must fly in from other villages to respond to emergencies a process that takes 45 minutes at best and sometimes , in bad weather , can take days . The state troopers have told me they ' re having difficulty finding someone who would take the job in Nunam Iqua . It ' s a tough economy these days , and I ' ve been told funding is available for the position . If you ' d like to apply , e mail me ( ctl cnn . com ) and put " Nunam Iqua " in the subject line . I ' ll be happy to connect you to the troopers .
