The specter of Grace reigned over our household for months . If you don ' t behave , Grace will be coming for the weekend . Clean up your toys , or Grace will pick you up from preschool . If only I could find that woman , I ' d hire her one more time just to revive the memory . The next replacement sitter was an aging woman sent by an agency with hearts and fairies dancing across their logo . Not an hour after her arrival came phone call No . 1 . " Mama , it ' s Luna . I ' m on the phone upstairs . " Let ' s start with the fact that Luna had never dialed the phone on her own . " Why are you upstairs ? " I inquired . " I don ' t nap . I don ' t want bath . " I could feel pouty face through the phone . Then came call waiting . The nanny was on the other line complaining that Luna wouldn ' t bathe at 2 o ' clock in the afternoon . I clicked to Luna . " Mama come ! " I was home in an hour .
