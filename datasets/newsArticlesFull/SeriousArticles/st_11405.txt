Little evidence Trump could win in a general election Amy Walter : " I have no idea what is going to happen in Iowa and New Hampshire . If the polls are correct , Donald Trump is on his way to victory in both states . On the Democratic side , Iowa is a coin toss and Bernie Sanders wins big in New Hampshire . For many Republicans , Cruz represents an obvious and predictable road to a loss in November : a conservative and ideologically rigid message to a shrinking base of voters . Meanwhile , Trump represents the audacity of hope , an opportunity to appeal to a crop of voters who ve either sat on the sidelines or voted Democratic in the past . Even many Democrats worry that they don t have the playbook to deal with Trump . But winning over GOP voters is NOT the same as winning a national election . " Cook Political ?
