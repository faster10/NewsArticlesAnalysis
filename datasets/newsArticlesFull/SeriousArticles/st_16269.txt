Mike Mertz knows this firsthand . On January 23 , 2008 , the 59 year old Arizona man was driving home from work . The last thing he remembers is pulling into his complex ' s driveway . Then his heart stopped . Corey Ash , a passing UPS driver , noticed a silver Saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall , with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel . Ash stopped to investigate . He switched off the car ' s engine , pulled Mertz out , and laid him on the ground . Ash called 911 and started pumping the older man ' s chest . The next few minutes would be absolutely critical for Mertz .
