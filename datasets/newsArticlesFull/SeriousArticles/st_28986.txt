" Under my plan , small businesses who cannot afford to contribute toward workers retirement plans can set up ' starter 401 ( K ) s ' for their workers , and businesses would have the ability to pool together to access a single retirement savings plan , which will save administrative costs and reduce complexity . " He also says he would take on regulations that " add unnecessary costs and make it difficult for individuals to save . "
