Over the past fifty years , the GOP has catered to the socially conservative views of the voters who migrated to the GOP in the wake of the Southern Strategy , but has been largely inimical to their economic interests . Pat Buchanan railed for years that the GOP was serving the interests of Republican corporate and Wall Street elites by supporting free trade and immigration policies that undermined the economic interests of working and middle class Americans . Donald Trump expanded on Buchanan ' s attacks on the GOP establishment when he targeted the preferential tax treatment provided to hedge fund managers and the control of GOP candidates by mega donors and special interests . Last month , a report published by Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case documenting the increasing death rates among middle aged white Americans in particular from suicide and substance abuse provided epidemiological evidence that anger and despair growing out of decades of economic stagnation and decline affecting working class and middle class Americans that have given rise to the anti establishment revolt within the GOP are reflected in mortality statistics as well .
