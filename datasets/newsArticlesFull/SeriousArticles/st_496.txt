YL : It depends what films you want to make . I think art and commerce can co exist side by side in the same film . For example , it is a big surprise to all of us that an arthouse film like " Dogtooth " is doing really well at the Greek box office : 25 , 000 admissions in Greece is considered a market success . After a six week run in two cities , " Dogtooth " is still screening . We have also secured several international distribution deals , including North American distribution , the Benelux countries , France and Spain .
