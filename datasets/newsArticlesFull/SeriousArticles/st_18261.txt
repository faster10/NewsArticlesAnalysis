So why is red meat and processed meat associated with cancer ? We are not sure . At McMaster ? we are studying the possibility that these dietary items may actually modify the expression of genes associated with cancer development . We don ' t yet know for sure . There are other hypotheses related to chemicals involved in cooking meat with fire ? with the development of ? heterocyclic amines and ? polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or the role of salt nitrate that you can find in processed meat . There is no consensus on how this is happening but I think it is time we provide the population with reasons because these agents are actually causing cancer .
