The roster is a perfect match for the modern NBA . Golden State can play small and shoot well , which it is famous for , or throw heft into the game with Andrew Bogut at center and Draymond Green at power forward . The properly conducted versatility has allowed the Warriors rest in a league where that is so fleeting . Kerr supposed that Golden State didn t have a player in the top 15 in the league in minutes played . Thinking he may be wrong , he shrunk the list to top 13 , intimating their minutes leader may be around 15th in the league . He was off . Green leads them in minutes played , and he is tied for 29th in the league . Curry is tied for 32nd . Klay Thompson is 42nd .
