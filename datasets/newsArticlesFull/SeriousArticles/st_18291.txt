" If the House had not acted , Social Security disability recipients would have faced a 20 percent across the board cut next year , millions of seniors would have faced a spike in Medicare premiums , and our troops and veterans wouldn ' t have gotten all the resources they need and deserve . This plan solves those problems . It is fully paid for by reducing spending in other areas , and saves billions of dollars in the long term . ? Under this plan , discretionary spending is still below what it would have been under the 2011 Ryan budget passed by the House . The plan isn ' t perfect , but it protects those who need it the most : our men and women in uniform , our seniors , and the most vulnerable in our society . "
