In the first debate between Reagan and Mondale , Reagan had appeared old . He was the oldest candidate in history at that time . He seemed confused by some of the questions , his answers had wandered , and the issue of age really became a large question among the press . So when he comes back in the second debate , and they ask him , ' Do you think age is a problem ? ' He had that answer prepared , and boy did he nail it . It was subtle , it was humorous , and Mondale knew , he said right then , that he had not only lost the debate , but probably the election .
