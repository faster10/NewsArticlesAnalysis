Game ball : I ' ll let our Jets columnist , Manish Mehta , give out the Jets game ball . For the Giants , there really is only one choice : Odell Beckham has quite a collection of these ( you know , if these were actual balls we were giving out ) . He gets this one for the incredible acceleration he showed on his 72 yard touchdown , the incredible one handed 22 yard catch he made in the first quarter , and for the way he stood up to the beating he took from the Jets ' defense in this game . They hammered him and he kept getting up and making catches . Yeah , he made a stupid play in overtime to get a penalty for kicking a ball he couldn ' t catch . But he made up for it with a great catch on the next play . Oh , if only one of his teammates would actually help him out .
