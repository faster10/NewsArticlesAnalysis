UNICEF nutritionist Elham Monsef weighs into the conversation explaining that somewhere in the last 20 years the message has been mixed up . " I spoke to a doctor in Afghanistan who said his grandmother used to feed all the poor babies in her village with her breast milk . Now these women are told to use instant formula or mix it with water and crushed biscuits . It ' s such a dangerous message . Breast milk is the golden drop for the child and the best chance of giving these kids the start they will need in what will be a tough life . "
