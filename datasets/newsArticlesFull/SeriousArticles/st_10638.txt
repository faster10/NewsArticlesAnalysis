In my take it however you want opinion , my top pick to pull off the rare home playoff upset ( that certainly never happens in Foxboro ) is the Bengals . I know , it s a tough bet to depend on a team that has literally never won a playoff game with their current head coach and QB situation . But as far as personnel on the field ? They are almost completely healthy ( save for the QB , but who knows , maybe McCarron plays better than Andy Dalton has in past playoff games ) . On paper they have arguably the most talented team in the league . And the Steelers may have crept into overrated territory with how much they have scored in recent weeks you can throw on their secondary and nobody on the Steelers could possibly handle A . J . Green .
