Over time I have learned to replace the urge to judge with the desire to seek our like humanity . Over the years I have spent my fair share of time around people fighting for LGBT rights and I can tell you the mocking of transgender people is not something that is exclusively heterosexual or conservative . It is not only found in red states or in Christian homes . I have learned a person can be progressive on numerous social issues and still house bigotry in the hidden , dusty corners of an otherwise illuminated heart .
