Its nice to think that entirely new systems incorporating new and faster cars would make derailments disappear into the history books , but they probably won ' t . Although the absence of high speed technologies in this country means that rail travel is not an attractive option for certain long distance journeys and contributes to higher levels of pollution and road congestion in places , it doesn ' t really make rail travel any less safe . Indeed , countries with high speed rail have roughly the same rate of derailments and crashes as we do often with far more serious consequences .
