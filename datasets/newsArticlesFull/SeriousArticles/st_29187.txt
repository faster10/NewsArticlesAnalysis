On March 4 , 1983 , John ' s 70th birthday , the couple received a letter from Hoa Van Nguyen . Nguyen , a former soldier in the Vietnamese Army , said he and his younger brother had found one of the Peckhams ' bottles as the two men were floating 15 kilometers from the shore of Songkhla Province in Thailand . They were braving the waters of the Pacific in a small , shallow riverboat in order to escape the Communist regime in Vietnam . When they saw the bottle , they felt as though a prayer had been answered , giving them the strength to carry on . After reading the letter , the Peckhams looked for Songkhla on a map and were shocked to find that the bottle had traveled 9 , 000 miles from Hawaii .
