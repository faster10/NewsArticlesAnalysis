Following a snowy , controversial home win over the Raiders ( the 14 year anniversary of the Tuck Rule game was Tuesday ) , the Patriots went to Pittsburgh to face the top seeded Steelers . Brady , who had replaced an injured Drew Bledsoe in Week 2 of the season , left the game after taking a big hit in the second quarter . On came Bledsoe , who threw a touchdown pass to complete the drive and give the Patriots a 14 3 halftime lead . Special teams made the play of the game , with Troy Brown picking up a blocked Steelers field goal attempt and giving the ball on a lateral to Antwan Harris , who scored a touchdown . The Patriots completed the dream season by beating St . Louis for the first Super Bowl title in franchise history
