Current " True Blood " show runner Brian Buckner , who replaced original creator Alan Ball , promised there would be game changing deaths in the final season , and he wasn ' t kidding . Within the first minute of the opening episode , Tara Thornton ( Rutina Wesley ) was staked and killed by a Hep V infected vampire . The death happened off screen , too talk about a cold exit . A few episodes later , Sookie ' s werewolf boyfriend , Alcide ( Joe Manganiello ) , got the ax as well . He died while protecting Sookie , a common theme in the series . But ever since those deaths it has been unusually tame . Which prompts the question , who will bite it in the series finale ?
