I found myself in the news this week after offering a surprise of my own at a New York theater : The woman seated next to me was on her phone throughout most of the show . ( It was " Natasha , Pierre , and the Great Comet of 1812 , " in case you ' re wondering , a musical based on " War and Peace . " You know what show you shouldn ' t see in New York if you have the attention span of a goldfish ? One based on " War and Peace . " ) When she was not on her phone , she and her friends were engaged in a four part imitation of a " Sex and the City " brunch conversation . I asked her nicely more than once but she did not respond to courtesy . She said : " Just don ' t look . " So I took her phone from her and tossed it .
