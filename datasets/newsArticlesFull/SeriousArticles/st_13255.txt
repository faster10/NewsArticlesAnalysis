? Is the UK that is pledging financial support for clean energy research ( Major economies promise 20bn for clean energy , 30 November ) the same UK that has cut subsidies for wind and solar power , is driving all out for fracking and gas fuelled electricity plants , has increased support for North Sea oil production , has ended home energy efficiency grants and watered down efficiency requirements for new houses , and will soon end grants for electric cars ? The same one that is offering billions in support , funded by doubled electricity wholesale prices , for nuclear plants , yet claims to be helping households by cutting the piffling environmental tariffs on energy bills ( Osborne puts forward plan to reduce household bills by ? 470 , 30 November ) ? For sheer chutzpah this blatant hypocrisy takes the prize .
