In the motion it filed Wednesday , the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen , the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska . The notes show that responses by Allen , the prosecution ' s star witness , were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens , and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial , the motion says .
