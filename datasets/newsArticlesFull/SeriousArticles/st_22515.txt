One of the year ' s most anticipated albums was " Black Messiah , " the incendiary work by the reclusive R B artist D ' Angelo , who needed 14 years to follow his breakthrough release , " Voodoo . " A politically charged , album length statement that draws from funk , rock and soul , " Black Messiah " would seem prime fodder for album of the year , but it was not to be . ( That spot likely went to Kendrick Lamar ' s " To Pimp a Butterfly . " ) Instead , D ' Angelo ' s smooth single " Really Love " earned acknowledgment as one of the five best records of the year and R B songs , and " Black Messiah " was recognized in the R B album category .
