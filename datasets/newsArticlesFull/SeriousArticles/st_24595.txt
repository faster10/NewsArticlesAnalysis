Earlier in James ' career , when he was frustrated about a play or player , he would routinely look over to the bench and the coaching staff . It was as if he was looking to the teacher to reprimand a student . In recent years , James will often bypass this and take matters into his own hands . He will yell or just glare at a teammate , justified or not . Love has learned this and sometimes when there ' s a mix up , James will glare his way and Love will stare at the hardwood so as not to meet James ' eyes .
