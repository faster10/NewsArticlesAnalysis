His new movie pleads the case for the hard drinking spy ' s relevance in the era of drone assassinations and WikiLeaks even more loudly than Skyfall did ( and with far less eloquence ) , while being paradoxically determined to reprise all of Bond ' s Greatest Hits . As with any aging rock band , the set list overwhelmingly favors the enterprise ' s first decade : There are echoes of Bond ' s train fight with a hulking Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love , his combat optimized Aston Martin ( and white dinner jacket ) from Goldfinger , the spectacularly designed villain ' s lair from You Only Live Twice , and the stunning Swiss alpine outpost from On Her Majesty ' s Secret Service . There are also at least two too many callbacks to Casino Royale , the excellent 2006 reboot wherein newly minted 007 Daniel Craig gave the character a vulnerability and dimension he ' d never had before ? and , on the evidence of his granite faced performance in Spectre , will probably never have again .
