Like Berbatov , Arshavin has been a late bloomer . Arshavin was little known outside Russia in his early days but he shot to prominence in 2007 08 , when he was the inspiration behind Zenit St Petersburg ' s UEFA Cup triumph . Arshavin then demonstrated his wonderful dribbling and playmaking abilities at Euro 2008 for a Russian side beaten only by eventual winners Spain . The pint sized Arshavin had been linked with moves to Europe ' s biggest clubs for a while but it was Arsenal who made the deal happen after much wrangling in 2009 .
