After putting out an album roughly once a year between 2005 and 2012 , Rihanna took an unprecedented three years to put together her eighth LP . Her first album since leaving Def Jam , Anti marks the introduction of a new kind of RiRi , less polished pop star and more swaggering oddball . Fans of smashes like We Found Love and Diamonds won t find more of the same gleaming electro pop . Instead , the album comes closer to Rihanna s social media persona : full of ( relatively ) unfiltered DGAF attitude , with a number of eclectic inspirations . For better and for worse , the songs are more than ever driven by her personality , rather than the other way around .
