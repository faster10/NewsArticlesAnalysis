Brussels : Daesh has built a serious capability to inflict terror and is bent on staging more attacks in Europe , possibly at several places simultaneously , the head of Europol said . After the Paris atrocities , it is reasonable to assume without any recourse to exaggeration , that further attacks are likely , Rob Wainwright , director of the European Union s crime fighting agency , said yesterday in Brussels . He called Paris the first European instance of shootings and suicide bombings at several venues , similar to the four day Mumbai rampage of 2008 at sites including a luxury hotel and community centre . French investigators into last Friday s killings are pursuing a number of leads uncovered by Europol , Wainwright said . Speaking to the European Parliament s civil liberties committee , Wainwright called for better intelligence sharing between crime and terrorism fighting agencies , noting links between Daesh and the organised underworld . Disclosing what is probably secret at the same hearing , Christian Braun , Luxembourg s EU ambassador , said heads of national spy agencies have held meetings in Brussels to coordinate anti terrorism steps . These contacts exist but spy chiefs don t seek the limelight , Braun said .
