Forsberg : Well , Boston fans know a thing or two about inconsistencies . The Celtics have won 12 games by an average of 17 points , while losing nine games by an average of 10 . 1 points . Which is to say , either the Celtics have looked really good or they ' ve looked really bad and fans up here tend to ride the emotional roller coaster based on the latest result . As Boston ' s record indicates , it has been more sunshine and puppy dogs than doom and gloom . It certainly helps that Boston has the third best defensive rating in the league , which suggests it should be competitive most nights .
