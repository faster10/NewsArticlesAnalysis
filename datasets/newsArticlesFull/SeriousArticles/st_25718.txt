( SK ) : I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world . If you think about some years ago , if you think about the internet bubble for example , where it was New York and California wasn ' t it ? And you look at a whole range of reasons for it , and the sub prime crisis perhaps , the decline of the dollar perhaps . But you have overlapping regulators in the United States , you have very high taxes in the United States , you have a very litigious environment in the United States , and you have the emerging markets coming up , so capital is being raised outside of the United States . These things , some of which are negative for the United States , some of which are positive for the other regions , is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York , to London , to Hong Kong , to Singapore , and potentially to Dubai as well .
