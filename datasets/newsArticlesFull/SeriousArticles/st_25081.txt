these attacks , a passport found next to the body of one of the attackers raises the possibility that he was a Syrian who entered Europe posing as a refugee . Now , critics have said allowing free entry to hundreds of thousands of refugees risks making it easier for extremists to slip through the security net so let ' s bring in ABC news consultant Matt Olsen in Washington . The former head of the national kurpts terrorism center . Matt , good morning to you . Good morning . In light of the refugee crisis we are allowing 10 , 000 Syrian refugees into our country . Is that going to change in light of this development ? You know , Paula , I would not expect that that number so change . That is a relatively manageable number particularly when you consider the total number of Syrian refugees which exceeds 3 million Syrians who fled the country . So what exactly will the vetting process be in taking these refugees into America ? How can we feel safe here at home ? The U . S . Has a very intensive process for vetting refugees , it can take as long as two years . It includes checking databases within the intelligence agencies , the department of defense , the department of homeland security and includes interviews , the collection of buy graphic information , so it ' s a very intensive vetting process , of course , the issue is it ' s only as good as the intelligence information and it ' s difficult to get intelligence from Syria . It is and you mentioned that massive wave of Syrian refugees , we ' re taking in 10 , 000 but there are millions . What is the U . S . Doing to help european security agencies . Here the key is to cooperate and share information with our allies in Europe to make sure that they have the latest information because the problem is not just the refugees but it ' s the flow of foreign fighters back and forth from Syria to western Europe . It is a crisis in there , so many concerns about it this morning , Matt , thanks for
