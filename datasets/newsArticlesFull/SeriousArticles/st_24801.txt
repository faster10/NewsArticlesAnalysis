Though Federer had six titles against his name in 2015 , but the most important aspect is that he is still not ended the Grand Slam drought since the Wimbledon title he won in 2012 . However , the Swiss maestro is unduly bothered . I think this year had a lot of great things in my game . How I m able to play at net , how I m moving and feeling at net in particular is a great thing to have . Then my serve has been really working very consistent , very well throughout the year more or less . If I can just get that to work slightly better at times , that would be incredibly helpful . I ll work on that as well , Federer said .
