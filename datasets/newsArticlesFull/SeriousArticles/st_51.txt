The issues and opportunities facing the fantasy sports industry can be best addressed through an independent agency supported by the industry and its members , Harris said in a statement . The Fantasy Sports Trade Association will continue to work closely with state and federal lawmakers and regulators as we develop and implement strong integrity programs . We are confident that an independent control agency can prevent any unethical , dishonest , or unfair behavior . In the process , we can save lawmakers and regulators the cost and effort of intervening so that they can expend their limited resources on bigger and more societally important challenges .
