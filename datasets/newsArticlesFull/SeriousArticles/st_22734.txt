While Manchester United flounder in the post Ferguson , post Gill world , with a manager ? Louis van Gaal ? who was the most sought after in the world 20 years ago and an expensive and largely incomprehensible transfer policy , City can congratulate themselves on their long term planning . Or at least they can if it works . A four year battle to get a manager to sign a three year contract will have been worth it if it establishes City as part of the European elite , whether through consistent success or because of the style of football they play ? or , ideally , both . And Guardiola , at the very least , will guarantee interesting football with his radical tactical approach and his meticulous manipulation of his side from the touchline .
