JR : Yea , when Barack Obama was running for president he told Univision in an interview that he was going to have an immigration bill during his first year in office . It was an important promise because back then Barack Obama was trying to the get the Democratic nomination against Hilary Clinton . Hillary Clinton had promised that she was going to do it during the first 100 days . Anyway , Latinos believed Barack Obama 67 percent of Latinos voted for Barack Obama and at the end President Barack Obama didn ' t keep his promise . He broke a promise .
