Perhaps no fight ? or even sports spectacle ? has had such an impact on the world as Jack Johnson fighting James Jeffries . In a world still divided by rampant racism , Johnson had surprised everyone when he had become the world s first black heavyweight champion ( and perhaps first black champion in a popular sport ) by defeating Tommy Burns . So incensed were some at this prospect that they lured the undefeated former James Jeffries out of retirement to show him his place . In the event , Johnson mercilessly pummelled Jeffries , stunning the world and even sparking off riots in some parts of the USA . The era of white supremacy in boxing was over !
