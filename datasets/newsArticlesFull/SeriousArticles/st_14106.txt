Of course , we would have loved to have been live at Chelsea in the 4th round and Bradford in the 5th , but the good news for fans is that even when a game isn ' t shown live there ' s always comprehensive Match of the Day highlights available . There ' s a lot more extra coverage devoted to the FA Cup on the BBC , with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it . After the 4th round , 26 million people had watched the coverage on the BBC , that ' s 8 million more than on terrestrial TV this time last season . It ' s not all about viewing figures and ratings , but it ' s pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world ' s most loved cup competition to such a wide audience .
