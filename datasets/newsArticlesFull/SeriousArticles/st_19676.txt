The product overlap isn ' t extensive and the focus will probably be on seeds and crop chemicals , said Jason Miner , an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence . Even in those markets , Dow and DuPont compete against large rivals like Syngenta AG , Monsanto and Bayer AG , Miner said . As well as the 3 billion of cost savings , the companies said the deal will create additional earnings of about 1 billion . DuPont said its own effiency measures will save it about 700 million .
