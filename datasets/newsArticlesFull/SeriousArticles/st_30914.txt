On foreign policy , Abbott is a strong U . S . alliance man . He is also a believer in the " anglosphere , " and was one of the leaders of the monarchist cause when in 1999 Australia had its failed republic referendum . But Abbott ' s focus will be heavily on Asia . He has said policy should emphasize " Jakarta rather than Geneva " a comment not only on the importance to be placed on the region , but also reflecting the Coalition ' s lack of faith in multilateralism . Abbott has promised an early visit to Jakarta , where he will try to persuade the reluctant Indonesians to accept his policy of turning back asylum seeker boats .
