I was the last person released from my cell . The woman who left before me , a middle aged lawyer who had been arrested multiple times that weekend , reassured me that I ' d get out soon . When I did , friends were waiting with hugs , pizza and the National Lawyers Guild . Occupiers have a strong support system for those who are arrested , whether it ' s in the form of food , drinks or a pro bono lawyer . I felt incredibly lucky , essentially a tourist in that miserable place . In the pizza joint across the street , we bought beer for a woman who ' d been held for 38 hours .
