Mr Putin was actually not much of a spy . He rose through the ranks of the KGB initially keeping an eye on his fellow Russians . When he was finally selected to attend the elite overseas spy school in Moscow , he did not excel the reason was that he was a risk taker . The bureaucratic Soviet Union and its intelligence services did not like risk taking . That trait got Mr Putin assigned to spying on Soviet allies in East Germany rather than to a more prestigious intelligence mission in West Germany . But the collapse of the East German government gave Mr Putin the chance to show what he could do as an independent leader . This occurred when a German mob that had sacked the offices of the East German secret police ( Stasi ) attempted to storm the villa that was the headquarters of the KGB liaison office where Mr Putin was temporarily in charge . Unarmed , Putin quietly and firmly dispersed the mob . The story of how Mr Putin thrived in the post Soviet anarchy takes up much of the rest of Mr Myers book .
