This is the kind of larger bore thinking I mentioned above . And Bethel s reference to the Congress of Vienna is especially useful . It took place in the Austrian capital in 1814 15 , just after the Napoleonic Wars , and was intended to stabilize Europe by fixing very messy borders and establishing a balance of power . It was high conservative in outlook and far from perfect , but it brought Europe a period of peace based on a recognition of interests . ( Klemens , prince von Metternich , was the Austrian emperor s chancellor and chaired the proceedings . )
