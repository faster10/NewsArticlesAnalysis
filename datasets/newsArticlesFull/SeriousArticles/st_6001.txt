Don t look now , but Allen Crabbe has been really consistent . He played 34 minutes on Monday , scoring 14 points with three rebounds , one assist and one 3 pointer . He s played 28 . 4 minutes per game over his last five , averaging 14 . 6 points , 2 . 2 boards , 1 . 2 assists , 0 . 6 steals and 2 . 2 treys on 54 . 9 percent from the field and 85 . 4 percent from the line . That is absolutely his ceiling and it s good for sixth round value . Crabbe was one of the best players at Summer League before he suffered an ankle injury , so his playing time is for real . He s still more of a 14 team guy until we see him add non scoring stuff .
