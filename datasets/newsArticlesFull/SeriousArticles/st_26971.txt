Many official figures , particularly those hailing from the ruling Islamist party Ennahda , have been defending the judiciary ' s decisions . For example , Amer Laarayedh , the head of Ennahda ' s political bureau and a member of the Constituent Assembly , insists that the protests taking place in support of the victim are attempts by the opposition to bring down the government . The Ministry of Justice denies that the victim was even accused . The Ministry of Interior retains that the couple was found in an " immoral position " when the police first stopped the car .
