" The government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation is conduct , " said Roberts . " Plaintiffs want to speak to certain foreign designated groups and whether they may do so under the federal law depends on what they say . If plaintiffs ' speech to those groups imparts a ' specific skill ' or communicates advice derived from ' specialized knowledge ' for example , training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the United Nations then it is barred . On the other hand , plaintiffs ' speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized knowledge . "
