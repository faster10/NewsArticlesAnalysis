Dallas Cowboys : Jason Witten hasn ' t scored a touchdown since he had two in the Cowboys ' season opening win against the Giants . No other Cowboys ' tight end has a touchdown either . In two of their past three games , the Buccaneers have given up three touchdowns to tight ends . The Cowboys were perfect in the red zone last week , but in three road games this year , they have three touchdowns in eight trips inside the opponents ' 20 yard line . Matt Cassel ' s grasp of the offense has increased , but he will need to cash in on chances deep Sunday , and Witten is always a good target . Todd Archer
