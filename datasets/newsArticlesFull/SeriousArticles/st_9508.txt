The contrast with Senator Sanders is striking in that it is precisely the opposite : a net positive of 24 percent , with 55 percent responding yes and 24 percent no . Though voters have in the past sometimes supported candidates not known for their honesty and trustworthiness ( Richard Nixon comes to mind ) , a deficit on this quality is a not inconsiderable liability .
