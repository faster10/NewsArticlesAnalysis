" In order to be a good football player and good football team , you have to have passion , " Garrett said . " You have to put it all out there . You have to be completely engaged , completely invested . Over the course of the game when things don ' t go well , you ' re going to have a response . But if you ' ve ever been a football coach or a football player or been around a pro football team , you understand those things happen . You want the guys who have the passion , the emotion , the enthusiasm for the game . "
