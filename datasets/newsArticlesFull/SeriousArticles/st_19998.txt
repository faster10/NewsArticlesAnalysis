Just before writing " The Bridge of Sighs " 11 years later , I spent a year on a Fulbright fellowship to Romania , and all the research I did there shaped " The Bridge of Sighs " and helped direct the course of the next four books , which charted the Cold War history of Eastern Europe . By the time I was writing my second book , " The Confession , " I was living in Italy and then in Hungary , where I ' ve spent the last decade . While all this European living has influenced the subject matter of my novels , I think more importantly it ' s given me a window onto the world that ' s different than the one I would ' ve had if I ' d spent the last 10 years in the States . I was in Italy when 9 11 occurred , and I ' ve experienced the entire post 9 11 era through more distant eyes .
