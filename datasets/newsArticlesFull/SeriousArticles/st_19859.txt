Paul Ryan complains that Trump is not acting as a conservative , but Ryan is showing a tin ear to the situation facing his party . The definition of being a conservative to say nothing of being a Republican has changed dramatically over the years . Richard Nixon walked away from the New England small government conservatives when he brought southern , rural and evangelical conservatives into the fold who were activists on social issues . Similarly , Ronald Reagan killed the fiscal conservative traditions of the party , while George W . Bush cast out the GOP traditions of conservative restraint in foreign policy in favor of neoconservative activism . But through it all , the GOP remained true to its corporate and Wall Street masters , the elements of the party that were most distrusted by the groups that were brought into the fold fifty years ago , and by Pat Buchanan and the Tea Party in the decades since . Conservatism in Republican politics is not a static concept defined in the writing of Edmund Burke , or Ayn Rand for that matter , as Paul Ryan ' s words suggest . It has been balanced over the years by the exigencies of what it takes to win .
