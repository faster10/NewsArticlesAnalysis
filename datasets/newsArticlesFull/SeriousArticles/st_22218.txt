Before the construction of the Pak Moon dam in Ubon Ratchathani province , Thailand , the waterway contained over 250 species of fish . This plummeted over 80 when the dam began operation , and a decade later , through extensive government investment to restock the river , the species number is still less than half the original amount . More than 20 , 000 people have been affected by this loss of fish . This dam was anticipated to have a production capacity of 136 megawatts , but it can barely generate 20 megawatts during high demand months .
