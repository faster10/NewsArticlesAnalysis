Minnesota at Oakland : The Raiders have a fun little thing going with their AC DC tandem of Amari Cooper and Derek Carr . And both Charles Woodson and second year man Khalil Mack are getting a lot of media love , too . But the two guys I ' m most impressed by in Oakland are Aldon Smith and Michael Crabtree . Both considered questionable signings by the Raiders , they ' ve been the ultimate leaders . Smith , who many questioned whether he ' d ever get another shot after being released by the 49ers , was a team captain Sunday vs . Pittsburgh . Crabtree , viewed by many as cancerous in San Francisco , has been an important mentor for Amari Cooper . I like what ' s happening in Oakland , and think they get the best of a very good Vikings team on Sunday .
