It should be apparent by now that I m a massive , unabashed fan girl . That s been true for a long time . My earliest memory is a trip to the drive in to see the original Star Wars . ? The first VHS cassette I held was The Empire Strikes Back , rented along with a blocky VCR from our small town s new video store . Return of the Jedi was the first movie I saw in a theater . My coming of age as a media consumer is tightly linked with the franchise and , as evidenced by pictures of me dressed up as a pint sized Princess Leia , the films were a source of early concepts of female power .
