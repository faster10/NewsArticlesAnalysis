Every other character on the show who has left Don Draper ' s ad agency has either never been heard from again , or revisited in a one off episode and then rarely to never heard from again . Peggy , by contrast , had been such an integral part of the show ' s exploration of the 1960s that the thought of completely losing her " and the Emmy nominated Moss " had some fans in a wee bit of a snit . ( Of course , Moss ' appearance in the final moments of the season finale certainly suggested that Peggy ' s story was not complete , but why let that get in the way of wild speculation ? )
