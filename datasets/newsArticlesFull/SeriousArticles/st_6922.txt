Eliot Shorr Parks : ? At this point , there is nothing more frustrating than picking an Eagles ' game . Although the times are now fewer and far between , the team has shown this season they are capable of putting together elite performances , like their win over the Giants , New Orleans Saints and New York Jets . They have also shown , however , they more times than not , they will beat themselves , display questionable effort and come away with a loss . They should beat the Lions ? just like they should have beaten the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins . But does anyone actually think they will ? Lions 24 , Eagles 21
