The festivities in Centeroo came to a close with a three way indie pop showdown between the Shins , Young the Giant and the aforementioned fun . The Shins played the fest ' s traditional indie headliner Sunday evening slot at Which Stage and came out with guns blazing , opening with the " Chutes Too Narrow " favorite " Kissing the Lipless " and following it up with the blithe and bouncy " Oh , Inverted World " gem " Caring Is Creepy . " In other words , business as usual for the good natured power twee quintet . Meanwhile at This Tent , Young the Giant had a sizable crowd of thousands enraptured in tunes both emotionally charged and affable , the presiding tones of the day .
