? SANDERS CALLS FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN PENTAGON SPENDING PRIORITIES , via our colleague Bryan Bender : Sanders on Sunday called for fundamental changes in how the Pentagon spends money , asserting that too many resources are dedicated to preparing for war with conventional military forces and not enough to terrorist threats . We have a 600 billion military budget , the Vermont senator said . It is a budget that is larger than the next eight countries . Unfortunately , much of that budget continuto go to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union . Very little of that budget ? less than 10 percent ? actually goes to fighting ISIS and international terrorism .
