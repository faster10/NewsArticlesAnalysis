Bush family consigliere James Baker ( and current Jeb Bush advisor ) was in control of the spin from the beginning and the Republicans had election lawyers flown in from all over the country within hours . They were prepared to fight it all the way . But there can be no doubt that if it hadn t been for the ineptitude of the Jeb Bush electoral machinery , with its butterfly ballots and illegal voter purges , the vote would never have been as close as it was . It s also a fact that Al Gore won the national popular vote and that ? more Floridians intended to vote for him than George W . Bush . ?
