The Patriots opened up with an 11 play , 80 yard drive that consisted of nothing but passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receivers Julian Edelman , Danny Amendola , and Brandon LaFell . The key to that drive was the protection of quarterback Tom Brady , who had been taking a lot of hits in recent weeks . The Chiefs are known for having an aggressive pass rush , but they rarely tried to blitz after that first drive . Brady was not sacked once , and he completed 13 consecutive passes at one point .
