Other critics focus on the quality of the deal being negotiated and want Congress to have a say . And as a negotiator , I spent almost as much time with members of Congress over the past 15 months as I did with Iranians and the P5 1 . As a result , I was acutely aware of congressional views and ensured that they directly affected the policy options we pursued in the talks . Congressional concerns were raised at the negotiating table not only by U . S . negotiators , but by fellow members of the P5 1 , and even by the Iranians . Congress is very much present in these negotiations .
