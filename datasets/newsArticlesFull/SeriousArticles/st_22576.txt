Murray lost only four points on his serve in the opening set as he registered a decent 7 5 , 6 2 win over towering Pole Jerzy Janowicz to make the third round . In doing so he pushed himself very close to the frame for the eight man field who will contest the season ending championships at the O2 Arena . He is due to meet Spain ' s David Ferrer on Thursday morning and victory would put him within a sliver a mere five ranking points of the eighth qualifying place currently occupied by Canada ' s Milos Raonic .
