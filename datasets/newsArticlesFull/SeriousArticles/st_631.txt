Trump also risks looking petty , stupid and foolish . True , he s been looking petty , stupid and foolish for years , but boycotting a debate because you think Megyn Kelly will be mean to you is especially petty , stupid and foolish . Forget the Trump who swaggers into every room and stares down his foes . Never mind the man who promised he could solve the Israel Palestine conflict in two weeks through the sheer power of his steely forcefulness . He can t even deal with Megyn Kelly , and now he s just given his rivals two very highly rated hours to point that out and bash him all they want .
