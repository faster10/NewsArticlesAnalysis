ABOUT THE BRONCOS ( 7 2 ) : Denver coach Gary Kubiak second guessed himself after last week ' s 29 13 loss to Kansas City , letting a banged up Manning play and finish 5 for 20 for 35 yards and four interceptions before Osweiler came on to throw a late scoring pass . Neither Ronnie Hillman nor C . J . Anderson has been able to provide a semblance of a consistent ground game , but Osweiler won ' t be lacking for weapons with Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders at wide receiver . The Broncos own the league ' s top ranked defense , but they have surrendered 56 points in the last two games .
