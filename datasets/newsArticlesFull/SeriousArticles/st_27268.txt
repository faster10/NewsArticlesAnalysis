" Currently , I am telling my pregnant patients not to travel to locations where the Zika virus has been identified , " said Dr William Schweizer of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYU Langone Medical Center . " If we are treating mothers who have a history of traveling to these places , we are having them get more frequent ultrasounds to make sure their babies are growing properly . I am also giving my patients other practical advice like having them purchase travel insurance . "
