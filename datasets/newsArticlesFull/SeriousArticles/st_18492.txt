And yet Republicans seemed to be shocked , shocked , to find flight delays ripple through airports across the country . They ran to television cameras to point fingers at President Obama , saying these delays were preventable . I am not sure what they expected to happen . It would be irrational to expect that we can cut more than 600 million from the FAA budget in six months and not see effects on the flying public . Just as we should not expect that we can cut 4 million meals to seniors , as the White House reports , and not hurt them .
