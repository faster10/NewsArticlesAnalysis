Of course , there are very tangible connections between Clinton and Planned Parenthood . Cecile Richards s daughter works for the Clinton campaign in Iowa . Planned Parenthood has donated over 9 , 000 to Clinton s various campaigns , from her 2000 Senate race to her 2008 presidential campaign , and many of the bigwigs who donate to Planned Parenthood have also donated to Clinton s campaign . Planned Parenthood is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative , and Clinton gave a keynote address at a Planned Parenthood gala while she was Secretary of State . Clinton and Cecile Richards are rumored to be close friends , and they both love pantsuits . So if Hillary Clinton is establishment , then yes , so is Planned Parenthood .
