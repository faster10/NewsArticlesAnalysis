If we were to let cynicism consume us , and fear overwhelm us , if we lost hope , for however slow , however incomplete , however harshly , loudly , rudely challenged at each point along our journey , in America we can create the change that we seek , Obama said . ? All it requires is that our generation be willing to do what those who came before us have done , to rise above the cynicism , rise above the fear , to hold fast to our values , to see ourselves in each other , to cherish dignity and opportunity not just for our own children , but for somebody else s child . To remember that our freedom is bound up with the freedom of others , regardless of what they looked like or where they come from or what their last name is or what faith they practice .
