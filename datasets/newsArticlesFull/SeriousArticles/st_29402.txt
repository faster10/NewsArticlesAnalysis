As an out lesbian and journalist , I ' ve always felt conflicted about the uncertainty of Cooper ' s sexuality . On the one hand , I can delight in the mystery of a person ' s unspoken and enigmatic preferences , wondering : Is he gay ? Straight ? Bi ? Maybe he ' s asexual . On the other , before he came out I couldn ' t help but wonder if he ' d felt the need to veil his homosexuality to make himself palatable to the masses . It ' s irksome to think that he ' d have to cater to the ignorant until he could secure a large following . Hopefully his coming out will blast the perception that you can ' t be openly gay and a widely respected public figure .
