So , if you are a retribution type judge , you ' d probably sentence Clem to long term incarceration even though the legislature has effectively told you that , because of overcrowding , he might not serve that whole sentence . If you are a rehabilitation type judge , or you worry about Clem ' s dependents , you might do as this judge did , and focus on the rehabilitation , with the idea that more progress can be made on the outside than on the inside . As long as the sentence is legal , as a judge , the choice is yours : Do you focus on retribution ? Or rehabilitation ?
