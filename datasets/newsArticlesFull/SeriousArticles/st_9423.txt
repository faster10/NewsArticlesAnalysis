" The issue of creating some sort of platform in the Arctic is an interesting sort of idea , " Derocher said on video from Canada ( which , apparently , has better Internet connections than our offices in New York ) . " The challenge is really one of scale . When you look at the size of a polar bear ' s home range the size they wander over in a year you ' re basically talking ( about ) an area that ' s two thirds the size of Texas . So these are huge areas . And if you go around the circumpolar Arctic , there ' s so much habitat that would have to be put in place that it ' s basically untenable in terms of a spacial scale . "
