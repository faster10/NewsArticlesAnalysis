? Biden s withdrawal means Clinton will lock up even more commitments from the Democratic establishment , giving her even more super delegates and making it easier to bounce back if Sanders wins Iowa , New Hampshire , or both . I reported in August that Clinton s camp already had in hand private commitments from enough of the elected and party officials who are automatic delegates to the national convention next summer ( so called super delegates ) that she was one fifth of her way to the nomination . That number has increased significantly in recent weeks and will go up now that Biden has passed on the race . This allows Team Clinton to make a robust argument about her inevitability and gives it a squadron of surrogates from the left , centre , and right of the Democratic Party to wound Sanders , buck her up if she stumbles , and , eventually , argue that the senator should get out of the competition if she wins early .
