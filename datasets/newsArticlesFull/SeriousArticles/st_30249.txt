The forthcoming election might well be the most competitive of its kind in more than 50 years , certainly since the military took over in a coup in 1962 , just 14 years after Myanmar won independence from the British .

Many hope that Myanmar , once the most prosperous country in the region , might regain some of its former eminence and even become a reliable western ally , detached from its previous paymaster , China .
