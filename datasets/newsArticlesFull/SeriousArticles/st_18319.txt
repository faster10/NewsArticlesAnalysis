Frustration probably more than disappointment . Frustration with the injuries that have happened with the offensive line and wide receiver that ' s really made it difficult for Rivers . His tight end Antonio Gates has been bothered by a knee injury , he missed the first four games of the season because of suspension . So he hasn ' t had all the pieces there , and now Malcom Floyd is out for the year . So the frustration of the things you can ' t control , and that ' s the injuries , are really bothering San Diego .
