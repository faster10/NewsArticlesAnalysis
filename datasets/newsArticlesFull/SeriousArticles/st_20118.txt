Teresa Giudice released a statement to HLN after being charged , saying she plans to stand by her man throughout the ordeal . " Today is a most difficult day for our family . I support Joe and , as a wonderful husband and father , I know he wants only the best for our lovely daughters and me . I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible , which includes continuing my career . As a result , I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the Government as quickly as possible . "
