Card ' s public stance against gay marriage has been controversial , but none of those views have made it into the film . The movie actually contains an anti bullying theme of tolerance . Mostly , it ' s a harmless , slightly clunky story in which the undercooked plot and unremarkable performances fail to match the visual ambition . The revelations in the film ' s downbeat but satisfying final act hint at deeper wrinkles that were ironed out of the novel on its journey to the multiplex . But by the time the movie finally manages to get interesting , audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back . Grade : C
