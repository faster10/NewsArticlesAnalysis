What is exhilarating and impressive in the design is often undone in the detail . It makes some conceptual sense to cast the same actors in numerous roles it implies something about the human struggle and what one character calls " perpetual recurrence " but disguised and coated in layers of makeup , the stars ( they include Tom Hanks , Jim Broadbent , Halle Berry , Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw ) repeatedly default to crass caricature . The dramaturgy is frequently jarringly crude and ham fisted frenzied comic relief fails to hit the mark ( Mitchell ' s very dry , English sense of humor eludes them ) . There are fleeting moments of inspiration the Wachowskis are clearly in their element in the corporatized neo Seoul of the not so distant future but a post apocalyptic episode where everyone speaks an incomprehensible invented pidgin cries out for cutting , and the earliest seafaring tale is also a very long haul .
