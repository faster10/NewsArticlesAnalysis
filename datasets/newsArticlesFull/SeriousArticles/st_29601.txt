The three hour protest , which kicked off in a garden in the city ' s business district and went on to the U . S . consulate and the Hong Kong government headquarters , failed to gain a strong sense of momentum , hampered in part by the narrow looping route allocated by the city ' s authorities . At each rallying point , only a small group was able to gather around to hear the keynote speakers most protesters were relegated to standing single or double file some distance away . By the time the protest moved outside the government headquarters to deliver an open letter to the city ' s leader , Chief Executive C . Y . Leung , the crowd had dropped to about 100 people .
