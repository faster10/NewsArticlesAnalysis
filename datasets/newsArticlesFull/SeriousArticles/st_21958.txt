For those not well versed in Agent 007 lore , Spectre alludes , in part , to shadowy crime syndicate SPECTRE , which first appeared in Fleming s 1961 novel Thunderball and the 1962 Sean Connery era film Dr No . Our man stumbles across this worldwide criminal organization after he pulls an octopus embossed ring off the finger of an assassin he throws from a helicopter above a public square in Mexico City . Though Bond is intrigued , his bosses are displeased by the publicity , especially as Her Majesty s Secret Service is about to be contracted into the British government s MI6 .
