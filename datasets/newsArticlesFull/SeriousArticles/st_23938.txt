The lack of diversity isn ' t in the movies that ultimately make it to be reviewed by the Academy members . The lack of diversity is in the stories chosen to be produced by studios throughout the year and the roles that are offered to actors of color . The lack of diversity is in the overlooking of black screenwriters in writing black characters that are more than stereotypes or placeholders among a largely white cast . The problem is the lack of promotion of movies with majority black cast or the limited release to theaters . The lack of diversity and lack of enthusiasm for movies produced with more realistic portrayals of black characters leads to apathy among the industry which trickles down to apathy among the viewers . It can be seen among the responses to the outrage . Many people of color echoed that they didn ' t expect or hope to get recognized by the Academy anyway .
