Sanders supporters see Wall Street and a rigged system as the enemy of the people and view Hillary Clinton as a sell out to both . It s a variation of the theme that split Democrats in 1968 . Back then , the revolution was led by Senator Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy . They challenged the establishment , led by Humphrey . The fight was mainly over Vietnam but the causes of social and economic justice were also part of the internal conflict . With Kennedy s death , Humphrey won the battle for the nomination , but ultimately lost the general election war .
