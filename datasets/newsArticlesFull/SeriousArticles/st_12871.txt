For Murray s coach , Amelie Mauresmo , the great thing was that her charge refused to lie down . He was incredible because he was in a bit of trouble , she said . Milos definitely improved a lot and his serve was really hard . Andy had a lot of trouble reading it at the beginning and then as the match was going on he was reading it better and better so that was really a big satisfaction . But he never gives up , that s basically what happened tonight and in the fifth set he was able to physically and mentally get over Milos . But it was a tough one tonight .
