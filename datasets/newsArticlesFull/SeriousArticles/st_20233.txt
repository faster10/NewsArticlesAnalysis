Hint : You know you are in a crisis when a president known to be a control freak who is allergic to delegating responsibility and has alienated many in his own government by his reliance on a small coterie of close aides starts arguing he had no idea what his government was doing . That might be credible , or tolerable , when it comes to IRS snooping on conservative groups or how the tech work was handled on the rollout of a health care website . But when it comes to the vitally important , hugely sensitive business of managing America ' s intelligence programs , such " ignorance " beggars the imagination .
