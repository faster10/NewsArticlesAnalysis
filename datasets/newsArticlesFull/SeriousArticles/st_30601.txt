Bowie had already recorded and sequenced Ziggy Stardust before Hunky Dory was released . Such was the speed people moved at in those days of two albums a year . There was no time for second guessing yourself , Scott recalled . The only change made to the album was the replacement of a cover of Chuck Berry s Around and Around with Starman , a radio friendly single made at the request of the boss of Bowie s new record company , RCA . Bowie had no problem doing him this favour , once he had finished the heavy lifting involved in recording the album .
