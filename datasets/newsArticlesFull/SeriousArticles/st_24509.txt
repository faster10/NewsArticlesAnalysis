One wildcard : Ben Carson . The retired neurosurgeon briefly led polls in Iowa before his campaign fell apart in November . But he ' s held onto a loyal base of support , creeping close to 10 percent of likely caucus goers .

Carson will spend the day primarily in northwest Iowa before calling it a night in West Des Moines .
