New Yorkers are always striving for the best . We want to be the best . The best . It can get a little obnoxious and arrogant but at the same time , it can be a good thing , he told The Daily Caller . Yes it s a bit of a racket living in New York because everything is so expensive but people who live there , they love it and they re willing to work damn hard and get callouses on their hands and elbow grease on their elbows just to live there , and I think that s very commendable in a lot of areas .
