As she reflects on the garden , and how far it ' s come , Susan says " probably the biggest thing I ' ve learned is how incredibly important it is for human beings to have something they can take ownership of and feel strongly about . . . . And with that also comes a tremendous amount of confidence and really a comfort level of being in this country , having an opportunity to share it with their children . . . . It ' s been really amazing to see that grow because it tells the story of people getting a chance to do something that ' s good for them and good for their families , but really is central to who they are and it makes people so much stronger .
