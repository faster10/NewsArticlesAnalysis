Mezrich : Actually , Thad ' s story came to me . Soon after he was released from prison , he reached me through mutual friends he ' d read my stuff in prison and wanted to tell me his story . Ever since " Bringing Down The House " and especially since " The Social Network " every genius kid who pulls of a scheme calls me , but this story was different it really blew my mind . I ' d always wanted to write about NASA , because when you think of NASA you think of the ' 60s , the Apollo stuff , not the NASA of today . Thad ' s story was a great way to get inside one of the most amazing places on earth .
