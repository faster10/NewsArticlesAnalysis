With my flight a day away , I hadn ' t yet begun the routine I use to prepare for trips to the U . S . Government and airline guidelines explain some of what you need to collect . They don ' t explain the code switching bit : being conscious of what you wear , how you look , how you answer questions . A Pakistani friend once told me she always travels to the States in gear from her American university . It ' s a way of signaling : ? I ' m normal ! I promise ! I once told my brother that I ' d mentioned to an immigration officer I might travel to Pakistan soon to visit my parents . Shocked , he texted back , " Oh , um . " It ' s best , Muslims tell each other , to be a bit vague to avoid setting off alarms . So we become a little more restrained , push ourselves a little further into the shadows so far , in fact , that we ' re almost choking on all the words we ought to be able to casually share .
