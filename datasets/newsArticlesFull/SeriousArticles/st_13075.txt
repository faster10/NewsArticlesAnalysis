Well , pain is going to drive that . If your tooth is abscessed to the point it has to come out , the pain will be the driving factor . As most people know , when you have a tooth that needs a root canal or there ' s a bad abscess , you can hardly function . You need to get it out right away . If you have to do it by yourself , you can follow Tom Hanks ' method . He grabbed a rock and filed it down to pry it out . A lot of times when a tooth gets that bad , it gets pretty loose in general . In a zombie apocalypse , tools should still be readily available . So grab some pliers , and if you ' re going to pull it , just grab and pull it to the outside of your face . It should pull right out . You can take a screwdriver , or something narrow , and actually get it in between two teeth . Push against the tooth that ' s hurting , and that will get it mobile , then grab it with the pliers , and pull it out .
