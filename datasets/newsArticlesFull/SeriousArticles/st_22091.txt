British readers will see parallels between Sanders v Clinton and Jeremy Corbyn v the Blairites . But there s a crucial difference . Sanders is a very American socialist . On foreign policy he s quite mainstream : crush Isil , finish the job in Afghanistan . His position on gun control has shifted as per the views of his rural constituents . And he does not call for nationalisation of the economy but a restoration of stakeholder capitalism . His obsession with the venality of the big banks harks back to Andrew Jackson s Bank War or William Jennings Bryan s campaign for free silver , while his puritanical opposition to the influence of money has hints of Jerry Brown , Ross Perot and even Father Coughlin ( before he went crazy ) . When Sanders speaks , I don t hear Stalin . I hear Huey Long and Woody Guthrie , with a dash of Norman Mailer .
