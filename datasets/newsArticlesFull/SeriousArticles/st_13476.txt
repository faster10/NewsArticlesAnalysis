I ' m not the sort of partisan who ' s spent the last several years agitated about Keystone , as many on both the left and right have . I ' ve always felt that this is just one project it wouldn ' t be an enormous job creator , but nor would it be a huge climate killer . Nixing Keystone won ' t matter much to the environment , and might even be a net negative . And if you ' re really worked up about climate change , why focus on Keystone ? The ultimate game is to get an international agreement ( there are talks scheduled in Paris ) that would address checks on reducing China ' s emissions .
