It also maintains that the jet s crew had been warned prior to the attack .

The surviving Russian pilot , Konstantin Murakhtin , confirmed that neither he nor Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Peshkov , who was killed by Turkmen rebel machine gun fire after ejecting , had received any radio or visual warning from the Turkish F 16 .
