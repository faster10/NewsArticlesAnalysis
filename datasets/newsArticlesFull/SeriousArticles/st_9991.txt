Throughout our visit , Vincent kept asking the kind NASA public affairs officers if there were " clean rooms " or " white rooms " he could photograph in , and they were generous enough to let him navigate his way through a handful . At one point , we entered an enormous three chambered room full of men and women working on towering rocket engines . It was akin to stumbling on to the set of Micro Machines : the Movie but with the people in miniature . Vincent snapped a few photos but pressed forward quickly , as he was more interested in the adjacent airlock room with its almost fully white aesthetic . Here he had a little more more freedom to let his cinematic imagination take hold , as well as the option of positioning a worker in a clean room suit ( aka " bunny suit " ) . The images are reminiscent of some he took at Ariane in French Guiana , with their stark empty spaces broken up by vivid lines and colors .
