Robby Kalland , college football writer : Simply put , Alabama ' s the best team in the country with the best college defense I ' ve ever seen . I think Clemson ' s a fantastic team with a defense can cause problems for the Tide ' s offense , and the Tigers will be the best offensive team that Alabama ' s faced . It still doesn ' t matter . This Alabama defense is so ridiculously good that I think it can neutralize the Clemson offense and force this game to be played at their pace . Eventually , I see Alabama ' s offense finding success and pulling away late to earn a comfortable win and a fourth title under Saban .
