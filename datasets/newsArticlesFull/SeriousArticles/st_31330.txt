Well , for starters , the answer was " a lot " but at the same time , I didn ' t feel bad for them one bit . The simple truth is that Sparty has been playing with fire all year yes , entering the Nebraska game they were 8 0 , but they also had four wins by a touchdown or less , including narrow victories over an awful Purdue team by three , and an even more awful Rutgers team by seven . Simply put , if you ' re a really good team , if you ' re a truly elite playoff contender , those are teams you should be blowing out , yet Michigan State was barely getting by them . Meaning that ultimately , the Spartans were due to lose a game . It just so happened to come in the one game that they probably didn ' t deserve to lose . ?
