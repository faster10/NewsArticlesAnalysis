For Warner Bros . , " Cloud Atlas ' " failure is not the worst news the studio acquired domestic distribution rights for a reported 15 million and marketed the film but the real losers here are the Wachowski siblings and the foreign investors who financed the project . " Cloud Atlas " cost a whopping 100 million , and it has no chance of making that money back at least not in the States . Another loser ? Tom Hanks , whose box office clout has all but disappeared in recent years . Cloud Atlas arrives on the heels of two other box office underperformers : " Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close " ( 31 . 9 million ) and " Larry Crowne " ( 35 . 6 million ) .
