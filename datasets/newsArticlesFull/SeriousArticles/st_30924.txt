No one , including kids , should travel without a lightweight , rolling duffel . Lands End ( www . landsend . com ) or L . L . Bean ( www . llbean . com ) offer them in a variety of colors and while you ' re at it , order a monogrammed fleece blanket for each child for those interminable car trips . I ' m also a fan of fleece jackets and vests for travel because they ' re lightweight and dry quickly . You can find them everywhere , even for young kids .
