Hopkins : Hopkins is great on contested catches . If he s one on one , he and the Texans quarterbacks consider him open , no matter what . But he s also adept at getting open through very precise route running . One thing he s worked on with the Texans this season is disguising the top of the route so an opposing defensive back doesn t quite know what he s about to do . This was on full display when the Texans faced the New York Jets this season . One on one with Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis , Hopkins had 98 yards and a touchdown in the first half . It was Hopkins most impressive half of the season . Since that game , no team has tried to single cover Hopkins .
