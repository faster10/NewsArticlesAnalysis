One would so like to believe that were the case . Shinseki has a sterling record as a soldier . He was twice wounded in Vietnam the second time grievously , losing most of one foot . A lesser man would have been forced out of the service but through sheer courage ( he used to run punishing laps around a track to show he was still able ) , he convinced the Army to let him stay and he rose to four stars . More recently , Shinseki was the man who had the guts to tell the truth before we went into Iraq insisting he needed a much bigger force and was essentially cashiered . I have long been an unabashed admirer .
