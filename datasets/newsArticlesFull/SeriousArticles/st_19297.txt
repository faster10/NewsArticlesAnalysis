People would actually say things like , Who would ever love you ? ? You were a stripper . Why are you in relationships ? And I used to feel like I had to explain that maybe it was because I m a good person , she wrote in TIME . But I realized that I ? can t make everyone believe . And I can t talk to everyone and tell them who I really am . They re still going to have their own opinions . If you know me , you love me . If you don t know me , you might love me , but you might not ? and that s cool . And you know what ? Now I sleep like a baby at night .
