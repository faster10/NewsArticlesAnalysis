What happens when a Pakistan official delegation meets the Kashmiri separatists ahead of talks ? Has New Delhi received some sort of assurance from Pakistan that this will not happen ? But knowing Pakistan ? ? ? s domestic compulsions , it is hardly likely that the army will agree to this . Or can it be that India has decided to overlook Pakistani officials meeting the Hurriyat Conference before official talks in New Delhi ? No one knows for sure . But these things may resurface again . Having drawn the lines , mainly to show that Modi ? ? ? s government is different from the previous UPA regime , going back on this may look silly . Or is it that the Pakistan has promised to do so only after the talks ? No one knows for sure .
