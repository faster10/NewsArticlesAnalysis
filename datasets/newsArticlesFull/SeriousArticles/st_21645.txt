The Lakers closed the gap to 49 42 late in the second quarter , but McCollum knocked down a 3 as the Blazers closed the half with an 11 4 spurt to go into the break ahead by 14 points . At the start of the game , we saw him hit that first one and so I tried to just keep calling plays and in transition keep finding him . He finished with seven points and no assists in 17 minutes . The Clippers came in at 38 . 8 percent ? they shot 19 percent in the second quarter ? and Portland shot 37 . 9 percent .
