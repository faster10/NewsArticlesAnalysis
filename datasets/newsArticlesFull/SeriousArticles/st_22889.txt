Also in the dossier are results of forensic tests done before Morris ' s trial , which found traces of a man ' s DNA on the murder weapon , the matches used to light the fire , and on Mandy ' s clothes and watch . Inexplicably , further tests that could have established whether this DNA matched Morris or someone else were never carried out . Morris has always protested his innocence , and from his cell at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire , is urging the CCRC to have these further tests conducted as soon as possible .
