JL : Yes it is , and many top generals continue to say that Assad is the magnet , and of course , that makes a little bit of sense , but not a lot of sense : because , after all , when did Al Qaeda get into Iraq ? It was when the Americans came and I don t think any of them would have suggested that America was the magnet and America should have left Iraq in order to get rid of Al Qaeda . The American policy in Iraq has been to send more troops in order to kill Al Qaeda , not less . The lack of security is what has allowed Al Qaeda to spread in Iraq , and they don t seem to be using the same logic for Syria and that s just part of the landscape in America . You ve got to understand , I think , that U . S . has two different matrix one for Iraq and one for Syria .
