In my project , I included interviews along with the portraits so that the viewer could get a real sense of who they were . I recently curated " Inside the Outsider , " a photography exhibition for Mason Murer Fine Art . The theme was about how we have all felt like an outsider in some way , and in that way , we are all the same . I think if we took that to heart , we would realize that there isn ' t anything that we are going through that no one else is and that no one is as different from us as we may think that they are .
