Add to that Trump ' s experience as a presidential candidate . As a former co producer for Jay Leno ' s " Tonight Show , " I frequently booked Trump as a guest , and worked with him . When " The Apprentice " began airing in 2004 , he launched a . . . wink , wink . . . presidential campaign on " The Tonight Show " and other programs , which lasted until 2015 . This was nothing more than a front to promote his show . Even so , it established him as an even bigger celebrity , as well as a believable presidential candidate .
