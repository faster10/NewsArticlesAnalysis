Maybe you don t care about queer cinema and instead you were rooting for Ridley Scott ( The Martian ) , the veteran director who has been nominated three times but has never won ? No sight of him either , despite the fact that many thought Scott would win the whole thing this year . Or perhaps you were interested in seeing lots of veteran actresses recognized after the Golden Globes nominated four supporting actresses over 40 ? Not a chance , this year s female nominees were just as young and nubile as ever . The average age of this year s Best Supporting Actress crop was 37 , thirteen years young than their male counterparts . The Best Actor ( 43 . 2 ) and Actress ( 39 . 4 ) nominees were a bit closer in age , but per usual , the men averaged nearly half a decade older .
