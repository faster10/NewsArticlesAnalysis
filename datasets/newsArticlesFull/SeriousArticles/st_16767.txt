Right around the end of the regular season , I wanted to try to put these Royals in some kind of historical context . I wanted to know how good they are at hitting the ball , relative to other teams over the past several decades , but it ' s not as easy as just looking at the strikeouts because whiffs have increased over time , especially lately . You have to make adjustments , so I folded in yearly league averages and standard deviations . What I found : by the resulting measure , the Royals were baseball ' s best contact hitting team since at least 1950 . I went back no further , because I didn ' t see the point .
