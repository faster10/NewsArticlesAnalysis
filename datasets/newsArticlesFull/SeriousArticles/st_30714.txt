In Bavaria , Peter Dreier , a district mayor belonging to another right wing party has raised the prospect of local disobedience to the resettling of refugees . Earlier this month , he packed off a busload of them to Berlin , saying he couldn ' t settle any more in his district , Landshut . With thousands already placed in rental accommodation in villages dotted around the district , Mr Dreier says he is having to dump hundreds more in poor temporary shelters and fears " social harmony is at risk " .
