As it is , Rodgers looked like a mess even though he was barely touched . His helmet was askew after the play , not because he was egregiously mangled , but because he uses one of those old two point chin straps that excels at giving adolescent boys a chin of socially crippling acne in under a quarter but sucks at keeping a player s helmet on . Apparently the single bar Joe Theismann lid rocked in the 80s or a Gretzky Jofa brain bucket aren t allowable , or I presume Rodgers would be rocking one of those as well . But how Rodgers looked after a play should have absolutely no bearing on whether a foul occurred .
