I was , for example , with my father at the 1964 doubleheader with the Giants at Shea Stadium , which remains the longest doubleheader in baseball history . The second game went 23 innings . At one point Willie Mays was playing shortstop . The Mets had a triple play . The second game was the longest in time in major league history , seven hours , 23 minutes , and the doubleheader remains the longest ever at nine hours , 52 minutes . We were there to the end . Of course , the Mets lost both games .
