Under all of this is the assumption that Republican voters are conservatives first , driven by conservative principles . And to an extent , that s true . But it s self serving to ignore , or deny , the extent to which Republican voters have been mobilized and organized by the politics of white backlash , and the degree to which conservative organs like National Review have been active participants in the process . The classic example is William F . Buckley s infamous 1957 editorial , Why the South Must Prevail , where the National Review founder and premier conservative intellectual made the case against the civil rights movement . The central question that emerges , writes Buckley , is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail , politically and culturally , in areas in which it does not predominate numerically . The sobering answer is Yes ? the White community is so entitled because , for the time being , it is the advanced race .
