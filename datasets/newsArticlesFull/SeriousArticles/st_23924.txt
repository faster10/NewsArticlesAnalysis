Just as America had precious little influence over South Vietnam s venal rulers in the 1960s , so China has lost its grip on Pyongyang . Kim clearly believes that his neighbour will bankroll his rule whatever he does . And so his nuclear arsenal continues to expand . A decade ago , Kim s father had four or five Hiroshima type atom bombs , deliverable only from a vulnerable warplane . Today , his son possesses up to 20 nuclear weapons , perhaps half of which could be loaded on ballistic missiles . Those missiles , meanwhile , acquire ever longer ranges : The Taepodong 2 , currently in development , could fly across continents and strike as far away as the US . So North Korea has crossed the vital threshold from being a country with a handful of primitive atom bombs to one that could actually launch nuclear missiles .
