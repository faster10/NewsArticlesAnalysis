But it doesn t , really . And every last attempt by Republicans to show that ( a ) Clinton didn t care about this tragedy or ( b ) that she participated in a politically motivated coverup of the true nature of the Benghazi attack , fell disastrously flat for the Committee s hapless prosecutors . On Point A , she attended a deputy s level meeting ? something a Cabinet officer rarely does ? in the hours after the attack to make sure that State , Defense , CIA and other relevant agencies were doing all they could to respond . On point B , it seems clear that a local militia used the cover of regional protests against an anti Islamic video to launch an attack on the compound . The initial assumption ? by everyone , not just Clinton ? that this was part of a regional pattern of violent demonstrations was understandable , not at all conspiratorial and even if it was part of an Obama plan to low ball the continuing threat of Al Qaeda , that is a matter of politics , and it pertains not at all to deaths in Benghazi .
