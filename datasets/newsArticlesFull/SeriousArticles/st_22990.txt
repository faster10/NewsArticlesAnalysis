As American soldiers leave Afghanistan , they must not " hand over " power to Karzai or any similar figure . Instead , the United States must work hard in the next year to build deeper ties with diverse local leaders , many of whom oppose both the Taliban and Karzai at the same time . The United States should encourage power sharing between groups , and it should avoid dependence on Karzai for security after 2012 . Afghanistan needs more federalism across regions and less centralization in Kabul .
