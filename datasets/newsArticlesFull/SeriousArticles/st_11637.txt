The Australian share market finished the session sharply higher due to bargain buying among all ten sectors , led by consumer staples , materials resources and financial blue chip stocks . The advance came as further data suggested the local economy continues to hold up , despite the end to the boom in commodities investment and a more recent cooling in the property market . At the close , the benchmark S P ASX 200 index ended 99 . 60 points , or 1 . 93 , higher at 5266 . 10 points , while the broader All Ordinaries index grew 94 . 40 points , or 1 . 81 , to 5312 . 60 points . Rising stocks outnumbered declining ones on the Australia Stock Exchange by 562 to 448 and 151 ended unchanged . The S P ASX 200 VIX , which measures the implied volatility of S P ASX 200 options , was down 2 . 82 to 16 . 825 a new 3 months low , suggesting 4 . 8 swing in the equity benchmark index in the next 30 days .
