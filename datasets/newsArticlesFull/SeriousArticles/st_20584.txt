The Davis Cup is an idiosyncratic event . Tennis is an individual sport , but this is its version of a World Cup , a team competition that often seems insignificant next to the glamour of the grand slams . Yet it means the world to the British and Belgian teams this weekend and the cheers were ear splitting when the curtains around came down to reveal the two teams standing side by side at the net before the start of play . They were joined on court by the king and queen of Belgium . It was an occasion that called for pomp and ceremony . Happy young people , curiously bare footed , sang the national anthems . While Great Britain are looking to end 79 years of hurt , Belgium are hoping to win the Davis Cup for the first time in their modest tennis history . This is only the second time they have reached the final ? and their last appearance ended in a 5 0 defeat to Great Britain at Wimbledon in 1904 .
