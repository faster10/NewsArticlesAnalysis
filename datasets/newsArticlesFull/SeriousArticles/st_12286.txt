6 Hidden plays , Part 2 : Jared Allen got no credit for this on the stat sheet , but he really should get half a sack on one play Seattle ran Sunday . Allen sniffed out a screen and stayed home as Russell Wilson tried to lure him into a rush . With Allen ready to intercept the ball if it was thrown , a flummoxed Wilson ended up taking a sack . Allen was credited with no tackles Sunday , but he also had three quarterback hurries . The Panthers will miss Allen if he misses Sunday s game ? as I expect he will ? because of a fracture in his foot .
