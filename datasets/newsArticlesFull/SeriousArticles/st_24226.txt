John Oreovicz , ESPN . com : I like Truex because his story is a combination of good stories his girlfriend ' s successful battle with cancer , the " rebel " single car team operating out of Colorado with a rookie Canadian crew chief , and of course the driver ' s own story : rebuilding his career from a point where things looked pretty bleak 24 months ago through no fault of his own . Truex would make for a popular champion , and with a strong historical track record at Homestead , he shouldn ' t be discounted this weekend .
