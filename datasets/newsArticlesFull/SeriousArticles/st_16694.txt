Zubayr is 36 years old , according to most accounts , and originally from Somaliland , now a vaguely autonomous part of northern Somalia . He is slim to the point of wispy , as shown on the very few photographs of him , and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public . As a teenager , he studied at a Pakistani madrassa , thanks to a grant from a wealthy Saudi , and he returned home with militant beliefs and an appetite for trouble . He was thought to have been involved in the abduction and murder of several foreign aid workers in Somaliland , including the killing of Italian aid worker Annalena Tonelli in 2003 .
