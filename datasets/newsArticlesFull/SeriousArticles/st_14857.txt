Remember the Charcandrick West era ? In the aftermath of Jamaal Charles ' season ending knee injury , West was run into the ground , racking up 88 carries in three and a half games before a hamstring injury put him on the shelf for Week 12 . Spencer Ware stepped right in and kept things rolling , given the Kansas City Chiefs double digit Fantasy points in Weeks 11 and 12 . West returned to action in Week 13 , but Ware outperformed him , scoring eight Fantasy points in a split workload to West ' s three . However , West had 11 touches in the win over the Oakland Raiders , to Ware ' s nine , and actually played twice as many snaps ( 34 ) as Ware ( 17 ) . The Chiefs are likely to continue to get both backs involved in the offense , but don ' t be fooled by Ware outscoring West in Week 13 West is the one you want to rely on for Fantasy purposes in Week 14 , if anyone .
