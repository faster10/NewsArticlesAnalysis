But if Roethlisberger is starting to feel as if this is one of those rotten seasons , it ' s hard to blame him . The Steelers lost Pouncey , their All Pro center , to a knee injury in the preseason , then lost Beachum , their left tackle , against the Arizona Cardinals Oct . 18 . That ' s 40 percent of their offensive line . Roethlisberger was out with his knee injury . Wide receiver Martavis Bryant missed the first four games because of a drug suspension and the fifth because of a minor knee injury . Throw in all of the injuries to the defensive players . The 4 4 record seems about right .
