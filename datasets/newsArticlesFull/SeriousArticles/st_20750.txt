When Shanahan heard Griffin ' s plea , he should have looked across the locker room at his son , Kyle Shanahan , who serves as the team ' s offensive coordindator . Were RGIII his son ( and not merely his quarterback ) , would he have sent him back on the field , sans a leg ? Would he have forced Kyle to face one of the NFL ' s most vicious defenses without a full arsenal ? Shanahan should have thought of all the retired NFL players who can no longer walk , can no longer drive , can no longer feed themselves , who in the name of toughness and staying on the field are pathetic shells of their former selves .
