The schtick of the play is that Greg and Kate , like all pet owners , anthropomorphise their animal . They speak to Sylvia like a person and they imagine her responses as more or less logical and grammatical . Dressed in a fuzzy sweater , Daisy Dukes , a velour bodysuit , and a collar , her jumble of blond hair spilling to her shoulders , she looks less like a dog than like some bridge and tunnel teen on a tear . And her acting isn t particularly doggy either , although there s a way she tosses her head that does suggest the canine .
