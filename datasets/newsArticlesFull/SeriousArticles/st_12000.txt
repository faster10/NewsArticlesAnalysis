WILL HE HELP OR HURT ? Hillary has called Bill her secret weapon , but her GOP opponents have wasted no time in trying to make him a liability , ABC s JENNIFER HANSLER writes . Bill was viewed as a " wildcard " in the 2008 presidential race and he engaged in a number of angry exchanges with voters and reporters . He notably called Obama s contention that he was consistently opposed the Iraq War as the biggest fairytale he d ever seen . His remarks equating Obama s success in South Carolina to Jesse Jackson s wins there in 1984 and 1988 sparked huge controversy . Those remarks and his subsequent accusations that Obama s campaign had played the race card drew such wide backlash , particularly from the African American community , that they elicited an apology from Hillary herself . However unpredictable he may be , Bill has the potential to be an extremely valuable asset to his wife s second run for the White House . He has retained a consistently high public approval rating since leaving office ? 56 percent according to a March 2015 NBC Wall Street Journal poll . http : abcn . ws 1OHCa8g
