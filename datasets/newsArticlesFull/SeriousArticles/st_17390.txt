While there has been lots of post ? meeting commentary laying the blame for yesterday s mishap at the door of Draghi and some of his colleagues , we think a portion of the blame also needs to be assigned to market participants . We do think that the ECB could and should have found a way to check market expectations as they got ramped ever higher in the run up to the meeting . But we also think the market is guilty of suspending disbelief to a degree in allowing itself to get so bulled up on the prospects for action given that the incoming news on the euro zone economy has been encouraging in some important respects . As we have noted several times in recent weeks , the latest news from the business surveys has shown reasonably positive momentum is being maintained in economic activity , thus calling into question the need for the uber ? aggressive easing which markets had come to expect .
