" We talked at halftime , ' Hey , we ' ve had some struggles in the second half " . And yet it was one of those contests that felt a bit like a vintage dead ball era National Football League game , where defenses were the dominant paradigm on both sides of the ball . After passing for 119 yards in the first half , McCarron managed only 81 after halftime and was sacked twice . Their offense has been improving in recent weeks , so I expect them to score a little more than the three they scored against us last time . So KC would need an upset to win the AFC West . And that ' s fine . He completed 12 of 17 passes and spearheaded an offense that converted seven of eight third downs against the top rated defense in the NFL .
