Phyllis Bennis : No , this was clearly a political move by the Obama administration to fend off pressure from many : from Congress , from Israel and elsewhere , who were very unhappy with the implementation potential of the Iran nuclear deal . I think that this was expected quite soon . There was a certain amount of juggling because of the prisoner exchange that was under way . But these are very , very narrow sanctions in terms of what the impact will be there will be virtually no impact on ordinary Iranians . Unlike the earlier sanctions that were lifted ? that were crippling the Iranian economy and created enormous problems for the ordinary civilian population in Iran these are quite targeted on 11 individuals and a couple of small companies that have allegedly been involved in procurement of some kind of ballistic missile technology . I think that on both sides there is a lot of political posturing underway . Obviously it would have been better not to engage in such a provocative move right at this moment , when there is a great deal of excitement on both sides for a potential new relationship on the basis of the implementation of the Iran deal ? the prisoner exchange was a reflection of that . I don t think this is enough to derail it , but it certainly does make it a little bit more difficult .
