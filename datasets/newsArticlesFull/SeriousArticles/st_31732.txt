Indeed , some of the strongest voices of support for Katie came from the 501st Legion , an international charitable organization dedicated to creating exact costume replications of characters from Star Wars . When Katie mentioned that she would like to be a Stormtrooper for Halloween last year , the 501st Legion put out a call to action , and members worldwide donated parts for a miniature set of armor . The Midwest Garrison assembled the costume and presented it to Katie in a ceremony that ended with her hugging Darth Vader . After Katie outgrows the armor , we ' ll donate it back to the 501st so it can be passed to another child , most likely through the Make A Wish Foundation .
