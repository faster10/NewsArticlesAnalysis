Fey ' s sweet and sour line readings at first sound like Liz Lemon redux , and I was glad for the moment when her 10 year relationship with a twit of an English professor ( Michael Sheen , who also played one of Liz ' s disastrous boyfriends on " 30 Rock " ) crashes and burns . The breakup unhinges Fey ' s character , and liberates her performance . From that point on , she ' s falling apart or at least falling into a pit of desperation and the neurotic crack up looks good on her . It gives almost everything she does a shimmer of spontaneity .
