What is it , asked the PM , that makes the Constitution a document that abides and inspires , in a changing world ? What is that width of vision , that makes B . R . Ambedkar , who led the constitution making project , an icon who can be appropriated and owned , not just by one party and school of thought , or one generation and social section , but by one and all ? It is because the Indian Constitution is not just a legal document , it is a samajik dastavez or a social compact as well , the PM said . And this contract that binds a diverse people mirrors in the sprawl and complexity of its concerns the sensibility that Ambedkar brought to it as a Dalit ? shorn of any sense of resentment or retribution . In the Lok Sabha on Friday , PM Modi marvelled , rightly , at the capaciousness and largeheartedness of the constitutional framework . He underlined its expansiveness , and also its careful delineation of the limits of power .
