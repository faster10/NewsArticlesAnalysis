ISIS has repeatedly made clear , in its own English language publications , that it seeks to divide the world between the infidel Crusader West and the purifying force of radical Islam , and to destroy any gray zone of accommodation or d tente that lies between those stereotypical extremes . As scholar Bernard Lewis explained in an extended discourse on this subject back in 1993 ( long before he suckered himself into becoming a war cheerleader ) , the most important target of Islamic fundamentalism was not the West itself but pseudo Muslim apostates who had abandoned the true faith and become corrupted by secular foreign ideologies like liberalism or socialism or nationalism . This also could not possibly be clearer in the case of ISIS , which has murdered many times more Muslims than Westerners and whose ideological outreach is all about providing unemployed and disaffected Muslim youth in Europe and North America ( many from secular families ) a renewed sense of identity and community .
