As Inquisitr mentioned in a report earlier , the Vermont senator has not only managed to cut down Hillary Clinton s lead in the two states since mid November , but has even gone on to lead his fellow Democratic presidential hopeful by 13 percent in New Hampshire , according to Fox News poll results . Other polls conducted in the month of January , like the NBC News polls , have either shown Sanders coming perilously close to Hillary , or like the Quinnipiac polls , have shown the senator establishing daylight between himself and Clinton . So what , really ? if anything ? can we infer from the staggering amount of ground Bernie Sanders has been able to gain on Hillary Clinton now that we are only three weeks away from the Iowa caucuses ?
