If Sylvester Stallone was to finally claim Oscar gold , Creed is probably the most fitting film for him to do it with . Stallone has walked this tumultuous path before , long before he was a household name or a bona fide action superstar . Back in 1977 , the fledging filmmaker was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Rocky , the first film in the franchise . Rocky Balboa was introduced to the cinema masses , and Stallone s imprint on the industry has been present ever since . The win would mark a successful career for the actor , and it would be a poignant victory if he claimed gold for a successful franchise he started all those years ago .
