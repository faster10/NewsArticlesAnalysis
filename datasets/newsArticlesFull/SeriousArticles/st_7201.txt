This year ' s controversy has gained serious traction with a campaign to boycott the ceremony being spearheaded by Jada Pinkett Smith , wife of Hollywood star Will Smith . It s a boycott campaign which has so far attracted the support of black director Spike Lee , who said : " I would like to thank president Cheryl Boone Isaacs and the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for awarding me an honorary Oscar this past November . I am most appreciative . However my wife , Mrs Tonya Lewis Lee and I will not be attending the Oscar ceremony this coming February . We cannot support it and mean no disrespect to my friends , host Chris Rock and producer Reggie Hudlin , president Isaacs and the Academy . But , how is it possible for the 2nd consecutive year all 20 contenders under the actor category are white ? And let ' s not even get into the other branches . 40 white actors in 2 years and no flava at all . We can ' t act ? ! WTF ! ! "
