The first thing to say is that even when there were border controls between the 26 European countries that are signatories to the Schengen Agreement that established the free travel zone from 1995 , traffic flows were so great that most cars were waved through , unchecked . That was in the 1980s and 90s , when cars drove at least 500 million fewer passenger miles per year across Europe than they do now . Restoring Europe s internal borders today would be like putting border checks on state lines between New York and Washington . How many cars travelling on highway I 95 would actually be stopped ?
