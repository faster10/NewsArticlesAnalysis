Blige : I definitely had a scene with Tom Cruise , and he is just so helpful and so much fun . Everyone was just how can I say it ? Everyone in that star studded cast , they were just as star struck to meet me as I was to meet them . And when I met Catherine Zeta Jones , she was like , " I love you ! " And I was like , " What ? I love YOU ! " And Russell Brand is just amazing . And Julianne Hough is my friend , and Adam Shankman ( the director ) is one of my really good friends . So we were like family no joke .
