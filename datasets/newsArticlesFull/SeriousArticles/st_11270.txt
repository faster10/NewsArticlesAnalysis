Presto : In the dog days of August , that finale to " The Fugitive " drew the biggest ratings in the history of television up to that time . Since then , some of the most ambitious TV dramas have ended not with a bang or a whimper , but with a preconceived farewell ending . Some were perfect , like HBO ' s " Six Feet Under " and FX ' s " The Shield . " Others were disappointing , like ABC ' s " Lost " and , most recently , Showtime ' s " Dexter . " And some infuriated some while delighting others , like NBC ' s " St . Elsewhere " and HBO ' s " The Sopranos . "
