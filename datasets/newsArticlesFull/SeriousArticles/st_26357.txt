Now it s also true that Rubio causes no real excitement on the Republican side , either . But while that can hurt him in the primary , it s no big deal for him in the general election . Republicans have an army of elderly voters that never miss an election , which is why they kill in midterms but don t do as well in presidential election years . Plus , while Republicans may not be fired up about Rubio , they will be fired up about keeping the Democrat out of office ? whether it s Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders ? which will drive up turnout on their side .
