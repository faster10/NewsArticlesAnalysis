They couldn t run across the locker room for Gatorade , and James White is not Dion Lewis in the passing game . Denver s defense took away Tom Brady s favorite weapons most of the game , leaving him to throw 16 times to White , who almost made several big catches . Emphasis on almost . White was one on one with linebackers much of the day , a matchup Wade Phillips hoped Brady would focus on because it took his best weapons out of play . Brady did focus on White and completed only five passes , as several long throws fell short of the running back s ability to handle them . One third quarter pass that could have been a touchdown was deflected by backup safety Josh Bush after White broke into the open but couldn t create enough separation . Brandon Bolden beat Von Miller on one circle route for a 20 yard catch , but White was the featured player , and his production was minimal .
