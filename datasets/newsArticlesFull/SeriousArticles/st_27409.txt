Kobe retiring due to age and performance should serve as another reminder of how Tim Duncan s freakish career . Kobe s position and playing style takes a much greater toll on the legs , so it s kind of comparing mambas to oranges , but Duncan is two years older at age 39 and still an very important piece on a title contender . Duncan is not human . He is an alien . It s reassuring to know that if the rest of his species ever comes to Earth , they ll just be kind of boring and want to win basketball championships semi regularly . That s much preferred to zapping the planet with a giant laser .
