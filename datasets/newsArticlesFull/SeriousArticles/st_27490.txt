" Implied covenant claims ask a court to substitute state law for competitive market forces , contrary to Congress ' deregulatory intent " under the ADA , said Paul Clement , the company ' s appellate attorney , who will press his arguments before the justices . " This case arises in one of the discrete contexts in which ( the federal Department of Transportation ) retains substantial regulatory authority and capacity . If DOT determines that airlines are being deceptive or manipulative in exercising their discretion to remove abusive members of their frequent flyer programs ( an unlikely prospect since the programs exist to reward and retain the most valued customers ) , DOT has authority to act . Absent such a determination , there is no role for courts applying state law concepts of fundamental fairness and decency . "
