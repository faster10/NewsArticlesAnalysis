Gronkowski was out of the game battling leg cramps for a while and also took a solid blow on his thigh after one second half catch . But he battled through it all , showing guts and guile , and wound up with eight catches for a whopping 144 yards and that touchdown . No one wearing a Patriots uniform was remotely as efficient as Gronkowski on Sunday . And had New England converted the game tying two point conversion and gone on to win in overtime , Gronk s game would have become a major slice of Patriots playoff lore .
