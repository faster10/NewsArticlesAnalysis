Another useful conclusion that Trump has reached again to poke at Jeb through his brother and also to pillory President Obama is that the Middle East would have been safer if the United States had left dictators Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi Libya in power . He alluded to the same about leaving Bashar al Assad in power in Syria . Given the current chaos and civil war in both Iraq and Libya , this conclusion should be conventional wisdom among all of the candidates , but Trump makes news when he says it . It should also be obvious given what happened in those countries that taking out al Assad in Syria might also be a bad idea . But of course , that would require Obama and the Republican politicians to admit that the always " evil " Vlad Putin might occasionally have a point .
