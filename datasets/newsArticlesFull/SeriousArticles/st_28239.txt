Contain Clemson QB Deshaun Watson : This is one of those duh ! keys , but its obviousness doesn t make it any easier . It s hard to believe the 6 foot 2 , 205 pound Watson is only a sophomore given his talent and command of games . Yet the widespread belief Watson is the sort of quarterback that gives Bama fits is of dubious origin . In two losses to Ole Miss , neither Bo Wallace nor Chad Kelly presented anything like the rushing problem Watson does , and in last year s college football playoff Ohio State s Cardale Jones gained only 43 yards on 17 carries . Those quarterbacks ? beat Bama by keeping plays alive . The Tide swarmed Jones but couldn t bring him down Kelly had prayers answered in Tuscaloosa . Bama must keep Watson in the pocket and hope to capitalize on the fact he s thrown 12 picks .
