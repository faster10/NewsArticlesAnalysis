Jeb seemed to relish the night , and even took some joy in the discussion over immigration , which was an awkward sequence of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio accusing each other of supporting amnesty while at the same time defending their previous positions on some pathway to legalization . Bush even defended a pathway to citizenship as reasonable , pragmatic , and humane . Perhaps in recognition of his low support in the polls , he no longer felt compelled to appeal to the more conservative factions of the party , and instead chose to stand up for his record . Perhaps it is too late for Bush , with the damage done over the last six months , but my sense is the longer he is able to hang on , the stronger he will get .
