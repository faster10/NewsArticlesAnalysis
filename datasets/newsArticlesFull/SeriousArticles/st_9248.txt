I haven t changed my tune , Chris . In fact , I signed the bill that banned guns for people on the terror watch list . As president , I would make sure that the terror watch list was actually accurate . But I think most Americans believe if you re on the terror watch list , you shouldn t be able to buy guns , " he said . " But I also have vetoed the . 50 caliber rifle ban I ve also vetoed a statewide ID system . I ve also vetoed a reduction in the magazine ban , and I ve also pardoned six different folks so far who have been caught up very unfairly , in my view , in New Jersey s gun laws . So , listen , the approach I m going to take is to protect Second Amendment rights but also to make decisions that are in the best interests of the people of New Jersey . "
