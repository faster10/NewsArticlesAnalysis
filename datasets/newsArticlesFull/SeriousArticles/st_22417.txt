In Chongqing , police operations started in June , leading to the arrest of over 4 , 800 suspected gangsters and the confiscation of 1 , 700 illegal firearms . Investigations led to many city officials , including police officers . They include Wen Qiang , Xie Caiping ' s brother in law , who is now accused of colluding with gangsters . Highly regarded as an ace investigator , Wen was the deputy police commissioner and head of the city ' s justice bureau . Last August , he was stripped of his posts , detained and charged of accepting over 100 million yuan in bribes in exchange for giving gangs a " protective umbrella " . Local media reports say Chongqing residents celebrated Wen ' s arrest by setting off firecrackers .
