For the last year , with the release of my book , African Americans Against the Bomb , I have been fortunate to travel around the country meeting individuals who care deeply about race and nuclear disarmament . The most frequent question I have received was what I thought of Obama . I explained to audiences that writing about Obama was the hardest part of the book . As a historian , the worst thing I could do was predict and be wrong . As I state in my book , from passing the new START treaty to the Iran Nuclear Deal , at times Obama has acted boldly and heroically . However , his decision to take money out of nonproliferation programs while dedicating 1 trillion over the next thirty years to our nuclear arsenal continues to leave this part of his legacy in doubt .
