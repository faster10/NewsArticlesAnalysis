Eifert ' s inclusion on the inactive list in Week 13 was a bit surprising , even though his limited participation in practice hinted at the possibility . The breakout tight end is nursing a stinger in his neck , an injury that occurs when a bundle of nerves in the neck and shoulder area are irritated . It often occurs when the shoulder is pushed down and the neck is forced in the opposite direction . The combined stress puts the bundle on stretch , causing a sharp " stinging " sensation . The injury can result in diminished sensation and limited muscle strength for the affected individual . In some extreme cases , temporary paralysis can occur . Fortunately , Eifert has not reported any of these more serious symptoms , though the Bengals are clearly monitoring his healthy closely . Time remains one of the best treatment options and holding him out against the lowly Browns was a smart play to insure his long term health . Look for Eifert to up his workload at practice this week with the hope of playing Sunday against the Steelers .
