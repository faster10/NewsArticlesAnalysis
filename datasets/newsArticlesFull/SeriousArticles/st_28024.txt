Rand Paul continued to distinguish himself from his colleagues to the glee of some very vocal and enthusiastic supporters in the crowd . Despite the assertion that Ted Cruz has inherited Ron Paul ' s liberty vote , Paul is still the only one reaching out to libertarian voters . He is the least hawkish of the field and the one most consistently speaking out against government surveillance . As the only person asked about the situation in Ferguson ( an unfortunate choice by the moderators ) , he spoke against people being " fined to death " , the war on drugs , and the need for equal protection under the law . He waffled a little in his response to a question on abortion , stating he both supported to repeal of Roe v . Wade as a means of returning power back to the states on the question of legality , but then also supported a federal " life " bill . His other major departure from libertarianism is his harsh stance on immigration . A lapse in ideology reminiscent of his father ' s own nativist approach .
