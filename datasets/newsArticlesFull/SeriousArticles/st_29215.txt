C . J . Anderson : The Broncos continue to rely on a run heavy attack with Peyton Manning still recovering from a foot injury . Unfortunately , Anderson limped off the field in the first half of the team ' s win over San Diego . The team downplayed the severity of the injury following the game and called the decision to remove him from play purely precautionary . However , Anderson does have a lengthy history of ankle and foot problems and will be a question mark entering Week 14 ' s game against the Raiders . Ronnie Hillman will remain the starter and would see a bump in usage if Anderson were unable to play .
