Large though they are , it is worth putting into context the numbers of migrants coming to Europe . A million refugees and migrants arrived last year . That represents not much more than 0 . 1 per cent of the EU population . There are already 1 . 3 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon ? 20 per cent of the population . That is the equivalent of Europe playing host to 150 million refugees . Turkey , the country on to which the EU would like to offload its migrants and refugees , already hosts two million refugees .
