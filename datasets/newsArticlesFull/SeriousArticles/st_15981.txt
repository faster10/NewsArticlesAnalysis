On Sunday , January 30 , 1972 , a large crowd took part in a banned civil rights march in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry . ( Even the name of the city is disputed , with pro Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro British unionists calling it Londonderry . ) After a disturbance , British Army paratroopers fired shots into the crowd , killing a total of 14 people . " Bloody Sunday , " as it came to be known , was a major turning point in Northern Ireland ' s history and considered by many to be one of the greatest injustices of the Troubles .
