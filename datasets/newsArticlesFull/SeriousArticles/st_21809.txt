The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand offs . Not surprisingly , Robert Downey Jr . ' s flip , cynical Stark ( Iron Man ) gets a good measure of the movie ' s best lines , bouncing off Steve Rogers ' ( Captain America ) boy scout idealism and Thor ' s guileless sledgehammer style ( sometimes literally ) . Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johansson ' s Black Widow , a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in " Iron Man 2 . "
