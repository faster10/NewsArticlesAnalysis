In a debate in which we were to listen to candidates discuss the important issue of race , I had hoped to get a lengthy discussion on the Charleston massacre and the ensuing debate over the Confederate Flag . I hoped we would have a discussion on the racial divisions over our immigration policy . Remember that our immigration policy has always been an explicit consequence of this country ' s fascination with race . One can look at the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 Quotas Act , both of which imposed limits on immigrants explicitly because of their race , and we could trace those policies to our current immigration discussion over Central American refugees and Mexican labor .
