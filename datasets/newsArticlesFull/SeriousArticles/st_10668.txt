Finally , there s Brett Favre whose selection is a sure thing on the level of Secretariat at the 1973 Belmont . The only NFL player to win three straight MVP honors ( 1995 97 ) Favre lasted 20 seasons , most of them in Green Bay . But his final season , in 2010 with the Vikings , ended badly . Favre , the ironman of all quarterbacks who played every game in 17 straight seasons , missed three games with injuries . For the first time since 1993 he threw more interceptions than touchdowns . His final appearance was Dec . 20 in a 40 14 defeat to the Chicago Bears at the University of Minnesota s stadium on a 23 degree Monday night . Favre completed five of seven passes for 63 yards , one TD and one interception but left the game with a concussion after a sack by the Bears Corey Wootton . At 41 , the career of the most prolific passer in NFL history at that time was over .
