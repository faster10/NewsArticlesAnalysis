As long as the Crimson Tide continue to recruits as well as they do , it s impossible to not consider them top tier contenders for the national championship . Alabama s most recent recruiting classes have ranked second ( 2015 ) , first ( 14 ) , fourth ( 13 ) and second ( 12 ) , according to Scout . com . On offense , the Tide will once again have to find a new starter at quarterback , and Heisman winning running back Derrick Henry will surely leave early for the NFL . Center Ryan Kelly s graduation is also a significant loss . The defensive departures should be even more severe with A Shawn Robinson , Jarran Reed , Jonathan Allen , Reggie Ragland , Cyrus Jones and Eddie Jackson all possibly moving on to the NFL ? not to mention coordinator Kirby Smart s move to Georgia .
