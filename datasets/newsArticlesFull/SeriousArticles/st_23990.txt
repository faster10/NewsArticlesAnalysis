My first husband and I divorced 15 years ago , and I married Haskell in 1999 . To borrow from humorist Erma Bombeck when writing about her stepfather , if Haskell had been the relief pitcher brought in to bail out his team , the crowd would have cheered . Had he been the off duty cop who delivered the baby because the ambulance was stuck in traffic , he would have been called a hero . Or had he been the understudy who filled in when the beloved star got sick , he might have gotten rave reviews .
