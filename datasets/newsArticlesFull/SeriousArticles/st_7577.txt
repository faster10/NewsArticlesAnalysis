Ohio Governor John Kasich tried to distance himself from the Republican whining this weekend , insisting that he was not at all bothered by the CNBC debate or moderators . ? In the third debate , they asked me a lot of questions and I didn t feel anything was below the belt , he told CNN ? on Saturday . ? I don t want to spend my time talking about the process of the debate . However they set it , I ll show up and do the best I can to let people know who I am . So it s just not something I m focused on .
