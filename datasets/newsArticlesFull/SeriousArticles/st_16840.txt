As for the actual moves for the number , McConaughey had ideas for those , too . " He was so in it to be gross and raunchy , " choreographer Alison Faulk told EW . He came up with signature moves , like the " Lick It and Slick It " ( he licks his fingers and slides them down his pants ) . " He was the one who had the most names for things , because we would call them out , " Faulk said . " I ' ve never laughed as hard as I laughed watching him perform , only because it was so f ing amazing . The women did not know what to do with themselves . The last thing he does in his routine is lie on the ground , and the girls were insane trying to tip him , shoving money in his G string , and his G string ripped off . He held it on with his hand . Nothing will beat that to me . "
