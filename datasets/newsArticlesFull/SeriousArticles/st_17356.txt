This is a famously big hearted country , but after San Bernardino , it wants to be sure that generosity toward refugees won t put itself at risk . In a study for the Shorenstein Center at the Kennedy School , a faculty student research group under my guidance has developed a detailed proposal to vet refugees in the camps in Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan , airlift them to secure military installations in the United States , and complete their vetting before releasing them to the community groups who ve proved they can integrate refugees successfully . This is the model the United States adopted in 1999 , when it flew 4 , 000 refugees from Kosovo to Fort Dix , N . J . , and processed them there , before releasing them to their new homes across the United States . What a big country did then , it could still do now .
