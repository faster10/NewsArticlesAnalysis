I bring this up , because Wednesday afternoon , Sam Bradford again stood on a podium and subjected himself to a series of questions that would have set a less secure man squarely on the defensive . If you have any doubt about what I mean , a fun exercise would be to pose some of these questions to your spouse or significant other using the same general structure , but with different nouns . Instead of " Sam , " insert the name of your significant other ( lest things get awkward from the jump ) . And instead of the word " film " use the word , " mirror . "
