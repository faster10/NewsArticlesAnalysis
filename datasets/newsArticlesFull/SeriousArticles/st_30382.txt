The reduction in vaccination rates reveals one of the quirks of vaccines they only protect a population if nearly everyone is vaccinated . This is the concept of herd immunity . The magic number for measles is 95 , which means if at least 95 of people in a community are vaccinated , everyone is protected . This is because the chance of the virus finding the individuals in the group who have little or no protection is very low . If a vaccinated , and protected , person gets measles they may not even know it , but the virus will be stopped in its tracks by their immune response before they can make more people sick . However , the more poorly protected , or unprotected , people there are , the easier it is for the virus to find them , make them sick and spread .
