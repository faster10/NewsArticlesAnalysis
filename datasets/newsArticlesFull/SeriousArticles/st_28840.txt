The Wisconsin congressman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee was elected with 236 votes , a majority . The outcome effectively was predetermined after he locked down most Republican members ' support . Democrats put up their leader , Nancy Pelosi , who got 184 votes , to run on Thursday . But Ryan ' s chief GOP opponent Daniel Webster , R Fla . , took himself out of the running after Ryan easily beat him for the nomination though several Republicans voted for Webster on the floor anyway . ?
