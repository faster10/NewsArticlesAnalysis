McCreary : It ' s very hard to say . I thrive on diversity . Action scenes are fun until you do a million of them . Emotional scenes are great until you get too many in a row . My favorite type of scene is one that has layers to it , narratively . I like scenes that when I look at them , it ' s not obvious what the music should be doing . Should it be scary ? Should it be funny ? What is the character thinking ? If the slightest shift in the music will make you feel sympathy to one person over another , that ' s really fun and that puts the composer in a powerful position .
