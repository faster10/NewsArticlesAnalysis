The National Network to End Domestic Violence reports that financial abuse almost always accompanies physical abuse and can be the primary obstacle to women breaking free from bondage . It works like this : A man ( women are the victims in 85 of cases ) sets up a credit card in the woman ' s name and doesn ' t pay the bills , ruining the woman ' s credit . The man forces the woman to put her paycheck into a bank account and won ' t give her access . He hides all financial documents and won ' t share passwords for websites .
