An MSF hospital was bombed in an American air strike in Kunduz in northern Afghanistan on October 3 , killing 22 people including 12 MSF staff . US President Barack Obama apologised for that attack , but MSF continues to call for an independent humanitarian commission to investigate what it calls a war crime . " International humanitarian law is not about " mistakes " . It is about intention , facts and why . . . It is precisely because attacking hospitals in war zones is prohibited that we expected to be protected , " MSF director Joanne Liu said in October .
