Analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion . The footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber . This footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert , that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle , strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position . It is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage , could have survived the blast and escaped .
