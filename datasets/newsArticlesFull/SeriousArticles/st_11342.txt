Astronomers have captured a black hole eating a star and then sicking a bit of it back up for the first time ever . The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up . They then saw a high speed flare get thrust out , escaping from the rim of the black hole . Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars . And the jets have been seen before . But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards . And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before
