Pretty much the same way . Laughs After we shoot certain scenes , I feel like I need to take a shower . A long , hot one . I ' ve got about a thirty minute ride home from the studio to where I live in Albuquerque , so that ride is important . Music is selected carefully to help me shed it . Sometimes in watching the episode , I will start to feel , in my body , the way I felt when I was filming the scene . Like at the end of Episode 2 , where Walt climbs in the bed next to Skyler I felt this feeling of makes gagging sound in my body , the same feeling that was going on during the filming it . I can ' t watch it too close to bedtime .
