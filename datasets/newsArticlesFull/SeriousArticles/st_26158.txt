Thousands , from school children to the elderly , are engaging in peaceful protests . They have been shot at some killed , many more wounded by Chinese security forces . Over five days in January , in three separate incidents , Free Tibet received reports that five Tibetans were shot dead , many more wounded , when security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters .
