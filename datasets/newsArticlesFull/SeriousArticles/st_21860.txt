He also stated : " As a result of the consult delay issue VA discovered at two of our medical centers , the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) conducted a national review of consults across the system . We have redesigned the consult process to better monitor consult timeliness . We continue to take action to strengthen oversight mechanisms and prevent a similar delay at another VA medical center . We take any issue of this nature extremely seriously and offer our sincerest condolences to families and individuals who have been affected and lost a loved one . "
