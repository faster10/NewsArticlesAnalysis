This is why at Just Vision , our mission is to create and distribute media , including documentary films , that tell the stories of Israelis and Palestinians working nonviolently to resolve the conflict and end the occupation . We also provide in depth introductions to these visionaries by publishing new interviews with them on our website every few days . By providing these resources to millions worldwide , we ensure that those who promote nonviolence have an effective platform through which they can share their accomplishments and ideas with their own societies and others around the globe .
