Fortunately for the Seahawks , they are one of the hottest teams in the National Football League down the stretch . That s why the Steelers go into this game as slight favorites , and I ll go with that as well , even though Pittsburgh s lucky to be here at all . I mentioned before , we had a lot of young guys that were playing , we had some guys that were injured that were coming back , and I kind of feel like if everybody kind of hung together , that we would be OK , and that s the way it turned out . But in order I like Brown , Green , Hopkins , Maclin , Baldwin for the big dogs at wide out . They have gone 4 4 in their last eight games . Seattle QB Russell Wilson is 50 22 as a starter , including 6 2 in the playoffs . In the beginning of the season people were talking about Aaron Rodgers being one the best quarterbacks ever , and now , crickets .
