" Two candidates each received 246 votes for the 1st District commissioner in Cook County , Minnesota , " Stephen Pettigrew , of FiveThirtyEight , explained in 2014 . " It was originally suggested that the candidates draw from a bag with two Scrabble tiles , and the person who picked the ' Z ' would become commissioner . Ultimately , the race was instead decided by drawing wooden blocks from a cloth bag . Frank Moe drew the red block Kristin DeArruda Wharton drew the blue one . Moe won the seat . "
