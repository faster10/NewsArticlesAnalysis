The low polling candidates were actually the winners of the evening . Perhaps without Trump sucking up all of the air in the room , they were able to relax and present themselves in an authentic , positive light . Jeb Bush was a stronger , more confident presence , calling out Rubio for bailing on the " Gang of Eight " bill and defending his own support for legal status for the undocumented . Rand Paul showed strength too , needling Rubio and Cruz , and scoring points on abortion and racial profiling . John Kasich ' s closing statement hit exactly the right inclusive , aspirational notes .
