Clinton s California cash : Hillary Clinton is raising more money from California than New York , the Hill writes , a reversal from the last time she ran for president . California has always been a magnet for Democrat money . But in 2008 , Clinton relied more on her Manhattan connections , taking 29 . 3 million from New York and 26 . 4 million from California over the course of her primary campaign . This far into the 2016 cycle , she has flipped that ratio , the Hill writes , with her super PAC and campaign raising 32 . 7 million from California donors and 14 . 1 million from New York .
