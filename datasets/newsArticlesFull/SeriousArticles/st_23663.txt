I m sure we ll be challenged by that again , Belichick said . They always challenge you in the running game . They do a great job of setting up formations and trying to put your defense in a run pass conflict , or some kind of a compromising spot with their formations , or their ability to change plays based on what the better look is . If we re not sound , if we don t play with good technique , if we don t tackle well , it will be a problem . If we do those things then we should be competitive , but it won t be easy .
