Just as James Callaghan described the 1975 referendum , five years before it was held , as a rubber life raft into which the whole party may one day have to climb , Mr Cameron hoped to avoid this referendum . Just like Harold Wilson and Callaghan , he ended up putting party before country . Even he must have hoped for a grander and more definitive European settlement . Instead , he has merely put off the difficult questions for his successors to solve , and he has provided an inglorious sideshow to the continuing crises in Syria and Libya that are leading to the drowning of refugees in the Mediterranean . ?
