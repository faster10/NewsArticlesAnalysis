Paterson was right . The Adventurecorps Badwater Ultramarathon is infamous in endurance sports circles . It is the running equivalent of summiting Everest , the ultimate test of mental fortitude , a hippy communion with the desert of epic highs and lows ( literally the race starts at 280 feet below sea level , the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere , covers three mountain ranges for descents and ascents totaling 9 , 000 feet and ends halfway up Mount Whitney , the highest point in the contiguous United States ) .
