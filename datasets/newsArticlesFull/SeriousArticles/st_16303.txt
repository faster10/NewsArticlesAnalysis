American generosity is not dependent on the government or public policy . It should be pointed out that conservatives , criticized by liberals as health care and welfare slashers and greedy capitalists , give far more to charity than liberals . Arthur Brooks wrote in his now famous book , " Who Really Cares , " that households headed by conservatives give 30 more to charity than households headed by liberals . Conservatives also give more blood and donate more of their time to volunteer work , according to Brooks .
