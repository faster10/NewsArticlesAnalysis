And it s another positive that the Vikings can find a way to win even when Bridgewater isn t his sharpest , or when running back Adrian Peterson doesn t have to do it all . The Vikings got the big play out of Diggs , as part of his six catch , 95 yard showing , as well as 65 yard punt return touchdown by Marcus Sherels . Sherels s touchdown might have been the easiest punt return score I ve seen in quite some time , as he was never even close to being touched as he burst down the right sideline with a convoy to the end zone . The Bears played coverage on that return like Sherels was contagious .
