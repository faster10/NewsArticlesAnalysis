Stone : . . . I can ' t control that . We made the movie to make people think , to make themselves feel , to walk in the shoes of George Bush and to understand him . This is not a job done with malice . This is a fair portrait of the man . I think it ' s empathetic . You care for him and your feelings for him . An activist said , " I never thought I could feel something for George Bush . I came out of this movie feeling compassionate for him , and even more important , feeling compassion for our country and where we are now . "
