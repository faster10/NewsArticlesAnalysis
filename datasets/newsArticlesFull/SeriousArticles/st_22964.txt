Finally , a female assistant : It s only in the low level role of quality control special teams ( for the record , I ve never heard of such a thing as a quality control coach for special teams the coaches usually handle the prep work themselves because there are so few plays ) , but it s something , so kudos to the Bills and coach Rex Ryan for hiring Kathryn Smith as the league s first full time assistant coach . Just about every head coach has gotten his start as a quality control coach somewhere , and it s a great way to master the little things needed to advance a career .
