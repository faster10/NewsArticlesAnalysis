In this system we have built , we must be honest and ask ourselves , " Is vengeance justice ? " If we want truly to codify revenge , let ' s not pretend . Let ' s admit that we are willing to live with the byproducts of our retribution . Let ' s admit that we are willing to kill a number of innocent people . Let ' s admit that it is fine to execute a disproportionate number of minorities . And let ' s admit that we want condemned murderers to suffer like they made their victims suffer . Let ' s not dress the execution up as a medical procedure .
