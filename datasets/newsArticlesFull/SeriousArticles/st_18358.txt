I recall being an undergraduate in Russian Studies at Amherst College when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 . I was flabbergasted when then President Carter initially expressed surprise that Leonid Brezhnev and his cronies decided to undertake that ill fated adventure . Just the little I knew of Soviet history at that time led me to conclude that one should never be na ve about Russia . Wisely , the Carter administration soon implemented a wide ranging and powerful set of sanctions against the USSR .
