For the past several years , I have privately advised and counseled several professional and amateur athletes , and entertainers , all men , all grappling with very warped definitions of manhood . The recurring theme over and over is fear of expressing themselves fully , fear of letting others down , fear of not being the tough and rugged men they were told they had to be . And on the inside so many of them are damaged as a result . The very definition of manhood they ' ve embraced is more an emotional prison than anything else .
