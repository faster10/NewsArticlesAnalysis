3 . The surf : Before I left for Hawaii , a state representative , Angus McKelvey , gave one very Hawaii specific reason for the state ' s low turnout : surf . When the surf ' s up , he said , people won ' t go to the polls . The theory is a little wacky , of course , but even if it ' s true , there will be better surf in Hawaii on Monday than Tuesday , Election Day , said Gary Kewley , " chief surfing officer " of the Surf News Network . " Most people only surf on average for an hour and a half to 2 1 2 hours , " he told me by phone . " That leaves plenty of time to go to the voting booth . " Waves on Monday are expected to crest at 15 feet . Tuesday , they ' ll still be big , but more in the 8 foot range . By the way , Kewley votes .
