And finally , Rubio should consider standing out from the rest of the crowded non Trump , non Cruz field , not just with his resume and with the same platitudes about God and country every other Republican candidate has , but also with the specific policy proposals he has ? especially since they ' re tailor made for the New Hampshire audience . He should talk about his child tax credit , which would make life easier for families , even those that work but don ' t pay the income tax . He should talk about his wage subsidy plan , which will bring jobs back from China without starting a trade war that would make the shopping bill 40 percent higher . He should talk about ending the higher education accreditation cartel , and expanding competency based learning , which will enable working Americans to earn a degree to climb the ladder of opportunity , without spending a lot and without straining their families . These are all good ideas that are specific , workable solutions to the real problems that Trumpmania has highlighted . It would also address the problem that too many voters see Rubio as a lightweight .
