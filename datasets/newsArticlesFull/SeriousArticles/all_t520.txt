The family continues to ask for your prayers and requests privacy out of respect for Congressman Nunnelee.” Nunnelee was diagnosed in May with cancers after doctors discovered a tumor in his brain. His condition worsened after he had a stroke during an operation to remove the first tumor. He briefly returned to Capitol Hill in a wheelchair following the November elections but has been receiving treatment for most of the past month that kept him from Congress. Nunnelee was elected in 2010 after defeating Rep. Travis Childers, a Democrat.
