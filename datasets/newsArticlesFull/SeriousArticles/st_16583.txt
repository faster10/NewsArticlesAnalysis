No one has to ask why there must be Secret Service war wagons standing sentry on otherwise cleared of traffic streets adjacent to where a president sleeps , or why guests checking into a hotel where a president stays have their baggage taken from them and carted to an outdoor location behind steel and cement barriers , where sophisticated screening devices give them the once or twice over . And no one has to inquire about the reason for the searches every hotel employee and every hotel guest must submit to each time he or she wants to enter the building anew .
