That , essentially , is the state of Republican policy discourse these days ? a debate that s mostly about signaling conservative bona fides rather than detailing a realistic way one might actually run a country . Ben Carson says he s in favor of a tithing inspired flat tax of about 15 percent , which he will somehow balance out by cutting fat from the government . Ted Cruz is promising a flat tax of 10 percent . Both would likely cost trillions . But compared with Bush s or Rubio s plans , they only look like a slight ratcheting up of the crazy .
