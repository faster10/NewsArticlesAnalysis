You are not necessarily playing through an injury , Romo said . It ' s not something I need to feel . When I first started with the back you had to figure out how to play through that or with that . But this you are really coming back healthy . It s just the fact that a hit could reinjure it faster than others . It is not as if I feel that on each play . That is a different perspective . To be honest with you , I don ' t know that you really change anything as far as your thought process and how to play the game . You go out . My job is to get us in good plays . Throw the ball accurately and get it the guys and let them go make plays . I got to do that this weekend .
