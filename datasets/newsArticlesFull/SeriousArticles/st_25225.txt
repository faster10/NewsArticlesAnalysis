I ' ve spent the bulk of my career climbing the so called corporate ladder . As chairman and CEO of Ogilvy and Mather , chairman of J . Walter Thompson , and later as Undersecretary of State to Colin Powell , I ' ve been witness to how power is exercised and how people are chosen for leadership roles in the halls of both corporations and governments . There are now many more talented women to choose from , and yet we women still hold relatively few positions of influence . Even though I was a pioneering woman among a world of men , I think it ' s harder for women today than it was for me to enter these circles of authority and influence .
