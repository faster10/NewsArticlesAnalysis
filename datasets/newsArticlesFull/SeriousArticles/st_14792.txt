It seems that the warning was not quiet heeded today half the political discourse is focused on fear mongering and many on the Republican side advocate bombing cities and putting " boots on the ground " as if they were talking about a sport . Perhaps war is indeed a sport to them . Thing is , this long awaited grassroots movement has arrived in the form of Bernie Sanders ' presidential campaign . Here is a chance to put in the Office of President an individual who is willing to fight for the subaltern and who has proven over and over in his political career his will and determination to do so . Many are yet to realize the significance of what this campaign constitutes . Here is a self made politician who has built his career from scratch and who is not subservient either to lobbyists or to purblind party loyalties . Here is a candidate who has throughout his career as a congressman and Senator voted according to his conscience . Far more often than not , his vote has landed on the right side of history and the aspirations of the American people .
