Scott s not the kind of player you normally see at the league s annual skills competition . He s what known in the hockey world as a goon . In nine NHL seasons , he had just five goals and six assists ? not exactly an all star record . But fans love players like Scott for the grit he brings to the game . And the other all stars love players like Scott because he s the guy on the ice who keeps them safe when other teams cross the line trying to stop them from scoring . Mess with Blackhawks superstar Patrick Kane , and you get to meet John Scott ? up close and personal .
