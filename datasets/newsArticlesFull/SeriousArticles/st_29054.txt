Lewis : I ' ve been doing theater for the past six months in the U . K . Alan Rickman told me to do theater , he recommended theater , and so I did . And it was really a learning experience for me . I wanted to expand my ability , and I want to try and learn as much as possible and really add another string to my bow , if you like . I feel like I ' ve grown in confidence as a person and an actor in theater . It really is a foundation for all acting , whether in television or film . It really is where it all started .
