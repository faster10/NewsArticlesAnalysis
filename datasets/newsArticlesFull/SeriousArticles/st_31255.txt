If North Carolina thumps Clemson a la Ohio State over Wisconsin in 2014 , it would be tough to leave out the Tar Heels regardless of their schedule . That being said , I think Stanford would deserve the spot . Yes , the Cardinal have two losses . But the defeat to Northwestern happened early in the year , and teams are allowed one " what the hell just happened ? " game . As for the Oregon loss , the Ducks are undoubtedly the best three loss team in the country , and everyone knows Oregon ' s season would have been different if quarterback Vernon Adams Jr . had been healthy all fall ( like he was against Stanford ) . The Cardinal also have a terrific non conference schedule . So I ' d take Christian McCaffrey Co .
