The Denver Broncos are in no rush to get Peyton Manning back on the field and expect youngster Brock Osweiler to get at least two starts while the future Hall of Famer continues to rest and rehab his injuries , according to team sources . It ' s very unlikely that the coaching staff goes back to Manning in any circumstance until he is able to practice regularly in preparation for a game , sources said , and should Osweiler operate the offense in a manageable manner , he very well could keep the job for the foreseeable future .
