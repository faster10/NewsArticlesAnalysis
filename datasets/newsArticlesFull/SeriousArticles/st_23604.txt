The study didn ' t track the reasons the women quit nursing , but experts including Los Angeles , California , lactation consultant Corky Harvey said many women have a hard time nursing and don ' t know where to turn for help . She says one common reason for quitting is that women mistakenly think they don ' t have enough milk and decide to give the baby formula . Other women quit nursing when they go back to work , and others stop because family members encourage them to give bottles instead of breast milk .
