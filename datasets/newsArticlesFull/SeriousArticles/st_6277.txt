Trump will be unmerciful in identifying any organization , for political reasons , that does not accept these donated dollars . Furthermore the organizations are about helping veterans and their families . Posturing their own moral aversion to take money from an individual , representing tens of thousands of donors , whom they disagree with would be absurd and counterproductive . It is not blood money being offered . One can argue the merits of the reasons why the money was raised but a significant amount of those funds were donated by average Americans , yes , exercising their right to a political statement , but also responding to a worthy cause .
