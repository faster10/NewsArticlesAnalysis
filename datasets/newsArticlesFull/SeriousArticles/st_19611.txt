That sense of cheerless duty ? while appropriate for a spy who has devoted his life to Queen and Country ? has somehow infected Spectre itself . Daniel Craig , who was so convincing in his grief and rage over Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace , doesn ' t seem capable of playing anything but cool efficiency . Mr Hinx ( Dave Bautista ) , a new henchman that ' s clearly aiming for a slot in the Jaws Oddjob pantheon , falls totally flat . Monica Bellucci , the much vaunted " Bond girl " that ' s actually in Bond ' s age range , gets little more than a cameo . And one " surprise " villain is so transparent that Spectre practically sneers at itself during the reveal .
