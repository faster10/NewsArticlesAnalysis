The story , meanwhile , is run of the mill muscular pulp . While all evidence points to a former military sniper in the apparently random shooting of five victims , JR follows his own instincts calmly , opaquely , except when he ' s a coldly violent fighting machine and draws his own conclusions . Along the way , he crosses paths with a Russian mobster sinister enough to sound exactly like Werner Herzog , maybe because Herzog plays said mobster with lip smacking gusto and a display of tiny teeth . And Reacher works side by side with a Blond Lady DA probably as good a name for her as any , since British beauty Rosamund Pike ( " An Education " ) is given a Jane Doe of a role to work with . " Jack Reacher " doesn ' t play well with others Jack Reacher is an argument to leave the guy alone . Grade : C
