Sutter : I ' ll go ahead and disagree with you on that . Asking whether same sex marriage is fully blessed by social science is like asking , in 1967 , whether data support interracial couples getting married , or being parents . I get why it ' s coming up , but it ' s offensive on some level . Ask kids who were raised by same sex parents . Many will say , as this kid did during a hearing in the Iowa House , that they ' re doing just fine . Plus there are lots of same sex couples who would want to get married and don ' t want to have children . The more fundamental question is whether LGBT people are equally human . And if so , why our laws don ' t reflect that .
