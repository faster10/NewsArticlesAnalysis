1 , QB Russell Wilson : The play of Wilson may have gotten as much scrutiny this week as at any time in his four year Seattle career . While Wilson has a QB rating for the season of 91 . 7 he has been below that the last three weeks at 84 . 5 , 81 . 3 and 67 . 2 , throwing just three touchdowns and four interceptions in that time ? that s the most interceptions for Wilson in a three game span since the first half of his rookie season . And he s coming off what was statistically one of the worst games of his career last week against Arizona when he was 14 32 for 240 yards with a touchdown and an interception . The Seahawks are 13 point favorites against the 49ers and may not need a lot of points to win this one . So what is important for Wilson is to be efficient and make the plays that are needed to be made more consistently than has been the case the last few weeks .
