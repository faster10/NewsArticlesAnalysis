That ' s why I continue to call on the governor daily to go further in his actions of addressing this crisis . While water bottles and filters are a Band Aid fix , that will do nothing if people lose their homes . Not only would they lose access to any water at all , but they would be forced to survive a harsh winter simply looking for shelter . Gov . Snyder must use his executive powers to forgive the debt owed by those in danger of losing their homes . It is criminal to expect the people of Flint to pay for poisoned water , or face homelessness if they don ' t comply .
