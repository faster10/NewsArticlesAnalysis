Manning is a mess and sadly for Broncos fans , there ' s just not much of a reason to think things will get better . The arguments earlier in the season were that the Broncos needed to return to a more Manning friendly scheme and get their offensive line right , and neither solution appears to be in the cards . Each of Manning ' s 20 pass attempts Sunday came in the shotgun or pistol , and he posted a 0 . 1 QBR on those throws . Further injuries to the offensive line have prevented the unit from jelling , and the running game that carried Denver over the regular season finish line last year hasn ' t shown up since the Nov . 1 win over Green Bay . Denver still has a great defense , but when the opposition ' s average starting field position is 52 yards away from the end zone , as it was for the Chiefs on Sunday , even a dominant defense can do only so much . The Broncos may have already banked enough victories to claim the West , but with Manning this altered , it ' s hard to see them doing much in January .
