" The excellent verification of the seasonal forecast points out , once again , why one cannot use this forecast as an indicator of personal risk . The good fortune of relatively minimal impact on the United States in spite of 19 storms , 12 of which were hurricane and 5 of which were category 3 or 4 , will serve as yet another reminder that from a hurricane readiness viewpoint , one must prepare every season as if a major hurricane will impact them , " said Bill Read , director of the National Hurricane Center .
