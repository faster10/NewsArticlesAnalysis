Navarrette asked : " Where were the Italian American athletes waving the Italian flag , or the Irish Americans waving the Irish flag ? " Maybe we don ' t have that because Italian and Irish families emigrated to the United States much earlier and their ties may not be as strong to their motherland . Also , they are too far away from Europe . However , Mexico is so close to the United States that Manzano , or any other Mexican or Mexican American , can just drive their car across the border . Those people with Italian or Irish lineage can ' t just drive home : There ' s too much water along the way , much more water than the Rio Grande .
