Ibragim Todashev : Ibragrim Todashev was Tamerlan ' s sparring partner at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts gym near Cambridge . The two bonded over Chechnya and religion , sometimes laying out rugs to pray to Mecca inside the small gym . Todashev moved to Florida in fall 2011 , not long after a brutal triple slaying in Waltham , Massachusetts . One of the victims was fellow sparring partner Brendan Mess who , along with two friends , were nearly decapitated , with marijuana strewn over their bodies . Authorities began taking a closer look at possible involvement by both Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Todashev , who was allegedly writing out a " confession " when , authorities say , he tried to attack an FBI agent . The agent fatally shot Todashev , whose family maintains he is innocent .
