I ' m counting on Raines not making it this time . His percentage is one of the most intriguing on the ballot , however , because next year would be his last chance at induction . Generally , once players get into the 70 percent range if they have another chance they make it . Tim Raines got only 55 percent of the vote last time around , though . Did clearing four names off the ballot and only adding one definite to it help to push Raines to a huge 15 percent increase ? If not and he only has a 10 percent increase , he might face an uphill battle in his final year .
