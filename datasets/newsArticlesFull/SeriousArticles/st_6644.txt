You can see the same tensions at work in the other major categories , such as record of the year , where Swift ' s Blank Space and the Weeknd ' s Can ' t Feel My Face ? both state of the art pop productions ? are nominated alongside Ed Sheeran ' s plaintive Thinking Out Loud , which would have fit in on an early ' 70s James Taylor album . ( Speaking of Taylor , he ' s probably as surprised as anyone to find his Before This World up against 1989 and Kelly Clarkson ' s Piece by Piece for the pop vocal album prize ? just one of the wonders of taxonomy that the Grammys offer every year . )
