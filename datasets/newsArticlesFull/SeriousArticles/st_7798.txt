Dr Hunt Batjer , chairman of neurological surgery at UT Southwestern and president elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons , says White ' s research is not validation for a human head transplant . " It ' s a 45 year old reference in a primate and there is no evidence that the spinal cord was anastomosed functionally , " he says . Batjer further explains that it ' s a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function , which White did not look at .
