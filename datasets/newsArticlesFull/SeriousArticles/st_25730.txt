Rushdie : I ' m actually delighted , but on the other hand , I ' m scarcely objective , you know , because I wrote the film and I narrate the film , and I was very , very involved at every stage of it . I was involved in the casting . I was even involved in talking to the production designer , showing him photographs of ( my ) childhood and trying to get him to make the film look right . I was involved in the cutting room . So if the film is no good , it ' s my fault too , but if it is any good , I can take a bit of the credit .
