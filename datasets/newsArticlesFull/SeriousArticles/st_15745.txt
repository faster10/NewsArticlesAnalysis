New Orleans at Washington : I circled this one back in August as the much anticipated Junior Gallette Bowl ! Unfortunately , the troubled former Saint current Redskin whose " girlfriend ' s account " blasted all of the Saints on Twitter after he was cut ( the tweets were deleted ! ) , is out for this one . I ' ve got the Redskins winning anyway , finding holes in a Rob Ryan defense that is amazingly on pace to not only be worse than last year ' s unit , but the worst passing defense in NFL history . The Sean Payton to Miami to Indianapolis to USC to . . . wherever rumors will continue to ramp up with every Saints loss .
