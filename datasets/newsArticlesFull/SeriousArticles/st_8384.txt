" So by 1976 , 37 states had passed new death penalty laws and they tried to remove arbitrariness in its application based on what the court has mandated or at least made a good faith effort to attempt to do this . One of the great stories in my book is that Powell , Stewart , and ( Justice John Paul ) Stevens met at a local restaurant called the Monocle , and there agreed that the mandatory death penalty for murder was reprehensible , but that they would also uphold the ' guided discretions ' statutes ( through the use of what are called ' aggravating ' or ' mitigating ' factors either favoring or blocking its use ) . That was their Solomonic compromise . The 1976 compromise was that similar capital cases should be treated alike . But also that no mandatory death penalty for certain crimes means individual cases must be treated individually . It ' s a fundamental contradiction that has made death penalty law in the U . S . for the past 40 years at a minimum confusing and problematic , at a maximum completely inconsistent and incomprehensible . "
