Note that the President did not say that airstrikes would be used to eject ISIS forces from Mosul or Kirkuk or Fallujah . For in densely populated cities like these , airpower has real limitations . An enemy in defensive positions , particularly in urban terrain , is very difficult to engage with airpower . Even if the target can be hit , the possibility for collateral damage that causes civilian casualties is very real . And if the target is missed , the collateral damage can be exponentially higher , even catastrophic .
