Robertson ' s arguments are wrong on each and every fact . First , regulating marijuana like the way we regulate alcohol ( or cigarettes ) will only result in the increased use and abuse of marijuana , particularly among youths . As the late , great political scientist , James Q . Wilson , put it , " The central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption . " Arguing that adding a dangerous substance to the legal marketplace will reduce its usage is to renounce all common sense . Does Robertson truly believe that addicts and first time users will be curtailed once the substance they seek becomes easier to obtain ?
