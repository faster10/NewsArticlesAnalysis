John O Shea , who left the pitch with a tight calf , is the only new injury concern . Allardyce also confirmed that somebody would be signing for the club this week ? possibly the former Hull City striker Dame N Doye ? but it was glimpses of craft from the ? 8m summer signing Jeremain Lens , who scored the opening goal at the Emirates , that will give Sunderland heart . I was very impressed . Hopefully he s got to grips with this level of football , which is hugely difficult in your first season in the Premier League , Allardyce said .
