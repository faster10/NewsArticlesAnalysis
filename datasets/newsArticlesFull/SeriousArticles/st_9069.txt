No team in college football has been more impressive than Oklahoma since Oct . 11 , when the Sooners inexplicably fell to Texas . They lead all Power 5 offenses in rushing since then . They have a Heisman caliber quarterback in Baker Mayfield . And they have an average margin of victory during that span of 33 points per game . The committee recognized that last week by bumping the Sooners up to No . 3 . And since then , all Oklahoma has done is beat the No . 11 team on the road by five touchdowns .
