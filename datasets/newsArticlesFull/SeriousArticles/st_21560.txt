I could speculate for hours about which solution will be found , what formula they will adopt to keep the whole thing moving and frankly , it would be useless . This crisis is now moving too fast and has taken on a life of its own . The firewall is starting to smolder . The austerity plans are starting to fray . The European Central Bank is cutting loose several Greek banks it does not consider solvent . The eurozone is all but back in recession . There are some uncontrollable aspects ( the Greek voters for instance ) which make forecasting the future direction just about impossible .
