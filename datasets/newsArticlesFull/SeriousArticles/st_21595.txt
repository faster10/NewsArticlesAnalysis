You don t often hear the words Hollywood , diversity , and good job in the same sentence ( or even adjacent ones ) , but this morning s lineup was a definite step forward for an awards race tarnished by last year s OscarsSoWhite conversation . It s beyond great to see Elba and Smith s names on the list , giving them much needed boosts in the Oscar race , but the more surprising thing about this year s pool that it includes a group too often snubbed at awards ceremonies : veteran actresses . Jennifer Jason Leigh ( The Hateful Eight ) , Helen Mirren ( Trumbo ) , Jane Fonda ( Youth ) , and Kate Winslet ( Steve Jobs ) are all at least 40 years old , and the only upstart in the category is Alicia Vikander ? the Danish actress who earned two nods for her astonishing work in The Danish Girl and Ex Machina .
