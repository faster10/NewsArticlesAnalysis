Outbreak investigations involve a complex choreography among many state , local and federal agencies . They begin with state and local agencies receiving reports of illnesses , investigating them , and forwarding their findings to CDC . CDC aggregates these state reports with data collected from monitoring programs . Next , it sifts through huge volumes of information to link up illnesses occurring in different states , identifying common pathogens and common food sources . That information is forwarded to USDA and FDA , which try to track outbreaks to their sources .
