? ? Even after this week s drubbing at the hands of the Warriors , this loss was less an indictment of the Spurs than it was a highly decisive outing from their opponents . ? San Antonio allowed its second most points all season after Golden State beat it down for 120 earlier this week . But Cleveland shot nearly 55 , and the consistency of its makes spoke louder than any defensive scrambling from its opponents . It s worth noting that LaMarcus Aldridge , who , sans Tim Duncan , is the Spurs tallest rim defender not named Boban , sat the entire second quarter due to foul trouble . If you watch closely , he s been a little better on defense than his reputation suggested when he arrived in San Antonio .
