Amedy Coulibaly , the gunman who killed a female police officer then killed four in the kosher grocery siege in the same wave as the Charlie Hebdo attacks , came from the tough Grande Borne estate in Grigny only four miles away from where Mostefai grew up . Coulibaly was a convicted armed robber who had done time in France s notorious Fleury M rogis prison , where he was radicalised . Mostefai had never been in prison but was convicted eight times for petty crime between the ages of 19 and 25 . These included driving without a licence . It was not clear if he had had any involvement in small scale drug dealing .
