Taken as a whole , there are two things that play into the Panthers ' favor right now : Stationary quarterbacks , and teams with overly aggressive pressures . At times , the Broncos fall into both of those holes . Granted , Peyton Manning moved better against the New England Patriots than in maybe any other game this season . And Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has proven to be a master at tweaking game plans to confuse quarterbacks . He might be one of the best in the NFL at the kind of pre snap looks that leave quarterbacks completely misjudging what is coming .
