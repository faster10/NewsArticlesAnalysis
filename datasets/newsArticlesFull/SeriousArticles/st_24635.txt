So , what now for Fury ? He is 27 , unbeaten and a hero in his community , the first Traveller to win the world heavyweight title . That is quite something . It is up to his manager , Mick Hennessy , to negotiate the best deal for his first defence ? and talk of an immediate rematch with Klitschko is worrying if there was not a get out clause in his contract and the beaten Ukrainian is handed a chance to reclaim his titles , then the pre fight negotiations must have been very one sided indeed .
