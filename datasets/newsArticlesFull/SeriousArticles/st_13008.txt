At the time , it seemed to us that we got no practical benefit from a state marriage given all the paperwork we had completed . We ' d already made our commitment and had the acceptance and love of our friends and families . Our employers recognized our relationships and our child was safe .

The only struggle we had was how to explain this debate to Luna , who believed her parents were already married . Did she need us to get " married " yet again ?
