Oppression is an accusation critics have aimed at the Taliban for decades . They rule their lives by an extremely strict interpretation of Islam . In places under their control , women shroud their faces and bodies in burqas and girls are forbidden to attend school . " There is nothing that Islam does not have the solution for , " Abdul Rahman , a local Taliban judge , explains to Refsdal . " If a person cuts off another person ' s hand , then according to Islamic law , you have the right to retaliate and cut his hand off . It ' s the same with the ears , the teeth the eyes and the nose . "
