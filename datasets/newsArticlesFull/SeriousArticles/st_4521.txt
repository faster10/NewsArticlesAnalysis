When my uncle shares that story , people aren ' t necessarily as shocked as you might expect . The first thing people ask him is not , " Oh my goodness , you were kidnapped ? " but rather " Who did you tell you were coming back to Nigeria ? " This is a country where no one is immune from the rife practice of hostage taking and if you travel to Nigeria , the onus is on you to stay safe . If the Nigerian President ' s cousin can be kidnapped and the finance minister ' s mother can be held hostage , then anyone else can be , too .
