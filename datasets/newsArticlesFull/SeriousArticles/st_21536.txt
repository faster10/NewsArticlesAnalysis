Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrested hundreds of civilians nationwide , specifically Kurdish activists and politicians connected to the pro Kurdish People s Democratic Party ( HDP ) after the HDP gained more than 10 percent of the threshold vote needed to enter Parliament as a party for the first time .

Mr Erdogan skillfully ended the peace process with the PKK to evoke Turkish nationalism with the hopes of winning the ultra nationalist vote , another tactic used to quell the Kurdish voice .
