In the first debate , Hillary Clinton was much stronger against Sanders than many had expected . She directly challenged him on a number of issues , instead of just playing it safe . Hillary was also forced just before the first Democratic debate into taking some concrete positions on several issues that Bernie had been using against her to good effect on the campaign trail ( the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Keystone XL pipeline , to name just two ) . Since then , Hillary has moved to the left on marijuana legal reform as well ( although not as far as Sanders ) .
