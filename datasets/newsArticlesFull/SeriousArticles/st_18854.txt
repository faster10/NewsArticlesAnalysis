Of course , even if Charles is guilty of crimes against Teresa Halbach , there is the question of how so much evidence was accumulated against Steven . " There is clear evidence that the Manitowoc County sheriff ' s department used improper methods to convict both Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey " . Chuck spoke with TMZ and said that he was angry when the documents were filed listing him as a potential alternate suspect and denies that he had anything to do with Halbach ' s death . Very soon after Halbach ' s body was found , however , one investigator called another and asked : " Is Avery in custody , though ? " David entered a no contest plea to reckless homicide and child abuse and was sentenced to 14 years in prison . Dassey , who is now 26 , will not become eligible for parole consideration until October 31 , 2048 .
