The Texans are committed to running the football , as they ve rushed for 125 yards or more in six of their last seven games . Against the Jaguars on Sunday , they rushed for 160 yards in 31 carries ? a solid average of 5 yards per carry . Star running back Arian Foster was lost for the season because of an Achilles tear in October . While second year pro Alfred Blue ( 6 2 , 222 ) is a one speed power back who has generally been inconsistent as the lead ballcarrier , he has good vision , size and feel for the position and is coming off a respectable 21 carry , 102 yard effort against the Jaguars . Backups Akeem Hunt ( 5 10 , 190 ) , Jonathan Grimes ( 5 10 , 209 ) and Chris Polk ( 5 11 , 222 ) all mix in to give the Texans a little more wiggle and or receiving ability , depending on the situation , while muscle bound second year fullback Jay Prosch ( 6 1 , 256 ) will also make the occasional cameo as a lead blocker . The Texans will also mix in a little wildcat here and there with quarterback turned receiver B . J . Daniels or Jonathan Grimes .
