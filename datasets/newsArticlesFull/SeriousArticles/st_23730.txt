So what explains the Paris attacks , which represent a departure from ISIS s tactics and perhaps even strategy ? In a word , defeat . ISIS has been dealt a string of recent defeats with the loss of territory , the death of many of its top commanders and numerous fighters as well as the drying up of its recruitment networks . ISIS has lost territory in both Syria and Iraq , most recently the towns of Sinjar to the Kurds and Baiji in October to the Iraqi government and irregular forces . The road connecting ISIS s two most important urban centres , Mosul and Raqqa , is no longer under ISIS control . In Syria , ISIS not only lost Kobani , but also Tal Abyad and looks about to lose all its territory along the Turkish Syrian border . After ISIS s suicide attack in Ankara in October , Turkey effectively stopped the pipeline that was feeding the movement with recruits through its territory . At the same time , the Russian air force became involved in the Syrian war on the side of the Bashar al Assad regime and ISIS has been targeted .
