Target made news last year when it was revealed that its mailer system tracks purchase history and mails coupons based on those purchases . The system got a little too accurate for comfort when a Target in Minneapolis determined that a teenager was pregnant before she did . The mailer system analyzed her previous purchases and noticed that what she was buying in terms of groceries and toiletries fit a trend that usually meant a customer was in the early stages of pregnancy . Unfortunately , the girl and her family didn ' t know that yet . Sure enough , though , the mailer system was right , the girl was pregnant , and Target ' s purchase analysis figured it out before the humans it was monitoring did .
