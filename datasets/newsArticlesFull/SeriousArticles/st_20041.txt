" Breaking Bad " is the story of a high school chemistry teacher who found out he had lung cancer . Not that there ' s ever a good time for this news , but for this guy , the timing couldn ' t have been worse : A pregnant wife , a handicapped son and financial circumstances so dire ( did I mention he was a public high school teacher ? ) that his wife and children will be impoverished when he dies . So he did exactly what you or I would do under the circumstances : Get into the burgeoning market for crystal methamphetamine .
