Obviously now everyone has Spain in their sights . And there is where the real problem lies . Spain is too big to fully bail out a la Greece and definitely too big too fail . If Spain gets into too much trouble " Project Euro " is likely over . From all my private talks with European officials it has become clear Spain is the line in the sand . Greece may be too far gone and be allowed to fall , but Spain will be defended till the bitter end . So I fully expect European leaders to give Spain something to take the boot off the throat of austerity in the coming weeks . Probably the same for Portugal .
