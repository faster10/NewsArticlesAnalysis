We are encouraged to see global health partners such as the Global Fund , PEPFAR , UNAIDS , and UNICEF are creating new initiatives that specifically focus on young women and girls . If we are to end this epidemic , young women and girls have to be at the center of the response to HIV in Africa . That is easier said than done because issues that marginalize girls are often interwoven in the cultural fabric . Yet I have faith in humanity and in the human compassion that changed my life , my sons ' lives and the lives of millions of other people by supporting access to HIV treatment . That love that saved millions of us is needed now more than ever to save young women and girls a group that has been left far , far behind .
