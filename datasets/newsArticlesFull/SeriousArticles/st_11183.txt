The wackos who are mostly but not exclusively Republican do not believe in " the public good " . ( In fact that would be an excellent question at any of the forthcoming TV campaign " debates " : do you believe in the public good ? ) In 2014 , Cruz fanned the flames : " We have seen our liberty under assault from a federal government that seems hell bent on expanding its authority over every aspect of our lives . Thomas Jefferson famously said the Constitution is meant to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government and we have seen , sadly , our Constitutional liberties eroded under the Obama administration and I think it is in that context that people are viewing this battle with the federal government . We should have a federal government protecting the liberty of the citizens , not using the jackboot of authoritarianism to come against the citizens . And I think this is the unfortunate and tragic culmination of the path that President Obama has set the federal government upon . "
