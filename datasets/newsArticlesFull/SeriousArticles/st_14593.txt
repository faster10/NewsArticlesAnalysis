This lack of interest in having a big ol shootout right away on government property didn t just disappoint the militiamen . A number of liberal commentators were miffed that the feds seemed to be twiddling their thumbs , often arguing that if the occupiers were people of color , the shootout would have happened already . The criticism had some merit , of course , but the solution for such a double standard isn t to have more shootouts , so much as it s an argument against the quick to violence reactions law enforcement regrettably has when dealing with ? non white suspects .
