It will always be argued there are more worthy films and performances than there are slots . Michael Keaton didn ' t receive a best actor nod , even though he commanded the screen in " Spotlight . " Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg weren ' t nominated for best director , even though both " The Martian " and Bridge of Spies " were nominated for best picture . This year ' s best director list includes Miller ( " Mad Max : Fury Road " ) , Inarritu ( " The Revenant " ) , Lenny Abrahamson ( " Room " ) , Tom McCarthy ( " Spotlight ' ) and Adam McKay , for " The Big Short .
