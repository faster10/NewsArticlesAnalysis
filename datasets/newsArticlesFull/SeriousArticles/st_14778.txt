Black History Month grew out of a desire to make the black past visible . In 1926 , Harvard trained historian Carter G . Woodson sought to challenge the myth that black people were without a history .

Woodson ' s Association created the Journal of Negro History to promote research and writing on Africa and its Diaspora in an era during which much of the historical profession was indifferent to the subject .
