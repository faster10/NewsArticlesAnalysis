Isis has openly declared itself at war with Britain , its allies and now Russia , too . It must be rooted out or else more terrible outrages may follow . This may ultimately involve a truly international , UN authorised combined military operation in Syria ( in contrast to the Bush Blair intervention in Iraq ) . It would see the west , Russia and the Arab powers joining together to suppress Isis , end the civil war and refugee crisis , and achieve a political settlement . An international menace requires a truly international response .
