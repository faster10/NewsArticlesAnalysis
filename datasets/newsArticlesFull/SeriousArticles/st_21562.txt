But what wasn t peculiar was what took place in the ring as Tyson Fury ? who is named after hard hitting heavyweight legend Mike Tyson ? used his size and speed to make Klitschko ( 64 4 ) look every bit of his 39 years . Standing at 6 foot 9 with an 85 inch reach ( compared to Klitschko s 6 foot 6 frame with an 81 inch reach ) , Fury ( 25 0 ) worked behind a long jab to keep the Ukrainian off balance . The action was limited but Fury was more effective as he landed 86 of 371 punches to Klitschko s 52 of 310 punches .
