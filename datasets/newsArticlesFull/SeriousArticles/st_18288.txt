Cummings responded to the new obsession of the Republicans on the committee over Sidney Blumenthal by demanding that Blumenthal ' s nine hours of testimony before the committee be made public . After all , if Blumenthal is such a bugaboo to Republicans , there must be a reason why and that reason should be found in the questions they asked him and the answers he gave , right ? Demonizing Blumenthal doesn ' t make a whole lot of sense , but then nothing about the Benghazi committee makes a whole lot of sense , so it fits right in , we suppose . Still , the vocal argument Cummings got into with Trey Gowdy was the actual highlight of yesterday ' s hearing . Cummings has been saying stuff like this for a long time now , but the press has ignored him in favor of blindly reprinting the leaks from the Republicans on the committee . Finally , Cummings got to make his case in a very public way .
