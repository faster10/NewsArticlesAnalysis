AT : Pan African collaboration is extremely important . I think things like regional integration , inter African trade does need to increase and is increasing . I mean , the progress in the East African community has been amazing . The manner in which they ' ve harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic . So , we need to see more of that take place on the continent . The fact that we ' re 54 countries , yet we ' re a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage . I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial .
