There are several common types of turbulence . Convective turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over an unstable air mass ( perhaps near a thunderstorm ) and experiences rapidly rising or descending air , according to Schneider . Mechanical turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over a mountain range , hills or even large buildings . They bring " waves " of uneven airflow . Wind shear or clear air turbulence can occur without warning due to changing movements and speeds of air at different heights .
