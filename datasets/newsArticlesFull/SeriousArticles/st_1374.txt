Conventional thinking will not solve Syria ' s complex conflict . These are the questions that should be on the table : How can a face saving exit route for Assad be found ? Will Russia provide a home , or Iran ? If protesters in Syria are democracy activists , what stops them from working with their democratic neighbor , Israel ? The answer to that question tells us much about anti Israeli , and by extension , anti American sentiment in Syria . How can Turkey and Arab nations persuade the opposition to return to nonviolent protest ? Who can hold the country together after Assad ' s departure ?
