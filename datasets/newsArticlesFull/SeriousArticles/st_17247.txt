The screening where I saw it , it was very well received . I can only surmise that it didn t have real broad support from the below the line groups but everyone really liked it , says ? the editor , referring to the fact that it wasn t nominated by the editors guild , cinematographers guild , or the art director guilds in their best of the year contests . The cast was terrific . The editing was great . It was shot really well . I was really disappointed it didn t get in , but I think it s the system that s flawed . The Academy has increased its members by 20 percent ? in the last three years , but it s going to take a while to pay off .
