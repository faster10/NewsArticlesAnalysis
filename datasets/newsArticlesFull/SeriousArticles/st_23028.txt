These are the kinds of people that Moas helps , day in and day out , on the Mediterranean . And the charity is now poised to help many thousands more . On 18 December , Moas will send a new boat to the Aegean sea , to help rescue stricken people ? mainly Syrian , Afghan and Iraqi refugees ? if they run into difficulty while trying to reach Greece from Turkey . The new boat s two dinghies will be called Alan and Galip , named for the two Syrian toddlers whose corpses were found face down on a Turkish beach in early September .
