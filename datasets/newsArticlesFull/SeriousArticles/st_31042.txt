The results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies . The slight increase in President Obama ' s proposed 2016 budget won ' t significantly change that . At the end of this process , our military will be significantly smaller , dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place . The Army is on the path to be reduced to pre World War II levels . The Navy is at pre WWI levels . And our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history .
