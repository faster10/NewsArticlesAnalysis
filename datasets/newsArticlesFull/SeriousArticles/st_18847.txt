Colwell : It ' s a combination of sanitation and safe water . . . . We do not have cholera in the United States . We have not had it since about 1930 when filtered , chlorinated household water was made available . Similarly in Europe , back in the 1890s and 1900s , cholera epidemics were devastating . In fact , cholera played into outcomes of major wars when troops became debilitated by the cholera bacterium . So , a combination of proper sanitation and filtered , chlorinated , safely distributed water not just cholera , but at least two dozen diseases transmitted by contaminated water can be prevented .
