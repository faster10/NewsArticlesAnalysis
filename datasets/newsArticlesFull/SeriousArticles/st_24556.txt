Down in fourth place , Universal ' s " Kick Ass 2 " stumbled in its opening weekend with a meager 13 . 5 million . That ' s a big step below the original " Kick Ass , " which debuted to 19 . 8 million en route to 48 . 1 million total in 2010 . While that was hardly an eye popping total , Universal pushed ahead with a sequel based on " Kick Ass " ' popularity in geek circles and its strong home video sales . Unfortunately , few people were very interested in the sequel ( including star Jim Carrey , who would not do any publicity for the R rated film after deciding he would not promote violence ) .
