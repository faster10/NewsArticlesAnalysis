The FDA will no longer recommend routine and periodic monitoring of liver enzymes of patients taking statins . Instead , it said liver enzyme tests should be performed before a patient starts taking statins , and then only when clinically indicated . That ' s because according to the FDA , serious injury to the liver is rare , and routine monitoring doesn ' t detect or prevent it . The new label will tell patients who experience fatigue , loss of appetite , dark urine , upper stomach pain or jaundice to notify their doctor immediately .
