Bogdanovich : I had very interesting experiences . " The Last Picture Show " was at one of those places where the audience was told to turn a knob one way if they like it and another if they don ' t . And the picture was not liked at all . Columbia turned to me and said , " What do we do ? " I said , " I think they need to be told it ' s a good picture . " And they snapped their fingers and said , " Tastemaker screenings . " So we had 30 screenings for small groups of people and the buzz was extraordinary .
