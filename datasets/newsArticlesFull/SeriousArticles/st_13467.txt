Interviews with about 100 parents and doctors showed that rather than rushing to pathologize and medicate their kids , parents did all they could to avoid " labeling " their children and put off using medication if they used it at all until they really were desperate . What these interviews showed above all is that for parents and children ( and grown children ) dealing with mental health issues , life is complicated , unsure and filled with unanswered questions that can ' t be addressed by gross generalizations about the " medicated child " in our time .
