Yeah , I said John Cusack , who unless I have missed some important news story , is about as white boy as they come . He plays a Catholic priest in a South Side parish who gets one of the movie s biggest scenes . Lee has always been clear that America s racial problem is not about white people as such , but an institutional system of white racism that allows all individual white people to hold themselves innocent of its history and unaccountable for its continuing operation ? ? hey , I never owned any slaves , and Jim Crow laws were abolished while I was in the cradle ! What does any of that stuff have to do with me ?
