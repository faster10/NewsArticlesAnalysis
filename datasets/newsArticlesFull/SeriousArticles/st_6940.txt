The Erdogan government has been unhappy with the US for its handling of the Syrian crisis almost from the time when the rebellion to overthrow the Assad regime started in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring . And Erdogan is politically inflexible when he has taken a position on any issue . His government seems to believe that the present mess in Syria , with IS emerging as a determining force in Syria and Iraq , is due to the US failure to act against the Assad regime . And this mess has also raised the profile of the Kurds across Turkey , Iraq and Syria , thus creating problems for Turkey . This might need to be dealt with directly through security operations by the Turkish state and , indirectly , by IS . This pincer movement will most likely weaken Kurds over a period of time . In the meantime , this might win the AKP the parliamentary elections , thus entrenching its political dominance in place since 2002 . Such calculations do not seem to factor in the threat from IS , not only for Turkey but the entire Middle Eastern region . And this is where the Erdogan government has lost the plot .
