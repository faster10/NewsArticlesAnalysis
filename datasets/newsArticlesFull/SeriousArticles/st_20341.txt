As for law enforcement ? The recent decades have given them an unprecedented ability to put us under surveillance and access our data . Our cell phones provide them with a detailed history of our movements . Our call records , email history , buddy lists , and Facebook pages tell them who we associate with . The hundreds of companies that track us on the Internet tell them what we ' re thinking about . Ubiquitous cameras capture our faces everywhere . And most of us back up our iPhone data on iCloud , which the FBI can still get a warrant for . It truly is the golden age of surveillance .
