Since 2010 , I have sat on the board of the Global Foundation for the Elimination of Domestic Violence ( GFEDV ) , and am a signatory to the Peace One Day ' s Global Peace Declaration , supporting efforts to end the global epidemic of domestic violence and gender based abuse . The organisation , which I founded , Wellbeing Foundation Africa ( WBFA ) , has taken a strong stand against domestic violence through the production of documentaries , peaceful awareness marches , social media campaigns , and joined the Nigerian Legislative Advocacy Coalition on Violence Against Women ( LACVAW ) to lobby the Nigeria ' s National Assembly to pass the Violence Against Persons Prohibition ( VAPP ) bill . We want our nation to bear witness to the dark secret that affects one in two households in Nigeria , and have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of the issue .
