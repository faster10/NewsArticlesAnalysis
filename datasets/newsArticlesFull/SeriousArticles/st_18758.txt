Big picture : The Kansas City Chiefs , who won their first playoff game since January 1994 , are legitimate threats to reach the Super Bowl . They have now won 11 straight games after starting the season 1 5 . The competition will get much tough after beating a Texans team that lacked a serviceable quarterback Saturday . The AFC s top two seeds , the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots , are both vulnerable . The Chiefs , who continue to lurk under the radar , have an outstanding defense that intercepted quarterback Brian Hoyer four times . Quarterback Alex Smith has authored a strong season , throwing just seven interceptions during the regular season . He s more than just a game manager , as he displayed Saturday . Aside from an errant pass on a potential deep touchdown early , and an interception that deflected off receiver Jeremy Maclin , Smith was on point Saturday . The Chiefs are playing as well as anybody .
