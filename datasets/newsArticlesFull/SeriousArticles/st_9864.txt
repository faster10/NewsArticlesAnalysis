Disappointment No . 2 : Battery life has been not so great thus far . I haven t done any significant testing so it may just be my imagination but I haven t had the greatest experience with the device s battery life so far . The good news here is that Apple offers great tools to help you track which apps are wrecking the iPhone s battery . I ve already decided to use Safari in favor of Chrome on the iPhone 6s after being positively horrified at the amount of battery life Google s mobile browser uses .
