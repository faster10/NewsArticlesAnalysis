Rushdie : I ' ve done bits " Haroun and the Sea of Stories . " I did my collection of short stories , but it ' s not the same thing , you know . Reading is a very different thing than performing . In fact , one of the things I think that doesn ' t work in books on tape is if the person doing the reading " acts " too much it becomes irritating to you listening to it . So reading is a different place , a different voice , and ( " Midnight ' s Children " ) after all was not me reading the book it was me performing the part of the older Saleem looking back at his younger life . It ' s a first person narrative , first person voiceover , and it ' s his first person , not mine . So this involved a tiny bit of acting .
