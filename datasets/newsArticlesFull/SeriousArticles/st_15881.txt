Jay Cutler has been a coach killer in his career , but he may have gotten Gase the Dolphins job . Cutler had 21 TDs and 11 INTs and a career high 92 . 3 passer rating in his one season with Gase as the Bears offensive coordinator . Gase was a favorite of Peyton Manning , too , so he has done good work with two diverse personalities . Now it s on to Ryan Tannehill Chip Kelly interviewed with the 49ers but Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson appears to be the leading contender . If Kelly gets the job , the good thing for the 49ers is that when he tears the team apart , it will be justified , unlike the hatchet job he did in Philly In addition to Coughlin , the Eagles could go after Chiefs offensive coordinator Doug Pederson , who was on their staff from 2009 2012 and played for them in 1999 The Bucs really like the job offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter did with Winston and have received more than one request to interview him from teams looking for a head coach . If Tampa promotes Koetter , it will explain why they fired Smith . After firing Jon Gruden in 2008 , seven seasons after giving up two first round and two second round picks and 8 million to the Raiders to get him ( he won the Super Bowl in his first year ) , the Bucs have shown no patience . Raheem Morris lasted three years , Greg Schiano two years and Smith two years .
