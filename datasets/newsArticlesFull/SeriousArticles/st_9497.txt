Although the trailer doesn ' t ? provide much detail about the season , it s been previously reported that the biggest draw for fans is the introduction of Frank Castle ( Jon Bernthal ) , better known to fans of the Marvel Comics Universe as The Punisher . Matt Murdock ( Charlie Cox ) spent last season learning that he doesn t need to be a killer in order to be an instrument of justice in New York City s Hell s Kitchen . Castle , on the other hand , decided to take a very different approach to stopping crime . In the comic books , the anti hero clashes with Daredevil over his philosophy of simply killing criminals rather than allowing the justice system to take control . While it may sound like The Punisher is going to be the new villain of the season , like Wilson Fisk ( Vincent D Onofrio ) was in Season 1 , things are much more complicated than that .
