Levi ' s Stadium , home to the 49ers and this year ' s Super Bowl , is just 110 miles from West Coast Turf . In fact , West Coast Turf provides the regular season field too . And that brings a twist : In the two seasons the 49ers have played at Levi ' s , fans have booed the turf almost as much as the team . In 2014 , then coach Jim Harbaugh pulled the 49ers off the field in a public practice after players slipped on the grass . In 2015 , the team canceled another public practice after continued problems . And in October , Ravens kicker Justin Tucker ' s plant foot disappeared into a divot as he attempted a fourth quarter field goal . The 45 yarder doinked off the right upright , and the Ravens lost 25 20 . If something like that decides Super Bowl 50 , we ' ll still be talking about it at Super Bowl 550 .
