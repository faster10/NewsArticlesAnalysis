In the car were two women , three small children and an elderly man , plus the two men who were attempting to dig out the wheels with sticks . It took less than 10 minutes to pull them out , and they were grateful for the help . . . they ' d been there for nearly four hours and many trucks and security vehicles had passed them without offering a helping hand . They thought they would either freeze or be pushed over the brink of the cliff once it darkened . I know that story is true because the young man is my son Reese and I was with him .
