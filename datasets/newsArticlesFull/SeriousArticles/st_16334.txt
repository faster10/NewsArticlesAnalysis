Everything that Bernie Bros have been accused of doing is something I ve seen from One Directioners on Twitter ? a group so displeased by an article I wrote three years ago that they invited me to ? sit on a chair upholstered with glass shards . ? Cross them , and you re liable to be swarmed by a loosely coordinated crew of obsessives who will accuse you of rank opportunism . ( You just writted about one direction because you want fame , or as Sanders supporters put it , you re a paid Hillary shill . ) They will also slide into your timeline under the auspices of asking a perfectly innocent question ( I just wanna know why are you so obsessed with one direction ? Why criticize only Bernie ? Please answer ) , make irrelevant aesthetic arguments ( gotta hide them cankles ) , and add that anyone who complains about personal attacks is discounting true criticism .
