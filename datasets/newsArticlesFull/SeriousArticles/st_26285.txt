Change makers like gogo ( grandmother ) Kawocha , who never learned to read or write but now encourages her own grandchildren to read at home . She told me in a text message sent by a village boy , " Tererai , my daughter could not read and write and died leaving orphans under my care . Now they can read at home and I get to participate in their reading , it has never been heard of until the Matau Project . It ' s a miracle . " It warms my heart when I picture gogo Kawocha taking part in her grandchildren ' s education .
