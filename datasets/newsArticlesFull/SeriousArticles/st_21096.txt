It ' s something that I ' ve occasionally seen adults do , and yes , it was a little startling to see a kid this young with a movie to hawk go onto the Letterman show and assume that mock confrontational , who ' s really in charge here ? stance . But it wouldn ' t have worked if it wasn ' t , in its way , a gripping little talk show performance . ( Letterman himself played at being taken back , but also was taken aback it ' s always a good thing when Dave gets jolted out of his stuffy protective pose , his robo irony . )
