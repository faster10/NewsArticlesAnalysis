The judge likely relied upon Section 15 18 8 of the Alabama Code , which explicitly gives judges discretion to suspend a significant portion of a defendant ' s sentence . A suspended sentence is incarceration in name only : The defendant will serve that time out of custody . Clem received 20 years . In this jurisdiction , for sentences between 15 and 20 years , it appears that a mandatory minimum applies : The judge must order at least three and up to five years , and then may suspend the rest . Here ' s where it gets strange : The Alabama Supreme Court has held that even the incarceration portion of a split sentence ( the three year minimum ) may be suspended . So 20 years can mean zero years .
