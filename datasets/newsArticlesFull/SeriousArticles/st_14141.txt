The NFL is hoping it gets three new stadiums built in one fell swoop . It ' s got Kroenke ' s massive 1 . 86 billion complex in Inglewood . With any luck , Spanos and the Chargers will take the 100 million and get the necessary public funding to get a new stadium approved in San Diego within a year . Then , after the Chargers say " thanks , but no thanks " to moving to Inglewood , the Raiders have an additional year ? taking them to the end of 2017 ? to use their 100 million to get a new stadium in Oakland . ( And if the Raiders don ' t get it done , they can move into Inglewood with the Rams . ) And there you have it . Three new stadium approvals in three NFL markets in the span of little more than two years . And one of the three happens to be a gargantuan in Los Angeles .
