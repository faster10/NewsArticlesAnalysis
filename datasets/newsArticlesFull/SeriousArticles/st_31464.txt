Why they ll win : It ' ll probably come down to Cam Newton playing a big game . Newton has been phenomenal all year , and it ' s arguable no quarterback is more important to his team ' s offense because the Panthers also feature Newton extensively in the run game . Newton is coming off his worst game on the ground all season , with just 3 yards on 11 carries , and didn ' t do a ton in the passing game either because the Panthers were sitting on a huge lead in the second half . It ' s hard to imagine the Panthers will win again without Newton playing a huge role . He ' s the favorite to win NFL MVP for a reason , and he ' ll be in a big spot on Sunday .
