Hannah Storm : I feel very blessed . I was the best person off in that burn unit . What many or so many suffer from is so exponentially worse than I could ever imagine . I ' m so grateful to be able to do my job , to sit here and to talk to you and to be able to carry on . So the only reason that I will have wanted to share what I have wanted is because I don ' t want it to happen to anybody else , and I also want people to you know understand a little bit about what burn victims go through . The pain is there for a long time the trauma is there for a long time . I think it ' s not always obvious .
