" One song changed the way we look at rock music , " said Russ Lancaster of " Smells Like Teen Spirit , " the first track on the record . " Just like the Beatles changed pop music 30 years prior , Nirvana ' s breakthrough album achieved the same level of power in terms of changing pop music . They weren ' t singing anymore about happy , funny songs . They were taking a real dark turn to pop music , and it changed everything . Back then it was really different to hear that on the radio . It opened up a floodgate of artists that might never have been heard before that . "
