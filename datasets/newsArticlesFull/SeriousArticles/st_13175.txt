And campus wasn t exactly an easy place to be black . For such a big school , the university was incredibly segregated . ( Today , more than 75 percent of the 35 , 000 students at Mizzou are white . ) I figured that out early when I decided to go through formal recruitment , otherwise known as rush , for a sorority . I d gone to an all girls ( and , yes , nearly all white ) high school and was nervous about getting lost on the massive campus . I thought joining a sorority could help it feel more like home .
