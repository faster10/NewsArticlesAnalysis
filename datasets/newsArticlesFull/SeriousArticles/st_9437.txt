San Diego s latest loss came on Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs , far from the league s most formidable opponent . The Chargers were completely dominated , losing 33 3 in a game that was even more one sided than the score suggests . What s surprising is that the Chargers do not have an inherently untalented team . Philip Rivers is still considered by many as a top franchise quarterback , one that several GM s may well sell the farm for come the off season . Keenan Allen at wide receiver as well as Antonio Gates at tight end have also all been integral parts of San Diego s offence that has produced success in the past . ?
