Roethlisberger s return provides a huge boost not just to those who have been forced to play a backup for four weeks , but also to those who have Pittsburgh s skill players . Brown may be the biggest beneficiary , as he was an absolute beast during his first two games with a healthy Roethlisberger , catching 18 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns . He finally returned to form last week after three duds , and now with Roethlisberger back , Brown could quickly regain his status as the top wide receiver in fantasy .
