Louis was 37 years old . He had been the undisputed champion for more than 11 years and fought in 27 world title fights . But now he had nothing left . They had to lift me off the stool for the bell in the eighth , he remembers . I was glad I wasn t fully conscious when referee Ruby Goldstein stopped the fight . There was no doubt Marciano had beaten the shit out of me . Afterwards , when Louis was on the massage table , the doctor told him he could not fight for at least three months . I turned my head and looked at the doc and said , Do you mind if I don t fight no more at all ? wrote Louis , sounding both grateful yet wistful . I thought , like many fighters before and after me , that I d always be some kind of superman . That s the dream . Not the reality . I just didn t have it any more .
