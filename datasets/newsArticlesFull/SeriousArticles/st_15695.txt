" We like our chances , man , " Durant said . " We ' re not coming into any game against any team thinking , We don ' t have a chance to win this game . ' We ' ve got guys who have played in the toughest playoff series . We ' ve got guys who ' ve been to the Finals . We know what that feels like . We know what that is . Of course , if we go into a series up against either the Spurs or the Warriors , we ' re not going to be favored . But we ' re not worried about that . We like our chances against anybody . "
