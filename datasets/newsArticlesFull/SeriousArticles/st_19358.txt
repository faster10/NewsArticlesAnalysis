Harington : I don ' t wash it anyway when I ' m filming . It ' s my choice in a kind of strange little way . I think when we shot the pilot one of the things that was wrong about it was that everybody looked too clean . There wasn ' t enough dirt on people ' s faces . Hair was too slicked back . When they saw the pilot they rang and said , " Can you grow your hair ? Grow a beard , we want it to look a bit dirtier and grubbier and more visceral . " We were in Iceland for about a month and I kind of let it build up . It was very , very nice to wash it by the end .
