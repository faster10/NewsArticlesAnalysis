Perugia ' s Madonna delle Grazie in the Duomo is a larger than life , clearly pregnant young woman , painted in 1515 by one of Perugia ' s Renaissance greats . She wears a brocade blue dress , and her pale eyes are strangely distant and slightly uneven . Perugians hundreds of years ago adorned her image with a real crown . Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini , a staunch traditional Catholic , kept her image hanging on the wall behind his desk and spoke of how she had helped his uncle escape from certain death at the hands of the Russians in the 1940s .
