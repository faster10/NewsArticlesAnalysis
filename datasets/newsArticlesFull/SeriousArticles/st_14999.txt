On a positive note , both parties will continue to resettle refugees directly from camps and urban settlements in other countries , as well as asylum seekers who come by plane who are found to be refugees . The total number of refugees accepted by Australia whether by overseas resettlement , plane arrivals or boat arrivals will be capped at 13 , 750 by the Coalition . Labor will increase that number to 20 , 000 , and possibly up to 27 , 000 if there is a significant decline in the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat .
