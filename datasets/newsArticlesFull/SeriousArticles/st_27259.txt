So back to the conversation I had with the lady who had recently received the news that she had advanced cancer that had spread , and that she would probably not live much longer than a year or so . She talked about you and loved your music , but for some reason was not impressed by your Ziggy Stardust outfit ( she was not sure whether you were a boy or a girl ) . She too , had memories of places and events for which you provided an idiosyncratic soundtrack . And then we talked about a good death , the dying moments and what these typically look like . And we talked about palliative care and how it can help . She told me about her mother s and her father s death , and that she wanted to be at home when things progressed , not in a hospital or emergency room , but that she d happily transfer to the local hospice should her symptoms be too challenging to treat at home .
