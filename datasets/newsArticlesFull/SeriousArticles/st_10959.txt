A fumble by running back Jeremy Hill as the Bengals tried to run out the clock breathed new life into the Steelers , and Roethisberger returned to the game to jump start their comeback . Big Ben dinked and dunked the gold and black toward field goal territory when the combustible Burfict leveled receiver Antonio Brown , causing a fifteen yard personal foul . Adding to the nonsense , while trainers tended to the wobbly Brown , Bengals cornerback Adam Jones received another personal foul call that put the Bengals into field goal range for Boswell .
