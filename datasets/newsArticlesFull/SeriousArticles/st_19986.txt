I recently attended a talk with Sherry Turkle , author of " Together Alone " and an insightful MIT researcher on how technology is pulling us apart . She spoke about research indicating that empathy must be developed with face to face interactions , not with devices . This is undeniably true , but I feel that we should give parents more credit . We get that empathy is best cultivated with face to face interactions and experiences . However , kids spend more time on their devices than sleeping , eating or going to school .
