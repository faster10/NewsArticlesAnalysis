Robertson : ( The violence ) is significantly worse . It ' s become quantifiably worse since Bashar al Assad unleashed the full force of his military army on Homs , on places like Zabadani that we visited with the Arab League monitors . When the monitors were there , the army wasn ' t shelling these towns . They weren ' t using tanks this way . They weren ' t firing mortars into these civilian areas . That ' s begun in the last week or so , all these injuries . And when we were there , there were perhaps 20 or 30 people being killed a day . Now the numbers are up in the hundreds . So it ' s quantifiably worse .
