Thomas : The thing we ' re proud about in this series , we were able to pack some real surprises into the conventional sitcom form . A lot of viewers have given up on meeting the mother prior to the final episode . There are a lot of people who think that ' s true . I think this will count as a genuine surprise for a lot of people . A lot of people think , " Oh , they got another year we ' re never going to see her face this year . " I think the way that the season ends , I ' m hoping it will blow some people ' s minds and surprise them and make them want to tune in and see what we ' re going to do with that .
