Now as to why someone would leave Griffey off his or her Hall of Fame ballot is entirely beyond me , an act for which I believe there is no real defense . ( Maybe this is it has taken so long to identify the culprits . ) We all know Griffey was good enough , as have been many others . And if someone left Griffey off the ballot for the purpose of manipulating the process ? namely , to give a vote to someone who otherwise would have been squeezed off his her ballot ? that to me is perhaps a most inexcusable sin .
