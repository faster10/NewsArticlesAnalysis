In 2013 , I put forward the proposal of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road , which received positive response from Iran . As two important stops on the ancient Silk Road , both China and Iran have high expectations for reviving this road of peace , friendship and cooperation . China is soon to implement the 13th Five Year Plan for Economic and Social Development . Iran will also carry out the sixth five year plan for economic development . Our development strategies are highly compatible , which creates huge potential for cooperation .
