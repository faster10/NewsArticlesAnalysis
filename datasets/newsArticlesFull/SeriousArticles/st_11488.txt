Another possibility would not require any reporting on the part of the licensed dealer . Instead , gun owners themselves would be required to keep documentation on any transactions in which one of their guns was transferred to another person . That documentation could then help the police trace a gun through the chain of possession from first retail sale by a licensed dealer . If the gun were associated with a crime or a criminal , then police investigators might require previous owners to provide that documentation .
