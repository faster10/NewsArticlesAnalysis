Okay , I was joking there , but some did say it was a snub for The Peanuts Movie not getting an animation nomination . Ridley Scott ' s sci fi epic The Martian landed seven nominations , including Best Picture and Best Actor for Matt Damon , but , surprisingly , no Best Director nod for Scott . He said he didn ' t see it as an Oscar film but " Creed " was considered an Oscar film and so was " Concussion " . The Oscars have also garnered criticism this year for a " a almost all white nominees ' list " .
