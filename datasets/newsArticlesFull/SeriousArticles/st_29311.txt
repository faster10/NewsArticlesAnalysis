The same applies in the air . North Korea ' s air force largely comprises aging Soviet MiG fighters ( though it has some MiG 29s ) that would be unable to compete with South Korean F 15 jets or the F 16 fighters of the U . S . 7th Air Force , based in South Korea . In addition , the North ' s air force has suffered fuel shortages , and Jane ' s estimated that the North ' s fighter pilots may get as little as 25 flying hours per year . The North Koreans also have a large fleet of Russian design biplanes that would be better suited to crop spraying but could be used to drop special forces behind enemy lines in the event of conflict .
