Has anybody seen Norman Rockwell ? We gather together for the Thanksgiving holiday and a few days of family togetherness . The tables are groaning under time honored dishes of our Pilgrim forefathers , or so we like to think . We tell innocent stories about them and their Native American guests ( or Indians , as the first settlers called them . ) We draw inspiration from rough times , when families came to find freedom to worship as they please in a new land , forging the first chapter of our history .
