In 2010 GMHC joined a coalition of other nonprofits to encourage Congress to send a letter to HHS to end the ban , which some members of congress did . In June of that year , HHS brought together an independent panel of experts . The Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability reviewed the policy and decided to keep it and concluded the ban was " suboptimal , " because it allows high risk individuals to donate while keeping low risk donors out . However , the expert committee also concluded " available scientific data are inadequate to support change to a specific alternate policy . " The panel suggested the policy not be changed and recommended further evaluation .
