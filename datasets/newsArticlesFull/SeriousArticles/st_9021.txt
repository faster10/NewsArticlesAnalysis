Every man has two cities he needs to be . The one he can touch and the one he can t see The one where a stranger s a friend Every man s got one city of liberty For me it s Paris I love it Every time I get lost down these ancient streets , I find myself again You re free , baby , baby , free now and for ever It s Christmas time , you can decide to forget or to remember You re free , baby , baby I didn t come here to fight you I came down these streets of love and pride to surrender The streets of surrender .
