The onscreen evidence that most fans point to is the reunion moment between Poe and Finn on the planet D Qar . The two men had met and bonded briefly at the start of the film , when they escaped together from the First Order ? Poe as a prisoner and Finn as a defecting Stormtrooper who needed a pilot . They crashed , and Poe appeared to die . Finn wore Poe s jacket until the two are reunited through the Resistance , when Poe tells him , Hey , that s my jacket . No , no . Keep it . It suits you .
