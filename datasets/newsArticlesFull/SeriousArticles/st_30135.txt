What we re seeing with Stone , Trump and company is the classic swift boating technique , which was named after a 2004 campaign to discredit John Kerry by ? falsely accusing him of not earning the Purple Heart and Silver Star that he got for service in Vietnam . There was a real me too quality to the entire campaign , as there is with any efforts to argue that liberals are the real racists or the real sexists . Kerry was up against George W . Bush , who had come under fire for not just being a warmonger , but doing so while having a history of evading service himself ? by joining the National Guard instead of going to Vietnam to fight in a war that he and his family supported . Conservatives were mad . They wanted a military service controversy of their own . Unable to come by one honestly , they just made one up .
