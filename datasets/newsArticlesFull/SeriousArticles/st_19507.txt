Holy smokes the Giants defense was awful , especially in the first half when they didn ' t create a turnover and forced just one punt . The breakdowns on the back end were embarrassing . Wide receiver Marques Colston didn ' t have a defender within 15 yards of him on his 53 yard touchdown . Snead was wide open on his 34 yard touchdown on a flea flicker in the first quarter . The Giants couldn ' t muster a pass rush , couldn ' t stop Brees and the Saints , and didn ' t look like they had any chance of stopping New Orleans at any time on Sunday .
