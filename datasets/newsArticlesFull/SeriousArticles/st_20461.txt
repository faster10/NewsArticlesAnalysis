Rupert and James Murdoch did not get off so lightly . Leveson saved some of his strongest words for the media mogul and his son , a senior executive at the company founded by his father . The judge expressed amazement that Murdoch Sr . had not sought more information about the likely extent of phone hacking at the News of the World , one of the company ' s flagship titles . His failure to read a damning high court judgement about the conduct of News of the World " says something about the degree to which his organization engages with the ethical direction of its newspapers " . Referring to Murdoch ' s claim he did not remember visiting then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss his 1981 takeover bid for the Times of London at her official country residence , Leveson said : " It is perhaps a little surprising that he does not remember a visit to a place as memorable as Chequers in the context of a bid as important as that which he made for Time newspapers . However , perhaps that is all I need to say . "
