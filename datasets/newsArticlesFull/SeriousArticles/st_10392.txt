Bernie is not a guy who is reading polls and deciding what he should say , this is what he believes in , Cohen said . If you ' re looking of incremental change , fiddling around the edges , Hillary will do that . If you realize the government is seriously flawed , that the system is broken , it s rigged , that it s no accident all this money is going up to the very top while the rest of us are struggling to get by , you have to have a fighter , a passionate guy like Bernie who is not in the pocket of the major corporations and the ultra wealthy who are fueling Hillary Clinton s campaign .
