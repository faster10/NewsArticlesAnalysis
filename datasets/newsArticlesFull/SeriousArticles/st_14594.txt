Well , those fears were proven most dramatically wrong Tuesday afternoon , when law enforcement ? confronted ? the militiamen on the open highway . A shootout did ensue , which was expected since these folks all have ridiculous martyr fantasies , and ? one person was killed . So far , there have been eight arrests , and the leaders of this fiasco are in custody . Now the feds have closed in on the refuge , closing roads and access . Without leadership or access to the outside , it won t be surprising if the rest of the people inside just give up soon enough .
