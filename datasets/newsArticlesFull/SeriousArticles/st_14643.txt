MJ : The shift in style fit my personnel . When the shift says more three point shooting and I m sitting there with Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry , then I m fine with it . I totally understand what coach Popovich is saying . I think the foolish thing is to have coach Popovich s team and they re just trying to jack up threes . The way that they are successful is staying true to their identity . Too many teams are trying to copy the trend , but ultimately it s going to put them in a position to fail . Let them do what they do and do what you do best . I totally think you can t have one way of going and that s the way to win . The Warriors have won because their style matches their personnel .
