7 . Moderating a presidential debate is hard . Republican candidates weren t happy about how the Republican debate went last night ? and they weren t afraid to say it . RNC Chairman Reince Preibus said that CNBC should be ashamed about the way they ran the debate . But CNBC spokesperson Brian Steel shot back , saying : People who want to be President of the United States should be able to answer tough questions . The candidates also weren t afraid to criticize the moderators on stage . Are we really talking about getting government involved in fantasy football ? Christie asked . Can we stop ? With a full stage of 10 Republicans , all trying to angle for more speaking time , it s hard to keep things under control .
