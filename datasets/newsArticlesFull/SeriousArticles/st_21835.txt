The return of wide receiver DeSean Jackson from early season injury and emergence of tight end Jordan Reed as a difference making tight end have helped Cousins enjoy one of the most prolific passing seasons in Redskins history . Jackson provided a deep threat the Redskins sorely lacked . He registered three scoring catches of 56 or more yards between Weeks 10 and 16 . Through the first nine games , Cousins ' longest completion was 43 yards . With 87 catches for 952 yards and 11 touchdowns , Reed became the first Redskins tight end to lead the team in receiving since Jean Fugett in 1977 . Wide receivers Pierre Garcon ( 72 777 6 TDs ) and rookie Jamison Crowder ( 59 604 2 ) contributed , as well .
