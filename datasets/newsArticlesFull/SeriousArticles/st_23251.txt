Getting back from the date , I immediately turned on the television to get an update on what had happened and was struck by the photo of Robert Lewis Dear . There ' s scant information law enforcement had collected on him was routine : 57 . White . Three rifles . Had recently moved to Colorado from a North Carolina cabin without electricity of water . I think what struck me the most was how much he reminded me of one of my family members , even someone I had just spent Thanksgiving with . This family member who makes it a point to loudly and publicly " just tease " me about my liberal politics and I had just had a rather heated argument the day before on how " somebody needs to do something to take back this country . " He said he " understands " people who bomb health clinics and that " they ' re patriots . " When the defunding of Planned Parenthood took place earlier this year , he called me to tell me " it wasn ' t enough " and to reiterate " someone needs to do something to stop these bitches . " So , when I say that the image on the news right now looks and sounds so familiar , it is because I like so many others have a Robert Lewis Dear in my family .
