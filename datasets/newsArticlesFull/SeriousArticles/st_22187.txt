Those at Rod Laver Arena were actually witnessing a historical event of sorts because in front of their eyes , Konta became the first British woman in 32 years to feature in grand slam finals action . The Brit received hearty applause when introduced but the stadium was still only half full by the time she d wrapped up the first set . There was also plenty of love for Zhang , who has delighted so many Melburnians over the past week after failing to progress beyond the first round of grand slam tournaments in every one of her previous 10 attempts . Australian sports fans are nothing if not appreciators of an underdog battle .
