The first American Labor Day is dated to a parade organized by unions in New York on September 5 , 1882 , as a celebration of " the strength and spirit of the American worker . " Their goals were simple : decent wages , an eight hour workday and the right to organize . The September date was selected to provide a respite for workers and their families midway between July Fourth and Thanksgiving Day . By all accounts , the first Labor Day was a peaceful affair that drew tens of thousands of workers and their families to the city ' s Union Square Park .
