I know the terror that descended over her like a dark cloak every time the bell rang , signaling the beginning of the school day . And I also know that as much as she must have hated her classmates for what they were putting her through , it was what they were denying her that hurt even worse : someone to sit with at lunch , the invitations to hang out on weekends and after school , the girl talk and giggles exchanged between trusted friends , the simple joy of fitting in . Before long , it pokes holes in your soul , and you can feel self loathing start to fill in those empty spaces .
