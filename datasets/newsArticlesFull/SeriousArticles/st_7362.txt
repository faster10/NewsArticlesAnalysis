Microsoft Windows Phone Director Aaron Woodman has stated his belief that competition between manufacturers to produce phones with faster and faster quad core processors is unnecessary . " The quad core arms race is ridiculous , " said Woodman . Instead , he explained how Windows Phone devices like the Nokia Lumia 800 are able to run fast without using battery sucking quad core innards . Microsoft has even gone as far as handing out 100 ( 133 ) to anyone whose phone can beat a Windows Phone in a one on one user test during MWC .
