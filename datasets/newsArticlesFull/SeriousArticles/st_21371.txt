Carson confirmed to CBS on Wednesday that he still believes this , but I ' m not sure why this is such a big story . Before Wednesday , we knew that Carson takes the Bible literally . After Wednesday , we knew the exact same thing . Frankly , I don ' t care whether the president believes the pyramids were built by Joseph , aliens or the Egyptians themselves levitating the stones into place . What matters are the president ' s ideas ? ? and that ' s where the focus should be with Carson , since it ' s clear he has no idea what he ' s talking about .
