Forte , set to turn 30 in December , is still playing at a high level , too , bucking a trend for running backs . He ranks sixth in the NFL with 507 rushing yards and has also added 21 catches for another 191 yards . Chicago does not look all that much like a potential playoff contender , though , something that has unfortunately been true for the majority of Forte ' s career he ' s played in only two postseason games . This is the final year of his contract with the Bears , and it seems like a pretty decent bet that he ' ll be playing elsewhere next season .
