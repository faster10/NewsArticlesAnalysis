I do not forecast an apocalypse , just a slow descent into controlled speech alien to the British tradition . It may be humanely directed , but the ultimate price of a statutory backstop to regulation of the newspaper industry is a docile press . Far better to cherish raucous , impertinent journalism that can speak truth to power on behalf of its readers and entertain them enough to secure their loyalty . A few individuals who already have our collective sympathy and who have received or will receive richly deserved compensation might enjoy the spectacle of state sanctioned regulation . We would all be losers .
