The Bond franchise s disposable women are a wearisome tic , not just ? because of the rise of actresses such as Emily Blunt and Jennifer Lawrence as credible and compelling action heroines who could capably serve as Bond s ? colleagues , but also because the franchise ? itself has demonstrated what it s able to do when Bond gets a sparring partner like Vesper Lynd ( Eva Green in Casino Royale ) . But this trope looks especially stupid in a movie where the emotional climax is built on the idea that Bond has deep and enduring connections with the women he truly loves , among them Vesper and M , who died in Casino Royale and Skyfall , respectively .
