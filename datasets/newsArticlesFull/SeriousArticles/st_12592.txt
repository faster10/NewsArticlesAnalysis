You ' d never know it today , but the estate ' s historic 1912 wing , originally christened Villa Crawford for its first owner , fell into serious decay and was boarded up for many years . That is until 1990 , when Sir Bernard Ashley ( the widower of famed designer Laura Ashley ) bought the 600 acre manor with the intention of turning it into a " country house hotel " fit for a king . His subsequent 25 million makeover both modernized and upgraded the property , while maintaining its fundamental structure and design , and then he added antiques and artworks throughout from his own private collection .
