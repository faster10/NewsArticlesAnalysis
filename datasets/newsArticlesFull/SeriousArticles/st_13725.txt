Guys always try to pick apart a guy , like what makes him so good . He s just a football player . Throw the ball up to him covered , and he makes the catch . If that s because of his size , his speed , his hands , I don t know . I know he comes down with the catch , said safety Devin McCourty . I don t know exactly what makes him a really good player , but I know he goes out there each week and somehow makes game changing plays . We ve got to try to make sure that doesn t happen , because he can ruin the game for us defensively .
