I meet Kitching at his workshop near the London College of Communication . The smell of ink and metal hits you at the door , growing stronger as you move closer to the intimidating printing press in the back . Prints of his work eye popping text images in rainbow hues hang from the walls , the ceiling , a drying line . The hundreds of typeface alphabets he ' s made and amassed over the years ( the largest collection in Europe ) , from indecipherably small metal nubs to wooden letters the size of a man ' s forearm , are filed away in stacked tiers , and leaned against walls . His only computer is a first generation MacBook he uses to check emails .
