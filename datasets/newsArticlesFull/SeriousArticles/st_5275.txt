On what he s seen from K . J . Wright and if it s as good as he has seen him play : I would agree . K . J . Wright has always played very , very good football . It s nothing to say that he s playing his best football now , to say he s drastically improved . He s always been a very , very good football player . I think this year , he s just playing mistake free . He s not missing tackles , he s playing in the backfield , he s sniffing out screens , something he s done phenomenally well his entire career . Hopefully he can get recognized , more people will see it . The same can be said for a kicker Steven Hauschka . A kicker is playing great football and I don t know what you have to do to get special teams player of the week , but he s kicked them from 50 plus a few times , I think he s four for four 50 plus and I don t think anyone else in the league has done that yet . You don t see him getting very much recognition , but here s me saying those two guys are playing very good football right now .
