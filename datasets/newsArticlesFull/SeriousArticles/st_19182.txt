It ' s too soon for that , though for now , there ' s a new summer of one nighters stretching out ahead . Backstage in Fort Myers we ate a cafeteria style dinner I sat with Randell Kirsch , a Beach Boys guitarist with whom I spent 15 summers on the road while he and I were touring with Jan and Dean . He told me that at a television studio in California recently he had shared a similar commissary meal with astronaut Buzz Aldrin . " We talked about the moon , spirituality and surf music , " Randell said . That is one of the many unlikely places that singing the songs of summer can take a person : to the side of a man who walked upon the surface of the moon .
