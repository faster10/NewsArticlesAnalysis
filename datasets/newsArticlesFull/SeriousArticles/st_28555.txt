I d do a bit more of everything : Apply more pressure on our Sunni allies to join the anti ISIS fight with troops on the ground call on the Saudis and other Sunnis to loudly delegitimize ISIS deploy more USA and NATO Special Forces make clear to Iran that we might have to put the nuclear deal on hold if Iran is not a more constructive partner in Iraq and Syria and stress that while we know that the violent jihadis are a minority among Muslims , the notion that they re a totally separate and distinct group is not true . So Americans of good will should condemn anyone at home who uses these tragic terrorist events to build political capital by demonizing Islam itself , as though all Muslims are now suspect .
