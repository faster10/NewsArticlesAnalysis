Most Americans who are unfamiliar with the border don ' t realize that , under normal circumstances ( and we ' re a long way from there ) , Border Patrol agents don ' t just keep away uninvited visitors . They also act as a deterrent to the host of street crimes that bad guys might engage in along the border that has nothing to do with immigrants : drug dealing , shootouts , robbery , sexual assault , cartels raiding stash houses and stealing from one another , etc . That is what is going on at our back door as we speak . It ' s total mayhem .
