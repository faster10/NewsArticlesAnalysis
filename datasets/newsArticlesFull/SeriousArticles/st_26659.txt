Views : Night has fallen , and so has the temperature , but the adventure is just beginning . For a breathtaking view of the surroundings , take the fast elevator up to the Signature Room at the 95th in the John Hancock building ( 875 N . Michigan Ave . ) and ponder the panoramic scenery over cocktails and snacks in the lounge on the 96th floor . The Chicago area is so flat that you can see for miles : endless rows of streetlights extending into the horizon . A chocolate martini and a view like that go well together .
