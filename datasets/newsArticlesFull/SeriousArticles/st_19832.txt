At that point , I wasn ' t as committed to the Beatles as my sister and her friends were even before the movie started . But after it was over , all of us were so wired by what we ' d seen that we wanted to run , goof and joke around all night long , even after two cars scooped us up to take us home . It was as if the movie and the Beatles themselves had given me permission to be as wise , foolish , daring , smart and alert to the world as I wanted to be . And I couldn ' t wait to see it again just to make sure I hadn ' t imagined it .
