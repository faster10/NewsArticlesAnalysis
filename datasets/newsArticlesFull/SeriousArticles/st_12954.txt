Speaking of the front office , do you hear that noise coming from Jerry Jones ? Exactly . I wanted to talk about how Jerruh s been oddly muted during the first half of this season , except largely for earnest musings about how much he can t wait to see his full arsenal back on the field . The deft touch displayed during the draft has paid off well , as Dallas now appears to have an embarrassment of riches on the offensive line , which last season powered a team led by a healthy Romo to a 12 ? 4 record . Orlando Scandrick is better than anyone other than Orlando Scandrick expected him to become . Jones appears to be , quietly , running a football team rather than lording over an entertainment empire .
