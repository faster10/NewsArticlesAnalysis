That was the case in a 2010 chain reaction accident near Gray Summit , Missouri . During the 11 minutes prior to that incident , the driver of a pickup truck received five text messages , and sent six , and he was seen leaning over just before the accident , leading investigators to believe the driver was likely distracted when his truck plowed at 55 mph into the rear of a tractor trailer , which had slowed or stopped because of a highway work zone . Two school buses then plowed into the wreckage . Two people including the pickup truck driver and a bus occupant were killed 38 other people were injured .
