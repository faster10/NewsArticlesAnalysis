I think when you look at the arenas where Saudi Arabia and Iran are in conflict , whether Syria or Bahrain or Lebanon or Yemen or Iraq , Iran has an upper hand . When you look at it in a broader regional context , the increasing prevalence of sectarianism benefits Saudi Arabia because they have more numbers . Eighty five percent of the region s Muslims are Sunni . For the Saudis , if sectarian politics outweigh anti imperialist politics , that is beneficial . But at the same time , we are not talking about a Saudi government run by Wahhabi Kissingers or Brzezinskis . This government does not have a deep bench of strategic thinkers . They are not playing a game of chess .
