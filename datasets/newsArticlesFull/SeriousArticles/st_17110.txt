Tying Swift with seven nominations , R B singer The Weeknd crowns his breakout 2015 with nods for album ( Beauty Behind the Madness ) and record of the year ( Can ' t Feel My Face ) , as well as three for Fifty Shades of Grey anthem Earned It . The Weeknd has been nominated once before ( in 2014 , for Wiz Khalifa collaboration Remember You ) , but his strong showing this year only solidifies his status as a bona fide pop star . Still , his plaudits as a relative newcomer aren ' t unprecedented : Sam Smith ( In the Lonely Hour ) , Macklemore Ryan Lewis ( The Heist ) and Frank Ocean ( Channel Orange ) all earned album nods for their debuts .
