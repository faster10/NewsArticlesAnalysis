The previous paragraph was not the most scintillating I ve ever written , but it is accurate . I m not particularly proud of it , but it does fulfill one of my responsibilities as a journalist , which is to tell you the differences between the candidates . Of the three politicians involved , Bush has been most honorable and consistent ? and he has gotten clobbered for it , mostly by Trump , but also by Cruz , who goes around shouting amnesty as if it were not an occasional American immigration tradition , last exercised by , uh , Ronald Reagan .
