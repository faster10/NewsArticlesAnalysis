We need accountability for all officers involved that sends a message that this type of brutality is unacceptable and the lives of people of color are equally valued . Systemic cultural and substantive policy changes in police departments particularly in New York are needed to ensure black and brown communities are not targeted with overly aggressive , discriminatory " broken windows policing " and " stop and frisk " policies that promote brutality and violence . Officers should work to understand the communities they work in , not criminalize them .
