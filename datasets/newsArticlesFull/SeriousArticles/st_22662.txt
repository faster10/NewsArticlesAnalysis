1 . " Rob " ( CBS : 12 million viewers , 3 . 7 adults 18 49 rating ) : A 3 . 7 ? If NBC had a freshman comedy with a 3 . 7 average , it would run the show five nights a week this fall ( " Community " was renewed with almost half this rating ) . Bully for CBS that their table scraps have these kind of numbers . The issue here was Rob Schneider ' s comedy was shedding too much of its massive " Big Bang Theory " lead in , and was trending the wrong direction . CBS suspects the time slot can do better .
