Detroit Lions : It would be stunning to see Bob Quinn bring in Manziel , especially since Quinn said at his first news conference that he wanted the Lions ' culture to be one of great work ethic and no egos . We will create a working class attitude throughout the organization . Everything Manziel has shown so far in his two seasons in the league has run counter to that attitude . Plus , the Lions have their starting quarterback in Matthew Stafford . And while it wouldn ' t hurt to bring someone in to push Stafford , Manziel would seem to be the antithesis of the guy they would want to have as Stafford ' s No . 2 . Of course , Quinn has no track record to speak of as a GM , so never say never , but it would be shocking to see him pull this move . Michael Rothstein
