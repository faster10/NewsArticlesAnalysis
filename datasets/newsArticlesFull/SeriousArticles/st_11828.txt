This next turn in the story may come as a surprise to you , but when a home lacks running water , the government can and regularly does condemn the property or deem it uninhabitable . You may think that this would never happen in America , but many people in the Flint area were forced out of their homes over the last few years for this very same reason . In several instances , it happened at apartment complexes where water bills were included in the monthly rent of each unit . These renters were current in their rent payments , but the property management companies failed to pay the municipality for the water which caused the water for the entire complex to be shut off . These residents did nothing wrong , but in the government ' s eyes , the law is the law . In these instances , every resident in these apartment complexes was evicted .
