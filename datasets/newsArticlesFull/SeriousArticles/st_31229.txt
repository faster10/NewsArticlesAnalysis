That ' s a convenient way to look at the Eagles ' defensive shortcomings , but not an entirely accurate one . This was a team that was gashed for 204 rushing yards in a game at Carolina that started the current stretch of four losses in five games . The 411 yards Dallas put up with Matt Cassel at quarterback represented the second highest total by the Cowboys during Tony Romo ' s absence . And , of course , when the Eagles needed late game stops in Atlanta and Washington earlier this season , the defense came up short .
