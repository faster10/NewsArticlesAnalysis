Trump is oblivious to this for a good reason . His unapologetic race baiting is a big part of what rocket launched him to the front of the GOP presidential pack and at a couple of points when he slid a bit , launched him right back to the front . The race baiting is hardly new . The instant a multi million dollar settlement was announced in 2014 with the five young African American and Latino youths falsely convicted and imprisoned for assault and rape of a jogger in New York ' s Central Park in 1989 , Trump loudly ranted against the settlement and did everything possible to whip up another round of racial hysteria over the case . And why not ? When the case broke in 1989 he shelled out 85 , 000 to four newspapers to splash an ad demanding the death penalty for the five . The toss of the case and the overwhelming evidence that the men were innocent meant nothing to Trump .
