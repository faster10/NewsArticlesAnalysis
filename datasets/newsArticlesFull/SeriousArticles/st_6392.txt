A : Nothing indicates that faulty work was done following an incident in 2001 in which the tail of the Airbus A321 200 hit the runway . But investigators will be looking into it . If cracks in the tail section were not properly repaired , they could have grown over time and led to a tear under pressure . Jets go through a heavy maintenance check every few years that should have spotted such issues . If the tail were to be lost in flight , pilots would have little control over the jet . In 1985 , a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 had an explosive decompression that led to a crash killing 520 people . Investigators eventually blamed the crash on prior faulty repairs .
