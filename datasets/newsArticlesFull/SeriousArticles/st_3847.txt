" 21 and Over " ( CinemaScore : B ) had a 9 million opening weekend in 2 , 771 locations , with a 3 , 248 per screen average . Directed by first time directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore , Relativity ' s 13 million party movie should be able to make back its budget , but it is surely disappointing that the film came in at less than half of " Project X ' s " opening weekend . " Project X " dropped off 47 percent in its second weekend , and , if " 21 and Over " follows that trend , it will at least slide past the 13 million mark .
