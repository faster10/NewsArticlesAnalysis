WC : For almost five years I worked on a show where we kind of looked at the way the news cycle becomes this sort of feeding frenzy for the story that may not be the best story but the story that gets the most views . And in that interview with Maron I was talking about something that was a real and personal thing that got cannibalized into something that could be click bait . And so I think if anything it was for me this almost like ' oh right , this is what happens . ' It wasn ' t a thing I was talking about with the thought that it would hit the news cycle . The amount of people that actually listened to that Maron interview versus the people who just kind of sort of just took an opinion without actually hearing the word , it felt like people were just kind of making a headline versus actually listening to what I was talking about laughs . It felt like , yeah , there ' s a drama that is trying to be created here that didn ' t exist .
