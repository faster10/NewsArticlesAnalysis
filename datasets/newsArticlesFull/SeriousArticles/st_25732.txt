Rushdie : Well , of course it ' s challenging , but , you know , all writing is challenging . Writing is difficult one should just say that . What I found interesting writing a screenplay as opposed to writing a novel is not the obvious thing , which is having to pare everything down and find the kind of essence , the skeleton if you like , which can then be fleshed out by performance and cinematography . That , of course , you have to do . But I think the thing that ' s really different and very interesting is that when you ' re writing for the screen , you have to be hyper conscious every moment of how the audience is going to react . If you write just one scene where the audience is confused or it breaks their concentration in some way , then you ' ve lost them , and you might never get them back . You ' re really thinking all the time of what you have to do to make sure that they have the information that they need , that the emotional thread is not snapped , that the story moves at the right speed , to keep the audience hopefully sitting on the edge of their seats or else weeping or laughing . Any of those is good .
