Members of law enforcement are supposed to take special care of juvenile and mentally challenged suspects such as Dassey . But on video , the detectives deviated from the Reid Technique , giving him specific information he may not have known , telling him they already knew he was guilty and promising help if he confessed . Only police knew that Halbach had been shot in the head , Drizin said . If Dassey corroborated that evidence , they would know he was at the scene of the crime . The general questions , however , became more specific over time and the detectives finally asked him outright who shot her in the head . Dassey said his uncle had done it .
