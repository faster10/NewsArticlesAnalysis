In limited release , two films stood out . After being available on demand for a three weeks , Lars Von Trier ' s " Melancholia " still debuted with a solid 265 , 000 out of 19 theaters , leading to a 13 , 947 per theater average . Meanwhile , Emilio Estevez ' s directorial effort " The Way " has quietly hiked all the way to 2 . 6 million over six weeks ( 334 , 000 from 171 locations this weekend ) , despite never playing in more than 283 theaters . The Martin Sheen drama is clearly experiencing good word of mouth on a small scale , so it will be interesting to see if " The Way " ' s distributor , Producer ' s Distribution Agency , pushes the film any harder in an effort to garner awards attention .
