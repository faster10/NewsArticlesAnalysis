Our Multitasking test provides a good glimpse of overall application performance under a typical workload . The Pavilion Media Center m8120n ' s showing on this test is particularly impressive when you consider that it easily outpaces a Gateway PC that costs a few hundred more . While Dell ' s original XPS 710 cost nearly five times more than the m8210n when we reviewed it in November 2006 , it ' s used here by comparison to show what the scores of an overclocked , high end , quad core gaming PC look like . Also note that the Dell XPS 710 was running Windows XP , which isn ' t nearly as demanding as Vista .
