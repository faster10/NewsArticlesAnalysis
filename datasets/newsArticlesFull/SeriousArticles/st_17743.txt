For the same reasons I love the " It ' s a Small World " ride at Disney , I always look forward to watching the Miss Universe contest . It ' s a kitschy , utopian universe where countries are supposed to set aside their petty rivalries and hatreds and pretend to be BFFs . Critics can dismiss it as a sexualized hybrid of the United Nations and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue . But for the three hours the contestants stand on stage , it doesn ' t matter how big their country ' s army is , the size of the nation ' s gross national product , or whether it has nuclear weapons .
