When Rezaian , a 39 year old dual Iranian and U . S . citizen born and raised in California , was seized in his home with his Iranian wife , Yeganeh Salehi , on July 22 , 2014 , Iran had recently extended an interim agreement on its nuclear program with the United States . As the nuclear negotiations continued , Rezaian languished in Tehran ' s notorious Evin Prison . Judicial authorities repeatedly violated Iran ' s own laws by , among other things , holding the Post reporter for months often in solitary confinement before bringing charges , allowing him almost no pretrial contact with his defense lawyer , failing to inform him or his lawyer of the verdict or sentence after completion of a sham trial in August , and ignoring a deadline for release in the absence of a public conviction .
