Any rational person would have to agree that the world stands a better chance of effectively fighting IS together , than separately . Yet , given the political climate in the U . S . , with poisonous demagoguery being spewed from many of the Republican candidates for the presidency , and the current composition of the U . S . Congress , the chances of the U . S . joining forces with Russia to fight IS in Syria appears remote now . It would be even more so if one of those candidates were to assume the occupancy of the White House in a little over a year .
