Bloom shared some of his " fan mail " with media commentator Jim Romanesko , including this excerpt : " First I want to apologize for Iowans who may have threatened you . I am a dental student here at the university and grew up in a small Iowa town my whole life ( Palo ) before coming here . I agree that we have our problems as Iowans but one thing we are is fiercely loyal . Your article is true ( for the most part ) about rural Iowans but anyone from here , esp us city folk , are going to be upset by that stereotype . "
