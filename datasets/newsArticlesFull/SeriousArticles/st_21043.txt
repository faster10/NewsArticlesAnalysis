I m a Vikings fan recovering from another botched field goal that lost us another playoff game and I look at what Browns fans have put up with for the past 20 years and I SHUT my mouth . How an owner can be so short fused thinking that an NFL team can just turn things around with overall mediocre coaches and players , is absolute inexplicable . PLUS , who would really come into an organization with that much negative history and toxicity ? I feel for you guys and hope there s some sort of saving grace for you the fans and the team ? Good Luck
