Glass stewardship and then ownership of the Royals coincided with the Royals longest stretch of futility in franchise history , punctuated by four seasons in the space of five in which the team lost 100 games or more . If Kauffman had lived or Prentice took over that losing may have happened all the same , but Royals fans blamed Glass . And there was good reason to . He hired a series of inept executives to run the team on the cheap and allowed a franchise which was once considered to be the class of the American League to wither . Scouting operations were curtailed , international operations were cut and the team was seemingly run with an eye toward year by year profitability as opposed to winning or long term health . Over those same years the value of the team , like every other team , skyrocketed . Glass paid less than 100 million for the Royals in 2000 . They are now worth ? hundreds of millions .
