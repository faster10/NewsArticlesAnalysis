If you ' re a student , remember that it ' s not just joking around . Bullying people can damage them , and you , for life . Bullying is not just the mean things you do , it ' s all the nice things you don ' t do , like letting someone eat alone at lunch or ignoring people as if they ' re invisible . It doesn ' t take an overt act of cruelty to diminish someone ' s spirit . Simply never making the effort to include them in anything can be just as hurtful . Tomorrow at lunch , ask someone whom you wouldn ' t ordinarily reach out to to join your table .
