These baby rhinos are at an orphanage because their mothers were killed by poachers . I can t say where this is for obvious reasons . But I spent an afternoon with Petronel Nieuwoudt , who runs the orphanage . The youngest rhino was called Don . He was just two months old when he was found in Kruger national park . Petronel has students and volunteers from all over the world come to look after these orphans . They pay for this experience and that money is used for milk , food , fencing and rangers for security .
