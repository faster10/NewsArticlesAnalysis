Pittman : We don ' t compete with that . I think again you ' ve got to go back and look at what radio is . Radio is very different from someone ' s music collection , and the two have always co existed very well together . Your music collection is really where you curate music exactly for you at that moment you ' re living , and you don ' t want any interruptions . Radio is actually the exact opposite . Yes , we play music , ( but ) turning on the radio is like walking into your favorite bar where everybody knows you and you know them , and you say , " What ' s up ? " So we tell you about new music , we play new music , we ' ve got gossip , we ' ve got call ins , we ' ve got listeners on the air , we ' ve got contests , we ' ve got jokes . You hit your favorite personality who is really like your best friend .
