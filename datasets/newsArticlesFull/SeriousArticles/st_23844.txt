Small forward : We suggest adding the Sixers ' Robert Covington before he goes on a torrid shooting stretch . Covington was quietly top 10 in the NBA last season in 3 point field goals . An injury plagued start to the campaign has RC3 available in over 65 percent of ESPN leagues . . . . Jae Crowder leads the league in steals and continues to earn 30 minutes per night on a stable Celtics rotation . . . . The Pacers ' C . J . Miles is eligible at both shooting guard and small forward but is arguably best served at this more shallow position . Either way , versatile deployment only adds to Miles ' profile as a valuable source for 3 point production .
