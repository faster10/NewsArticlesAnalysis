However else Europeans celebrate the Yuletide season , Christmas still centers around an Advent market that , in most cases , has filled the square before the cathedral each December for hundreds upon hundreds of years . Many markets start on the Friday before Advent , which is four Sundays before Christmas Eve most end on December 24 , especially in Germanic countries , where Christmas Eve is set aside for trimming the tree at home . Others keep celebrating until Epiphany on January 6 . Travel Leisure . com : See Europe ' s best Christmas markets
