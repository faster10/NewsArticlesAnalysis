Most people launch mobile boutiques as faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional brick and mortar retail , said Jeanine Romo , who launched Le Fashion Truck with business partner Stacey Steffe in Los Angeles in 2010 . Usually , there ' s no lease involved and monthly expenses are lower than they would be to run a store . Before inventory , Le Fashion Truck ' s monthly costs run from 1 , 500 to 2 , 000 for generator , liability and auto insurance , cleaning supplies and storage rent , for starters . That pales in comparison to rent alone for a retail space , which could start at 7 , 000 in Los Angeles , Romo said .
