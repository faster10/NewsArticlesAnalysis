He thinks he s not being treated fairly . Really ? Donald Trump s not treated fairly by the press ? He consumes all the press . It s like he s a Stradivarius violinist from the Vienna symphony , man , Bush said . The press is just being played like nobody s business . Poor little Donald , being mistreated . If he s going to be mistreated now , what will happen ? Barack Obama doesn t go on Fox either , so they have that in common . And now he s not going to be treated fairly , well how do you think the general election will work out , or dealing with Putin or dealing with the challenges of being president . That notion just doesn t pass muster , it just doesn t make any sense .
