LEAVE DAVID HASSELHOFF ALONE ? Lifeguards Get Pensions ? At Age 45 ? They Do in Atlantic City , by Bloomberg s Romy Varghese : It s one of those relics from the lavish and loud Prohibition era Atlantic City depicted in television and film . Despite just a four month beach season and a battered casino industry , lifeguards who work 20 years , the last 10 of them consecutively , still qualify at age 45 for pensions equal to half their salaries . When they die , the payments continue to their dependents Kevin Lavin , the emergency manager appointed by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to stabilize the finances of the city of 39 , 000 , has cited lifeguard pensions as a possible item for shared sacrifice in a community already forced to fire workers and raise taxes . He intends to reveal more about his plans in a report that could come as early as this week . http : bloom . bg 1klWJKb
