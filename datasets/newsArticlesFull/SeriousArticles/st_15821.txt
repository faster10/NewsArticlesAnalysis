What the win means for Ole Miss : For one thing , this keeps the Rebels ( 8 3 , 5 2 SEC ) alive in the SEC West race . Going into the final game of the season , Ole Miss can still win the division if it beats Mississippi State and Auburn beats Alabama . It s an unlikely outcome , but the Rebels are still alive , mathematically . Credit Kelly for cleaning up his play lately . This is his second straight game without an interception , after he tossed at least one pick in seven in a row . That will serve the Rebels well if he can keep it up next week against State .
