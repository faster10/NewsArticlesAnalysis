For the new , rebooted Spectre , they ' ve dispensed with the acronym , but kept the cloak and dagger methodology . The organization ' s enigmatic leader Oberhauser is played by Christoph Waltz , whose true identity probably won ' t come as a surprise to anyone following the series for awhile , but since the creatives are intent on doing the J . J . Abrams " mystery box " thing a la Star Trek Into Darkness , I won ' t reveal that here . Waltz is an interesting choice , though he comes off more spritely than sinister , and an attempt to give his character depth by tying him into Bond ' s backstory mostly falls flat due to our unfamiliarity with both the character and the backstory .
