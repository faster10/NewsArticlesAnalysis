Inspired by Bowie s music , British musician and producer Mark Reeder moved to West Berlin at the end of the Seventies : You know , he presented this single Heroes , his first track on his friend Marc Bolan s TV show . And it was like , I saw this TV show and I was at home watching this and I just couldn t believe this . What is this new David Bowie song ? It sounded completely different to anything else , explains Mark Reeder . And you know , the actual period of David Bowie living here , working here , making three albums , set a kind of precedent for other artists . It meant something to come to Berlin at that time , you came to Berlin to have your Berlin period .
