The AKP has been in a strong position since 2002 because Turkey has voted for centre right parties in elections since 1950 . But in the past there have been other power centres which prevented it exercising complete authority . Many liberals and secularists saw the rise of the AKP as a welcome democratic alternative to a system in which the army and the judiciary repeatedly intervened . Many of these are now blaming themselves as useful idiots who have facilitated the AKP s path towards a monopoly of power . One said just before the latest election that we thought the AKP wanted to change the state , not take it over . ?
