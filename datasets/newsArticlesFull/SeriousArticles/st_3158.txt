New York Times columnist David Brooks writes this morning that the campaign is still in the casual attention stage and compared it to a recent rug shopping experience he had ? a very Trump like pink rug temporarily caught Brooks eye until a subtler and more prosaic blue rug grabbed center stage . Weekly Standard editor William Kristol also urges the jittery to calm down , writing that while Trump has defied gravity so far , it s hard to believe that , as voting gets closer , his support will go up rather than down . Of course , that s coming from the same guy who said almost exactly nine years ago that Barack Obama is not going to beat Hillary Clinton in a single democratic primary . I ll predict that right now .
