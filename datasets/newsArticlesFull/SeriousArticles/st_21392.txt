This is the mercilessly repetitive and equally catchy first single off Anti , so if you re reading this , then chancers are you ve already heard Rihanna repeat the word work a few hundred times already . I still don t think this is Drake and RiRi s best collaboration ( it s hard to compete with What s My Name ? and Take Care ) , nor is it the best song on the album , but this Boi 1da ? produced single is growing on me . One important thing to realize : Unlike most previous Rihanna singles , this one s appeal is less about the hooks and more about all the vocoder assisted things that Rihanna does with her voice . ( Has Rihanna been listening more to Young Thug ? )
