The Clippers choose to trap with Paul and DeAndre Jordan , and when Curry dumps the ball off to a rolling Green , the Clippers three defenders behind the action must rotate . Paul Pierce is a bit slow to pick up Green in the lane . Blake Griffin pinches down to pick up Barnes , which leaves Jamal Crawford on Thompson , with an open Iguodala in the right corner . With Paul essentially out of the play after the pick , Clippers ' defensive maven Lawrence Frank screams to Crawford to sink low . Meanwhile , Barnes has screened Griffin beneath the basket and effectively kept him from fighting his way back to Iguodala . Not that it matters . Thompson points to Iguodala , who has set up a chaise lounge in the right corner , not a defender within eight feet .
