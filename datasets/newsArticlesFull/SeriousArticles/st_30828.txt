Stewart gritted his way through for 106 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries . Before the ankle issue , Stewart busted a 59 yard run on the game ' s opening play highlighted by left guard Andrew Norwell blocking three Seahawks defenders to pave the way . Stewart isn ' t the only threat to the NFL ' s No . 2 rushing attack as the Cardinals also must account for dual threat quarterback Cam Newton .
