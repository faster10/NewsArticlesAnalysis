LePage ' s spokesperson defended his boss by saying race was " irrelevant " and Mr LePage did not make comments about race . What he said was relevant was the cost to ME taxpayers for welfare and the costs emotionally for the kids who were born out of a relationship with a drug trafficker .

Some say that ' s because the face of addiction in America today , particularly when it comes to heroin , is increasingly white .
