There are two complaints I hear most often from people who are already poised to dismiss Bradford : that he is " the same Sam Bradford he always was , " which involves quoting his passer and QB rankings for those bad Rams teams , with no acknowledgment that Bradford actually was playing well in 2013 , before his first ACL injury and " he throws too many interceptions , " even though the same stats from St . Louis show a much lower career interception rate than Bradford has compiled this season . So , the bad stats from St . Louis are telling but the good ones mean nothing .
