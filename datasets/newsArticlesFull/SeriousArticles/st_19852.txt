The depth of the Republican problem was made evident by polling published since Trump ' s most recent pronouncement . On December 9th , a Bloomberg Purple Strategies poll suggested that Trump ' s temporary ban on Muslim immigration was supported by 65 of likely Republican primary voters , and that 37 of respondents suggested that his proposal made them more likely to vote for him , while only 16 indicated that the proposal would make them less likely to vote for him . Then , the next day , a CBS News New York Times poll taken from December 4th through 8th days both before and after Trump initially made his comments showed him with 35 support among national Republican primary voters up 13 points since its last poll in October and a 19 point lead over second place Ted Cruz . Most notable about the CBS News poll was their observation that Trump ' s support was 30 before his comments on Muslim immigration , and jumped to 38 after the comments .
