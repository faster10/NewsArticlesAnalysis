Trust is the operative word there . For all quarterbacks in the NFL , trust with receivers is imperative . But it is even more so in the complex New England offense . The Patriots playbook is notoriously difficult for receivers to grasp ? ? not because of the breadth of different plays that they run , but rather because one particular play can have multiple different variations . Sight adjustments , route conversions , hot routes ? Brady and his receivers all have to be on the same page , and they have to do so without telling each other exactly what page that is . They have to get to the line of scrimmage , scan a defense , and see the exact same thing . Is there tight press coverage or is the corner playing off ? Is there going to be a linebacker blitz ? Are the safeties in single high or cover two ? Are they rolling toward one side of the field ?
