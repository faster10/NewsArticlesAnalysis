Officials at Conservative Solutions Project deny that the organization is supporting Rubio ' s presidential candidacy . " Conservative Solutions Project , as a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , is not about any one specific elected official or candidate , " spokesman Jeff Sadosky told NBC News . " It ' s focused on issue education and helping the conservative movement most effectively communicate with American families so that we win the battle of ideas and are able to enact conservative solutions to the problems they face . " A spokesperson for Rubio ' s presidential campaign declined to comment . ( Campaigns are barred from strategizing with 501c4s and super PACs . ) Yet there are some clear ties between Conservative Solutions and efforts to benefit Rubio ' s presidential candidacy including 1 ) that Rubio is the only 2016er featured in the group ' s TV ads , 2 ) that the group shares staff with the pro Rubio Super PAC , and 3 ) that at least two advertising filings with the FCC appear to show Conservative Solutions Project ' s advertising being on behalf of Rubio ' s behalf .
