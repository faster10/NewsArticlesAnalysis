Then again , don ' t imagine . Watch any vintage black and white video excerpt from " Your Show of Shows " ( 1951 1954 ) or " Caesar ' s Hour " ( 1954 1957 ) . You ' ll see Caesar in sketches where his characters speak a faux foreign dialect that , though it ' s gibberish in at least two languages , makes hilarious sense throughout . You ' ll see his big fleshy face in tight close up forcing tears out of his eyes as the fiscally challenged suburban husband whose wife just charged a mink coat to his account . Watch the contortions he puts himself through as he plays a frantically reluctant featured guest on a spoof of the " This is Your Life " TV show .
