3 . Bills at Eagles , Sunday , 1 : 00 , O U 47 : How important is volume in a fantasy quarterback ? Tyrod Taylor ( 33 ) is averaging 27 passes per game . I know , he runs , too . So let s give him his six rushes per game , too . That s 33 touches . That s not enough . Buffalo is 25th in plays from scrimmage and goes three and out way too much ( league worst 27 . 7 percent of drives ) . But Taylor has scored points , I know . I still firmly believe that volume is more predictive than points scored . Though it s only fair that I note that Taylor s efficiency has been good . But bottom line , he s just too volatile for a fantasy playoff game . I d play a higher floor guy on waiver wires in many leagues over him : Ryan Fitzpatrick ( 31 ) . I don t try to win games with my quarterback as I try not to lose them there .
