Liverpool 3 3 AC Milan ( aet : Liverpool 3 2 on pens ) , Istanbul , May 25 , 2005 Liverpool ' s players were stunned when they trudged off at half time , but not as stunned as Milan ' s were the best part of two hours later . All bets were off after goals from Paolo Maldini and Hernan Crespo ( 2 ) gave Milan a 3 0 interval lead . All except spread bets on the margin of Liverpool ' s defeat , that is . But it all changed after a tactical masterclass from Rafa Benitez , who replaced full back Steve Finnan with midfielder Dietmar Hamman , switched to a 3 5 2 formation and saw the seemingly impossible begin to unfold . Steven Gerrard , Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso forced extra time , and Liverpool pulled off the comeback to end them all by holding their nerve in the penalty shoot out .
