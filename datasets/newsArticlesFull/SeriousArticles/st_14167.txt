Yeah , I remember that point , ? Djokovic ? said . I thought I m going to end up the point with a smash , but it didn t happen . ? His defense was terrific that point . After it was done , I had to just forget about it and focus on the next point . Managed to return two very good returns and pass him on the net . That was a crucial break . ? I know that if I drop my level or concentration or allow myself to get distracted by anything that he would take the first opportunity , jump on me , and just take the lead of the rallies . That ' s what he has done in the third .
