Florence and the Machine ' s second album is as dark , robust and romantic as ever , but a revving 18 wheeler is no longer the apt metaphor for Welch ' s voice . Listen to her hooting and growling on " Only If for a Night , " a ballad somewhere between classic soul and midnight on the moors English art rock . Listen to " Shake It Out , " a treatise on heartbreak and spiritual rebirth . " I am done with my graceless heart So tonight I ' m gonna cut it out and then restart , " she cries , over guitars and keyboards that heave and chime . This is the sound of a human turbine a wind machine .
