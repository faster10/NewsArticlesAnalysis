A chief concern of the Brits is welfare benefits for EU migrants . Cameron wants EU migrants to have to live in Britain for a minimum of four years before being able to receive tax credits or child benefits . Tusk s proposal would allow the British to put a temporary emergency break on these benefits if there were an exceptionally large number of new migrants , though it s not clear for how long . Cameron also wants to ban foreign workers from sending child benefits to children back in their home countries . Tusk didn ' t agree to this , but his proposal would allow workers from lower income countries to be paid less in benefits .
