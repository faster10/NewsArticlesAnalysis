This month Wall has reemerged on both sides of the ball after a late November slump . In two of his past five games , he s had at least 25 points , 10 assists and 5 steals , which is tied for the most such games in the NBA this season ( Russell Westbrook ) . Wall , ranked third in steals , will be facing a Houston defense that allows the second most points off turnovers ( 19 . 6 ) and allows the second most points in transition ( 19 . 9 ) , according to the NBA ' s SportVU data . Wall also thrives on the break this season . According to SportVU , Wall averages 6 . 2 points on transition plays , third most among NBA players with at least 25 plays in transition . I expect Wall to get plenty of opportunities to make plays in the open court tonight .
