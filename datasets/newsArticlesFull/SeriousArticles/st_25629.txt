So the use of " hard power " in Syria would be limited to punishment strikes on the grounds that " something must be done . " Such strikes would begin to degrade the Assad regime ' s military infrastructure and discourage it from using chemical weapons but would probably not tip the military balance decisively . And they may become politically unavoidable if the U . N . inspectors who have gone to Ghouta find irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons killed hundreds of people last week . They would also be welcomed by the regime ' s opponents in the hope that more would follow . But they would be a metaphoric slap on the wrist . There is no " exit " or " end " strategy in such strikes , and it seems likely that hardline Islamist groups would be best placed to take advantage of a weakening al Assad regime .
