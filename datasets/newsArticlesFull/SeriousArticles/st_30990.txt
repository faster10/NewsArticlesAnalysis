To reach the World Series ? the first time since 1973 for the Mets , ' 75 for the Red Sox ? both teams had to survive unforgettable battles in their respective LCS matchups . New York won Game 3 against Houston on a walk off home run , Game 5 on a 12th inning single and Game 6 by erasing a three run ? ninth inning deficit and going ahead for good in the 16th . Boston , meanwhile , was down three runs heading to the ninth inning of Game 5 against the Angels before a pair of two run homers , by Don Baylor and Dave Henderson ? the latter coming with two outs and two strikes ? gave them new life . The Red Sox won that game and cruised to a pair of wins back at Fenway Park to reach the World Series , where they hoped to win the franchise ' s first title in 68 years .
