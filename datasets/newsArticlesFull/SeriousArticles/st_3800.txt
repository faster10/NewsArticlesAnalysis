Blake Bortles vs . Colts : The Colts just gave up 364 yards and four touchdowns to Ben Roethlisberger , Antonio Brown , and Martavis Bryant last week . They ve been bad against the pass all season with no pass rush and top CB Vontae Davis not playing up to the level he was at the previous couple years . Indianapolis has surrendered the fourth most passing yards , fifth most touchdowns , and fifth most fantasy points to quarterbacks . Bortles is coming off his best game of his career after lighting up the Titans for 322 yards and five touchdowns in a narrow shootout . Allen Robinson is an elite WR1 , and Allen Hurns has been cleared to return from his concussion . The trio of Bortles Robinson Hurns continues to be underrated in fantasy , and the spot couldn t get much better at home in sunny Jacksonville . Of course , Bortles has let down in favorable spots before . In the Week 4 date with these same Colts , Bortles unloaded 50 pass attempts and threw for 298 yards .
