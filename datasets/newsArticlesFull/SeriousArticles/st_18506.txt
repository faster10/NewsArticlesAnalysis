After more than two years , the central purpose of military intervention in Syria has still not been clarified . Everyone now insists they are fighting Isis , but the US , Jordan and others intervened at the start in support of those opposing President Assad . Turkey eventually joined in , and chose primarily to attack Kurdish PKK forces . Russia s airstrikes have been intended to boost Assad as much as to push back Isis . Where will any UK airstrikes fit in ? Whose war will we actually be fighting ?
