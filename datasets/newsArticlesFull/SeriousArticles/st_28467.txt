Given how the season has gone , it s completely understandable why coach Tom Coughlin bypassed a field goal with a 20 10 lead with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter . He s seen enough to know that SCORING POSSESSIONS have become more of a factor in his team s losses than actual points because of the Giants inability to control the clock via the running game . Along those lines , a 10 point margin is virtually the same as a 13 point margin . You can still get beat with TWO scoring drives . However , even the Jets would admit that a 17 point deficit would have sealed the game because THREE scoring drives would have been too much to accomplish with the time remaining .
