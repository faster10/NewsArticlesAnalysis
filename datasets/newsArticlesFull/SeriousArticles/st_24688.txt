" Smart and effective immigration enforcement relies on setting priorities for removal and executing on those priorities , " said agency Director John Morton . " These year end totals indicate that we are making progress , with more convicted criminals , recent border crossers , egregious immigration law violators and immigration fugitives being removed from the country than ever before . Though we still have work to do , this progress is a testament to the hard work and dedication of thousands of ICE agents , officers and attorneys around the country . "
