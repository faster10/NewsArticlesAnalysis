Branson : Well I suspect the fact that at age 13 I ' m writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money , and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students . And I managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said " Look , you ' re either going to have to do your school work or your magazine , " that I said " Well , goodbye . I ' m off to do the magazine , but thanks very much . "
