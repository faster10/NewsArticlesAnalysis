What happened in Toronto , happened in Toronto , Cueto said through Grifol . That s over with . We re here in the World Series . The bowling alley is still there , but there s nothing in the back but old bowling balls and old pins there , I think . He outpitched both Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in Los Angeles , and he ll be the top pitcher in this World Series . Johnny Cueto will start Game 2 and that means he will be slotted for Game 6 if needed . The Royals play a brand of baseball that has certainly worked in the postseason over the last two seasons , but they are running into a buzzsaw with New York s young pitching , and not even the voodoo magic of Ned Yost can defeat dominant pitching when it is right .
