Cleveland Cavaliers ( 53 29 ) : ? Let ' s be honest , if they had been fit during the playoffs the Cavs would have won it all . Take nothing away from the Warriors , but Cleveland didn ' t have that bit of luck everyone needs to win it all . If Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love can return to full health and LeBron James can be LeBron James , things are looking rosy . They paid overs to re sign Tristan Thompson , but what ' s 82 million when you have a happy LeBron ? When you have support players like Timofey Mozgov , Iman Shumpert , Mo Williams , JR Smith and Australian Matthew Dellavedova , what ' s not to be happy about .
