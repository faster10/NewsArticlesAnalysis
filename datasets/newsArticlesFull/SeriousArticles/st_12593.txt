Flush with riches from iron ore mining enterprises in Michigan and Wisconsin , Mary Hayes Chynoweth and her two sons had this expansive Mediterranean triple residence built in the early 1900s . The City of San Jose purchased the manse in 1985 and later turned it into a conference center , adding the 214 guestrooms now available for nightly guests . Take the self guided walking tour of the property ( pamphlets are available ) and you ' ll spy historic photos and visit various rooms where the family once dined , entertained , slept and attended daily worship services .
