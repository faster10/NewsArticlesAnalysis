" You get more than just a coach , " said former Bengals wide receiver Chad Johnson , who played under Jackson . " Hue Jackson is a gem . He was a gem for me and I am speaking gem , g e m . He was a gem for me in really allowing me to see the game of football differently when he was in Cincinnati . Allowing me to flourish as a receiver . I know in Cleveland things didn ' t go as well as everyone would like . With Hue coming on board , being able to get the maximum amount of potential out of each player is what I know is going to happen because he was able to do it with me . I am sure he will be able to do it with them . "
