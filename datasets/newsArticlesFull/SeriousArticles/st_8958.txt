When you re hot , you re hot as the saying goes , and at this stage in the game at least , there seems to be nothing Trump can do that doesn t reinforce the message that has got him this far , even as his rivals can t seem to help also reinforcing that message each time they mention him . Let me say : I m a maniac , ran Ted Cruz s meticulously planned reference to absent enemies . And everyone on this stage is stupid , fat and ugly . And Ben , you re a terrible surgeon . A putdown so obviously appreciated by the other candidates that it suggested the camaraderie of weakness .
