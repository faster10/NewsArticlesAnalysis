The surrounding wine country makes this bucolic town a no brainer for romance with the added couples friendly enticements of dreamy hotels ( such as the rambling Spanish Mission style Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn Spa ) and a noted lack of kids . The foodie factor runs high , too , thanks to renowned restaurants ( such as French country The Girl the Fig ) and top notch farmers ' markets , like the Sonoma Valley Certified Farmers ' Market on Fridays . Readers also voted Sonoma into the top 10 for having quirky locals , a plus on any memorable weekend getaway .
