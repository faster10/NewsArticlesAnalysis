I feel obligated to begin by stating that I have no sympathy for a murderer of children , that I was horrified by such actions , and that I feel deeply for the Boston bombing ' s victims . I live in Boston and have written about the sense of solidarity Bostonians felt after the attack , and especially on the day we sat still so that suspects could be tracked and caught . I rooted for Tsarenaev ' s capture , and I hope the alleged killer spends a long time miserable in jail , after a fair trial , of course .
