To the members of these churches , I say this : just because one man or woman stands behind Trump , doesn ' t mean that you have to be obedient and follow them . Do you research and make your own decision in which you will vote to elect as President and perhaps you may want to reconsider your house of worship if these individuals are not helping your community as well as work on your spiritual walk . The choice is yours . Your vote is very powerful , don ' t sell it to someone who will sell you out .
