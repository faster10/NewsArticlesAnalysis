I wish someone , excuse the frankness here , would have the sack , would have the backbone to make unpopular comments , and when folks come out ? mainly media , special interest groups , factions , things like that ? and just start hammering them and demanding apologies I ve always wanted to see the person that s like , Yeah , I ve made these comments , these are my beliefs , and you know what , if you don t like it stick it . I m not apologizing , I m not changing , Rocker told TheDC . I think that is something that millions and millions of Americans have been waiting for probably a decade or two to hear something . Maybe even since Reagan .
