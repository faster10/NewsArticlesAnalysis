Kraus : We ' re definitely more efficient than we ' ve ever been before , because we have to be . We no longer have those sweet spot , post sugar crash , 5 to 8 p . m . hours to make up whatever we haven ' t gotten done during the day . We have a hard clock out because we have to be at pickup . We have to do the parts of the day that we love : dinner , bath time and bedtime . And sometimes we get back to work after our kids go to bed , but we ' re usually really brain fried by then , in a way that we didn ' t used to be .
