Few American flea markets can measure up to Canton in terms of history : residents of this small town an hour east of Dallas have been hauling their goods here to trade since 1850 , when everything from hunting dogs to hand tools was bartered outside the courthouse during the circuit judge ' s monthly visit . Today , the market covers more than 100 acres of land a few blocks from the original courthouse square location . The merchandise is more varied than ever , with vintage cowboy boots , handcrafted leather saddles , antique silver , 19th century flow blue pottery , and homemade hot sauce among the 6 , 000 plus regular stalls .
