The New York Observer has a slightly more cynical take on Sanders ' political evolution . Bernie doesn ' t focus on foreign affairs , notes one columnist , " because he has little to gain by doing so . " The piece quotes Joe Trippi , an old campaign hand from Howard Dean ' s 2004 presidential campaign , who declares " everything I ' m looking at says domestic policy is what ' s driving his surge . He fares better the more he talks about domestic economics and , in fact , the groups he has to try to win over are more focused with economics than domestics . "
