The magnetic Australian singer , songwriter and guitarist is a critics ' darling but is hardly a stateside chart topper . Nor was she on many people ' s shortlist for best new artist , leading to one of the nominations ' biggest surprises . Unlike , say , Fetty Wap ' s " Trap Queen , " which was a commercial force throughout 2015 ( though he was shut out of this category ) , Barnett ' s album , " Sometimes I Sit and Think , and Sometimes I Just Sit , " isn ' t even on the Billboard Top 200 album chart anymore . Also missing from the best new artist list : breakout British crooner George Ezra ( " Budapest " ) and future one hit wonder Walk the Moon .
