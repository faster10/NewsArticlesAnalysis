To assuage doubts about his faith during his final push , Trump has been campaigning with evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr . , who has served as a critical character witness for Trump by praising his private generosity and stating that Trump reminds him of his father , famed televangelist Jerry Falwell . Though he ' s had some embarrassing gaffes when talking about faith quoting " Two Corinthians " at Liberty University , for example , Trump played up his faith in the final weekend . He went to church on Sunday with his wife . On Saturday , he released a Facebook video showing the Bible that his mother gave him and promising evangelicals that he would never let them down .
