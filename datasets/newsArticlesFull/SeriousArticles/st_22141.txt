It ' s therefore maybe not 100 percent worth it to suss out who was right in this disagreement , because Hoiberg didn ' t let Butler languish on the bench while the Bulls lost the game . ( Perhaps those two plus minutes of rest were even responsible for the 17 points Butler scored over the final 6 : 07 to help him to his new career best . ) Butler discussed the issue with Hoiberg and seems to understand the coach ' s perspective . It ' s likely that he ' s frustrated with losing much more than he is with the first year coach .
