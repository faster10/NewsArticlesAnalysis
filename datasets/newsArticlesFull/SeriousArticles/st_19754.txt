I love to cook , but I ' m not in the same class as my wife or Pierrot , my policeman friend . It ' s a wonderful hobby because I ' m always learning and it gives friends and family so much pleasure . It made me start my own vegetable and herb garden and now I ' ve even started keeping chickens to produce my own eggs with glorious golden yellow yolks . I call my cockerel Sarko , after the French president ( Sarkozy ) , and all the hens are named after women politicians . So far , Angela Merkel lays the most eggs , Margaret Thatcher is the bully who gets to the food first , Hillary Clinton will eat anything and Carla Bruno is the pretty one .
