Historically , general strikes were considered a powerful tool , meant to demonstrate the power of the people ( often organized labor ) , able at least to gum up the working of major segments of the economy . In France , general strikes were used to force the government to make significant concessions . For instance , the 2006 demonstrations over the controversial CPE ( or contrat premi re embauche , first employment contract , which would have made it easier for employers to fire young workers ) lasted two months before President Jacques Chirac scrapped the legislation .
