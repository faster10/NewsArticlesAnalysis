The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid ( plus the new 2010 health care law ) will increase from about 10 of the nation ' s total economic output this year , as measured by gross domestic product ( GDP ) , to nearly 16 in 2035 . Historically , the government has collected about 18 of GDP in revenue . Thus , if the entitlement programs remain on autopilot , there will either be nothing left in the budget beyond transfer payments , or government taxes will have to soar .
