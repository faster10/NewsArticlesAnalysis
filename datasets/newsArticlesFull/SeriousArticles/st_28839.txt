Recently , that tends to mean QBs who can run , but are less skilled at reading defenses and anticipating their receivers . In Kaep s case , he looked impressive when the 49ers had a dominant defense and a strong run game . They d go run , run , run , play action pass . Their run game was strong enough that teams had to play the run , meaning he d almost always have a WR open when they did go play action . Kaep didn t have to worry about reading the defense or anticipating his WR s movement . He could just throw directly to the WR . Russell Wilson is a lot like Kaep , just a little bit of a better version . He s a better passer , but he holds onto the ball too long because he s waiting for a receiver to get open , as opposed to anticipating the place he ll be open or throwing him open .
