Eastwood : We just did an interview with someone from the ( International Committee of the Red Cross ) office , and what he said is that what happens for people in Baghdad who have been internally displaced from areas where there is fighting is that they get brought into their ethnic communities they are seeking shelter in these places because they feel safer , rather than necessarily going to NGOs . Many are seeking sanctuary in their ethnic neighborhoods , and these are very closed neighborhoods .
