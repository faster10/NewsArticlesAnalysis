The city later made a significant loan from its pension fund , which was matched by the Burlington Savings Bank and bolstered with funds from U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development programs to make initial home purchases affordable . To provide a more sustainable source of revenue , the Burlington Housing Trust Fund was created in 1988 , bankrolled by a small increase in property taxes .
