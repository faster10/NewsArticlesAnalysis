For Clemson to have success like MSU did , middle linebacker B . J . Goodson needs to have a big game . The Tigers defensive line will play big part in that . If it can occupy Alabama s offensive linemen and prevent them from reaching the second level , linebackers like Goodson and Ben Boulware will be able to get a clean shot on the 245 pound Henry . Even if that happens , bringing down Henry is no sure bet . If Goodson reaches Henry on the initial point of attack , he ll need his teammates to come in to clean things up . With 98 tackles and 14 tackles for loss on the season , Goodson has been a sure tackler all year long . The Tigers need him play with the same consistency on Monday night . ?
