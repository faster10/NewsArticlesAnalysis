Jeb and Rubio have pretty much the same immigration positions , but Rubio is much more effective in obfuscating what they are and marketing them to conservatives , said Krikorian . Jeb is a less adroit politician . He just comes out and says what he thinks . . . . Rubio is better at deflecting and hiding what he really thinks and wants on immigration . Krikorian posited that Rubio could win back support from the right by categorically rejecting any legal status until border security measures such as E Verify and an entry exit tracking system are fully operational .
