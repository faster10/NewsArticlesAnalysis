Sticking with a mostly static camera and lengthy takes , Leigh seems to be shooting for the kind of slow , somber surrealism of Luis Bunuel ' s foray into similar subject matter , " Belle de Jour " . But she ' s not that accomplished a director not yet , anyway and the film sometimes drifts into a stilted somnolence . Scenes of Lucy ' s everyday life away from work bickering with flat mates , or caring for a dying friend fail to shed much light on the character or her motivations , and are shot in the same monotonous rhythm .
