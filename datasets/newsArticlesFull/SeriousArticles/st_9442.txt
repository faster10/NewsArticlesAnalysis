" I don ' t want to be misunderstood on this important subject . I ' m not an expert on the situation and I ' m aware of the complexity of it . My only wish and intention in signing that group letter is the hope that there will be peace in both Israel and Gaza . I am hopeful all parties can agree to a cease fire and there are no more innocent victims on either side of the border . I wish for unity , and peace . . . I believe in a civilization that can be capable of bringing the courage to have a world where humans can live side by side . "
