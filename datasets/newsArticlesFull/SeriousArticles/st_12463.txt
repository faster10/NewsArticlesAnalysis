One solution could be a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian population centers in the West Bank . As in the disengagement from Gaza , the United States would endorse this move , but unlike in Gaza , most Israeli settlements would remain within Israel , and Israeli troops would still patrol strategic borders . Of course , the preferable solution is two states for two peoples . But if that proves unattainable , then Israel can still end the occupation of the Palestinians , preserve its security , and perhaps lay new foundations for peace .
