If extra innings in a World Series game can possibly be considered " anti climactic , " this was how . Once the Royals tied the game , there was just no sense that the Mets would win it . Even with Wade Davis limited to one inning , Kansas City ' s bullpen continued its mastery of New York ' s hitters . The Royals ' bullpen wasn ' t perfect in this series , but when the games were close , it was at its best . The Mets got one unearned run off the bullpen in eight innings of Game 1 . They picked up a solo homer off Danny Duffy in Game 4 . They got nothing in six innings last night . There was a pretty good case for Luke Hochevar , who threw five shutout innings in the series , to be the MVP . Davis threw four shutout innings . Kelvin Herrera threw three shutout innings last night and allowed just a single unearned run in 5 1 3 frames over three games . ?
