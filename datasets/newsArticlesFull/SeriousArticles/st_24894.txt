Clinton says she isn t worried . Y ou know these polls go up , they go down , she said on Sunday in an interview with CBS News Face the Nation . I stay pretty focused , as I think we all should , on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration , but go even further . But her next sentence , an implicit jab at Sanders position on guns , belied that confidence . And that s why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can .
