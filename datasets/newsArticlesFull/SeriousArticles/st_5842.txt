The last two buckets stand out more than any others . Down 99 98 with around a minute remaining in regulation , Kobe used a pick to free up just enough space to launch a long three pointer to give the Lakers the lead . Marcin Gortat laid the ball in off a John Wall assist on the next possession to tie it back up , but Bryant answered by taking Bradley Beal one on one and burying a fadeaway over him late in the shot clock . A subsequent Wall turnover made it a free throw contest in the final seconds , and the Lakers hit enough to withstand a minor rally .
