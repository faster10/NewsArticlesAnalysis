Neville Longbottom No More: Matthew Lewis Shows Off Buff Bod in Military Series
In the Harry Potter films, Neville Longbottom -- played by Matthew Lewis in all eight films -- was dopey, pudgy, and not much of a heartbreaker. That is until he grew up. Now, at 25 years old, Lewis has shed just about any reminder of his awkward, onscreen childhood days thanks to a new photo tweeted by former co-star Emma Watson.  The new pic -- a still from the BBC dramedy, Bluestone 42 -- shows Lewis as a hunky, stone-faced military corporal.

Since the final two films, the actor has grown out of his pudgy frame and has shown off a scruffy, mature look. He even displayed his fit frame in an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge video.
