President Obama and his advisers would be stupid , however , if they were incapable of foreseeing Sisi s demise . After all , the grievances that led to the mass uprising against Mubarak ? police corruption , a deteriorating educational system , income inequality , political alienation , a farcical justice system , and the utter failure of most governmental institutions ? have yet to be dealt with . In fact , they seem to be worsening under Sisi . The situation is a recipe for an uprising of monumental proportions . It s hard to predict what that uprising will look like , but now that all peaceful methods have been exhausted , violence does seem inevitable . The people this time would be fueled by a need not only for change and reform but also for vengeance : friends and family have been killed ? in the thousands ? and the courts of Egypt have decided that no one will be punished for those deaths . The U . S . would be wise to rethink its support of Sisi ? because when the next uprising comes , we can be sure that his response will be heavy handed and proudly marked Made in U . S . A .
