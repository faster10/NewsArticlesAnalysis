What is great about the National Spelling Bee is that it provides a safe space for prepubescent kids to meet peers with a similar obsession for words . When I was in junior high , public schools tolerated a much higher background level of bullying than they do in the post Columbine era , but when I was at the Spelling Bee , I fit in . Yes , I won the championship , and I am always grateful for that , but ironically , the downside to being champion is that it gives you a lot less time to socialize with your fellow word nerds .
