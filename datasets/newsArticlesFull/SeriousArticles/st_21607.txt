Wrapped by deep roof overhangs some up to ten feet wide that serve to deflect the region ' s broiling sunlight and torrential downpours , the dwelling features tall windows that add a romantic transparency to its unpretentious countenance . " We wanted to see and enjoy the beauty as much as possible , " says Mr Bush . To answer the couple ' s desire for indoor outdoor living , many of the windows are also doors that open to covered terraces and walks , buffalo grass lawns , and the tree shaded swimming pool . When the doors are flung wide , the home becomes a veritable pavilion , capturing passing breezes and filled with birdsong . The configuration also reduces the need for internal corridors often the Bushes navigate the place by strolling out one door and in through another . " It ' s slightly motel ish , but we love that , " Mrs Bush says lightheartedly .
