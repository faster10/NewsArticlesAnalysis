Given the size of the little outcrop of Turkey into Syria and the apparent track of the aircraft , as confirmed by Turkish radar information , at the time the warning there could have been no indication that the SU24 would go near Turkish airspace . At that time it was travelling almost due east , again according to Turkish radar data . The testimony of the surviving crew member must also be taken into account . He is adamant that no warnings were received . It is possible of course that something was said on an obscure aviation frequency , but not the emergency frequency that all combat aircraft monitor as a matter of routine .
