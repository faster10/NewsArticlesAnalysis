But that ' s just the start of the Lions ' issues . A second flaw is that they used an aggressive three man rush that was about getting a sack , not containment . They allowed Rodgers to break contain , which buys time for targets to get down the field and also creates a situation where Rodgers can set his feet and get in a comfortable throwing position ( thus generating the power to launch the ball 60 plus yards in the air ) . Beyond that , the rushers didn ' t seem at all conscious of keeping Rodgers to the left so he is forced to throw at all across his body .
