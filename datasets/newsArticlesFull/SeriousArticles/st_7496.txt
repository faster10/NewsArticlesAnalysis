Jameis Winston . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback had a career day at the expense of the Philadelphia Eagles . In the midst of a 45 17 victory , Winston tied an NFL record for rookie quarterbacks by throwing five touchdown passes in the game . Oh , and along the way he also picked up 246 yards . So , congratulations to Eagles fans who were also Winston owners for your incredibly conflicted victory this weekend . ( Unless you were one of those Philadelphia fans rooting for Chip Kelly to go back to college . )
