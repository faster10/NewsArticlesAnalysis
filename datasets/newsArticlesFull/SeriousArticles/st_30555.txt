" Man , in his weakness and shortsightedness believes he must make choices in this life . He trembles at the risks he takes . We do know fear . But no . Our choice is of no importance . There comes a time when our eyes are opened and we come to realize that mercy is infinite . We need only await it with confidence and receive it with gratitude . Mercy imposes no conditions . And lo ! Everything we have chosen has been granted to us . And everything we rejected has also been granted . Yes , we even get back what we rejected . For mercy and truth have met together , and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another . "
