I believe that if anything is a national shame it is the fact that my father ' s and the INA ' s contribution to India ' s independence has been downplayed consistently from official sources and in history books . The argument about his death is by comparison unimportant . I hate to have my father ' s role in India ' s history reduced to " being that man about whose death people have arguments " . In my opinion , he certainly has had greater achievements for India and greater claims to fame than a mystery about his death .
