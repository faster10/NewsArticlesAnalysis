For me , addiction boils down to constant reinforcement , or put more simply , being constantly rewarded while playing the game . Gaming rewards can be physiological ( such as feeling " high " or getting a " buzz " while playing or beating your personal high score ) , psychological ( such as feeling you have complete control in a specific situation or knowing that your strategic play helped you win ) , social ( such as being congratulated by fellow gamers when doing something well in the game ) and , in some cases , financial ( such as winning a gaming tournament ) .
