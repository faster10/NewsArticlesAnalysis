Building on the momentum of this presidential leadership , the service movement has made considerable progress in the past three decades . Organizations such as Teach For America , YouthBuild and City Year have gone to scale and emerged as pillars of the service movement . Innovative programs including Food Corps , Green City Force , Global Health Corps and The Mission Continues present new models for engaging citizens in service . The new Service Year Exchange ( www . service yr . org ) funded by Cisco , Lumina and Joyce will create a dynamic online marketplace for service opportunities by bringing together young people seeking service positions , organizations seeking corps members and funders who want to support these efforts .
