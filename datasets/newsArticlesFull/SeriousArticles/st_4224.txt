So the paper says you ' re that new face of the Republican Party say you ' re the best hope for Republicans . Does that make you establishment . Now it makes it that if I win the nomination I ' m gonna unite the party and we ' re going to be Hillary Clinton . We need to win this election . This we cannot lose this election this country cannot afford another four years like the last just got to ask but the polls new fox poll out this morning I talked about this morning but . Such a 12 and Iowa . What ' s going on what he did we get . All I don ' t think you can accurately polar caucus like Iowa they never have been able to it won ' t be able now there ' s always surprises here and one of the reasons why is voters here take their vote very seriously . And more often on more than a third of them make up their minds in the last couple days ago . That it just means you gonna have to earn your growth you have to keep them and south we ' re gonna continue to do its due to win Iowa I have to get enough delegates to be the nominee and that ' s what I ' m vote . A lot of buzz being made about these party leaders kind of coming around on trumped what does that mean for you hear him . We can ' t continue to promote the next person in line with the people in Washington politics of voting for . We need to turn the page and move this country forward and that ' s what I ' m and a doing them right . You got here tomorrow with Jody Gerut sincere . Getting not quite endorsement but she ' s a person have on the stump with yet she taught you how to make and squeals . None I I think that ' s something . Now I I think she ' s very good I think .
