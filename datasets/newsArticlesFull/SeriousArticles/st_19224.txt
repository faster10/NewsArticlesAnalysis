" In the speech , I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things . . . . I said , " Wow , Carine ( Roitfeld ) is seven seats down from Kim ( Kardashian ) . Farnaz ( Farjam ) , the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of ' The Real World , ' is four seats down from ( director ) Steve McQueen . And four seats , because in between them is Hosain ( Rahman ) from Jawbone . This is what I talked about . That was not a forty five minute speech to myself . Do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other ? "
