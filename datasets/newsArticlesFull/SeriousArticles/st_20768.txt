Crais : I had heard about these atrocious mass graves uncovered in Mexico south of the border : 52 people in one grave , 87 people in another , 164 bodies at a ranch with multiple burial sites . If you watch the news at all , you know Mexico is pretty much defining itself now as a war between the government and the various drug cartels . South of the border is fairly well patrolled by armed groups of thugs who work for the cartels , and those guys end up preying on civilians , policemen and government officials , but they also prey on each other .
