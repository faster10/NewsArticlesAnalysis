Both Cruz and Rubio are playing a subtle game . They will not back Trump or his idea , but they don t plan to alienate his voters either . They will sit at the divide between the mainstream and far right and hope to benefit if and when Trump leaves the race . Viewed from their perch in the GOP , this makes sense . Trump represents a large and meaningful minority in the Republican Party electorate , but he has few formal ties to the GOP . A full attack from the entire party ? an attempt to destroy his stature within the primary race ? risks a schism . Trump would leave , his voters would leave , and the Republican Party might face an independent Trump bid for the White House . In other words , a GOP that denounced Trump in unison is one that might easily lose the next election .
