Hold it a sec . Make America Great ? Again ? I ' ve heard that somewhere before . While Super Bowl 50 promises to be the biggest football extravaganza of all time they ' re actually building a Super Bowl City along the San Francisco waterfront and rounding up all the homeless people so no one will see them on TV Donald Trump is campaigning for President on what could be called a ' Super Bowl 50 ' platform . Making America Great Again . Convincing other people to pay for things , i . e . the wall along the border with Mexico , he ' s a builder of cities or at least buildings , he doesn ' t like ' losers ' , i . e . homeless and John McCain , and he claims that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York City and his supporters would still love him and vote for him . Hey , just like the NFL . They have players that beat their girlfriends and wives , get arrested on multiple DUIs , deny benefits to participants who suffer life altering injuries , and then deny the injuries . And yet , Super Bowl 50 may end up being the biggest Super Bowl yet .
