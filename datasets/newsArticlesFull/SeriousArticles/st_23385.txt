The seasonal rains have brought cheers to farmers . Even some of the canals and rivers like Cooum have become clean overnight . But the ever increasing encroachments have cost more than Rs . 2 , 000 crores and untold miseries to lakhs of people all over Tamil Nadu . The observation by the Madras High Court that the encroachments of waterbodies led to the flooding ( Nov 28 ) fixes the responsibility for the floods on the illegal usage of waterways and water storage locations . Hence , the local bodies , district administrations and the Government should evict the encroachments and desilt all waterbodies to prevent such a situation in the next rainy season .
