I realised how much power the site had during a chat in 2008 with Larry Page , Google ' s co founder , who languidly said that he had followed the news of the Georgia invasion by watching the Wikipedia page about it . Why ? Because it was factual , updated quickly , and didn ' t use that annoying newspaper style of trying to make stuff sensational . Wikipedia , the news source ? Sounds crazy , until you hear about people checking there on hearing that someone famous has died , to see whether it ' s really true . These days , you ' re not dead until you ' re dead on Wikipedia . ( And even then , you might get a reprieve if you ' re , say , Zsa Zsar Gabor . )
