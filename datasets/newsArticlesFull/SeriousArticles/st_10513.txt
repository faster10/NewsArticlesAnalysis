This is partly the fault of the avant garde Left . Until the 1960s , the Democrats were the party of the little man and Republicans were derided as wealthy snobs . The switch in cultural representation is thanks to conservatism s growing popularity among the over taxed . But it s also because the Democrats forgot their roots . According to CNN : Clinton made 3 . 15 million in 2013 alone from speaking to firms like Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank and UBS . No wonder Sanders is doing so well in New Hampshire . Mrs Clinton is popular in Europe but divisive and derided in the United States . Her difficulty in getting elected isn t due to boobish sexism . It s because she is widely regarded as untrustworthy , and her husband as a joke that gets dirtier with age .
