" The older that they stay alive , the more they lose their humanity , " del Toro explained . " They start literally by losing their heart their heart is suffocated by a vampire heart that overtakes the functions . This was important metaphorically for me because the beacon that guides these vampires to their victims is love . Love is what makes them seek their victims . They go to the people they love the most . So they turn their instinct that is most innately human into the most inhuman feeding mechanism . "
