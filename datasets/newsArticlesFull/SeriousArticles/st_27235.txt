1 . Kanu Hawaii : This volunteer group , whose name means " to plant " in Hawaiian , has been working this year to register new voters and engage communities that typically have been left out of the political conversation . As of last month , the group had registered 2 , 397 new voters and knocked on 789 doors asking people to vote . If all of those new registered voters actually go to the polls ( if that ' s you , do it ! ) then the contest is already 20 taken care of , thanks to the work of 40 Kanu volunteers .
