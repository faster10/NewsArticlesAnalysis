We ask Yossi Beilin , who initiated the Oslo agreement , " What was more surprising to you that Rabin took a chance on the terrorist Yasser Arafat or that he agreed to something Shimon Peres proposed ? " " Tough call , " Beilin replies . " I knew then that negotiations had to be clandestine , or else Rabin would stop us in our tracks . " Twenty two years later , we ask Beilin whether Oslo failed . " It was made to fail , certainly , but Oslo ' s biggest curse is that is still exists . Today it is the political right that is desperately holding on to the Oslo accord , because it gave it the umbrella under which it could continue building settlements , " says Beilin .
