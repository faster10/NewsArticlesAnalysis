I ' m not quite sure you can make the same argument for Graham and the passing game . Yes , Graham has been a major disappointment this season , and Russell Wilson continued his incredible play in Week 13 without the benefit of Graham ' s presence . I ' m just not sure how sustainable that is , given that Graham still leads the team in targets , and nobody really stepped up to replace him . Doug Baldwin is doing incredible work in the passing game , but that trend started before Graham ' s injury , and in Week 13 , nobody else really filled the void Luke Willson and Cooper Helfet had just three catches between them for 49 yards . Maybe having tight ends who can be more of a factor in run blocking frees up the play calling and makes the offensive game plan a bit less predictable , and those small difference can really help the Seahawks keep their strong run up . But I would still guess Wilson and the Seahawks will miss Graham ' s between the 20 ' s production at some point .
