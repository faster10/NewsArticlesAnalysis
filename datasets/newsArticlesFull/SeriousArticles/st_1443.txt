The worst part about these establishment candidates is that they ll all have pride . Mike Huckabee , Sen . Rand Paul , Rick Santorum , Carly Fiorina , and Ben Carson all know ( hopefully ? ) that they re not supposed to win . Rubio , Bush , Christie , and Kasich , though , believe that they re supposed to win . Their likes always win ? these are the rules ! If Trump and Cruz run all over them through the first few states , they ll continue to argue that it s a fad and the serious candidates will soon have their opportunity . One imagines them still muttering this to themselves , in a cold sweated state of delirium , even as they re watching Trump accept the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland .
