When I visited the monument on a muggy Washington day two summers ago , I found it almost silent , only a few visitors strolling its flagstones . Maybe it was the weather , maybe it was because it was a Monday , maybe it was because , in terms of the National Mall , the landmark is still a relative newcomer . But this lack of people did not matter . If anything , it helped underline the site ' s value as a place for contemplation and quiet . And in a century currently short on peace , love and understanding , what could be wrong with that ?
