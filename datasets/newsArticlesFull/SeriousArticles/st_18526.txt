The Bills are riding a two game winning streak after important division wins over the Dolphins and Jets , and the chess match should be interesting in this one . The Bills will have had 11 days to prepare following their 22 17 win over the Jets last Thursday night , while the Patriots will have had eight days following their big comeback win over the Giants . Plus , since it s the second matchup of the season , it will be interesting to see how each team adjusts its game plan , particularly to account for the injuries that have popped up on both sides .
