McCarthy , as Diana ( which may or may not be her real name ) , is not about to give up without a fight . But she ' s also slippery in more subtle ways , an operator who knows how to manipulate people with the way she looks and how she talks . In some cases that involves playing on their pity and on ours , too , as the filmmakers imply that her weight is a symptom of her unhappy life . But McCarthy has the personality to subvert this , because her Diana may be lonely , but she is still more vital , more spontaneous and more fun than Sandy is ever likely to be .
