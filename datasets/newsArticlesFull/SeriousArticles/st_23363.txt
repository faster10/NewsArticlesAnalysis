In five years of civil war , 200 , 000 Syrians have died and 9 . 5 million have fled their homes . Germany has taken in 38 , 500 of them . The United States : 1 , 854 . Half are children . Most of the rest are women or elderly . Two percent are single men of combat age , the demographic from which most terrorists hail . ( The 9 11 hijackers average age was 24 . The elder Boston marathon bomber was 26 . ) Vetting a refugee takes up to two years and produces a fat dossier , which is why so few terrorists try to get in that way . We say the world looks to us for leadership , but every other nation that might join a coalition against ISIS is doing more than we are to meet this crisis . They no longer want our leadership ? just our soldiers , our arms and our money .
