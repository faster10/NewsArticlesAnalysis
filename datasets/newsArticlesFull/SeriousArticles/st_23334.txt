Aside : I tend to have no shame regarding the way I live , and have generally adopted a " sucks to be you " attitude toward my neighbors when it comes to my TV habits . I ' m sorry the apartment walls are thin , but we ' re all paying rent here and I ' m just trying to do my job , you know ? In all my years of recapping embarrassing reality television , Brielle ' s performance marks one of the few times I ' ve ever actually turned my television way , way , way down not , like , as a courtesy to the Thai delivery guy ( that ' s normal ) but as a way to save face from strangers passing in the night . I could hear that someone was about to walk by outside , and I suddenly couldn ' t bear the thought of him or her thinking I might have CHOSEN to listen to " Someone Like You " . . . like this . End of aside .
