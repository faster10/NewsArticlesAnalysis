" I haven ' t watched the finale since it aired , but the fact that viewers bingeing Lost for the first time don ' t get to hear Miles ' duct tape ' line , not to mention many , MANY other moments , makes me want to cry harder than Jack Shephard . And that guy can cry , " Lindelof said in an exclusive statement to E ! News . " I pray to Jacob ( who I guess is actually Hurley now ) that this obvious mistake gets corrected soon . ? If it doesn ' t , I have no choice but to subject those responsible to watch the episode where Jack gets his tattoos and flies a kite with Bai Ling over and over again until they surrender . "
