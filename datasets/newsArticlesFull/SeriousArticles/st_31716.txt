You can ' t call some people once and for all " good " and others " bad . " Or , well , you can , but that doesn ' t make it so , and it doesn ' t make you exempt from the other category . Falwell Jr . just doesn ' t seem to get this , or to see the utter inconsistency in his positions . When he condemns all Muslims for the violent acts of a few , then turns around to spit in the face of a martyred avatar for peace and reconciliation on the holiday that bears his namesake and lend his public support to an ignorant , small , and divisive pseudo celebrity in his bid to be the leader of the free world , he helps us remember something crucial . Left to our own devices , we are all " bad guys , " each prone to avarice and violence , clamoring for power and selling our souls to vilify those we believe threaten our interests and double mortgaging them to support whomever we believe will protect them .
