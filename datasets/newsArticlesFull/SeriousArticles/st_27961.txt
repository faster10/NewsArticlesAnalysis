She ' s an incredibly tough player . I think she ' s one of the , if not the most consistent player on the tour . And that ' s no secret , ? Konta ? said . She really makes every single ball possible and makes you work for every single point . She definitely played with that little bit more experience than I did . But I really enjoyed my experience out there . I ' m really happy how I was able to keep pushing my threshold , as well , keep gaining lots of new experiences , and just keep improving .
