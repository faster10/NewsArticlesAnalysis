2 . Jeb Bush is in serious trouble . There s no way to sugarcoat last night for Bush s campaign , not to mention his supporters . He not only didn t have a break out moment , but his face off with his one time prot g Marco Rubio was a stand out moment for his rival . The Bush camp telegraphed they were going after Rubio s voting record , making absolutely sure everyone , including the Rubio camp , were ready when that hit came . The problem : Bush had no comeback . Of course , one bad debate doesn t kill a candidacy , but the former Florida governor has been struggling in the polls and now it s time to keep donors from going into full on panic mode . There s another debate around the corner ? Nov . 10 ? and everything could be riding on that trip to the podium .
