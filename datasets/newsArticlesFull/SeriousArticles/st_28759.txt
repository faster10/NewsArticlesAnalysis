It s a politically satisfying explanation for conservatives who are already anti Trump he boasts so often of being tough , and they very much like the idea of him cowering in fear of a woman ? a woman ! But it s obviously not correct . Trump is clearly not afraid of Fox News or Megyn Kelly . Why would he be ? At the first debate he easily batted away Kelly s questions about sexism and won the crowd to his side with a rant against political correctness . He s already picked a fight with Fox News over how the network treats him , and he won . Trump s debate performances have only gotten stronger as the months have worn on . There s no obvious reason for why Trump should be scared of facing off against Kelly or anyone else .
