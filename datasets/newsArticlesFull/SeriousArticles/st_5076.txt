The streets on the poor side of Lake Providence are generally narrower and harder to navigate than those on the north , so maybe that had something to do with it . Maybe fear is a factor . Perhaps the driver taking these images didn ' t want to drive through the poor side of town with cameras tacked to his roof . Maybe it was racism , since the poor side is largely black . Or maybe Google prioritizes areas based on the number of businesses there or the number of times Internet users search for addresses in that zone .
