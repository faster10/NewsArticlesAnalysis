No doubt the few choice words Coughlin would use would not be suitable for family listening . At least the Saints at times made Eli Manning uncomfortable as he tossed his six touchdown passes . The Giants never sacked Brees in 50 pass attempts . They allowed 614 total yards and the only time they allowed more ( 682 ) in a game was way , way back in 1943 to the Bears . No one has ever thrown for more yards against the Giants than Brees 511 . He became the eighth quarterback in NFL history to throw seven TD passes in a game .
