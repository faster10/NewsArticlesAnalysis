Let ' s keep in mind that when nativists think Muslim , they conflate a religion with approximately 1 . 6 billion worldwide adherents to the Middle East ( and perhaps Central and South Asia ) without appreciating how ingrained Muslims have been in American society for decades ( and centuries ) . It ' s more than Malcolm X . If you have rooted for sports , what about Muhammad Ali , Kareem Abdul Jabbar , or Shaquille O ' Neal ? What about the comedic stylings of Dave Chappelle ? Islam was woven into hip hop , with rappers like Q Tip , Nas , Lupe Fiasco , and the entire Wu Tang Clan ( to name just a few ) identifying as Muslims . Of course , contemporary pop stars such as Rita Ora and Zayn Malik ( One Direction ) are also Muslims , so would Trump keep them out , too ?
