Abe Vigoda was married to Beatrice Schy from 1968 to 1992 . Vigoda worked steadily in theater and television for decades before gaining prominence with his roles in The Godfather and Barney Miller . People magazine says you re dead . That s how that came about , and it s been with me all these years . He is survived by his daughter , three grandchildren ? Jamie , Paul , and Steven ? and a great grandson . I was sitting in a restaurant , he told the Washington Post in 1977 , when this young lady came up and asked for my autograph . If you wanted that Abe Vigoda quality , there was only one place to find it .
