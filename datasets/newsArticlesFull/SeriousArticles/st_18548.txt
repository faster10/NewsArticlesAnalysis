For all those moderate Republicans ( and , yes , they really do exist ) out there in Hollywood , things are a lot harder . If they come out as conservative , they risk never getting invited to any forthcoming benefits George Clooney might be throwing to liberate the Elgin Marbles . That ' s a serious problem , because Hollywood is a business in which who you know is as important as what you know . Therefore , if stars admit their Republicanism , they risk losing friends , parts and a steady income . No wonder so few do it .
