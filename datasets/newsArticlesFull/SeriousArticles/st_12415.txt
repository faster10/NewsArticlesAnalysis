You may find this news exciting , or terrifying . But it ' s coming . Cruz may be the only Republican presidential candidate who in the course of this primary hasn ' t made any egregious mistakes , underperformed atrociously , or revealed themselves to be not what their supporters had hoped . He ' s raised more money than anyone except Jeb Bush , and if Donald Trump and Ben Carson flame out the way most people expect them to ? not a sure thing by any means , but a better than even chance ? Cruz could pick up much of their support . So it ' s not too early to take a good hard look at Cruz ' s strengths and weaknesses .
