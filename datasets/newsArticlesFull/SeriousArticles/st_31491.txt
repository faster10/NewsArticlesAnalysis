As for the literal operation of Anonymous , becoming part of it is as simple as going onto its Internet Relay Chat forums and typing away . There are numerous Twitter accounts which claim to be affiliated with Anonymous , and more websites that post and repost ( known as mirroring ) Anonymous content than there is room to mention here . The real life people involved in Anonymous could be behind their laptops anywhere , from an Internet caf in Malaysia to a Michigan suburb . Anonymous appears to have no spokesperson or leader . One could participate for a minute or a day in a chat room , and then never go back again .
