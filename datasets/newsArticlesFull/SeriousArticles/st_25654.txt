The stadium was first built over 120 years ago and , quite frankly , it shows . Anfield is looking old and tired and the club is actively seeking a new home , yet it simply has to be in the list for atmosphere alone . The sound of 45 , 000 Liverpool fans simultaneously singing " You ' ll Never Walk Alone " is spine tingling especially on European nights . The Kop is an awesome stand and as the players come down the tunnel to the pitch , a sign above them says " This is Anfield " . . . That says it all . See a photo gallery of our First 11 stadiums
