The Panthers lone defensive vulnerability is at safety , where Roman Harper and Kurt Coleman are simply adequate in coverage . But Josh Norman is one of the best cornerbacks in the sport with four of Carolina s 14 interceptions this season . He is a strong , physical corner with great ball hawking skills and capable of leveling any receiver . He s also forced a fumble . Cousins must be wary of him , but not to the point he limits his options or cuts down the field . Veteran corner Charles Tillman plays opposite of Norman .
