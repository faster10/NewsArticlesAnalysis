But Stone Temple Pilots are more important than Stone Temple Pilots , as perceived the snobbier end of my peer pool . Bands form today because they want to be the new Red Hot Chili Peppers or Coldplay ( in a way , the STP of their generation ? not sonically , but as far as a respect deficit that may or may not be just ) . I know because I ve interviewed them , too , the bands 10 , sometimes 20 years my junior . They don t seem to have the same issues as my bands , but they ll come . Nobody can escape them .
