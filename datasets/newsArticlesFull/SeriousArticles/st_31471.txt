Reiss : Without sharing his game plan , Belichick touched a bit on devising an approach to facing Manning , noting the variation and fluctuation is extreme because of his experience . Certainly there s an aspect of a chess match before the snap , but given where we are now in Manning s career and how he s playing , that s probably a bit overrated this time around . As Belichick said , sometimes you just have to line up and play , out executing the opposition . Thus , in what would have been viewed as a bizarre plan a few years ago , stopping the run is going to be their first priority , and if that means putting the ball in Manning s hands , they ll take their chances . Manning still deserves respect , but it doesn t take a football junkie like Belichick to see he s not the same quarterback who could strike fear into opposing defenses .
