Canavero points to Dr Robert White , who transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1970 . The monkey died after eight days , because the body rejected the new head . Before ithe monkey died , it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected . The monkey also was unable to breathe on its own . The paper in which Canavero outlined his procedure references a different 1971 experiment White conducted with six monkey heads , none of which survived more than 24 hours . But Canavero says advances in science and medicine since then eliminate the problems White faced .
