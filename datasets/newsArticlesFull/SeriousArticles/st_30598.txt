People had been tipping Bowie for much of the previous year . His album Hunky Dory had come out just before Christmas 1971 , with glowing reviews and a big marketing push from his new record company , but it hadn t really taken . The New York Times called him the most intellectually brilliant man yet to choose the long playing album as his medium of expression . In truth , Bowie was like everybody else , just trying to get a hit . The last time he d been on Top of the Pops was playing piano behind Peter Noone on the latter s hit version of his own Oh ! You Pretty Things . Bowie s people were furiously working the machine . His first release of 1972 , Changes , was not a hit , despite being single of the week on Tony Blackburn s Radio 1 show .
