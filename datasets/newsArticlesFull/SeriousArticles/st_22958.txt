Sadly , there are no party shoes here either , but I find a cosy tartan scarf for 19 . 99 ( 15 . 82 ) . UK price ? 24 . 99 . As I ' m about to pay for my items , I spot a display of sunglasses . They ' re not on my winter shopping list , but as one of the arms fell off my own pair on the flight over and the sun is very bright I treat myself to a pair of tortoiseshell specs . At 19 . 99 ( 15 . 82 ) , they ' re nearly a tenner less than in the UK , where they ' re 24 . 99 . By this point I ' m too exhausted to shop any more and treat myself to a bowl of gazpacho soup , a roll and a small jug of sangria in a beautiful square off Las Ramblas Barcelona ' s tree lined promenade . The cost is an eye watering 17 ( 13 . 45 ) , but then I am in prime tourist territory .
