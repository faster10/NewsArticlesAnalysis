The United States must put more pressure on Pakistan to play a productive role in the region . We must insist that the billions of dollars we send to Islamabad are not diverted to meddling in Afghanistan . Instead , the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies must work to apprehend terrorists , especially on their own soil , and they must enforce a cessation of violence on the key trade and communications routes into and out of Afghanistan . We cannot ask the Pakistanis to abandon their sympathies for some extreme Islamic parties , including elements of the Taliban , but we can insist that they help to maintain order , stability , and openness in the region .
