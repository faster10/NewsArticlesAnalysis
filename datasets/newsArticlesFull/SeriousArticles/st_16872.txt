Walker : Dave may not be a people person , but if you ' re his friend , you ' re his friend . The whole intern thing . . . I said this to people , ' If you had said to me two years ago , Dave is sleeping with his intern and cheating on Regina , ' I would have said , ' You gotta kill me because that ain ' t happening , ' and I would have been dead . I never would have believed that because Dave is a very shy guy . He ' s never really hit on chicks . He doesn ' t go out with attractive women , he doesn ' t try to do that . If I ' m David Letterman , I got me a Vogue magazine and I ' m going , ' Bring this girl to me now ! '
