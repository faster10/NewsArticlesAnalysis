The United States must cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent of 1990 levels by 2025 starting now ! The established science and the world climate crisis mandates the U . S . to initiate at least a 50 percent reduction of emissions from 1990 levels by 2025 . Such a plan would have to go far beyond setting stricter standards for power plants and fuel efficiencies for cars . It would require shutting down factories , closing freeways , and stopping the U . S . society ' s obsessive compulsion with consumer goods . The Strategy Center has initiated a No Cars in L . A . and the U . S . Campaign as a radical but reasonable response to the severity of the problem . The president does not have to put forth a comprehensive plan to achieve a 50 percent reduction but since he was the one to impose the idea of " Intended Nationally Determined Contributions " he must start with the intention to do what is scientifically and climatically necessary which is to popularize the concept of at least a 50 percent reduction from 1990 levels starting now .
