Mohammad Nabi Omari , the most junior ranking of the five , was a small time commander linked to pro Taliban strongman Jalaluddin Haqqani in the 1990s . After 2001 , he was among the many Haqqani followers who switched allegiances to the Karzai government . Malem Jan , another ex Haqqani commander who switched sides , remembers him vividly . " Omari was angry with the Taliban for throwing the country away ( for Osama bin Laden ) , " he said in a 2010 interview . " He would sit there and tell me , ' if I see a Talib , I won ' t even let him take a piss , I ' m going to turn him in . ' "
