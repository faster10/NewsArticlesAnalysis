And there I think Ben Carson emerges in a strong position . His answers by and large are not statements that I agree with . But if I ask myself whether the Republican base will find them satisfying , then I have to answer in the affirmative . Neil Cavuto threw him a softball on the fabrications he invented about his " violent " childhood and adolescent and Carson had his big opportunity . He bashed the press , he talked about the future and he put behind him the entire lack of evidence regarding his assorted stories about playing with knives . His closing statement , furthermore , was an appeal to the kind of compassion that at least the Republican base would understand : people are dying from drug overdoses , veterans are taking their lives , but the " people of America " are " special " and if we just reject " political correctness " we can make things right . Root causes ? Ben Carson just does not do the root causes of fear and desperation and hopelessness .
