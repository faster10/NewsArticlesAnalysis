Paul van Dyk : The reason I started to DJ was because I was so bored with the music in the clubs in Berlin it was really one dimensional . My musical education came from listening to the radio so I knew there was so much more in the whole wide world of electronic music to be discovered . So I went to record stores , I bought some records and made some tapes for myself and friends . One of my friends passed my tape on to a promoter and that ' s how I got my first gig . So that ' s when I knew , this is what I wanted to do .
