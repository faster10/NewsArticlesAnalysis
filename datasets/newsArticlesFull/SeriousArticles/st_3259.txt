Frankly , it s not worth the effort it would take to litigate this dispute . Progressive ? like most ideological labels ? is far from precise . In its original usage , it refers to a movement of middle class reformers who sought to rationalize a complex and novel industrial economy and control a social order under pressure ( and for some , under threat ) from immigrants , blacks , and other perceived undesirables . The original Progressives brought central banking , broader democracy , and the regulatory state to American politics . They also praised eugenics , opposed mass immigration , and ? in the case of President Woodrow Wilson ? resegregated the federal government . In short , they were a mixed bag . At the same time , Progressives ? like their contemporaries , the Populists ? were important antecedents to New Deal liberals , and modern American liberalism writ large . Important strains in liberalism ? technocratic thinking , scientism , concern with corruption and good government ? have their roots in the Progressive movement .
