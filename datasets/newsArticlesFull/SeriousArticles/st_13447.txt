I wanted to thank you for your excellent column on Marie Dorion . . . as a Western historical fiction buff , I ' ve wondered why she doesn ' t get more press . Glass ' exploits , or at least " tall tale " revisionist accounts , seem to capture imaginations with the revenge angle bringing some color to a " routine " miraculous ? griz attack survival story . No question , those were some tough times and rough conditions without the benefit of North Face parkas or search rescue . But the iron willed , iron boned heroes of the day weren ' t all big bearded white dudes .
