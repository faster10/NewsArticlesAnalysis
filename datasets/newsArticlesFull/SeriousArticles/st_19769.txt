Brian Kimberling : Some friends and I used to build fires on Indiana train tracks at night and sit around with a bottle of something purloined from someone ' s parents . I told this to an English friend who knew nothing about Indiana and who began imagining and describing a romantically desolate sort of place , forsaken by commerce and industry that ' s how we knew no trains would come through a place where there were no girls to talk to and no drugs worth taking , so adolescent boys played hobo together or whatever it was we thought we were doing . That is a very English way of viewing Indiana . It is also absolutely right , or it used to be . That conversation was a spark . I ran with it .
