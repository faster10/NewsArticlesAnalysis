When Alan Rickman first saw me , I was wearing black tights and six inch red heels and was swinging around on a rope . I was playing Captain Hook in a devised production of Peter Pan in my final year as a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . Later that year I had to suddenly apply for an Exceptional Talent visa just to stay in the UK and be able to work there as an actor . I wrote to Alan asking if he would write me a letter of recommendation to support my application . Not only did he respond very quickly , he wrote an initial draft in the first couple of days , trying to fulfil all the criteria that the UK Border Agency had put forward , and reassured me that he would help me in any way possible . He was incredibly kind and supportive through the whole process .
