Now at 4 6 , Jacksonville are somehow back in the play off race . Whilst their record virtually puts them out of the running for a wild card spot , the ineptitude of their fellow AFC South opponents has provided some hope . Indianapolis continues to lead the division but only with one game in hand at 5 5 . Houston s 5 5 record is nothing special either so if Jacksonville were to develop a winning streak , they could easily find themselves playing in January for the first time since 2007 . The Jaguars still have three more divisional games to play over the next few weeks . Those matchups look set to be amongst the most important for Jacksonville in years .
