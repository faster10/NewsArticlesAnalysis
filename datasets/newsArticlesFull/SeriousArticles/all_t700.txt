Madonna confirms she dated Tupac
Madonna has dated her fair share of men -- from husbands Sean Penn and Guy Ritchie to Alex Rodriguez and Vanilla Ice (the list goes on), but it's sort of a little-known fact that Tupac was among them.The Material Girl mentioned the late rapper in passing during an interview with Howard Stern this week.43PhotosMadonnaA look at the ever-changing but always controversial pop star over the yearsWhen the SiriusXM host asked Madonna about "contentious and uncomfortable" visits to "Late Show with David Letterman," she admitted, "Well, one time I was mad at him. When I said the F-word a lot...I was in a weird mood that day. I was dating Tupac Shakur at the time, and the thing is, he got me all riled up about life in general. So, when I went on the show I was feeling very gangster."Madonna and Tupac dated in 1994 -- two years before his death in 1996. Here are some other highlights from Stern's chat with the 56-year-old pop star: On Michael Jackson: "I could certainly relate to him on many levels, but he was also a very shy person. He was famous since he was a child and didn't really have a childhood. He was painfully shy...We didn't really have a relationship about me revealing myself to him, but making fun of the crazy world we were living and working in. We didn't talk about our childhoods...I think he felt eternally tortured. It was hard for him to look into people's eyes."On drugs: "I tried some ecstasy in the '80s, but I felt so ill for so many days after taking it. It wasn't worth it...I'm pretty fun when I'm drunk."On being raped at 19 years old: "I was in shock, I didn't know a soul. I was saying, 'Hi' to people on the street like a dork."Go to Stern's site for more interesting tidbits from the interview.
