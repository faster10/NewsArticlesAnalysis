" It has to be , " James said about sharing the ball . " We still can have a game where we don ' t move the ball like we should , but if we want to play like we did tonight and we want to continue to be successful over the course of the season , then we have to have those habits and we understand that it ' s just fun basketball . I mean , I ' m not just out there shooting a bunch of shots and I just know the rhythm and the pace and the energy behind the ball when the ball is moving and everyone feels in rhythm . It ' s a great thing to have and we understand that and we shouldn ' t take that lightly . We should never overstep that . "
