Is there a smoking gun in Isikoff s reporting ? Some documentary evidence to indicate that the Clintons or Obama or anyone else has done the Saudi royal family s bidding despite knowing what they clearly know about the nature of the Saudi state ? It depends what level of smoke you re looking for , but I guess not . Isikoff includes the requisite denials and reassurances from all parties : Heavens no , says Tony Podesta my work as a shill for the world s worst government is completely unconnected to my political fundraising . Human rights and core principles are super important , says a flack for the Clinton campaign ( in an email ) . The money trail doesn t look great , I would submit , but go ahead and believe whatever you want about Clinton s personal integrity and how it s not for sale at any price .
