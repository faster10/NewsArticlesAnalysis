The Broncos hiring of Gary Kubiak was seen as Elway hiring his friend . Although Kubiak had a solid run with the Houston Texans as a head coach , he was fired after a 2 11 start in 2013 and a 61 64 overall mark . Frankly , many called it an uninspiring hire , but Kubiak has disproven that ? ? all while navigating Manning s injuries and yo yoing between him and Brock Osweiler late in the season . That was a high wire act that many coaches might not have handled well . Only three first year head coaches ? Don McCafferty with the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V , George Seifert with the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV , and Jon Gruden with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII ? ? have won it all . Panthers head coach Ron Rivera , as you re likely to hear for the next two weeks , had eight head coaching interviews before he got his chance in Carolina . He almost didn t make it , though , riding through two rough seasons ( including a humiliating loss to the Broncos in Year 2 ) before changing his stripes as it pertains to aggressiveness and taking a turn . The Panthers have a chance to become the first 18 1 champion in 30 years . Rivera is coaching a terrific football team .
