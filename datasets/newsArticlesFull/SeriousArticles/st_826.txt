The facts suggest ISIS is on the decline and that the trend is accelerating . Geopolitically , it ' s lost a lot of territory and more is imminent . Important resources military , financial and personnel have been destroyed . The initial excitement and credibility of the caliphate ideology must be losing force , although this is hard to measure and the various terrorist attacks in different countries might suggest otherwise . Yet it stands to reason that like any movement based on fanatical enthusiasm , the longer ISIS is stymied and in fact losing ground , the less convincing are its claims to be the vanguard of a new world . It ' s also true , however , that Islamic State has accumulated pledges of allegiance by individuals and organizations in many countries , though not many recently . This apparent spread of Islamic State ' s reach is not what it seems to be it ' s not substantive , strategic or contiguous . Sporadic terrorist attacks continue across the Greater Middle East , Europe and one in the U . S . at San Bernardino . But their frequency and intensity ( and whether ISIS actually organizes them ) are far from what most people once thought would happen . No war is won by terrorism alone .
