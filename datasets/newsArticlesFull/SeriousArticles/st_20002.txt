If Edison Pena pays close attention , there are all kinds of memories to take from that house . On visits over the years , I ' ve jotted notations about Elvis ' record collection ( even Elvis had to listen to someone other than Elvis he had Dean Martin albums , a Peter , Paul and Mary LP , a copy of the once wildly popular " First Family " comedy album , featuring satires of the Kennedy family by impressionist Vaughn Meader ) about his gas station credit card ( from the Shell Oil Co . , issued to " Mr Elvis Presley , " his name typed onto stiff white paper in those pre plastic credit card days ) about the only portrait Presley ever commissioned of himself ( by artist Ralph Wolfe Cowan , showing Elvis dressed all in white , standing in clouds against a gold sky background . The framed portrait is an almost exact copy of an old Johnny Mathis album cover . Elvis reportedly saw that album cover , which was also painted by Cowan , and liked it so much that he ordered the same thing for himself ) .
