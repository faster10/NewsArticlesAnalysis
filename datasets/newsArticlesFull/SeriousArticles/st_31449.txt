Thompson : I ' ve optioned Kitty Kelley ' s book Oprah : A Biography . We have a fantastic take on her life , and we ' re talking to networks now , as we speak , and we ' re interviewing writers right now , too . I am from Mississippi , as is Oprah Winfrey , and I believe that her start on a rural country road in Mississippi to the world stage that she lives is a journey that is nothing less than miraculous . I think it will be the most fascinating biopic I ' ve ever done . I ' ve made the Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz movie Lucy Desi : Before the Laughter . I ' ve made the Sonny and Cher movie And the Beat Goes On : The Sonny and Cher Story . I ' ve made the Duke and Duchess of Windsor movie The Woman He Loved . And now I ' ve done Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton . I think the only thing I could follow all those up with would be Oprah .
