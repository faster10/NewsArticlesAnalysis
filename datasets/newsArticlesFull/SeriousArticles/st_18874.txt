This section of the episode seems like the world s drabbest buddy flick , as Eastman coaches Morgan in mental health and the two do their tai chi staff exercises by the river in the sunlight . Eastman also shows Morgan that he takes all the zombies he kills and , instead of burning them like so much chattel , buries each one in an individual grave marked with the zombie s name . Eastman is reclaiming their humanity for them , treating them like people rather than mere objects or monsters . Still , the whole time this was going on , I knew that Morgan didn t make it to Alexandria . I was just waiting for him to die of some horrible , ironic death .
