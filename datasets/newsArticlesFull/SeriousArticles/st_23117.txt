Building on lessons learned at Kiva , I ' ve now turned my attention back home to focus on serving small business here in the U . S . as co founder and CEO of ProFounder ( http : www . profounder . com ) . ProFounder is a crowd funding platform for American entrepreneurs to raise investments from their friends , families and communities . An unlimited number of unaccredited investors can invest and choose either to receive a share of the business ' s revenues as cash , or redirect them to a nonprofit .
