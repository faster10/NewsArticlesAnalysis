By Monday night , Antarctica was downright balmy compared to the bone chilling temperatures across the Midwest . A temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 . 8 degrees Celsius ) was recorded at McMurdo Station , a U . S . research center in Antarctica , while in Duluth , Wisconsin , it was a mere 2 degrees ( 19 degrees Celsius ) . Not much better was Green Bay , where a temperature of 1 degree ( 17 degrees Celsius ) was recorded , and 7 degrees ( 14 degrees Celsius ) in Chicago . Of course , it is summer in Antarctica .
