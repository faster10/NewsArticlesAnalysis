BUSH STILL THINKS HE ' S THE BETTER BET : The Jeb Bush that greeted veterans at an old Coca Cola manufacturing plant yesterday was technically the same man voters saw last week . His stump speech was the same , he spoke with just as many voters as he usually does and went over his normal allotment of questions . But there was something different about this Bush , ABC ' s CANDACE SMITH notes . For the first time in days , his appearance wasn ' t mired in talks of campaign cuts or failed jabs at Marco Rubio . Today , it was just about Jeb . " I hope you want a president that loves his country and means it , " Bush said As he spoke to voters in three different cities in the Hawkeye State , he rode high on his debate performance . Though he may not have won , it propelled his struggling campaign to more comfortable heights , amid discussions of a wavering donor base concerned about their candidate ' s prospects . http : abcn . ws 1Slvie7
