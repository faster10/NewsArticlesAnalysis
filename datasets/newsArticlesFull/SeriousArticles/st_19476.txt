Not everyone was there out of a deep connection to the man s music . Labyrinth was one of my favorite childhood movies , a woman in a full gold lam body suit and Bowie shag wig and lightning bolted cheek told me . That s about it . But I m from New Orleans , we don t need much of a push to dress up here . She added , Plus when do you ever get to second line with Arcade Fire ? I saw more than a few people ? all of them in their 40s and 50s , the age of blooming mortality fears ? dressed as Bowie in his final video for Lazarus , a simple cloth as a death mask , beads for eyes , silently , peacefully , they walked . Those moments of sober contemplation came as a relief to all the glitter and glam in the crowd . When the parade hit the river I looked back and saw posters of a younger Bowie raised high above the crowd . There you are , I thought . I missed your face .
