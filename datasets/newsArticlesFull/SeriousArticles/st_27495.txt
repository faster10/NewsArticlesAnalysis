" Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows " held onto third place with a 14 . 1 million weekend . The sequel , which initially appeared a major disappointment when compared to the original " Sherlock Holmes , " has redeemed itself handily in the last few weeks . After two weekends , " Shadows " was trailing " Sherlock Holmes " by 59 . 7 million , but over the past two weeks , the sequel has narrowed that gap to 22 . 7 million , and it now has a running total of 157 . 4 million still disappointing , but not nearly the disaster it first appeared .
