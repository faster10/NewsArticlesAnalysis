If you had to win just one game and could only choose between 2000 Trent Dilfer and today s Peyton Manning , would you pick Dilfer ? Eh . That would take some guts . But on just pure numbers , that Dilfer was better than this Manning . If the Broncos can knock off the Panthers , 2016 Manning deserves to at least share Dilfer s worst QB crown , meaning Dilfer could instead be remembered not as the hands down worst quarterback to win a Super Bowl , but as the guy who declared in September 2014 that the New England Patriots aren t good anymore . ? Congrats , Trent ! ?
