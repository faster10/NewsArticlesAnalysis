It is also important to remember that the disadvantages of defining a deal explicitly in law outweigh the theoretical negotiating advantages . If the point is to prevent a bad deal from being implemented by the United States , then Congress has less provocative ways to do so while talks are ongoing , including by refusing to fund the implementation of such a deal once reached . If the point is to create red lines for the Iranian negotiators , then Congress will have the opposite of its desired effect : defining a " good deal " in detail forces Iranian negotiators to cross our red lines to maintain their revolutionary credentials and sell a deal at home . Indeed , I have seen first hand how Iran tends to reject any P5 1 idea that is leaked , because , if accepted , then Iran would be forced to admit a concession . Negotiating in private , with U . S . and Iranian requirements neutrally described in public , avoids this morass .
