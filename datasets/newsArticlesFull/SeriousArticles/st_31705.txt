2 . Clinton made Sanders shvitz . Maybe it s the unruly white mane , the laundry sack off the rack suits or the Brighton Beach butcher s accent ? but the greatest misimpression about Bernie Sanders is that he s an all natural , unaffected anti politician who simply says what comes from his heart . He is , to the contrary , one of the most icily disciplined politicians around ( far more on message than Clinton , in fact ) and it s hard to knock him out of his crusty but loveable grandfatherly high road mode . But Clinton ? through sheer force of will ? put Sanders on the defensive , and ( for a while , anyway ) he seemed like just another lifelong politician covering his inconsistent record .
