McMillen said she ' s learning who her " true friends " are . They ' re the ones who respect her for taking a stance , defend her when others talk trash about her , don ' t turn their backs when she approaches and aren ' t afraid to be seen with her . Her girlfriend , too , has remained a constant support , even though she herself hasn ' t gone public . McMillen also said she ' s blessed to have family members who shore her up even if they don ' t all feel comfortable with her sexual orientation .
