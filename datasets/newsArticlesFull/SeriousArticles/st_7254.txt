We were due to proceed from Port Stanley in the Falklands to the world ' s southernmost city , the Argentine port of Ushuaia , on February 27 , having passed Cape Horn on the way . But early that morning , at around 6 : 00 a . m . , the Adonia ' s commanding office Captain David Perkins announced to passengers that he and the Chilean pilots already on board the vessel to help chart it through the Tierra del Fuego archipelago had been informed that the mayor of Ushuaia was refusing to allow the Adonia into port . We would therefore be carrying on earlier than had been intended to the Chilean port of Punta Arenas .
