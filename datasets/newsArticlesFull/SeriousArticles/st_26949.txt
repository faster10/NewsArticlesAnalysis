THIRD TERM WATCH : POLITICO s Glenn Thrush has a must read must listen interview with President Barack Obama who seems to put his finger down , subtly , but surely , for HILLARY CLINTON . Obama seemed to embrace Clinton s 2008 closing Iowa argument as much as his own , adopting her contention that inspiration without experience won t cut it . He repeatedly praised Clinton without reservation while offering more tempered praise to the surging BERNIE SANDERS , whom he sees as a principled outsider seeking to change terms of the debate that were set by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago . http : politi . co 23p2AjQ
