Harsh words indeed , but none of this matters to Cruz . He knows he s hated by his colleagues in the Senate and by establishment Republicans in general . But this is a good thing for Cruz . Being loathed by those responsible for governing plays right into his outsider narrative . When then Speaker Boehner called Cruz a jackass earlier this year , he responded by saying , I will wear it as a badge of honor because I refuse to join their club . The club , I presume , is everyone in Washington making a serious effort to navigate the challenges of policymaking in a partisan climate .
