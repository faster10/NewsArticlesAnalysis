In addition to direct human exploration of the seafloor , we need to mobilize a new generation of collaborative self powering robots that can explore the oceans , top to bottom , while maintaining communication to shore based scientists at all times . These robotic systems must be programmed with enough decision making autonomy to know when to diverge from a mission to follow something important and unexpected that they have encountered , and to know when to alert a scientist on shore to solicit input on what they should do next .
