In the past , the majority of Muslim countries supported Pakistan s just stance on Kashmir i . e . to implement UN resolutions that gave the right of self determination to Kashmiris . Now they advise Pakistan to resolve the issue through bilateral negotiations with India , knowing that such efforts were to no avail . In the case of Palestine also , the Organistaion of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) did not put serious effort into persuading the international community to help implement UN resolutions . Unless UN resolutions bestowing on the Palestinians the right for an independent state are fully implemented , there will be no peace in the region . In fact , the OIC is divided on a sectarian basis . Saudi Arabia and the majority of Muslim countries are on one side , and Iran , Iraq and Syria etc . are on the other . Iran has come out of isolation after striking a nuclear deal with the US and five other powers , and the sanctions have been lifted .
