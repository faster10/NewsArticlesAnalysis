Boston : Humanity . We as a species have faults and we still have wars with each other . I can still hear atrocities happening around the globe . . . . It ' s not because of a simple object that propels a projectile . It ' s because of us . We refuse to look at the root of the issue because it scares us . We give into fear and play to our emotions and we move to outlaw something that is not a cause , but just a means . I ' m not a psychiatrist . I couldn ' t tell you why there are so many . There ' s a deeper problem here . These kinds of things , and not just mass shootings , happen all over the globe it ' s not a problem specific to America .
