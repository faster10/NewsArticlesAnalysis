The Royals : This is not the same Royals team as last year . There are 12 new players on it . But they do have some of the same qualities you may remember . Just like last year , the team is a horror movie character that never dies . It has an as yet unquantifiable way of rattling opponents . Its hitters make contact , and put the ball in play . They take extra bases on hits and start running early to prevent double plays . And so they came roaring back against the Astros even though they were down 7 2 late in an elimination game . Also , they sport a collective . 284 batting average against fastballs 95 mph or above . These teams are very well matched .
