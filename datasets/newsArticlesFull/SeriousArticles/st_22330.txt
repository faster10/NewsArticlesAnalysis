CM : Hillary Clinton s career is tied with the rise of the Democratic Leadership Council . This was something formed in the late 1980 s essentially to move the Democratic Party further to the right and to push it into embracing economic policies associated with neoliberalism . And Bernie Sanders really represents what average democrats believe , which is the country has been taken over by a small group of wealthy bankers , and something ought to be done about it . And while there is plenty of criticism that can be made of Bernie Sanders , he is what the average Democrat believes . And Hillary Clinton on the other hand represents a right wing shift in the Democratic Party s politics throughout the 1990s . If you look at the attacks that have been leveled against Sanders recently , they are almost reminiscent of the 1950s . People are trying to paint Bernie Sanders as a communist , as if he is some kind of a Soviet agent . And these attacks have really escalated because there is a real fear again of what Bernie Sanders could become . Bernie Sanders has the potential to be something very special in US politics Bernie Sanders is emerging and becoming identified with a mass movement for raising the wages of the low wage workers , the mass movement against racism . He is becoming the candidate who is most identified with people who are politically frustrated with the emerging low wage police state . And because of that I think some of the forces in power are very frightened of him .
