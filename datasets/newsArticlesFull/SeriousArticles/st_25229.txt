It is a matter of letting everyone know what you believe in and all that you can offer . Though we are acknowledged to be the more verbal sex , we still need to acquire communications skills that include the ability to confront hostile actions , to motivate the disenfranchised , to reveal intensity of purpose and even to express anger .

" This is how a leader presents .
