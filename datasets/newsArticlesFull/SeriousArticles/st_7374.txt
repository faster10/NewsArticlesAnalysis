A lot of American fiscal conservatism isn ' t libertarianism per se but actually social conservatism , a form of the Protestant work ethic . Conservatives have struggled to persuade even their own voters to fight for limited government when programs aren ' t being pushed by liberal Democrats they distrust and benefit people who work . If a nontrivial percentage of culturally conservative white voters no longer sees a meaningful connection between limited government and their values , interests , or even livelihoods , that ' s going to be a problem for the right that outlasts Trump .
