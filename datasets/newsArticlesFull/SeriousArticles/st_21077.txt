While Hillary Clinton contrasts somewhat favorably for me up against Donald Trump , the differences between her and Bernie Sanders are incredibly significant . I ' ve already spelled out why I endorsed Bernie Sanders here , but no candidate has stood stronger against police brutality , stronger against private prisons , and stronger against economic inequality than Bernie Sanders . While Bernie Sanders speaks about taking on Wall Street and the health care industry , Hillary Clinton has been paid millions in speaking fees from those same types . Rather than tell you why you should support Bernie Sanders , I want you to understand that now is the time to make up your mind .
