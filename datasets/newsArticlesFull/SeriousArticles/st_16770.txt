The Angels ' playoff starting rotation was Jarrod Washburn , Kevin Appier , Ramon Ortiz , and John Lackey . I know this is asking you to go back a ways in your head , but that isn ' t a group with an ace , either . Washburn had a shiny ERA , but he was more like a dependable No . 2 or 3 . Appier was nearing the end of the road . Ortiz didn ' t become what he was supposed to become . Lackey was a rookie then , but it would be a few years before he established himself as a quality starter . As with the Royals , this group was by no means bad . But there ' s not a guy in there you ' d be afraid of .
