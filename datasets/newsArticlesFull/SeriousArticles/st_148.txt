Syria is the site of a traditional Sunni Shiite conflict . We have the Islamic State with its declared caliphate against all other factions . The United States opposes ISIS but supports the Free Syrian Army . Both Russia and the U . S . are conducting daily airstrikes in support of opposing factions in a relatively confined airspace . To prevent incidents , a memorandum of understanding was fortunately signed on Oct . 27 , which outlines rules and procedures for sharing airspace over Syria . The United States signed the memorandum on behalf of its anti Islamic State coalition , which includes Turkey . Clearly , if Turkey shot down the Russian bomber in Syrian airspace , then this would be a violation of the memorandum , and Turkey must be held accountable .
