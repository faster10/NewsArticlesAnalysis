The portion of service pipe from roughly the water main to the sidewalk is owned by the city . The remaining pipe running to the home is owned by the property owner . The city does not have information on the material used for the property owner portion . Prior to 1950 , it was common to use galvanized iron as a material for service pipes from the street to the home . The short connection between the iron service and the water main is made with a piece of lead pipe about 1 2 " in diameter and about 2 ' long . These connections are commonly referred to as " goose necks " because of the shape .
