The gist of mare clausum was that governments were entitled to exercise sovereign jurisdiction over sea space , much as they did on dry land . Coastal states could literally rule the waves just as they wielded a monopoly of legitimate force within their terrestrial frontiers . Selden insisted that England was sovereign over northwestern European waters including the approaches from the Atlantic Ocean high seas to Dutch seaports . Small wonder Grotius wanted to deny rival England the right to dictate the terms of his homeland ' s access to the sea lanes or cut that vital lifeline altogether . A similar quarrel played out in South Asia , where Portugal styled itself the lord of the Indian Ocean while the Dutch clamored for free access .
