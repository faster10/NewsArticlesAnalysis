Deen ' s response : " I do . It ' s funny . My great grandfather was so devastated . The war was over . He had lost his son , he had lost the war and he didn ' t know how to deal with life , with no one to help operate his plantation . There were 30 something people on his books and the next year ' s Census I go to find there ' s like zero . Between the death of his son and losing all the workers , he went out I ' m sure into the barn and he shot himself because he couldn ' t deal with those kind of changes . And they were terrific changes . I feel like the South is almost less prejudiced because black folks played such an integral part in our lives . They were like our family . "
