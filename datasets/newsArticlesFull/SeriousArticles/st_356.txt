Whether Myers is right , Golden State ' s success has teams wondering just how small they can go . If Green can play center for extended minutes , who else could handle it ? The question becomes especially pressing for teams that have to match up with Golden State in the playoffs . Perhaps the Spurs would have to cut Tim Duncan ' s minutes , and give LaMarcus Aldridge and Boris Diaw more time as the lone big man . Maybe the Clippers would have to sacrifice DeAndre Jordan and slide Blake Griffin to center . Why can ' t Kevin Durant log time there ? Or LeBron ? Or Paul George ?
