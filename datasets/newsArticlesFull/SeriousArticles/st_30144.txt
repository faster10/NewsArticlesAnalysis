And you can ' t blame him , either . Earlier in his term , Rubio made some attempts to pass meaningful legislation , particularly immigration reform , but it never happened . A Congress controlled by conservative Republicans has all but given up bothering to legislate , because Barack Obama wouldn ' t sign any of the things they want anyway , and compromise has become anathema to their party . This is the bed they made when they decided ? literally on the day Obama was inaugurated ? to oppose everything he might want to do . Whatever you think of it as a political maneuver , it takes a lot of what ' s interesting out of being senator .
