Make that an arm and a foot . If I were to have you name any two Cowboys , inevitably , the next name on the list would be all world wideout Dez Bryant , who has been sidelined since mid September with a broken right foot . I wanted to talk to you about Bryant s maniacal focus on becoming a better player and a better person , and how obviously it s paying off to even the untrained eye . I would expect him to pay immediate dividends upon returning to the lineup . He has to . Dallas is currently trotting out a three receiver set of Terrence Williams , Cole Beasley and Devin Street .
