Maureen was initially referred to Professor Goadsby in 2004 . Before seeing him , she ' d been given many different tablets for her headaches , including medicines used for depression ( some , such as lithium , can sometimes control pain ) , as well as epilepsy drugs ( which can suppress the over activity in the brain involved in headaches ) . But these only dulled her pain and wore off after a few hours . She ' d also been prescribed injections of morphine , and anti inflammatory medications such as steroids and diclofenac , which are used as painkillers for certain conditions including migraines .
