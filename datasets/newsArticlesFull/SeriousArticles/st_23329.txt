Dante ' s original " Inferno " guided readers through the most explicit journey of hell and purgatory ever committed to paper . Brown ' s " Inferno " takes a 21st century spin through a hell of man made microbes , pandemics and human overpopulation . The Brown hell is just close enough to the edges of biological reality to make for thriller reading . Biology as a discipline is indeed delving into human directed evolution and creation of life forms in ways that ought to be scrutinized . And while the real work of science is not dark and genocidal , as Brown portrays , there are risks of accidental release of modified organisms and , less likely , terrorism that merit wider attention .
