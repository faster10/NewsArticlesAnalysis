In his acclaimed autobiography , Gifted Hands , Ben Carson says he had an offer and scholarship from the West Point military academy as a teenager , which he declined in favor of Yale University . I was offered a full scholarship to West Point , Carson wrote , describing a meeting with Gen . William Westmoreland . I didn t refuse the scholarship outright , but I let them know that a military career wasn t where I saw myself going . As overjoyed as I felt to be offered such a scholarship , I wasn t really tempted . The scholarship would have obligated me to spend four years in military service after I finished college , precluding my chances to go on to medical school . "
