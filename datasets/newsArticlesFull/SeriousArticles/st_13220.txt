The Daily Mail reports that Hasna Ait Boulahcen , Europe s first female suicide bomber , was not always a radical jihadi . In fact , photos of the woman paint a picture of a girl who liked to party , drink , and smoke before turning to ISIS a month ago . Photographs of the female terrorist show her relaxing in a bathtub with her breast exposed and her face covered in heavy makeup . She also posted photos of her time out on the town , which included drinking and smoking . Her brother says that in addition to her party girl status , she was also known for having many different boyfriends . However , that all changed in recent months with the woman putting on a hijab a month ago , hiding her body for the first time .
