When a member of the U . S . military marries , he or she effectively gets a pay raise through an increased housing allowance . Even after repeal , this benefit will not accrue to married same sex couples . When a married service member is sent away from his spouse on a tour of duty , the couple is entitled to a family separation allowance . Again this will not apply to married same sex couples . If my partner and I were married and if the law allowed both of these benefits to accrue to him while he was in Afghanistan as they would if he were in a straight marriage we would have received an additional 10 , 000 that year .
