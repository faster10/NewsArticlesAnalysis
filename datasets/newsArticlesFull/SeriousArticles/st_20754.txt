DAVID SANGER , NEW YORK TIMES : You know , Bob , North Korea as a problem is not new . The armistice was signed 60 years ago , and it ' s been an on and off thing ever since with violations and so forth . What is new is a new North Korean capability . They ' ve now conducted a third nuclear test . And by all the early indications , this time it really worked . They have sent a missile as far as the Philippines . If you do the math on that , they ' re about halfway to being able to hit the continental United States . That is why you saw the Obama administration , which has not been a huge enthusiast in the past of antimissile defenses , say it was going to bolster the antimissile defense that ' s up in Alaska and in California .
