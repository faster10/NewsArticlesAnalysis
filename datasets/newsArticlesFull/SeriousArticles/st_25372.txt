Furthering the Phil analogy , Kobe went on : " I think Phil saw a lot of himself in Luke , honestly . And when Phil went down , former New York Knicks coach Red Holzman really took him under his wing . Phil did the same for Luke . Luke was apart of the coaching staff meetings , and Phil really brought him along and I think he still does . If you ' re going to have a mentor , Phil is a pretty good one . That goes for Kerr , too . Kerr has had a couple , and then Spurs coach Gregg Popovich . It doesn ' t get any better than that . "
