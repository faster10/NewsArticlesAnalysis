Honestly , Skyler is sometimes the biggest impediment to Walt doing whatever he wants . For the people who love Heisenberg , who love the badass Walt , when Skyler says , " No , you shouldn ' t do that , " they ' re like , " What is her deal ! ? What ' s wrong with her ? " Laughs I can understand that . I can . But having looked at articles that cite other female characters being attacked like this , I find it disturbing just in terms of a cultural phenomenon . I ' m not saying everyone who ' s into the show and has an opinion is like that , but I feel there ' s an element of that in there , and it ' s an interesting gender issue . I ' m glad that people are talking about it .
