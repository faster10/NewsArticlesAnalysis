Planning for graduation and the transition out of school begins when a student is 14 , seven years before he or she must , by law , leave the public school system . Terri Giampapa , the transition coordinator and job developer , works closely with families to help them find job placements , adult day programs , sports and recreational activities that will suit the graduate . As part of that preparation , students visit work sites , spend time learning vocational skills and get used to being in larger groups . Some learn to travel and navigate public transportation .
