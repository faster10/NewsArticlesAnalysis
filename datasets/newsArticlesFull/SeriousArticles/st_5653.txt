MRI research has found very large differences in brain structure between men who have a sexual preference for children and those who have a sexual preference for adults . These differences were detected as regions of low density in brain tissue called white matter . White matter is what connects the various parts of the brain , enabling it to function as a whole . The white matter that is affected in pedophilia and hebephilia is the white matter that connects the parts of the brain that respond to sexual images . ( Specifically , these regions were the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the arcuate fasciculus . )
