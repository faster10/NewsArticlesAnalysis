Curt Otto of Springfield , Virginia I waited in line for two and half hours to get this game at midnight . I purchased the Legendary Edition of this game at a hefty 130 ! Totally worth it ! Although I haven ' t slept since yesterday and I ' m currently at work and very tired , I would do it all over again for " Halo . " This is the GREATEST game ever crafted by the hand of man . If you own a 360 , buy this game . If you don ' t own a 360 , buy one and go buy this game ! The single player is incredible and the online multiplayer is MIND BLOWING ! Totally worth 130 ! ! !
