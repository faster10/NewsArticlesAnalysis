" I ' ve had worse . I ' ve had plenty of worse injuries than this one " , said Brady , who has had only one injury in his career that forced him to miss time a season ending knee injury in Week 1 of 2008 . " This time of year is about how you play , not who you play or where you play or any of that " . " We have a chance to go into the last six games and had some opportunities there and we didn ' t finish like we wanted to and the results didn ' t come up like we hoped to " . " We gotta amp it up and be ready to go " . There would be injuries the Patriots would have a hard time recovering from , most notably the loss of wide receiver , Julian Edelman to a broken foot in week 10 . " It has some value in terms of kind of having an idea of what you can get done in this situation or what your opportunities are " .
