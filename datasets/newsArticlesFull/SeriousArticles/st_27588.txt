Lin has also struck a chord among Asian American men . I have heard many negative stereotypes over the years . We aren ' t tall enough , sexy enough , strong enough or good looking enough . These stereotypes are still portrayed in our culture today . Just take a look at the Asian male character on the TV show " Two Broke Girls , " or read the crude sexual tweet by the sports columnist Jason Whitlock . I have faced my own share of stereotypes as a rare Chinese American television sportscaster . ( I believe I was the first in the country . )
