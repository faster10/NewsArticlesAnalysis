In a written statement issued last week , Oz said , " I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves . We provide multiple points of view , including mine which is offered without conflict of interest . That doesn ' t sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts . For example , I do not claim that GMO ( genetically modified organism ) foods are dangerous , but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world . I will address this on the show next week . "
