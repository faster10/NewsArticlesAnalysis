Whether consumers will be willing to pay for green energy remains an open question . One example comes from Pennsylvania ' s restructured electricity markets . In these markets , residential customers have the option of paying for " green " power , mostly from wind sources , and somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of residential customers do so . This green power , however , raises electricity bills about 15 to 20 percent . Moving toward a greener economy will further raise these costs , as it will become harder and harder to find green power sources .
