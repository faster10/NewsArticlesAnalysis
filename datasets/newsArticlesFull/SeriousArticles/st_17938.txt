Also of interest ? tonight is the budding contest between the establishment candidates . Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Chris Christie , and John Kasich are all competing for the same constituencies ? and the same donors . These are the beloved moderates whose only path to the nomination is via the establishment lane . As such , they have to sell themselves as viable alternatives to the outsider candidates without alienating the base of their party . They all need a strong performance in New Hampshire , and tonight is one of the last opportunities they ll have to change the narrative before those votes are cast . None of them have a chance to win in Iowa ( that s down to Trump and Cruz ) , and so expect them to tailor their talking points to more independent minded voters in New Hampshire .
