PNG leader Prime Minister Peter O ' Neill has indicated that the country could take in some 3 , 000 asylum seekers for processing , although no firm ceiling has been put on the ultimate number . O ' Neill has only indicated that the numbers of asylum seekers that PNG is prepared to take will depend on the country ' s capacity to do so . Although temporary tent shelters can be built within weeks to accommodate around 600 people , PNG officials have also indicated that permanent facilities to accommodate the 3 , 000 people will take two years to construct .
