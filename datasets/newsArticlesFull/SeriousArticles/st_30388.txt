Not having a reproductive health law is cruelty to the poor . The poor are miserable because , among other reasons , they have so many children . Providing reproductive knowledge and information through government intervention is the humane thing to do . It can help the poor escape the vicious cycle of poverty by giving them options on how to manage their sexual lives , plan their families and control their procreative activities . The phrase " reproductive rights " includes the idea of being able to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination , coercion or violence .
