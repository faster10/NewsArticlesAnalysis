This is a very intensely debated topic . One widely touted study claimed the policy reduced new births by 400 million . Other experts have put the tally at 200 million , a number still equal to roughly the entire population of Brazil . What isn t included in those numbers are the vast human costs the violence of forced abortions , parents denied the right to build the family they want , socially disruptive gender imbalances . Ripple effects of all these disruptions hundreds of millions of births prevented , deep tears in the social fabric , profound demographic imbalances will continue to play out for decades , as will debate over the policy . ?
