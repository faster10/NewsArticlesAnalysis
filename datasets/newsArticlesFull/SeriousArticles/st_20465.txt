Analysts said the drop in the yen so far was smaller than when the first and second round of quantitative easing were announced . Dollar yen jumped 4 percent the day the first round of QE was announced in April 2013 and rose 3 percent after a second round was announced in October 2014 . " Dollar yen did carry on rising in the days after QQEI and QQEII but we are not as convinced that will be the case this time around , " said Derek Halpenny , European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi .
