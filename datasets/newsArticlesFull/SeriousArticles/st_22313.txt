Teddy Bridgewater remains inconsistent . Minnesota ' s second year quarterback finished Sunday 17 for 30 for 187 yards passing ( he also had a 19 yard run late ) , one touchdown and one interception . His completion percentage ( 56 . 7 ) and passer rating ( 72 . 5 ) were pedestrian . Yet , the 22 year old Louisville product passed for 146 yards after halftime and made multiple long connections late . It wasn ' t a Picasso , but perhaps Bridgewater will glean confidence from Sunday ' s comeback win .
