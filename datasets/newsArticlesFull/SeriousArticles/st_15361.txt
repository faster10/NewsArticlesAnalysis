As Democrats , we believe in giving every eligible citizen the opportunity to vote whether it ' s early because they can ' t take off work on Election Day or absentee because they might have plans to be out of town . And we believe this for two reasons . First , when more people vote , Democrats win . That ' s because more Americans agree with us on the big issues and the big questions like who ' s got my back ? But second , it ' s because our democracy is better when more people have skin in the game . Our democracy relies on participation and we ' ve never done better by excluding folks .
