FEMA the Federal Emergency Management Agency was a late night talk show joke before she took office . Remember Hurricane Katrina and " heckuva good job , Brownie " ? Napolitano worked together with a top notch professional , FEMA Director Craig Fugate , to lead the federal response to historic natural disasters ranging from Hurricanes Sandy , Isaac and Irene to record flooding in the Midwest and major forest fires in the West . In the process , FEMA turned from a talk show joke into a top performing disaster response agency .
