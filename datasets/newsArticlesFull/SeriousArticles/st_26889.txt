" Dear Lord , we keep the families in Paris in our prayers , the children who ' ve been frightened to learn of the death of their mom or their dad or their brother or their sister . ? We know this evil can be all around us , but we know in the end it ' s the strength that you provide , the hope ultimately that you provide , that can help these folks deal with this terrible tragedy and recover . ? And we ' ll stand with ? them , Lord here across the ocean and the United States . ? We ' ll do the best to hold them in our arms , to be with them in this time of terrible grief and terrible tragedy . "
