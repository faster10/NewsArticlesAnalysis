Instead , Clinton should spin her incrementalist nature as being a positive thing . As I mentioned , there are plenty of Democratic voters out there who do agree with many of Bernie ' s issues , but who also feel that he ' s promising them too much . They want to dream big , they really do but they also don ' t want to be massively disappointed . For now , this means they ' ll probably vote for Hillary , whose platform does seem a lot more do able . Hillary should play this up both on the campaign and during the debates . " We can do this ! " she should proudly proclaim . " This is not some pipe dream of a new Utopia ! " might also work . Anything that reinforces " this is both possible and achievable , even with a Republican House " and plants doubts about Bernie Sanders being able to deliver on any of his lofty promises could work to her benefit . Her final summation of this strategy might be : " Let ' s build on the Obama legacy , and make it even better ! "
