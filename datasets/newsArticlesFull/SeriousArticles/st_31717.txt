By the Pentagon ' s own admission , building and operating three versions of the F 35 one for the Air Force , one for the Navy and one for the Marines will cost more than 1 . 4 trillion over its lifetime , making it the most expensive weapons program ever undertaken . And in an era in which aerial combat is of diminishing importance and upgraded versions of current generation U . S . aircraft can more than do the job , it is not at all clear that we need to purchase more than 2 , 400 of these planes . Cutting the two most expensive versions of the F 35 will save over 60 billion in the next decade .
