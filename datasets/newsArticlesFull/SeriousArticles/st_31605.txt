MANCHESTER , Iowa ? Ted Shelly , a retired funeral director , spoke on Donald J . Trump s behalf before a packed high school gymnasium of 1 , 000 people here at the Republican caucus of Delaware County . He used his speech to try to convince people that Mr Trump is , indeed , an abortion opponent . That was the only issue addressed by Mr Shelly , who began by describing himself as a Christian believer . Once the timer dinged , signaling he had to wrap it up , Mr Shelly added , Vote for the novelty !
