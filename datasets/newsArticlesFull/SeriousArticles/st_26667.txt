Momentarily , they played a game recognisable as tennis , mortal and lovely . The real Radwanska emerged , which salvaged some of her dignity , but only made it all the more frightening that this version ? had been so thoroughly suppressed in the first set . She worked the ball around the court , won a game on serve , and another on Williams ' s serve , to bring the crowd out of its stupor . She played perhaps the best crafted point of the match and Williams applauded . Her admiration was genuine , since she rarely had to bother with crafting points herself . Then she killed off the match anyway .
