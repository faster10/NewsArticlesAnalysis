This changed when I moved back to play for Glasgow . Suddenly , the derby against Edinburgh turned into a turgid affair when both sides seemed paralysed by the fear of losing to their nearest rival . One reason for this was they were seen as National Trials when you faced up to a player who you were battling with for the Scotland team . This meant lots of players went into their shells and made damn sure the opposition team and individual player did nothing to improve their chances of being selected for the national team .
