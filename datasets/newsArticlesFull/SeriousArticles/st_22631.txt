" But I am a guilt free person , " he continues . " Unlike Tiger Woods or Arnold Schwarzenegger or any of these guys that live the unfaithful , cheating lie , or even women who live that lie , I ' m not that person . I was when I was younger , but I chose the wrong girls to date . Now I still choose those girls , but I also know that it ' s not going anywhere . I don ' t promise them anything they don ' t promise me anything . It ' s very light . I have enough drama in my own life . Plus , I like having different girlfriends in different places that I travel . "
