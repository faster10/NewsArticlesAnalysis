Unfortunately , the self inflicted wounds of large publishers have already begun to render their businesses less relevant to the future of publishing . Authors are beginning to turn their backs on traditional publishers in favor of self publishing . Authors are now hiring their own editors , cover designers and marketing consultants . By assuming responsibility for the roles once played by publishers , authors are earning up to 70 of the list price as their e book royalty versus the 17 . 5 paid by traditional publishers . They ' re publishing low cost e books that are hitting all the bestseller lists . The all important access to distribution once exclusively controlled by publishers is now available to all self publishing authors .
