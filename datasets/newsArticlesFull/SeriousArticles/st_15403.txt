Jamie Vardy has scored just one goal since Dec . 14 ( eight appearances in all competitions ) , but remains the PL s top scorer this season with 16 goals . It s been a similar cooling off period for Riyad Mahrez , who has failed to find the back of the net in his last six PL appearances after scoring six times in three games in early December . With a glut of injuries decimating Liverpool s frontline , it s Roberto Firmino who s picked up the slack , banging in four goals in his last three PL appearances to give ? an otherwise floundering attack any sense of potency .
