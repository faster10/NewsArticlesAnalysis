Endless summers of going to other people s weddings give way to winters of divorce , and Christmas cards that arrive with names missing . A woman on the school run starts wearing a headscarf , and nobody needs to be told why her hair is falling out . We go to funerals of people who did not seem old . Things happen that all the music in the world cannot make better and suddenly just standing still ? still in that job , still married to the same person , kids all fine ? starts to feel like an achievement . The things we took for granted are worry beads in a string now , constantly checked over . Middle aged happiness is neither smug nor self satisfied .
