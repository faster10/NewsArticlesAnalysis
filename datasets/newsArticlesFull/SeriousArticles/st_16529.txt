Flash back to the present and we discover Morgan has been telling this entire story to one of the captured Wolves in Alexandria , in an effort to rehabilitate him , too . The only problem is that the Wolf seems even less interested in becoming a good person than Morgan was . He ' s ? ( and it is intimated , the rest of the Wolves , too ) only interested in stealing from Alexandria and then killing every man , woman and child there . It ' s a stance that puts Eastman and Morgan ' s no kill philosophy to the test , and Morgan leaves the prisoner clearly conflicted about what to to next . ? Out in the world is his attitude realistic at all ? Maybe , maybe not . But so long as the rest of the characters ( cough Rick Grimes cough cough ) continue on their violent paths , they are going to look a lot more like the Morgan of " Clear " and a lot less like the Morgan we know now .
