Just north of the Jemaa el Fna you ' ll find the myriad alleyways of the Marrakech souk , or traditional market quarter . No map will help you navigate these passages just accept that you are going to get lost and enjoy yourself along the way . While souvenir stalls are everywhere , you can still find shops selling items of remarkable craftsmanship that reflect local designs whether it is in the intricate patterns and colored glass of the hanging lamps , or leather goods from the tannery in another part of the city .
