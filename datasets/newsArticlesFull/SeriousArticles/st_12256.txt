The best analysis of Mr Khamenei s demands comes from Yigal Carmon and Ayelet Savyon of the Middle East Media Research Institute . Demand One : The U . S . and Europe must completely lift , rather than temporarily suspend , their economic sanctions , putting an end to any possibility that penalties could snap back in the event of Iran s noncompliance . Demand Two : Sanctions against Iran for its support of terrorism and its human rights abuses must also go , never mind the Obama administration s insistence that it will continue to punish Iran for its behavior .
