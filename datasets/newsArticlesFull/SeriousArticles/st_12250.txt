Bala had arrived in Toronto I was told with several of her colleagues from the censor ' s office . I know for a fact that they watched the movie . I do not know for a fact that they all liked it . I cannot say if any one of them stood up when , as the end credits rolled , the audience rose and gave the film three standing ovations . But I do know that Bala was gracious enough to tell us after the screening how much she loved the movie . At no point did she express any reservations about the contents of the film .
