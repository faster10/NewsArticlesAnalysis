I m the 9 11 generation . I was in London for a university open day and saw the second plane crash in to the twin towers live on television . But now , for the first time , I m worried to travel on public transport after seeing clips of insults and hearing of the abuse my friends have gone through . One of my friends had something thrown behind her , which sounded like a pop , and then the boys who threw it laughed and called her a terrorist . And I regularly see Facebook status updates about similar comments .
