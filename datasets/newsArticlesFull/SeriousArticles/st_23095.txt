British Royal Air Force Flight Lt . Caroline Paige : As a flight lieutenant , I serve as a navigator flying Merlin Battlefield Helicopters with the British Royal Air Force . The role of my squadron is to support the Army : from inserting assault troops , to resupply of austere bases , to escorting road convoys to casualty evacuation , and many other tasks . I am proud of the role my country plays in trying to stem the flow of global terrorism . I am proud of the military and the people who risk their lives in Britain and elsewhere around the world to do this and I am proud of my own military service .
