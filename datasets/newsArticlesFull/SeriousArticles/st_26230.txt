In the last debate , Sanders let Clinton get away with what many regarded as a weak explanation for her 2002 Senate vote in favor of an authorization to use military force in Iraq . She said Obama had respected her judgment enough to make her secretary of state . On Friday night , Sanders could point out that Obama may have done so not out of any particular respect for Clinton s foreign policy judgment , but in an attempt to unify the Democratic party after a bruising primary . Clinton has called for a no fly zone for Syria . Sanders should ask Maddow to ask Clinton what she thinks about Obama s new plan to station US troops there . An interesting contrast might emerge .
