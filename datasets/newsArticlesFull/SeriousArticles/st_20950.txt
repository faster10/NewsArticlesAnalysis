Cruz is staking his attack on Rubio s role in crafting and shepharding the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2013 . That bill ? crafted by Sens . Michael Bennet , Richard Durbin , Jeff Flake , Lindsey Graham , John McCain , Bob Menendez , Chuck Schumer , and Rubio ? was in line with President Obama s principles on comprehensive immigration reform , with calls for more border security , a pathway to citizenship , stronger employee verification measures , and fixes for the legal immigration system . There were differences ? the Senate bill had a longer path to citizenship that was contingent on more and greater border security ? but overall it had Obama s support .
