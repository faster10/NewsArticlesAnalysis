You get to see greatness up close and personal . The coaches always tell you this is what leadership looks like , " Miller said . You ve got all these greats that come through here , and they tell you this and they tell you that , but having a real life example right across just a couple feet from me and him being my idol , it was just great . I get to come in and see what type of shoes he wore every day , how he laces up his shoes , how he comes to work , how does he handle adversity from the injuries and all that stuff . I got to see it up close and personal . . . . It was great timing .
