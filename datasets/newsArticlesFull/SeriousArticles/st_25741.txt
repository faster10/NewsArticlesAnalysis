Carney : Here is what I say about that . He definitely doesn ' t and never has approached the job in a way that puts a high priority or focus on optics , and I think that ' s because 10 years and a few months ago if you passed him on the street , you wouldn ' t have known who he was . That makes him wholly different . What that means is , he is a different kind of person than the kind of person who normally takes this office . Sometimes that creates problems , but I also thinks it ' s why he is president , and why he was re elected . You can ' t be both somebody who emerged from outside Washington and catapulted onto the scene with a powerful message and also be a known entity to national political reporters and the general American public as somebody who was aspiring to the presidency for years . You can ' t be both . He is not a typical and never was a typical politician . That ' s an asset and a liability .
