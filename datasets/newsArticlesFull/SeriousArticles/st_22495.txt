Purple colors in the north and light blue represent terrains modified by the Veneneia and Rheasilvia impacts , respectively . Light purples and dark blue colors below the equator represent the interior of the Rheasilvia and Veneneia basins . Greens and yellows represent relatively young landslides or other downhill movement and crater impact materials .
