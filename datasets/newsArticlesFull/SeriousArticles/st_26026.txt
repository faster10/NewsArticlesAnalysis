The Clippers played two players the entire fourth quarter . One was Blake Griffin , who we covered , and yes , again , he was bad . The other was Jamal Crawford . Crawford , 35 , started the game with J . J . Redick out , and wound up playing more minutes than Griffin or Paul . That ' s understandable , because you want to save Griffin for crucial moments and Paul is coming off a groin injury . However , Crawford playing 40 minutes is inherently a bad plan vs . any team . Against the Warriors , given Crawford ' s , shall we say , pretty nonexistent perimeter defense , it ' s the equivalent of deciding to play dice with your life savings on the line , only you ' re rolling the dice into freeway traffic .
