If he is one of the attacking players in a 4 3 3 formation , with at least one midfielder holding a defensive role , then I think he can thrive in that position . He has the licence to break into the box from the deeper positions and face the play , rather than have his back to goal . I think that could work to his advantage . He also has the vision to play great passes and pick out his team mates from midfield , so I understand why Van Gaal wants him there . I can even see him at the tip of a diamond in midfield , but that seems to be the role for Di Maria .
