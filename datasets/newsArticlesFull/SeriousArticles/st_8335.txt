He thinks we live in a far more violent , desensitized society , and I find it harder to dispute what he says , Bloom said . Nothing shocks us anymore . Not just gun violence . Look at porn . Look at social media . People say outrageous things so often it s not considered so outrageous . There are no filters on anything . There s no collective grief anymore because we move on . What happened in San Bernardino will stay in the news cycle until something more interesting comes along . And it won t be long .
