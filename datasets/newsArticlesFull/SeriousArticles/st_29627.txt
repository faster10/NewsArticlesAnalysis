What it means : The Redskins dropped into a three way tie for first place in the NFC East with four games remaining . But this one hurt because the first tiebreaker after head to head is record within the division . The Redskins are now 2 2 in the division , so they still can finish with a 4 2 mark and control their destiny . But it also means that the Redskins have a ways to go in their rebuild . That should not have been in doubt before the game it s even less so afterward . Losing to Dallas makes Sunday ' s game at Chicago a must win if they lose , they ' d have to win out to have a realistic shot at the division title and a playoff berth .
