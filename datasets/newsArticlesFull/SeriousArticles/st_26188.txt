There is another potential problem . How will ministers be able to say there is intolerable pressure on services , including schools and hospitals , when their current line is that both are coping very well ? Jonathan Portes , director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research , said : There simply is no remotely credible evidence that current levels of migration , from inside or outside the EU , are an emergency for UK public services . In fact , schools in London , where the pressures are greatest , have outperformed the rest of the country by a considerable margin , as ministers have rightly highlighted . Pressures on the NHS are very real , but are overwhelmingly due to older Britons , not migrants ? who are mostly young and healthy . Waiting times are no higher in areas with most immigrants .
