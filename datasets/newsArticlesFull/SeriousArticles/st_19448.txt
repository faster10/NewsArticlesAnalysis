The current dangers have led me to read Thierry Wolton on the history of Communism and the voluntary surrenders that it brought about over the decades . But what is confounding is the degree to which , to cite Jean Fran ? ois Revel ( who was a friend of mine as well as of Wolton ) , knowledge of the past can go tragically unused , and how the same mistakes , the same willful ignorance , can return ? and not always , pace Marx , as farce . n Bernard Henri L vy is a founder of the Nouveaux Philosophes ( New Philosophers ) movement . His books include Left in Dark Times : A Stand Against the New Barbarism .
