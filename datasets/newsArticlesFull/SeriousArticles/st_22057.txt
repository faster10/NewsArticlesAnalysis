This Valentine ' s Day , I ' d like to call on all lawyers in Washington and elsewhere to consider helping stop domestic violence for good . The D . C . Volunteer Lawyers Project model can be replicated in any small town or big city . By giving victims a little pro bono assistance , lawyers can help make our nation ' s dinner tables , homes and families the safe and peaceful oases they should be . By giving a small amount of time , like the advocate who helped me so many years ago , we can all help victims of domestic violence .
