The past is always present in baseball it is " a haunted game , " as Ken Burns ' documentary " Baseball " intones , with typically perfect pitch . The best players of today compete not just with the players in their league , but the best players of all time . Statistics are the unlikely portal to this bit of metaphysics . Fans can compare players of different eras and dream up their own all time all star team . This is another reason to love the game : Baseball can inspire young fans to see the fun in math and history .
