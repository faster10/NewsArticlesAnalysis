Speaking at the rally , Vander Plaats invoked his severely disabled son , Lucas , and said he was outraged to see a candidate for president of the United States openly mocking and insulting people with disabilities . ( He was referring to Trump s scornful imitation of the disabled New York Times reporter Serge F . Kovaleski . ) Vander Plaats recalled that only a week before , at an event in Sioux Center , Iowa , Trump boasted that he wouldn t lose support even if he shot someone . The crowd in the packed hall hissed . Right away I thought of John Lennon and the Beatles saying , We re more popular than Jesus , Vander Plaats said . That s a pride , and an arrogance , and a temperament that is a roll of the dice to be president . ?
