The premier tight end play on the Wild Card slate is Jordan Reed against a Packers defense that submitted the 11th most catches ( 81 ) and 12th most touchdowns ( 7 ) to tight ends this season . Reed has been matchup proof , anyway , torching the normally tight end stingy Bears ( 9 120 1 ) , Bills ( 7 84 2 ) , and Eagles ( 9 129 2 ) in the season ' s final month . . . . The fact that top Packers CB Sam Shields ( concussion ) didn ' t practice Wednesday and Thursday bodes poorly for his chances of returning in the Wild Card Round , improving DeSean Jackson ' s outlook . Green Bay added LCB Damarious Randall to Thursday ' s injury report with a groin strain . This game sets up positively for Cousins and in turn his top deep threat . Were Shields healthy , he may have shadowed Jackson in this game . . . . Pierre Garcon scored a touchdown in each of Washington ' s final three regular season games , but he cleared 55 yards in just one of the final eight weeks , and never topped 80 on the season . From the Redskins ' Week 10 demolition of the Saints forward , Garcon averaged just under six targets per game . Garcon is a useful , scrappy NFL player , but his fantasy outlook is consistently pedestrian with Jackson in the lineup . Still , it is a player like Garcon who showed limited regular season upside and will therefore go low owned but is still long shot capable of hitting big in a plus matchup that could help win a DFS tournament .
