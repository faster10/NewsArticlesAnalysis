What do some of golf ' s multimillion dollar megastars do in their down time in the week before the Australian Open ? Nick into the barber , of course . Tournament organisers have ensured players have been ? pampered leading into the first round ? by having an on site barber at The Australian Golf Club . Chip Shots spied more than one player quipping how clean shaven they felt after visiting said barber . And we ' ve been told that none other than former top ranked golfer Adam Scott , the 2013 US Masters champion and at one stage one of the world ' s most eligible bachelors , made an appearance in the chair during the week . One wonders what the extra few dollars he saved will be put towards .
