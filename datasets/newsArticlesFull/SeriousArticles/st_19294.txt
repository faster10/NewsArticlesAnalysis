Ricky Gervais had it easy : He came into Sunday s Golden Globes with a reputation as a loudmouth ready to say whatever would provoke an uncomfortable laugh , and he lived up ( and down ) to it . He embarrassed Mel Gibson and offended a few other members of the club . It seemed gutsy , and at times it was hilarious . It provoked a shocked stare from Jane Fonda . But it s hard to imagine the monologue making any lasting change . Does hosting an awards show need to be about something more than exemplary entertainment ?
