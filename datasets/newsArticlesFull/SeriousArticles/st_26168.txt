We document the magnificent event from a behind the scenes perspective . Interviewing Von Furstenberg herself , along with supermodel Natalia Vodianova , and DVF Creative Director Nathan Jenden we get a sense of the unfolding of a magical star lit event . From fittings and dress rehearsals , to visits from the 9 year old granddaughter Von Furstenberg lovingly calls ' her assistant , ' we experience the excitement of the designer returning home to Europe and putting on a magnificent show to herald her arrival .
