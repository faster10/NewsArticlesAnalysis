I have a heart . I ll take everybody else , as some people chuckled . If people have no money . We all have a responsibility to make our voices known and vote for people who reflect our values . And if we have so many people of faith ? and the same thing was true among Catholics , many Catholics did not vote ? so if people of faith are not voting , it represents a great void in the political process . Jesus said , They persecuted me , they will persecute you . When you are having an impact on America , those who disagree with you are going to come out lashing at you with everything they ve got . But that doesn t mean single payer .
