In their respective debates , Republican and Democratic candidates should have had more extensive discussions of the Syrian civil war , the growing proxy war there with Russia , and the possible American quagmire . They also should have discussed the unnecessarily provocative U . S . naval incursion in the South China Sea to show the nuclear armed China who is boss there . Has any candidate of either party sounded the alarm over Obama ' s risky behavior that could involve the United States in a nuclear war over barren rocks off the coast of China in the Chinese sphere of influence ? Or more complaints might be nice from candidates about the bipartisan agreement to again bust the federal budget caps to pay for all of this imperial recklessness overseas , not to mention fiscal profligacy at home .
