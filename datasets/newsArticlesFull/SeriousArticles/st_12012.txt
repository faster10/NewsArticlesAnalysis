Pasqualino : 100 percent . I don ' t think there ' s one person who would like to see it get picked up any more than me . I fell in love with the project . I loved the style of work . It was my first leading American role . I had the most amazing time doing it . There is so much more that this young Adama can offer . This is the kind of age period where people start to find themselves . I think Adama needs to experience some highs and lows . I think we ' ve only touched the surface of his journey .
