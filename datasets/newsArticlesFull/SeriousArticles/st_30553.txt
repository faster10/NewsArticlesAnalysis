ML : No , I don ' t sit in a room writing a script solo . My films are highly structured . Everything you see in my films is very precisely written , very thoroughly researched , but actually it is done through rehearsal , it ' s done through improvisation and research . I work for six months with the actors before we shoot anything , then the shooting of the film is in itself then an operation of making the film as I go along in a way , although it ' s very structured . It ' s a very sophisticated thing .
