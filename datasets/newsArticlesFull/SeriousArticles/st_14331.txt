Kim Jong Il allowed institutions with the exception of the military to atrophy before belatedly revamping the party apparatus in September 2010 . The system is fragmented and stovepiped so that only the leader can exercise control . A vacuum at the top could lead to bureaucratic infighting , with no person able to step in and exert authority across institutions . The worst case would be anarchy or infighting among bureaucratic factions for political control . The main advantage that Kim Jong Un has is that the core leadership knows that if it doesn ' t hang together , it will hang separately . There is no viable alternative for survival among elites if the regime fails .
