He is , at the least , a matchup problem . Pierre Paul is , according to none other than New England coach Bill Belichick in a conference call Wednesday , obviously very athletic and has great length , balance , speed , quickness , good motor . So he s a tough guy to block in any situation and I m sure he ll be better this week than last week with another week of practice and that first game under his belt . We ll expect his best and try to prepare as best we can to handle him , but he s a great player .
