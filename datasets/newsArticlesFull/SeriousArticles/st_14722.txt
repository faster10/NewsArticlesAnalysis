Fantasy watch : Amendola rewarded fantasy owners with a nine catch , 117 yard performance before leaving . It was a quiet night on the fantasy front for tight end Rob Gronkowski , who was held to one catch for 10 yards in the first half and two catches and 37 yards overall . In terms of snaps played by Patriots running backs , LeGarrette Blount was charted on the field for 35 , followed by James White ( 21 ) and Brandon Bolden ( 12 ) . In the Sept . 20 game against Buffalo , Blount had played just seven snaps , so this was a change in approach for New England the second time around against the Bills .
