Abaaoud was the focus of a raid on Wednesday in St . Denis , a suburb on the northern edge of Paris that ended with eight people in custody . Mr Valls , in a speech at the French National Assembly , warned that we must not rule anything out when considering the possibility that terrorists might use chemical weapons , although he did not provide any evidence to suggest that such an attack was in the works . Mr Valls also called for reinforced tracking of movements of people within the European Union and urged European countries to improve the sharing of airline passenger information .
