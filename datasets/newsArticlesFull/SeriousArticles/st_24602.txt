Further complicating the picture , the United States imposed new sanctions on Sunday on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran s ballistic missile programme , even as it removed the old nuclear related measures and carried out an exchange of prisoners with Tehran . The new sanctions are much smaller in scope , but Tehran denounced them on Monday . Foreign ministry spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari said they had no legal or moral legitimacy , because US weaponry sold to regional allies was used to commit war crimes against Palestinian , Lebanese and most recently Yemeni citizens . The weekend lifting of international sanctions was accompanied by a US Iranian prisoner swap . Three of the five Americans released from detention by Iran were flown on Sunday for medical checks at a US military hospital in Landstuhl , Germany . ?
