It is true there are some court decisions ruling that a few parts of the Constitution do not apply to people who are not U . S . citizens and who are abroad , such as protections against unreasonable searches that would otherwise be illegal if conducted on Americans in the U . S . But those precedents have nothing to do with the Constitution s limits on government in this area ? there is no such limit on the First Amendment s bar against declaring an official religion , or such a limit on the Fifth Amendment s protection of due process . Under Supreme Court precedent , that protection applies to U . S . conduct impacting any person ? American citizen or not , wherever located .
