When it came to female pop stars , we were still reeling from the Britney Christina Jessica era , during which the only acceptable kind of femininity that presented itself was au naturel ? eternally sun kissed and low cut jean ready and never having anything too weird or opinionated to say . In this world , Gaga s take on femininity ? all boxy silhouettes , cyborgian dance moves , and grand , Warholian pronouncements ? was , to many , utterly illegible . I m not going to make a guy drool the way a Britney video does , she said in an early interview . W hat I do is so extreme . It s meant to make guys think : ? I don t know if this is sexy or just weird .
