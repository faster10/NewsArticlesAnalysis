There is a little truth in the assertion . All too easily however , it could become a self fulfilling prophecy , founded on misconception . In fact , Muslims constitute a tiny portion of the US population ? less than 1 per cent , a quarter of whom are not immigrants but African Americans who converted to Islam . They are as well , if not better , integrated into society than other immigrant groups , certainly much more successfully than the much larger Muslim populations in Britain , France and Belgium .
