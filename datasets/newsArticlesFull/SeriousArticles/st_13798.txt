Ashish Thakkar : Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent , I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I ' ve seen today . The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved . Unfortunately , it ' s one of those cases where perception is so different from reality . The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception . You ' ve got to remember , as Africa , we are 54 countries . Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues , but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit .
