The 20 year old ? Mondes played this season for the Double A Northwest Arkansas Naturals , hitting . 243 with 19 stolen bases in 25 attempts over the course of 81 games . While that steal percentage sounds good ? and Mondes s reputedly blazing quickness is obviously the big reason that the speed oriented Royals called him up for such a big occasion ? it s worth noting that the number is not that impressive and that his name is obviously playing some role in the hype machine . For comparison s sake , true speed monster Billy Hamilton had 75 steals in 90 attempts over 123 games for the Cincinnati Reds Triple A affiliate Louisville Bats in 2013 . ( Also for less relevant comparison s sake , Ra l Mondes s brother , Ra l Mondes , had 8 stolen bases in 12 attempts over 68 games for Tampa s rookie league affiliate Princeton Rays in 2012 . Ra l Mondes . )
