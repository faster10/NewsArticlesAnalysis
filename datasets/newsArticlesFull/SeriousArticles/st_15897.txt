President Obama , already under pressure from the Republicans generally for not being tough enough on terrorists and not doing enough to destroy IS , in his address to the American people on 6 December assured them that his administration would do everything possible , short of involving the US in another ground war in Iraq or Syria , to defeat IS in cooperation with American allies . The main elements of his strategy would be air strikes , Special Operations forces , and support to the US allies and friends in destroying IS . While acknowledging that Islam as a religion was opposed to terrorism and that the vast majority of the over one billion Muslims had nothing to do with terrorism , he called upon Muslim leaders all over the world to overcome the wave of religious extremism of which a tiny minority of the Muslims had become a victim . Domestically , he called for measures to make it difficult for potential terrorists to buy guns while reminding the American people that Muslim Americans , barring a few radicalized individuals , were peaceful and patriotic citizens who should not be discriminated against . On the whole , Obama s speech was a powerful appeal for reason and moderation to the audience both in the US and abroad , and for concerted efforts to destroy IS . Soon after the speech , the White House let it be known that a Summit would be convened on 17 December to choke off the flow of financial resources to ISIS .
