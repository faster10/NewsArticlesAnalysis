Rambling but in a jaunty , generous , let ' s shoot the works fashion , " Django Unchained " draws on dozens of westerns some of them American , others from Italy and Germany and includes a very funny travesty of the Ku Klux Klan that might have been an outtake from " Blazing Saddles . " It doffs its hat in the direction of German mythology , and the soundtrack samples James Brown , 2Pac , Rick Ross , Ennio Morricone and John Legend in the process . It ' s a big , brazen movie , brilliantly acted across the board , one of the best things Tarantino has done .
