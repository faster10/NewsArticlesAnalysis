Former ACMA president and MD Rane TRW Steering Harish Lakshman said : " Lot of damage in terms of our plant , all employees are safe but many many people have been displaced to their homes . The problem is mobile connections are very bad , hardly its working . so our own reaching has been a major challenge . As far as Rane is concerned three of our plants have been badly affected . All the machines are under water , the materials are lying in the plant . So even if we open plants on Saturday , it may take four five days to bring things to normalcy . "
