Israel is at obvious risk . Sinai Province , formerly known as Ansar Beit al Maqdis ( Supporters of Jerusalem ) , reportedly comprises mostly indigenous Bedouin fighters but also Palestinian militants from Gaza . It has a history of attacks on Israeli targets . Further north , suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people last month were attributed to Isis by Turkey s president . To the south and west , the group has expanded into Libya , perpetrating trademark killings of Christians and other unbelievers . Few in Britain will have forgotten last June s horrific beach killings by an Isis gunman in Sousse , Tunisia .
