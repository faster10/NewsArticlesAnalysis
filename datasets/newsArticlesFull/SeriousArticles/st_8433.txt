While he was still in high school , Rimac bought a lime green BMW for less than 1000 and began modifying it with new parts . " I couldn ' t wait to pull out ( the motor ) and put batteries and electric motors inside instead of the gas engine , " Rimac says . After several years of rebuilding and alteration , Rimac set a world record with his car , which became the fastest accelerating electric car in the world . The car is still recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest quarter mile by an electric vehicle .
