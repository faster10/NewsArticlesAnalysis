Rose , who told Cosmo last year that her experiences on social media had did help create the feminist monster that I ve become , has in just the past year become an anti shaming force to be reckoned with ? and she s done with her own cheeky sense of sass and humor . Last spring , she told the haters in no uncertain terms they can Kiss my MILFY ass bitches . ? In August , she showed up with Blac Chyna at the VMAs in outfits boldly emblazoned with sexist slurs . In September she appeared in a Funny or Die clip celebrating the walk of no shame . In October she led a Los Angeles SlutWalk . A nd now , speaking for the Allegedly podcast airing Friday , Rose talked about West s meltdown , and asserted , I would never talk about kids in an argument . It just shows what type of person he is . You took me around the world , we dated for , like , two years , but you re talking s t about Wiz and my baby . Don t talk about my baby . Unlike West , Rose wouldn t stoop to that . You know why ? Because having integrity has nothing to do without how much ? or how little ? clothing you wear .
