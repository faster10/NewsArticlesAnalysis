" I was talking to Mike Helton the other day , I said this might be the best thing we could have ever done for the quality of racing that we have ever done , " France said . " And he said , I think you ' re right . And we both kidded ourselves , because he and I both were the ones that were , believe it or not , against going forward with this format for a number of years . Advancing it to an elimination and winner take all scenario . But we got exactly what we want , which is great racing , obviously when you get great racing , you ' re going to get great moments , we love great moments as anybody in sports does . But more importantly , the thrill of watching the teams elevate to do things , achieve things , and I see on pit road , it ' s not just what the driver does , it ' s they ' re taking chances , their strategies , their preparation , and obviously the drivers are doing things .
