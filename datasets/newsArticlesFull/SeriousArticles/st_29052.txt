Lewis : It ' s really the underdog success story of it all . Everybody loves an underdog , but crucially , it ' s the message that a lot of people can have a pretty lousy time at school . A lot of people struggle in their younger years and I think people can relate to that . And Neville shows that ' s not the be all end all . You can still go on to do great things in your life . What I ' ve gathered from fan mail and meeting people is that that ' s quite inspiring , and it helps some people get over bullying at school or whatever difficult problems they ' re having in life . As an actor , that ' s the loveliest thing in the world to think that something you ' re doing , what your job is , is inspiring people .
