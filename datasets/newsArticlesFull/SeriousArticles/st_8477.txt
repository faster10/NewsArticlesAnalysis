Murray s first final in Melbourne was a chastening experience as Federer played almost flawless tennis to win his 16th grand slam title . The Swiss hardly made an unforced error in the first two sets while an overly passive Murray also served poorly . Still , he should have won the third , having led 5 2 , served for it at 5 3 and had five set points . In the trophy ceremony , Murray shed a few tears on court and went into a slump that lasted almost until the French Open . It was difficult for me to lose because I thought I was going to win , he said later .
