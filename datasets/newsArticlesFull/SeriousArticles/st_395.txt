I also have a positive side let ' s not be a wet blanket . It ' s not my intention for a song to be overly emotive or anything like that . Velvet Underground ' s " Who Loves the Sun " plays a very important part in how I write songs . That song is very ironic . If you ' re singing along to that song , you ' re singing this happy melody but you ' re actually singing about someone with a broken heart . It ' s sarcasm too , in a way . It ' s made such an impact on me , like the fact that you can do that with songwriting .
