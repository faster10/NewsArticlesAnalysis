What ' s been great is that Daryl has been the most loyal , almost blindly loyal number two that Rick could ever ask for he basically goes along with what Rick does . He ' ll disagree , he ' ll voice his disagreement and let Rick know his feelings , but also when Rick lays down the law , Daryl ' s right there stepping up behind . And that dynamic between the two of them has contributed to their success it ' s allowed our group to survive when so many other people haven ' t . And I feel like what ' s been great about that has been . . . you have a trusted lieutenant so that allows you to get things done , but I also feel like it is time for Daryl to come into his own a little bit , even if that means conflicting with Rick . I was honestly , as a fan , excited that Daryl showed a little bit of initiative .
