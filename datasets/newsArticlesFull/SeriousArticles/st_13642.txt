How exactly processed meat can cause cells to become cancerous is still being researched , but the chief culprit seemed to be chemicals involved in the production of processed meat , which can be converted into cancer causing compounds once in the body . Chief among these are nitrates and nitrites , salts which help kill bacteria in products like bacon , and which also lend them that distinctive pink colour ( without them , bacon would actually be grey . ) Grilling or smoking meat can also create suspected carcinogens .
