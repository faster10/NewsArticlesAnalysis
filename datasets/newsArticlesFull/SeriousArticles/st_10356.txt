Police in Fort Worth , Texas , filed a report Saturday after receiving a call about a disturbance involving Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel and a woman who described herself to officers as his ex girlfriend . Fort Worth police said a preliminary investigation determined that a possible assault might have occurred in Dallas , but that is not their jurisdiction . NFL spokesman Greg Aiello told USA TODAY Sports the NFL was aware of Manziel s latest incident and was looking into it . Manziel , the No . 22 pick in the 2014 draft , spent more than 10 weeks in a rehab center that specializes in drug and alcohol treatment last year after a rocky rookie season .
