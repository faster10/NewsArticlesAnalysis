The cynical side of me attributes the change to one thing : money . Modifying the guidelines to exclude a population based on age and " average risk factors " significantly reduces the number of mammography studies performed each year , which translates into millions of dollars paid for by insurance companies . We ' ve all heard stories of young survivors and women who were diagnosed who had no known risk factors at all . Such a broad brush elimination of a significant segment of the population will undoubtably result in delays in diagnosis for these women .
