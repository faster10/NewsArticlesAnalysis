What happened in Houston was atrocious , an embarrassment to sport , something the NFL seems to be mastering in . The NFL commissioner and his owners had a chance to save an NFL city . We know how much the NFL supposedly cares about its fans , from those NFL family commercials , from the way they honor the military and breast cancer fighters . But they ll only honor you if it s convenient to them . Here s a whole city , hundreds and thousands of people , the same people who packed the Dome when the team was run well and winning , the same people who spent hard earned money on overpriced tickets and jerseys , and said : We don t need you anymore .
