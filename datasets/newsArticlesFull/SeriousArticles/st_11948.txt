Yet the dour New England socialist is the sunny one in this race . Clinton looks back , and is frightened . Sanders looks ahead , and sees the America he s been trying to build since he moved from Brooklyn to Vermont in the 1960s : an America in which new mothers and fathers will be guaranteed three months of parental leave , the minimum wage will pay 15 an hour , free college tuition will be funded by a tax on financial speculation , and every citizen will be insured by a single payer health care system .
