In a dramatic twist to the San Bernardino shooting case that resulted in 35 casualties , including 14 dead , investigators are now focusing on Tashfeen Malik , the 27 year Pakistani wife of Syed Rizwan Farook , who reportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS on the day of the carnage through a fake Facebook account . The Pakistani media is also reporting that US officials have found Tashfeen had ties to clerics of the Lal Masjid in Islamabad , an extremist hub that was attacked during the Musharraf regime resulting in scores of casualties , including many women , and an eruption in extremist anger .
