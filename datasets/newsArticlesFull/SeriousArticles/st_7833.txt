Police unions say their forces are simply not adequately staffed and funded for the changing environment . What happened in Cologne was a result of the savings that have destroyed the police in the last 10 years , said Arnold Plickert , deputy chairman of the GdP police union . The number of officers in the federal , state and criminal police has been cut by around 13 , 000 since 2000 to 260 , 713 , according to the latest figures from GdP , although some federal states , including NRW are now boosting recruitment again .
