Sarah , a stay at home mother , began to drink more frequently after having her third child . She was often drinking alone , because her husband traveled a lot for work . " My social life is just so restricted I ' m home every night , " she said . " I used to have an active social life . Now , most of my evenings are about feeding kids , cleaning kids , putting them to bed and then collapsing in front of the TV . " Sometimes , she said , having a drink was a way to remember some of the excitement of her old life . Other times , it was just something to do .
