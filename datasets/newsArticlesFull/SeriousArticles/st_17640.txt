Here ' s my question : Is it possible to have these discussions without diminishing anybody ' s accomplishments ? Can you say you think James is better than Kobe Bryant without insulting Bryant ? Some people have trouble with this , but I ' d say that yes , it is OK to compare great players from different eras while acknowledging that the game has changed and current players are influenced by those who came before them . That ' s what Kerr did in that interview about the Warriors and Bulls , and , crucially , he did so with humor .
