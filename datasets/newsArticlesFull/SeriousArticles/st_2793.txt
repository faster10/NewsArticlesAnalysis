New England enters the playoffs having lost four of its past six games , which is the franchise ' s worst stretch at the end of the regular season in Belchick ' s 16 year head coaching tenure . But by securing a first round bye , New England should benefit from the return of key injured starters in wide receiver Julian Edelman ( foot ) , left tackle Sebastian Vollmer ( ankle ) and linebacker Dont ' a Hightower ( knee ) . The Chiefs may have suffered a major blow against the Texans if wide receiver Jeremy Maclin ' s reported ankle injury is serious . No other Kansas City wideout was close to Maclin ' s team best 87 receptions for 1 , 088 yards during the regular season .
