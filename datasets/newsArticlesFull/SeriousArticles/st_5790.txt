So why don ' t we hear more in the media about the activities of Mexican cartels on U . S . soil ? Mostly because cartels like to keep a low profile and blend in . Drawing attention to cartel operations in the United States is very bad for business and our law enforcement officers can generally be depended on to do their jobs . A big shootout in a San Diego shopping district or downtown Houston between dozens of heavily armed cartel gunmen and the U . S . Army isn ' t going to happen any time soon .
