" AAPM believes that we need to do research on cannabinoids to determine its safety and efficacy , " he said . " The problem with medical marijuana is that we never know using marijuana what chemicals are being ingested . That makes it really unpredictable , but the use of cannabinoids may well have a place in the treatment of pain and other diseases . The AAPM believes that the DEA should reschedule cannabinoids from Schedule I to Schedule II so that it will make it easier for research to be conducted . "
