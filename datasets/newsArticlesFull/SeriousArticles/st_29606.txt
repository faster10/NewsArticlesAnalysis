Decades of heavy infrastructure investment built what is today one of the world ' s busiest ports at Jebel Ali , and the world ' s most transited airport . At any hour of the day , Dubai ' s Terminal 3 is the single most cosmopolitan building in the world , with every conceivable nationality transiting , visiting , or settling .
