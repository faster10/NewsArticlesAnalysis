The Chancellor does not talk about how these cuts are needed to fund reductions in inheritance tax , but instead focuses on his fiscal charter to achieve budget surplus by 2019 20 .

Inflation and growth mean any deficit less than 3 per cent of GDP will reduce that ratio . What the fiscal charter really implies is that debt relative to GDP will fall rapidly .
