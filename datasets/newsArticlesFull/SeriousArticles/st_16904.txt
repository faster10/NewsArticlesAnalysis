" It ' s really fun playing opposite an actress that is talented and really listens and reacts , " Kunal Nayyar ( Raj ) told EW in the press tent before the panel . Inside the Saban Theatre , he told the crowd that he has enjoyed this storyline " because you play a character for six years , and in my case , you grow affection for that character . You really want to see that character succeed . It ' s really lovely to see him explore that side , which I think has been missed for so long while he ' s been seeing the growth of his friends . "
