Jacksonville Jaguars : Blake Bortles just came off a record setting season ( 35 TDs , 4 , 428 yards ) , and the Jaguars have finally found the franchise QB they ' ve been searching for since Mark Brunell . No way they ' d consider Manziel as Bortles ' backup , either . The Jaguars are interested in re signing Chad Henne , a veteran with whom Bortles has a close relationship . The last thing this team needs in Gus Bradley ' s make or break season is a boatload of off the field issues , and that ' s what you get with Manziel . Michael DiRocco
