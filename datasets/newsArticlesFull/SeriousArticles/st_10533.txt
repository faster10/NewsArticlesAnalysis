Israeli leaders , at least on the right and centre , might well feel bewildered if this came to pass . They would lose their trump card in elections : who best defends security ? The Palestinians would be putting their security totally into the hands of Israel . Also , Israeli politicians would find it hard to reject Palestinians agitating for the vote to elect an Israeli parliament . Of course , this would put paid to the concept of a Jewish state , which most Israelis would find impossible to agree to ( although a majority of Jews living outside Israel might well differ on that ) .
