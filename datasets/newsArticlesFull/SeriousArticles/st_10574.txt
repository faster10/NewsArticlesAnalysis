One evening in the weeks after September 11 , 2001 , I was having dinner with John Glenn . There is no American who has had the life that Glenn has : a World War II Marine fighter pilot who flew 59 combat missions , and who then returned to the skies in the Korean War to fly 90 more the first American astronaut to orbit the Earth and the greatest national hero of his era a United States senator for 24 years at age 77 the oldest man ever to leave the Earth ' s bounds as he returned to space aboard the shuttle Discovery .
