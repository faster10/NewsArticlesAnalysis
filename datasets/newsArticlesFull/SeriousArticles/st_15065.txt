" At long last , the government of Puerto Rico will work together with the Justice Department to end the rampant police abuse that has plagued the island for so many years , " Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement . " We trust that this historic settlement means that Puerto Ricans will no longer have to live in fear of their own police force . A court enforceable agreement like this ensures that the PRPD will be held accountable if it fails to overhaul its policies and practices . "
