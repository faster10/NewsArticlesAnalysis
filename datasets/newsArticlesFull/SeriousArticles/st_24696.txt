That ' s sort of the point , bien s r . Architect and former graffiti artist St phane Malka seeks out these neglected armpits of cities ' public space and transforms them into light , flexible , emergency housing . He calls the process " architectural kama sutra " because of the unorthodox ( and exciting ) positioning of the structures next to , above , or below traditional buildings and city elements . A kamp47 , as the Marseilles project is called , will be included in a series of similar efforts for Malka ' s book , Le Petit Pari ( s ) , coming out in February of next year .
