In coming up with a foolproof recipe , my first step was to tackle the crust . I tried just about every kind from butter to lard to shortening to combinations of all three as well as a few tricks , like adding vodka to the dough . In the end , I went with a mostly butter dough with a little bit of of shortening added for tenderness . This gave me a crust that tasted buttery , held its shape and was easy to work with . To solve the problem of shrinkage during baking , I added a tiny bit of baking powder to the dough ( a genius trick borrowed from one of my favorite pastry chefs , Nick Malgieri ) , which helped the crust expand into the pan rather than slip down the sides . And , finally , to prevent the dough from becoming soggy from the wet filling , I blind baked the crust until it was completely cooked .
