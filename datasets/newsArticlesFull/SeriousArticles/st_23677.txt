Indeed , Trump himself has almost certainly been benefiting from that same phenomenon . After all , Trump s lead in the polls ? which has persisted for months but now seems to be getting challenged by Carson ? seems only marginally less absurd than Carson s poll boomlet now does . Trump s polling probably can also be explained by media attention and name recognition , all of which was helped along when he spewed bile at debate moderators , insulted millions of Mexican immigrants , ranted about making Mexico pay for a new wall on the border , called everyone in sight stupid , boasted about his wealth , and so forth . Now , it s certainly possible that Trump has tapped into something much more serious among GOP primary voters , who appear to agree with his immigration views and may be responding to the peculiar right wing populist blend he has concocted . If he does show real staying power once the voting starts , we ll have to rip up our political rule books .
