Pauses . Let the record show that I m speechless . I have no easy answers for this one . What would it mean to right the ship ? You have some very profound and fundamental problems . You have every senator who has ever worked with Ted Cruz turning toward Donald Trump , because they can t stand Cruz . You have much of the infrastructure of the conservative movement explicitly saying that Donald Trump is unacceptable . That s a pretty profound breach , especially for liberals who are so used to seeing conservatives and Republicans as united strategic geniuses . Again , I have to end on that note of humility . Where was the original contradiction ? Where did this come from ? Is it , you know , really just this one guy with big hair ? Is this situation the result of the failure of political economy as practiced by the Democrats and the Republicans ? I don t have any good answers , and anyone who does , I think , is being glib .
