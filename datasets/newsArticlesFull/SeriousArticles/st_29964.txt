But how , after such bitterness , can the strengthened AKP government get Turkey s estranged Kurdish citizens back into a civil and negotiating polity ? This is doubly hard given the extent to which Erdogan has already trampled over the rule of law and hollowed out Turkey s institutions . But he is not solely to blame .

The PKK was overconfident that the de facto Kurdish autonomy spreading across north east Syria would seep into south east Turkey ? and that set off loud alarm bells in Ankara .
