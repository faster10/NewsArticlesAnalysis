Cleveland at Pittsburgh : I can ' t stop complimenting Mike Tomlin and Todd Haley for the job they ' ve done in Pittsburgh with a banged up offense this year . Ben Roethlisberger has been in and out of the lineup since the St . Louis game , Le ' Veon Bell is out for the season , and the offensive line is missing its starting center and left tackle . And yet , Pittsburgh ' s in the hunt with Landry Jones and DeAngelo Williams picking up the slack . Incredible to see them hovering in the AFC playoff picture , all things considered .
