So potentially that ' s why , a week after one of the most violent episodes of the series that saw the slightly ambiguous death of a fan favorite character , the show took a 90 minute detour into Morgan ' s past , chronicling what happened between Rick ' s last encounter with him and his arrival in Alexandria . But what may have intended as a breather actually feels a lot more like an abrupt stop , taking the viewer out of ongoing narrative of the season at a moment when what happens next seems the most important . In this episode we learn nothing of Glenn ' s fate ( well , besides the fact that Steven Yeun ' s name was not in the opening credits , for what that ' s worth ) ? or ? of Rick ' s as he is surrounded by Walkers in the RV , the two cliffhangers the show left us with a week ago . I ' m all for exploring these characters , but " Here ' s Not Here " felt off in its timing and its execution ( this , of all episodes , did not need to be 90 minutes long ) . ? Still , taken out of that context , there ' s a lot to like in ? " Here ' s Not Here , " especially in the fantastic performances from ? ? Lennie James and guest star ? John Carroll Lynch . Plus it ? does helpfully explain to us how Morgan went from the slightly deranged man we saw in season three to the cool , collected man of this season . I would have just rather gotten all that at a different time in the season , and in a tighter , more succinct episode .
