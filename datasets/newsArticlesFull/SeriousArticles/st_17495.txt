Three out of four nominations in the best Drama Series category are from on line streaming services Netflix and Amazon Prime , and that s not a judging quirk . Mr Robot and Narcos are both extraordinarily multi layered , expertly conveying entire worlds with intelligence and rigour . Outlander is tosh but deeply enjoyably and ravishing to look at . The presence of online returning favourites across the various categories ( Orange is the New Black , House of Cards , Transparent ) show that these companies have a continued commitment to the commissioned shows as the quality rarely dips .
