Jerry Palm , playoff expert : I ' m taking Alabama to win and cover for two simple reasons : It has the best talent and the best coach . That is not meant in any way to disparage Clemson and Swinney , which have had a terrific season . Watson and All America defensive end Shaq Lawson lead a very talented team that has yet to lose . Swinney has built a program that is an annual contender in the ACC , but it still falls short of the closest thing college football has to a dynasty . Alabama ' s offense matches up with the Clemson defense better than it did with that of Michigan State , and the Tide still scored 38 against the Spartans . Clemson ' s offense matches up better with the Alabama defense better than the Spartans ' did , but Alabama will wear the Tigers down in the end and come away with a comfortable win .
