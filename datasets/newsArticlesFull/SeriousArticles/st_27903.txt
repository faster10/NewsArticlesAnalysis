We know this intuitively , since we ve had to add numerous amendments to make up for their failures , lack , or just plain ignorance . But if we can add , we can also take away , by interpreting the Second Amendment differently or passing a new amendment that would effectively repeal it . We should never do so lightly , of course ? taking away rights can be , and often is , a risky enterprise . But the purpose of a right should be individual and collective flourishing . A right , in other words , has as its goal the individual and common good , even if we don t like to use such weighty moral terminology nowadays .
