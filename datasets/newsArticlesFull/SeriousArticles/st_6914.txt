But there ' s a thin line between world weary and tired , and Craig crosses it a few times . No accident he wears designer sunglasses more in this movie than any Bond ever . He ' s blocking it out , the spectacle around him , maybe thinking like Connery before him that this is too much of a circus and there ' s places he ' d rather be . " Casino Royale " and " Skyfall " held together as movies , start to finish . " Spectre " is a collection of scenes , some spectacular and some placeholders . It honors its history and uses it as a crutch . It ' s " Thunderball " without the light touch and the boring underwater scenes . Not bad , no need to wake Roger Moore from his mid morning nap and bring him out of retirement , but not special .
