So once again , and in lights , New York is about baseball at this time of year , after the city has not had a World Series in six years , only two since 2003 . At a time when the Jets have started the way they have and have such a big game on Sunday afternoon in Foxboro against the Patriots , and when the Giants are going to have a chance to win the NFC East because the East has turned into a division begging for gentrification , all anybody really wants to talk about around here is about baseball , about the Mets , about the World Series coming back to the city ? and into Citi Field for the first time ? next Friday night .
