Saudi Arabia is a sovereign state . Our Kingdom is led by our rulers alone , and our rulers are led by Islam alone . Our religion is Islam and our constitution is based on the Holy Qu ran . Our justice system is based on Sharia law and implemented by our independent judiciary . Just as we respect the local traditions , customs , laws and religion of Britain , we expect Britain to grant us this same respect . We do not seek special treatment , but we do expect fairness . I do recognise , though , that we in the Embassy can do more to create a better understanding of my country .
