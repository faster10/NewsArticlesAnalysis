When asked who takes the blame for that lack of discipline , Whitworth said , " I ' m a leader , so it falls on all of us . If any of us have let it slip , if any of us have let it not be important , then it ' s all of our mistake . Discipline , to me , is something that ' s taught throughout the year . It ' s not a one time moment thing . It ' s an everyday thing . It ' s just like raising my kids . Discipline is something I have to be consistent every single day with . I have to be consistent with things that are important , and as a leader of this football team , it ' s the same thing . It falls on all of us . "
