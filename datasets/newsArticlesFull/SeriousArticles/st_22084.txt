Nutt : Well , our biggest concern is that we believe that in the most in the majority of cases , orphans , so called orphans , in fact are not orphans they have at least one parent living and even those that don ' t , have a wider family that can look after them . And we believe that children in poverty should be best looked after by their own people in their own environment . And that people like Madonna and organizations like Save the Children are best off helping those families by building schools and supporting them to look after these so called orphans and not transporting them to live across the world in mansions , in pop stars ' mansions , that sort of thing .
