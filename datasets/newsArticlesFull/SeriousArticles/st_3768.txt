This week I was all set to write on the recent local bodies elections and their implications on the future politics of Pakistan . However , in the aftermath of the Paris attack and San Bernardino mass shooting incident , the world is changing in a direction much feared at a much faster pace . And that has forced me to shelve the local bodies election for a week . First , Islamic State ( IS ) carried out the Paris attacks . Then came the San Bernardino attack in the US . And in response to them came the extremist , hardline response from elements within Europe and the US . Most alarming of these responses has been from the Republican Party s front running candidate for president , Donald Trump , who has called on the US to ban the entry of all Muslims into the US indefinitely .
