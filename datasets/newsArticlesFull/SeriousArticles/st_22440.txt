Hundreds of Egyptians have also been sentenced to death , most after unfair mass trials . This includes a death sentence imposed on Morsy and some of his associates as well as the top leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood their convictions based almost entirely on the ' testimony ' of security officials , with no evidence presented to substantiate claims against them . Mass trials have also been used to convict others , notably in February this year when a judge sentenced the activist Ahmed Douma , a women ' s rights defender Hend al Nafea , and 228 others to life in prison simply for participating in peaceful protests .
