" First of all , forget the details , feed on the symbolism . Germany , Switzerland and Japan , the three great current account powers of the post Bretton Woods era , whose surpluses have financed the frivolity of baby boomer Anglo Saxons , are being told in no uncertain terms to stop saving . Whether it works or not matters less than the fact the disinflationary forces in the global economy are so entrenched that these central banks feel the need to set off on this path at all , following a trail of crumbs as they head for the gingerbread house . . . . ? Will negative rates dissuade an ageing population with inadequate pension and healthcare cover from saving ? . . . No . Will negative rates encourage investors to shift out of bank accounts and into higher earning assets ? Perhaps , but this is asking them to do what they already do . The yen already weakens in risk on markets and only rallies when a scary world encourages capital repatriation . Does the housewife who recently got stopped out of a short yen , long Brazilian real trade really need negative rates to lend more money to Rousseff and co ? Of course not ! She needs something to give her confidence in Brazil , not another reason not to keep her cash at home . "
