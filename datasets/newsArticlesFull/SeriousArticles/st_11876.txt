The lesson from this Jefferson Jackson Dinner , in other words , is that Clinton doesn t think she s going to lose and doesn t plan to start a serious fight with her only real opponent . Of course , Clinton tried this front runner strategy in 2008 , and it failed . Miserably . However , 2016 isn t 2008 , and at this juncture , there s no sign that Sanders can reach behind his base in the left wing of the Democratic Party . But if he can , then ? once again ? Clinton might regret this choice to play it safe .
