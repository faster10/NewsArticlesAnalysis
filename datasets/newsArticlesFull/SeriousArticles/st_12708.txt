It makes sense : If the boss sends you an e mail saying : " Meet me in the supply room for hanky panky if you want that promotion , " then you ' ve established the overture with one e mail . On the other hand , e mailing or telling a lewd joke may be offensive in one person ' s cubicle , but hilarious in the other ' s . It makes sense that hostile work environment requires more severe , pervasive behavior , or else the legitimate claims would be overwhelmed by the " can ' t take a joke " plaintiffs .
