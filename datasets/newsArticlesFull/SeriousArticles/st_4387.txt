These three are movies that have all the trappings of Oscar contenders , but never quite mustered the firepower to actually be ? Oscar contenders . All three ? were predicted to be major forces this awards season before they came out . And don ' t get us wrong : they ' ve all seen ? their share of respect . The stars of " The Danish Girl " and " Steve Jobs " both directed by men who ' ve previously piloted movies to Best Picture are still in the running for Best Actor . And " Sicario " has proven to be a serious player this awards season : It even landed a coveted spot on the Producers Guild of America ' s list of best pictures . So when we lump all these movies together at the bottom of the list , we ' re not saying they ' re bad , or even that they ' re not cut out for this awards season . But it ' s a competitive race , and there are too many other terrific movies for these three to stand out . So why not exclude them entirely ? It ' s not completely inconceivable that any of them will actually land on the list of nominees . Stranger , worse movies like " Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close " have gotten in before . ?
