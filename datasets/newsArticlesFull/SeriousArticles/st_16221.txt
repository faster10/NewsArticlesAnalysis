As Trump heads into Iowa and New Hampshire leading in the polls and looking likely to be the nominee , he risks doing permanent damage for Republicans with the largest of voting demographic groups : women . Women make up 53 percent of the population and turn out to vote at rates 10 percent higher then men . The only times Republicans have won the White House since Ronald Reagan is when George H . W .

Even with a female running mate , Republican presidential nominee John McCain lost women to Obama by seven percentage points four years later , Republican challenger Mitt Romney lost them by 12 percentage points .
