A : ? Researchers from Virginia Tech indicated their testing showed high levels of lead in water all around the city , but there are areas where the levels of lead and blood lead levels are highest . A mid section of the city showed the percentage of infants and young children with elevated blood lead levels tripled after the change in the city ' s water source . The zip codes 48503 and 48504 had the highest blood lead levels . Earlier this month , the state said its testing has identified 43 Flint residents with elevated blood lead levels , including 23 children younger than age 6 . Dr Mona Hanna Attisha has said those numbers minimize damage that may have been done to infants and children who no longer have lead in their blood but who have been permanently damaged by it . Lead only shows in the blood for about 30 days , according to the doctor .
