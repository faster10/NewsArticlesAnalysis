Some Republicans and European right wingers are intelligent enough to understand all this , one must assume . It s not some breathtaking new analysis to assert that the conflict between the West and violent Islamic extremism ? and the conflict within the Muslim world itself ? has more to do with ideology and economic conditions than with bombing sorties and boots on the ground . Either the leaders of the xenophobic right do not agree that they are doing exactly what ISIS wants them to do or they don t care , and both possibilities are equally puzzling . My conclusion is that some don t know and others don t care , and that none of them can help themselves . They are driven forward by larger forces they cannot resist or control ? by the populist upsurge of fear and animosity that is driving the No Syrian Grandmas movement , and by their not so secret conviction that the Islamist militants are right about the decrepit condition of Western civilization and democracy .
