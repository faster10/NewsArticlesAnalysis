LC : Well , so , that political revolution starts with the way in which the political system in the U . S . is so dependent on big money . This election year , which is the President , Vice President , 33 U . S . Senate , one third of the U . S Senate , and all the House members which is 435 is projected to cost 7 billion in donations . Well , who is it that gives 7 billion ? So , that political system is rigged . There used to be rules , limiting that , the court system here has thrown out the rules and made it very hard to get back to the fair system without a political revolution . So that s the starting point for why our campaign says we need a political revolution . We have to get big money out of politics . Second of all , we have ? to get voters in . At 35 states , more than half of the states , have passed legislation in the last few years making it harder and harder for people to vote . They have to register far in advance , they have to have documents to register that many citizens don t have . We ve blocked immigrants from being citizens , and therefore 20 million immigrants are not eligible to vote here . That s never been the case before . So that s what the political revolution means : get voters in , make it easy to vote , and get big money out .
