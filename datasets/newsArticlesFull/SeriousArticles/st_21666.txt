Arizona Cardinals : On paper , these teams are nearly identical . Good , big armed quarterback . Talented receivers . Potent running game . But the Cardinals are playing at home , where they re 16 4 under coach Bruce Arians and coming off an emotional high from beating Seattle . The Bengals are allowing the fourth most yards per carry ( 4 . 7 ) , which plays right into the Cardinals hands . Arizona has been averaging 4 . 37 yards per game Chris Johnson has averaged 4 . 14 . Cardinals 31 , Bengals 24 . Josh Weinfuss
