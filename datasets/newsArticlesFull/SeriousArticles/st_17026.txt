? Ben Golliver : The West still trumps the East . There s been lots and lots written about the East s improvement this season , and for good reason : There has been substantial progress since last season . This year , eight East teams are currently above . 500 , up from five in 2014 15 . This year , 12 East teams are playing reasonably respectable basketball , whereas only 10 fit that bill last year . This year , the East s No . 8 seed is currently 2 . 5 games up on the West s No . 8 seed , whereas the West s No . 8 seed finished seven games better last year . ?
