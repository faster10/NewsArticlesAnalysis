A lot of players on the ATP circuit bet on matches . However , they don t do it using their own name even in countries where betting is allowed . The basic premise for most betting is insider knowledge . The locker room in tournaments is not a place where secrets can be kept easily . Especially not when it comes to a player s physical makeup on a given day . When X knows that Y is not going to be able to play his best and is only showing up to collect his prize money , X tips off his people to bet against Y . This kind of betting falls in the twilight zone its illegality may be obvious to betting sites and the ATP as it is based on insider knowledge but for players it s a grey area .
