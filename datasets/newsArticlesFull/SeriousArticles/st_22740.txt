For years we ' ve seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and aggressively foisted on innocent young children , but kids today are being sexualized at younger and younger ages . A decade ago , parents worried about their teen daughters coming home from the mall with hip riders . Now parents have to combat marketing forces that are telling their third graders they need to have a padded push up bikini top , or their second graders that they need to have shoes that promote fitness , but are the same shoes sold to adults to tone and shape buttocks and thighs . Where does it all stop ? What have we come to when toddlers , not yet able to read , let alone make decisions for themselves , are getting schooled in dressing and acting sexy for adults ?
