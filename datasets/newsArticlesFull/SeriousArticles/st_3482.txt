Nuclear energy was a major sector of cooperation . The first discussions were between Areva ( French multinational company and global leader in nuclear energy ) and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited . When the US cut off fuel supply to Tarapur nuclear power plant in 1982 , the French stepped in to provide us with enriched uranium . France and India are really the only two countries that were interested in the fast breeder reactor technology . The two countries have also worked together on thermonuclear power projects .
