As long as future governments in India are beholden to big business , the best one can hope for is to have an industrial policy geared to encouraging only those large enterprises that can exploit global economies of scale , even as they are forced to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and required by law to allow for strong worker organisation at plant and company level . At other scales of enterprise , governments committed to boosting the home market should encourage the growth of state , private and worker managed enterprises that integrate job creation with the building of a green economy geared to social needs , taking its cue from the massive expansion of rural public works programmes that followed the introduction of NREGA in 2006 .
