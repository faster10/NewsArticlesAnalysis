Persistently low crude oil prices will impact India in several positive ways . There will be less pressure on the trade account , and probably a lower fiscal deficit , due to the lower subsidy burden . Fertilisers and retail petroleum products will cost less . The government has mopped up higher excise collections on petro products as prices have fallen . Non food inflation has moderated . The government has taken advantage of the lower oil prices and stepped up the pace to build strategic oil reserves in the country . This scenario also offers an opportunity to move ahead with policy reforms without causing undue consumer distress . For example , kerosene and gas subsidies could be eliminated , or at least , reduced substantially , by easing closer to market driven prices . The government has taken some steps in this direction and more , hopefully , should be taken in the coming months . The same holds true for fertiliser subsidies the subsidy mechanism for fertilisers requires overhaul .
