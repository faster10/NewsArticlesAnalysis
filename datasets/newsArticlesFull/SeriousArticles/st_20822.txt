Robert Art argues that the United States should continue to play a global leadership role , but that it cannot afford to do everything and thus must be selective in its engagements . He calls for the United States to focus its energies on providing what he calls " global public goods " that cannot easily be provided by other countries and that benefit both the United States and the world . These include protecting freedom of navigation on the seas , which undergirds the global economy , and helping to ensure peace among major powers , without which both security and economic prosperity will suffer .
