What this means is the Patriots likely will employ a far more aggressive man to man scheme . That kind of approach will get defenders down into the low parts of the field to challenge the routes early and not concede the one part of the field Manning can consistently exploit . There are several variations of man to man defense , but low coverage that plays with inside leverage to force receivers to outside breaking routes is the best possible scenario for New England . ? Very simply , the Patriots need to make sure every throw Manning makes is uncomfortable . No bunnies .
