That said , the Bengals brought it upon themselves . You have a game that is that close and has been chippy all along , as a coach during a dead ball such as that you call the defense together to huddle up and plan for the next play . You don t let them run amok and intermingle with the opponent . Huge coaching failure by the Bengals . Again . Marvin Lewis just standing there as if he doesn t even know or care what s going on at the moment . Paul Guenther as DC also should have taken some initiative during those moments , preventing what happened . They should both be fired .
