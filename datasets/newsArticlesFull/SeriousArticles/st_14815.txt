Making matters theoretically awkward for Trump , though , is something that s been well documented by now : He s previously cut checks to the Clinton Foundation , as well as to Hillary ' s Senate campaign . On top of that , he gave money to Weiner s congressional campaigns in 2007 and 2010 . ( Bonus : Trump s also given money to Chuck Schumer , who gets a small cameo in the ad and who has become a GOP boogeyman on the campaign trail thanks to his role in trying to pass bipartisan immigration reform . )
