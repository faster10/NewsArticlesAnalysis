For Rudd , on the other hand , Admission is the fourth bomb out of his five last releases . Though the actor ' s previous film , This is 40 , quietly blossomed into a mid level hit at the holiday box office with 67 . 5 million , his other recent efforts all began in the same sad range as Admission . 2010 s How Do You Know ( 7 . 5 million debut , 30 . 2 million finish ) , 2011 s Our Idiot Brother ( 7 million debut , 24 . 8 million finsh ) , and 2012 s Wanderlust ( 6 . 5 million debut , 17 . 5 million finish ) each hurt his box office credibility . Rudd tends to fare better in dude movies like Role Models , I Love You Man , and Dinner For Shmucks , which each earned about 70 million domestically .
