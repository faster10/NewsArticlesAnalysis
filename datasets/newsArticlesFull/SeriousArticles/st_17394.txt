The rest of the trip was an amalgamation of gigs , press and media , orchestrated by the record label I ' m working with Universal Music . We spent a lot of time in Mexico City , where I collaborated with the British Embassy on a project to promote the relationship between the UK and Mexico in culture , sports and music . I also had the first radio play of my debut single , hung out with some fans , ate an awful lot of Mexican food and drunk a little bit of Tequila too . My favourite place was a beautiful city called Zacatecas .
