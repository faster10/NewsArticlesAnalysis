James : I think he ' s perceived as one of the most fierce competitors , a five time champion , a two time Finals MVP , 17 All Star appearances . I think the media has done a great job of building Kobe as who he is today . There ' s no reason for me to say that the media has made him look a certain way . Throughout his career he ' s done unbelievable things , and part of the reason why he ' s as big as he is because obviously the work he ' s put into it but also the coverage that we all get from you guys . So I don ' t see it that way , and I don ' t really get involved in that side of things , but I don ' t see it that way .
