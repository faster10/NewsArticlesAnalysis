? No matter what you read back home , out here , or nationally . can t really see the so called trash talk of early in the week being that big of a deal . Antonio Smith was basically saying that Tom Brady does what any great competitor would do . he gets hit . yells at the ref to call it and then moves on . Smith has a good deal of respect for Brady ? you can see and hear it when he speaks of him . Now one can certainly argue that you should say ? zero , nothing ? but it wasn t a big deal to me . As for taking out Gronk by the knees ? We ve heard that time and time again . Even in listening to players here ? they are perplexed as to how to bring him down because he s so big . Also , more than one player was amused by Gronk s Twitter response back . But ? they all said bottom line . means nothing come Sunday .
