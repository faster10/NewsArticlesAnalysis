When you put your bird in a baking bag it makes its own awesome juices that are great for making gravy . Anything you place in the bag with the bird will add flavor . Throw in some veggies , even a green apple . You shouldn t need to puncture the bird for the stuff in the bag to flavor your bird or keep it moist . Beer ? You can always try it , but I wouldn t put the whole can in there , maybe just pour a little over the top and in the cavity of the bird . But don t ? use the juices for gravy if you re going that route . ? Instead try making this beer gravy ? from the Brooklyn Brew Shop .
