The handsome , sunny Rubio did well in Iowa among younger voters and the well educated he cleaned up in urban centres , which bodes well for the later big state primaries like Ohio and Pennsylvania . If Jeb Bush bows out , Rubio s native Florida is in also in the bag . So Rubio has the potential to do what Reagan did 30 years ago : Take the fury of grassroots conservatism , mellow it with humour and transform it into a strong electoral coalition . He has been smart enough to talk about education and health care ? the pragmatic side of Republicanism ? and to blend it with scathing attacks on Obama and Hillary . To borrow an old cliche , to vote for Trump or Cruz is to send a conservative message to Washington . To vote for Rubio is to send a conservative president to Washington .
