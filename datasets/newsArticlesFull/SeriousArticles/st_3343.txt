Martin says " Mylo Xyloto " was inspired by 1970s New York graffiti and the Nazi resistance movement known as the White Rose it ' s probably no coincidence both were about young people embracing art in times of turmoil . Here , Coldplay rage in their own lovably goofy way . On the rave tinged " Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall , " Martin imagines a revolution powered by dancing kids . " Hurts Like Heaven " might be the first Coldplay tune to which you can bust something resembling a move . The lyrics seem to be about fighting the Man " Don ' t let ' em take control ! " but Martin sounds ebullient over a sproingy New Wave beat .
