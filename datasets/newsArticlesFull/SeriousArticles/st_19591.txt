Caroling . The Todd Haynes lesbian drama Carol has been considered a front runner since it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last spring and instantly became a critical darling . And Oscar voters loved its acting ( nominations for Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara ) and its screenplay ( ditto for Phyllis Nagy ) , among other elements . But the film couldn t get over a larger hump ? it failed to land a best picture nomination and didn t score a director nod for Haynes . Perhaps the biggest surprise : With Carol not in the mix , this is the first time in eight years Oscar perennial Harvey Weinstein doesn t have a best picture nomination .
