So it ' s not wise to assume Newton will win one at some point if he doesn ' t take advantage of the opportunity now . If he does win , he ' ll be putting together one of the most unique football resumes ever and be just 26 years old . Marcus Allen is the only player ever to win a Heisman Trophy , national championship , Super Bowl and NFL MVP ( Allen got a Super Bowl MVP , too ) . Newton has the Heisman and national title and he ' ll get the MVP in a couple weeks . With a Super Bowl , we ' d view him in a different light for the rest of time . Even his biggest critics would have to concede . Yeah , he has a lot on the line .
