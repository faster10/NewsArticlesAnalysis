AB : What I was doing was going to the villages , buying food stuffs , buying everything needed in the kitchen and coming to the residential areas and announcing the things that I had to sell . It was a very lucrative job . I did it for some time and I saw that the work was so tedious because sometimes I had to go to the bush myself , carry the load , uproot the coco yam , cassava , and that stuff by myself and age was catching up with me . So I decided that this work , I can ' t do it for long because if age caught up with me I can ' t go to the bush to carry those food stuffs , so I decided to try another thing .
