Company : Tiffany Berkland and Elisha Morrow were sexually harassed by the same company commander when they were in basic training after joining the Coast Guard . Elisha thought about faking a suicide attempt to get away from him . They did not report the harassment for fear of being kicked out but came forward when they met a third victim . When their case went to trial , they met a fourth young woman who had been raped recently by the same company commander . Berkland and Morrow are guilt ridden for not coming forward sooner
