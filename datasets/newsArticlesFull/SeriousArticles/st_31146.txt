Terre de Haut , Guadeloupe You could be forgiven a double take upon arriving at Terre de Haut , a 45 minute ferry ride from Grande Terre , Guadeloupe : It ' s like a slice of northwestern France , with goats nibbling scrubby plants on the hillsides and a culture steeped in the ways of early settlers from Brittany . In the villages , fishermen still mend nets on their front porches , while women sell tropical fruit tarts ( called tourment d ' amour ) from wicker baskets . Even the 12 guest rooms at Auberge Les Petits Saints are decorated with French antiques ( petitssaints . com , from 131 ) . But it ' s not all about old times a cosmopolitan yachting crowd regularly drops anchor ( and their swimsuits ) at the west coast ' s Anse Crawen beach .
