As professional Republican pundits , operatives , and lawmakers , these figures care about the health of the party and their place in it . They want to win , and they want to preserve their influence . Trump appears malleable . Win or lose , they see themselves as safe . Cruz , on the other hand , is a threat . An unapologetic ideologue , Cruz isn t interested in outreach to the other side . Instead , he believes he can win by generating a wave of conservative enthusiasm . If Americans tend to punish naked extremism at the ballot box , then Cruz could cost the GOP the White House in a close election . And worse , as Feehery suggests , he could damage the party in Senate and congressional races . But beyond winning or losing , an ascendant Cruz brings a new class of conservative activists to Washington , who might displace the present establishment . In that sense , Cruz is an existential threat .
