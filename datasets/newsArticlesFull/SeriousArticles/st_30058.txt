Another alarming factor is the fact that all ISI agents active in India are trained . Proper training would mean there is some infrastructure and wherewithal on Indian soil . It is possible that the agents are sent to Pakistan or some third country for training . It is hoped the interrogators would be able to extract every minute detail about the ISI network and its nexus . This is expected to give a larger picture enabling our security agencies to bring to book all the players complicit in such anti national activities . The government would also do well to nominate a single nodal agency under a senior and experienced officer to coordinate the interrogation to join the dots .
