Burlington doesn t have the superheated housing market of Boston , of course . But according to John Davis , who now helms a consulting firm focused on community land trust development , the Champlain Housing Trust actually catches flak from NIMBYs for building too densely . All of the projects currently underway are multiunit apartment or condo dwellings , which include a 40 unit co op in the North End , a 20 unit apartment building in a growing suburban municipality , and 80 apartments on the Champlain lakefront . The land trust also recently purchased a couple motels the state was using to temporarily house homeless people , converting them into single room occupancy apartments with wraparound services for the chronically homeless .
