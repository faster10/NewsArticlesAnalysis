Mother Nature could benefit Bengals . One day before the game and the weather forecast still hasn ' t changed : it ' s going to rain throughout the game . According to Weather . com , temperatures in Cincinnati are currently expected to be in the high 40s around kickoff with an 85 percent chance of rain . That percentage will climb all the way to 100 percent throughout the night . Although it shouldn ' t get cold enough for freezing precipitation , the rain still could be an issue for both teams ' passing offenses . Footing shouldn ' t be an issue with this game being played on synthetic turf , but Bengals receivers are most concerned with having rain proof gloves that won ' t cause the football to slip through them . The inclement weather still means both teams could be relegated to keeping the ball on the ground . Advantage : Bengals .
