Palin s specialty is upending the news cycle , or kinda stirring things up a little , as she put it in Iowa on Tuesday . Whether it was her surprise selection as the 2008 vice presidential nominee , her abrupt 2009 resignation as governor of Alaska , her declaration that Obamacare had death panels ? which led to the summer of discontent ? or her endorsement of Donald Trump for President on Tuesday , Palin has proven adept at hijacking , irking and outraging the lamestream media , as she calls them .
