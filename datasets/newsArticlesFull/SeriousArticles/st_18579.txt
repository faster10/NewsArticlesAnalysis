Namely , what are we to do about the strongly illiberal convictions ? held , the data demonstrate , by majorities of Muslims across the Islamic world , convictions that , surely , have stymied any united Muslim attempt to counter ISIS ? ? Muslim migrants are now entering Europe , unchecked in any meaningful way , in record numbers . ? Given that Muslim majorities support making Sharia the official law of their lands , believe one must believe in God to be moral and that religious leaders should play a role in politics , hold that wives must obey their husbands , and favor stoning adulterers and putting to death apostates , how , if at all , are Western societies to adapt ? ? ( Majorities , Pew found , also profess to approve of democracy and religious freedom , which are simply incongruous with the beliefs just canvassed . ) ? How will peace and comity in our increasingly multicultural , multi confessional societies be possible if one group adheres to , and acts upon , violent and divisive dogmas inscribed in immutable ancient texts ? ? What is the best policy Western governments can enact in the Islamic world , given that military intervention has proved disastrous and counterproductive supporting secular dictators has resulted , eventually , in morasses of strife and mayhem and key Western allies ( Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Kuwait ) are clearly playing a double game by accepting Western backing yet propagating fundamentalist Islam ? ? It s a safe bet that neither Hollande nor Obama has answers to these questions .
