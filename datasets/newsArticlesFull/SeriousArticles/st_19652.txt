Longchamp ' s normally sparsely populated lawns will be packed this afternoon with 60 , 000 spectators . About 5 , 000 Japanese among them will be hoping their trio Just A Way , Gold Ship or Harp Star can give them a first win after near misses including second place for Orfevre for the last two years . The big worry for Hanagan , who landed the first Group One of his career at this meeting in 2010 with Richard Fahey ' s Wootton Bassett in the Prix Jean Luc Lagardere , is Taghrooda ' s draw in wide stall 15 . Treve won from there last year but she was the first to do so from a double figure stall since Dalakhani ( 14 ) in 2003 .
