I know who I am now , better . I was 19 when I got in line for " American Idol . " Nobody knows who they are at 19 you ' re not supposed to . I did this whole thing backwards . You come off a show like " Idol " and you ' re a celebrity , but for what ? You don ' t have a song on the radio , you don ' t have an album out . You ' ve been singing cover songs and you haven ' t done anything really . You have to develop backwards as an artist . Become a celebrity first and figure out " what kind of artist am I and where do I belong ? "
