A form also came home in Alex ' s kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom . I remember my mom being the class mom a lot and I loved the security it gave me to know she was so entrenched in the system . She knew the teachers , she knew the other moms , the kids , the school . She was also the CCD teacher , the Girl Scout leader , the carpool driver and pretty much everything else you ' d find under the overarching title of Kick Ass Stay At Home Mom . I don ' t have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom ( for now ) , but I do want to be involved . And the PTA seems like a no brainer , right ?
