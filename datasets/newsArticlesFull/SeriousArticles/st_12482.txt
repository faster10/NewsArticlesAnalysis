If that failed , the next vote would require 57 votes , then 54 votes , and so on , until the Senate reached a simple majority vote for cloture . To guarantee the minority adequate time to debate and amend bills , I would tie the number of days of advance notice of a coming cloture vote to the number of votes required for cloture . The fewer the votes required , the longer the advance notice . Coupling new cloture thresholds and notice requirements would allow the Senate to reach votes by simple majority while still protecting the minority ' s parliamentary rights .
