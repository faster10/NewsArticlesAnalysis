Instead of aiming all their artillery at the Tory massacre of public services , Corbyn and his team divert attention , raising contentious issues not on most voters radar . The pro EU case should be Labour s to own , hammering wedges into the Tory split . Instead , from Corbyn s camp comes a grudging near silence . Anti Trident replacement might gain support , but Corbyn s unilaterally declared unilateralism , refusing to pretend he d press the button , rules him out of No 10 in too many voters eyes . Agreeing the phenomenal expense of new submarines but empty of nukes looks the worst of all worlds . Why raise talks with Argentina on power sharing the Falklands , just after islanders voted 99 . 8 to stay British ? Or with Islamic State , right now , really ? What next , a united Ireland or handing Gibraltar back ? All interesting discussions , but they are no route to winning the necessary 94 English marginals where Corbyn must woo some who voted Tory last time .
