I calculate that if turnout is the same as it was for Cameron s re election last May ( 66 per cent ) , and he holds the referendum soon , he will squeeze through with 56 per cent in favour of staying in the EU . If he waits until next year and turnout is as high as it was for Scotland s September 2014 referendum on independence ( 85 per cent ) , then the vote to stay will get only 49 per cent . In other words , he will lose . That level of turnout would be extraordinary , but not inconceivable , given the passion Europe arouses .
