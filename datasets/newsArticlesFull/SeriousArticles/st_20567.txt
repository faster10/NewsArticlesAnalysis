I saw him at Winterland with the Edgar Winter Group , touring in support of They Only Come Out at Night , with " Free Ride " and " Frankenstein . " I didn ' t know who he was I didn ' t know anything about him . I had a soul band we were playing Tower of Power and James Brown and we sat there and watched Edgar Winter . I told my guitar player , " I want you to be like that " like Ronnie Montrose . And he ' s going , " I don ' t want to play that kind of music , " and I ' m going , " Well , I do . " We got into it . It broke my band up , seeing Ronnie for the first time . I said , " I ' m going to be like that guy . I ' m going to play guitar like that and I ' m going to sing like . . . the way I sing . "
