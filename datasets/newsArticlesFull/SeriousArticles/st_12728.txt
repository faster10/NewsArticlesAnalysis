Villa O ' Higgins , however , has remained somewhat isolated despite all of the recent developments . It was only accessible by plane until 2000 , when the final 62 miles of the 770 mile road finally linked the remote village to the rest of the highway ( via an hour long ferry ride to Puerto Yungay ) . Faustino lives 20 or so miles from Villa O ' Higgins , but those miles are of the Chilean Patagonia variety . It takes him several days to make his biennial trip , wrangling his cattle up precarious switchbacks , along the sides of ravines , through rapid mountain rivers , and , eventually , to town . He lived like this , without really seeing another soul outside his biannual trips into town , for about 35 years , until the boats came . First , about a decade ago , a government ship began cruising the lake weekly for whatever reasons the government had deemed important . Then came the semiweekly tourist ship that would take sightseers to the O ' Higgins Glacier a favorite among the global warming picture taking set .
