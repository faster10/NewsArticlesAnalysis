Donald Trump is pimping out Jesus for props . Well conceived blasphemy can be positive and I believe there ' s a place for even very irreverent jocularity in faith , belief and even ritual , but when I hear Trump , a man who so flagrantly embodies all that the Jesus of the New Testament is not , call Communion a " cracker , " now I am offended . Not because I am sensitive to Holy Communion jokes we make those at home but because it is clear to me that Trump has little use for Christianity beyond its potential to help him rack up votes .
