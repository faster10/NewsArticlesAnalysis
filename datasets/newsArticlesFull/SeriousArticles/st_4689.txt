Hart : Yes and no . At the end of the day your fans are the people who support you in and out . And their opinions matter . As a celebrity you can try to say you don ' t care and say , " This is my life , I don ' t live for other people " all you want . But we don ' t . We have no obligation to do things for our fans , but my feeling is that we don ' t get to where we are or get what we get without the support of our fans . So if there ' s questions going around that your fans have because of things that they ' ve heard , I think you do owe it to them to address it .
