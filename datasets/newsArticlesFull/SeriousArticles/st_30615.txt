Until she learned how to manage diabetes , Elizabeth found herself collapsing at times . " In this one particular tournament Elizabeth played in , her blood sugar was totally out of control and I kept hollering out to her , ' Quit ! Retire , you don ' t have to do this , ' " said Yvonne . " She stopped and she turned around and said , ' I can do this . I can do this , Mom . ' " Elizabeth went on to win the match and the tournament . " By the time we got home , she had collapsed on the floor . And I said , ' Sweetie pie , why didn ' t you quit ? ' " Yvonne remembered . " Because you didn ' t raise me to be a quitter , " Elizabeth told her mother . In spite of her diabetes , Elizabeth reached the No . 1 ranking in her age group in Southern California at 10 years old .
