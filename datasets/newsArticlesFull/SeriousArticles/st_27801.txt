It may be that members of the Republican establishment , in their trolling of Cruz , don t address Trump s own electability because they recognize it for what it is . Of course , this willingness to accommodate Mr Trump is driven in part by the fact that few among the Republican professional class believe he would win a general election , the New York Times reported in a separate piece about the establishment s supposed d tente with the mogul . In their minds it would be better to effectively rent the party to Mr Trump for four months this fall , through the general election , than risk turning it over to Mr Cruz for at least four years , as either the president or the next in line leader for the 2020 nomination .
