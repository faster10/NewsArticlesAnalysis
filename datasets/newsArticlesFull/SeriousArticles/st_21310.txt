Oklahoma survived a rare poor shooting effort from reigning national player of the week Buddy Hield and saw its vaunted defense allow No . 14 Iowa State to shoot 51 . 5 percent from the floor , but still found a way to pull out an 87 83 home win Saturday over the Cyclones . The hard fought victory helped the Sooners remain undefeated after 12 games for the first time since Blake Griffin led Oklahoma to a 12 0 start in 2008 09 . Kansas was much more convincing in its own showdown with a ranked opponent , pummeling No . 25 Baylor 102 74 on Saturday for its 25th straight conference opening win and 31st consecutive home victory . I think there ' s no doubt who the No . 1 team in the nation is . If ( the Jayhawks are ) shooting like this ( 53 . 7 percent Saturday ) and they take care of the basketball ( and ) defend , it ' s ( going to ) be hard for anybody to beat them , Bears coach Scott Drew told reporters .
