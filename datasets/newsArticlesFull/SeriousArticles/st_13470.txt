McCarron ' s performance in the opening half was enough to reassure Cincinnati that it can still win in the playoffs if Dalton ' s unavailable . An offense that was stuck in a deep freeze hadn ' t scored a single point in the second half in three straight games , and this game was the third coldest game in Denver history , with a starting temperature of 16 degrees . McCarron was 12 of 17 for 119 yards with a touchdown and no sacks or interceptions as Cincinnati led 14 3 . Now all they need to do to make the playoffs is beat Rex Ryan ' s Bills .
