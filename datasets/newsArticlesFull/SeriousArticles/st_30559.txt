There is some question about the competence of Cosby ' s original lawyers . It seems they proceeded with the civil deposition years back , in which Cosby discussed his modus operandi of using Quaaludes to seduce women his accusers say it was not a matter of seduction but of rendering them unable to function , so as to offer resistance . Generally , a grant of immunity is formal and written and might well need to be approved by a judge , but Cosby ' s lawyers went ahead , simply because the prosecutor said he would not proceed on the criminal case . It would hardly seem that this decision and any oral assurance would be binding , and certainly not on a future prosecutor .
