President Obama is not just attending the UNFCCC in Paris he is running it . The U . S . , as the world superpower with 800 military bases and its hand in every zig and zag of the Paris Process , is the elephant in the climate change bathtub . Whatever UNFCCC ' s achievements or failures , President Obama and the U . S . will be the chief architects . In my assessment , the U . S . tactical plan is to prevent any strong commitments in Paris that will expose the paucity of its own proposals . As I ' ll explain it is working to prevent a strong final document and is setting the bar for success very low so that the President can claim victory and protect any Democratic Party candidates from having to defend and run on a controversial climate agreement .
