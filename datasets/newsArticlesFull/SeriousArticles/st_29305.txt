It s indeed a scary thought about the precarious rules that govern our society . It s so scary , in fact , that for decades , we have collectively consumed cultural products that assert a more comforting reality . There is a reason crime procedurals remain some of the most popular shows on TV : they mostly show the system working as we d like to believe it does . This is what s so disturbing about documentaries like Making a Murderer or Serial . The kind of justice to which we feel entitled as citizens isn t just missing , it s shown to be merely conceptual and subject to regular human failings that make it unattainable ? even in the most obvious cases .
