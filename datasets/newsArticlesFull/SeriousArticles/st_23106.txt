If healthy ? Yes , I would . Milwaukee oozes young talent and Greg Monroe who was productive , albeit somewhat inefficient in the preseason is the post presence the Bucks lacked last season . Giannis Antetokounmpo is another year older and Milwaukee will eventually get back Jabari Parker , who showed flashes of becoming a fine scorer before a knee injury ended his rookie season . Michael Carter Williams is again a question mark MCW will need to get his three point percentage up and keep his turnovers down . In the West I might be a little worried . In the East , this team should absolutely be in the playoffs .
