Part of the challenge with pumpkin pie is that there are a lot of variables . First , there ' s the type of pan you use : ceramic , glass and metal all behave differently . Second , no homemade pie crust is ever the same plus , crust by nature is finicky . And , finally , pumpkin pie filling is a custard , which makes it difficult to gauge doneness . Most recipes instruct you to remove the pie from the oven when the filling is still a little jiggly take it out too early and it never sets up cook it too long and it cracks down the center ( or , in my experience , take it out at just the right time and still have it crack down the center ! ) .
