' Quite apart from Luis Suarez , I can ' t understand why Daniel Agger left in the summer , ' says Ince . ' I thought he was fantastic and left sided centre halves are priceless . Instead of spending 20million on Dejan Lovren , they could have saved the money . I ' d have spent whatever it took on a great striker like Edinson Cavani or Radamel Falcao , make a statement to replace Suarez and the 35 goals he scored . Instead they tried to buy five or six new players to share the goals around and it hasn ' t materialised .
