This second class status was further demonstrated when the national government and media seemed to lose interest in or concern about the shootings and the ensuing dialogue . Maybe it was too much to take in after the massacre in a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado . Maybe this was not tragic enough to get prolonged attention . Maybe politically , this is a powder keg . Whatever the excuse , it is not good enough . Michelle Obama is coming to Oak Creek , but she is not an elected official who is responsible for national policies that are at the core of this problem .
