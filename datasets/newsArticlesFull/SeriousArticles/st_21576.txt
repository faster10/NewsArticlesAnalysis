Where else in the world can you tell your significant other that you ' re just going to duck out for a three way and have them ask if you can bring them back some extra crackers ? Cincinnati natives will squabble ' til they ' re blue in the face over which chili parlor reigns supreme : Gold Star , Skyline , Empress or Dixie , but they ' ll all agree that this soupy , Greek style chili is the single finest spaghetti topping , alongside handfuls of fluffy , shredded cheddar ( three way ) , onions or beans ( add one for a four way ) or all of the above ( five way ) . Sop up any spare sauce with oyster crackers , or add a cheese coney ( chili and cheese on a hot dog ) for a perfect Queen City experience .
