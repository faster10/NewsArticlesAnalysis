What s the one key move the Steelers should make but won t ? Get a Heath Miller successor through free agency , maybe a young pass catcher with in line blocking skills , such as the Colts Dwayne Allen . Miller isn t done , but at 33 , he s getting there . He probably has lost some quickness . Fifth round rookie Jesse James has shown promise , but he is hardly a guarantee . A young , dynamic tight end could provide a lift to an already potent offense . The Steelers could play Miller and the new guy together in two tight end sets . The Steelers are loyal to veterans and aren t very active in free agency , so don t expect such a move .
