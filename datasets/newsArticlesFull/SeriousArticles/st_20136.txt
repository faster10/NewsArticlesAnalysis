Susan ( Teri Hatcher ) : She was waiting for the right moment to tell the ladies she ' d be the first one to leave Wisteria Lane so she could help daughter Julie ( Andrea Bowen ) raise her baby . Susan kept trying to fix Julie up with her hot young obstetrician , but that was really just to give Julie a reason to ask her mother if she thought she ' d ever find love again . Susan said she may have one more torrid romance in her , but if not , she had enough wonderful memories of Mike ( James Denton ) , who ' s dead , and her children to keep her warm at night . Julie ' s water broke as she , Susan , Gaby , and Renee were in the limo on the way to Renee ' s wedding .
