" All persons must be protected from violence , but codifying the classifications ' sexual orientation ' and ' gender identity ' as contained in S . 47 is problematic , " the bishops said . " These two classifications are unnecessary to establish the just protections due to all persons . They undermine the meaning and importance of sexual difference . They are unjustly exploited for purposes of marriage redefinition , and marriage is the only institution that unites a man and a woman with each other and with any children born from their union .
