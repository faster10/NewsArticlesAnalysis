" Any subpoena that is issued should be drawn as narrowly as possible , be directed at relevant information regarding a limited subject matter and should cover a reasonably limited period of time , " Cole wrote .

We take this policy , and the interests that it is intended to protect , very seriously and followed it in this matter . "
