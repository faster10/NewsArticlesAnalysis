1 . Phil Fish , " Barney Miller " : Detective Phil Fish was grumpy and sickly , and one of the most beloved characters in " Barney Miller . " Two years after the show premiered , his character earned a short lived spin off , called " Fish , " which focused on the detective ' s life at home with his wife and foster children . " Fish works best in ridiculous situations . Out of reality comes humor , " Vigoda told the Sarasota Herald Tribune in 1977 . " Fish won ' t change one whit as he attempts to cope with the kids . He will go to the bathroom in the middle of the night to find a boy in his favorite spot . He will be harassed and provoked . Asked to kill a rat in the house he will demur , saying the light is too poor for a shot . "
