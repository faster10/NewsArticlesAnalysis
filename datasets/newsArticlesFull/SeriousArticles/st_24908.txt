Manning has foot and rib injuries . The foot injury has been reported as a torn plantar fascia in his left foot . One of the game ' s true legends has not played to his normal standard all season though , at age 39 . He has a 67 . 6 rating , the lowest among all NFL starting quarterbacks at the time he was benched . There ' s no tangible reason , based on this season ' s results , to go back to Manning , though there is a well deserved amount of respect for him within the Broncos building of course .
