Sound familiar ? History will repeat itself in 2016 because Democrats in Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and every other state have more in common with my recent YouTube segment than a static poll number . I explain why I ' m only voting for Bernie Sanders in this segment , and why Sanders is more honest than Clinton in another YouTube segment . Also , the polling trajectory that I highlighted in an earlier piece is tied to why Hillary Clinton is unelectable ( I explain here ) due to negative favorability ratings , in addition to why swing states find Clinton " not honest and trustworthy .
