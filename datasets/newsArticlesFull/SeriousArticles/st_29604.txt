Mr Sarisuluk , who belongs to the Alevi religious sect , has been embraced by the HDP as part of its bid to attract voters aggrieved by the government , from young leftists and liberals to environmentalists , gay activists and women s rights campaigners . The party hopes to persuade the groups to band together again against the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) and its leader , the President , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who has alienated voters by exploiting ethnic , religious and political tensions to try to consolidate his grip on power . It was during the first major challenge to Mr Erdogan s authority , in the summer of 2013 , that Mr Sarisuluk s 26 year old brother , Ethem , was killed . Anti government protests that began in Istanbul spread to Ankara , and Ethem was shot during a scuffle with police . The officer who pulled the trigger ? originally sentenced to eight years in prison ? was released in September after the sentence was overturned on appeal .
