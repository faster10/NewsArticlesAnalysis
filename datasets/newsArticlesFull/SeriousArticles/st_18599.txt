So what would Bowie himself have made of all this ? Here s a man who turned down an CBE in 2000 and then , three years later , a knighthood , saying I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that . It s not what I spent my life working for . Of the many admirable things about Bowie , his unwillingness to accept the embrace of the Establishment ? we should forgive him his visit to Chequers : who wouldn t , given the chance ? ? was principled , and he was resolute in his stance in a way few artists and performers are these days . While he would have been unfailingly polite in response to a Prime Ministerial paean of praise , it is doubtful that the Thin White Duke ( a non hereditary title , by the way ) would have had his head turned by it . ?
