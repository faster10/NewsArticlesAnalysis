DiOrio : I think , based on what I ' ve read , people just have the perception that I think that gun owners are evil or don ' t care about gun violence . I realize that ' s not true , but I just think that people are very eager to talk about their rights but not always so eager to talk about collective responsibility and safety . Also , I want to set straight that I don ' t think Josh Boston is a disgrace at all . I just think that his letter could have been more sensitive to the issues . I respect him and his service I wasn ' t trying to personally attack him .
