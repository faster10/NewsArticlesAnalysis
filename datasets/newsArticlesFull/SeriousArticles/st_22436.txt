Formed by the collapsed roof of two sea caves , this " punch bowl " features dramatic water displays that are definitely worth the hike . An easy walk down Beverly Beach and a cliff climbing staircase leads to the nature carved basin . Spend the day exploring extensive tide pools , then amble back over to the bowl to witness the wildly churning waves that accompany high tide . The area also promises whale watching and birding . Seaside accommodations are within walking distance at The Inn at Otter Crest .
