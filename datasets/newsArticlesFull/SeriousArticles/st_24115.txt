The six game slate this week is relatively light compared with recent Tuesdays , and that makes fitting in the right star players even more crucial . The five most expensive players , regardless of position , are Stephen Curry ( 10 , 900 ) , Paul George ( 9 , 500 ) , Damian Lillard ( 9 , 400 ) , Blake Griffin ( 9 , 200 ) and John Wall ( 8 , 900 ) . Curry seems like the obvious play , as he is every week , but Lillard and Wall do present attractive , high ceilinged options at more affordable prices . We don t like to tempt fate here , though . We re not fading Curry , though there is the concern that the Warriors destroy the Lakers and Curry sits the entire fourth quarter . Of course , in that eventuality , Curry likely would have had a lot to do with the game getting to that point .
