While none of that is inconceivable , I can ' t buy it . I think the Patriots are simply a much better team . They have a very good , well coached defense that can shut down Denver ' s limited offense , and an offense that will figure out a way to put up points . The Patriots looked relatively healthy last week against the Chiefs , and a lot like the team that started this season 10 0 . They ' d be better off with some more offensive balance , but they have won big without much of a running game before .
