" The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , I still possess the ability to prove that I am human . Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things . But no matter the label attached to me , I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact . . . Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me , or anyone . "
