ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : As surely as it s President Obama s Democratic Party until it won t be , it s Paul Ryan s Republican party until it can t be any longer . The new House speaker made that clear in Obama s last State of the Union and Ryan s first as speaker , new poker ( and beardless ) face and all . Ryan s choice of South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley to deliver the GOP response was borne out by a strong national debut speech that , notably , took on Donald Trump style rhetoric ( angriest voices ) as strongly as it did Obama style policy . And Ryan took a stand of his own by applauding the president s call to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion ? another clear Trump reference . Coming from Ryan , this is more than the establishment trying to rid itself of Trump . It s a vision of a future of the GOP , in a House chamber with a different vibe than it had just a few months ago .
