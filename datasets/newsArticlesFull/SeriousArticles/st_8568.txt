As one student told me : " The legal firewall between universities and parents is unnecessarily strict . College life is a period of growth , and the university system does not always provide adequate guidance toward that end . Parents conintue to play a major role and should be encouraged , not dissuaded from doing so . Those students hoping to keep their affairs secret will just have to learn better discretion , which is in itself an important life skill for those hoping to hold on to their privacy in the modern world .
