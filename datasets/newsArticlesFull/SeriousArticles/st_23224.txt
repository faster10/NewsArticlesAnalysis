Right off the bat , we need to remember that the Affordable Care Act makes significant cuts to future Medicare spending . Reductions in overpayments for Medicare Advantage constitute almost 140 billion in savings over a decade . Changes in the fee for service reimbursement schedule add up to almost 200 billion . That ' s an enormous amount of money , so large that it scared many people into thinking that Medicare would be severely curtailed . Running against Medicare cuts helped sweep the Republicans into power in the House of Representatives in 2010 . Often , such arguments came from the same people now decrying the Affordable Care Act for not cutting health care spending enough .
