Volatility in recent prior GOP primary contests has been driven by dissatisfaction with the presumptive nominee : McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012 . But there is no establishment candidate or presumptive nominee to be dissatisfied with this time . Instead , there ' s a candidate from far outside that establishment , who is running explicitly against that establishment , but not running a particularly ideological campaign ? certainly not one that lines up with traditional conservative shibboleths ( which is what Cruz is doing ) . The extraordinary stability of the Trump vote may be a sign not merely of the high name recognition of the candidate , but the wide and deep appeal of that stance ? or of Trump personally .
