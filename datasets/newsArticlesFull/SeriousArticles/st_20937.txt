Said JD ( U ) Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar : The BJP has been resorting to old gimmicks to polarise polls . It knows it s very weak in Seemanchal and Kosi and is trying to divide voters on communal lines . But voters have become mature and cannot fall for such a trap . Said RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha : It is not just about the Bihar election but about what message the BJP wants to give to a democratic country . The BJP has scant respect for institutions . It senses a rout in the Bihar polls which is why it has stooped so low .
