Some may think that there is a random element to drone strikes . But that is far from the truth . Jihadi John was not killed because the British and Americans got lucky he was killed because he had been identified , watched , followed and then attacked with lethal precision . Drones have the capability to linger at high altitude over a potential target ? for days , if necessary ? to build up a detailed picture of the pattern of life of a particular individual , or within a building or vehicle . The decision to strike with lethal force is only taken when there is a very high degree of certainty that the effect of that attack will have the intended result . Potential damage to surrounding buildings and to other people will have been carefully evaluated . Among those involved in the attack decision making process will be an international lawyer . Little is left to chance .
