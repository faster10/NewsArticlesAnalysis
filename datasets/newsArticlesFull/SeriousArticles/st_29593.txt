I have been involved in storm research and or the storm chasing community since 1985 . In this 28 year span , there had not been a death , and I know of no injuries among meteorologists studying tornadic storms until now . It will be several days before the exact circumstances of this tragic loss become clear . But even before the storm that ravaged the El Reno and Union City , Oklahoma , areas occurred , many questions appeared in the media about storm chasing , or storm observing in the field .
