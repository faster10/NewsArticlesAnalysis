Thank you for Lazarus and Blackstar . I am a palliative care doctor , and what you have done in the time surrounding your death has had a profound effect on me and many people I work with . Your album is strewn with references , hints and allusions . As always , you don t make interpretation all that easy , but perhaps that isn t the point . I have often heard how meticulous you were in your life . For me , the fact that your gentle death at home coincided so closely with the release of your album , with its good bye message , in my mind is unlikely to be coincidence . All of this was carefully planned , to become a work of death art . The video of Lazarus is very deep and many of the scenes will mean different things to us all for me it is about dealing with the past when you are faced with inevitable death .
