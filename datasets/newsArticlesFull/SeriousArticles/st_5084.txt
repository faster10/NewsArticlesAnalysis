Thankfully , what Chiles didn ' t try to do was change his personality to fit . That would have made him look like a fake , which I don ' t see him as . But he didn ' t adjust his approach . This became particularly clear with his frequent launching of custard pies in the direction of , in particular , Martin O ' Neil and Roy Keane . These would often come back with interest . Chiles was determined to maintain the sense that we were all just a bunch of pals watching the footy down the pub together . But it increasingly didn ' t seem to sit well .
