In December 2015 , John Kerry reportedly told President Obama that the US had been skirting dangerously close to the possibility of accidental hostilities breaking out with Russia . In a press conference in Moscow , John Kerry said : The US and our partners are not seeking so called regime change . There is a perception that John Kerry has realised that for the US to insist on regime change in Syria could result in inevitable war with Russia , Iran and Hezbollah . Yet , Saudi Arabia was hell bent to get Bashar al Assad overthrown and still supports the Syrian rebels . On the other hand , Iran supports the Houthis ( rebels ) to change the elected Yemeni government . Both are to blame for their acts of adventurism and violation of UN principals that forbid interference in the affairs of other countries .
