But not this year . The Tigers come into the title game at 14 0 , the only unblemished mark in the country . Their win over Notre Dame in October catapulted them to the No1 spot when the initial College Football Playoff rankings came out in November , with the Crimson Tide ranked fourth after an early loss to Ole Miss at home . Losses by LSU and Ohio State would vault Alabama to the two spot . Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting behind Stanford s Christian McCaffrey and winner Derrick Henry ? running back of the Crimson Tide . These two squads have been the best teams in the nation throughout the year , and one will exit Monday night s game as the undisputed national champion .
