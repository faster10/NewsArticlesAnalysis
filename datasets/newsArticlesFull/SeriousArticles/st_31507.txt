Federer begins by ramming a forehand down the line . Djokovic doesn t bother chasing after it , he just dusts himself down and wins the next point . The game goes to 30 all and Federer wastes a challenge by querying a Djokovic backhand winner that landed on the baseline . The camera locates Mirka , who s got her head in her hands . She needn t worry . Her husband earns a set point when Djokovic mishits a backhand return . But Djokovic isn t done . A monstrous forehand from right to left from almost knocks Federer off his feet . The set point is saved . Yet he ll have to do it again when Federer beats him with a forehand pass . Federer can t take that one , but he gets a third chance when he crunches a big serve down the middle , and this time Djokovic squirts a forehand long ! He was staring down the precipice half an hour ago and now look , Federer has somehow forced a fourth set ! I suppose the good thing is that the way the first two sets whizzed by means he won t be too tired now .
