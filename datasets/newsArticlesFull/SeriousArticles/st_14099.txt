The former rain forest around Z Cl udio and Maria ' s settlement is a prime example of such irresponsible land use . The majority of deforested land in the Amazon is used for cattle ranching . As ranchers and their supporters will point out , the beef industry is a major part of Brazil ' s economy and an increasingly important source of American meat . The problem is that while clear cutting sections of rain forest and burning out all the underbrush makes great soil for pastureland , it only does so for about three years . After that , the soil ' s fertility plunges , " invasive " jungle plants like the baba u tree begin to grow again , and ranchers are forced to find another plot of rain forest to slash and burn for their cows .
