Since 1993 , McCain has had four skin cancers removed . McCain ' s biggest health scare came in December 2000 , when he was found to have a Stage 2 melanoma on his left cheek . The cancer was about as wide as a dime and a little thicker than a nickel . By today ' s standards , his surgeons took an extremely aggressive approach , removing more than 30 lymph nodes even though a test showed the cancer had not spread . McCain ' s surgeon , Dr Michael Hinni , said they simply wanted to err on the side of caution .
