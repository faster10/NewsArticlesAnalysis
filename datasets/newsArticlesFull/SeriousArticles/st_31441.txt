Former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney : You know , one of one of my heroes was a man who had an extraordinary turn of phrase . He once said about us , he said , you know , you can count on the Americans to get things right after they ' ve exhausted all the alternatives . And now and then we ' ve made a couple of mistakes . We ' re quite a nation . And this man , Winston Churchill , used to have his bust in the Oval Office . And if I ' m president of the United States , it ' ll be there again .
