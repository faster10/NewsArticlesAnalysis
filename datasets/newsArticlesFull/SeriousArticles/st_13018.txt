Last weekend ' s fairest movie of them all , " Snow White and the Huntsman , " bit into the poison apple of competition and dropped 59 percent to 23 million during its second frame . The 170 million fantasy has earned 98 . 5 million total after ten days , and another 83 . 5 million overseas . Universal is reportedly fast tracking a sequel for the film , which frankly seems like a rather irrational decision at this point . While a 181 . 5 million worldwide total is nothing to shake a stick scepter at , between the budget , marketing costs , and distribution fees , " Snow White " has a long way to go before it ' s out of the red . Still , Universal must see a path to profitability on the home market and ancillary markets . If the studio does make a sequel , I have one request : Bring back Charlize Theron !
