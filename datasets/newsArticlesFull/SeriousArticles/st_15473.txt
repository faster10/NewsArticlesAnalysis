New craft breweries are opening up all over the country , seeing a 15 increase in 2013 . The Brewers Association says that most Americans now live within 10 miles of a craft brewer , so what better way to tap into this movement than by visiting your local craft brewery ? The beer cannot get any fresher than directly from the taps at a brewery , and it ' s a great way to connect with the people who make your favorites . And to top it off , many brewers offer exclusive or small batch beers , which don ' t make their way into stores or bottles .
