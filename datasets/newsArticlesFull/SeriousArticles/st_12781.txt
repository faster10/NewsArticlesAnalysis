Global Witness , one of the world ' s leading anti corruption NGOs , released a startling report shedding light on how a powerful elite is benefiting from Myanmar ' s 31 billion dollar jade industry . This eye opening investigation is an important case study on how open company data and identifiers are critical tools to uncover corruption and the links between companies and the real people benefitting from it . Global Witness estimates that Myanmar ' s jade industry is worth as much as US 31 billion that ' s nearly 50 of Myanmar ' s GDP and up to 46 times the government ' s expenditure on health . Kachin State , the region where jade is mined , has suffered environmental and economic destruction as well as displacement of indigenous people . Global Witness used the information OpenCorporates had scraped and turned into open data from Myanmar ' s official company register to connect powerful elite to the jade trade .
