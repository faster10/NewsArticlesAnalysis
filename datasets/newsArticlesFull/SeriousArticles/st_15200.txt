As a matter of fact I did . You know there s three types of mint : spearmint , peppermint and wintergreen . So I got those three extracts , and I thought I would base it on peppermint and add some notes of spearmint and wintergreen . First I started using 2 3 times the amount of mint that the manufacturer suggested . That wasn t near enough . For two quarts of ice cream I had like around 2 teaspoons of peppermint and 2 teaspoons of spearmint and 1 teaspoon of wintergreen . That seemed to work pretty good .
