To resolve the mystery , the NIH commissioned similar experiments with rhesus monkeys . Instead of searching monkey blood for DNA after antibiotic treatment , the researchers would sacrifice the animals and scour their tissue for signs of the Lyme spirochete , including the RNA that is a surer sign of active disease . The monkey studies , published in 2012 by scientists at Tulane , document the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA and RNA following aggressive antibiotic treatment . When uninfected ticks fed on those treated monkeys , they literally ingested intact spirochetes proof that the organism remained .
