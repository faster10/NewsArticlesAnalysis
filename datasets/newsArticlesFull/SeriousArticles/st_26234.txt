Since then , Celtic has modified its position by stating that it will pay the living wage to its full time staff . Troublingly , though , I have been approached by one of its employees who is distressed that in exchange for paying him the living wage the club is asking him and others to forfeit their annual bonus . Celtic is concerned that by signing up to the living wage set by the Living Wage Foundation it is ceding some control of its remuneration policy to an outside agency . What it fails to recognise is that there would be no requirement for the Living Wage Foundation to exist if rich organisations such as Celtic FC paid all of its employees a wage that gave them an opportunity to raise a family , feed and heat them and maintain a roof over all of their heads .
