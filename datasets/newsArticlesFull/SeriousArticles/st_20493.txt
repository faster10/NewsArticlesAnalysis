Robin Wright , The New Yorker : Fourteen months ago , President Obama authorized a top secret , second diplomatic channel with Tehran to negotiate freedom for Americans who had disappeared or been imprisoned in Iran . . . . The initiative grew out of nuclear negotiations , launched in the fall of 2013 . . . . The deal finally came together ( Saturday ) , just as Iran and the six major powers also moved toward Implementation Day of the nuclear deal . It will mark the point when the United Nations confirms that Iran has complied with terms to dismantle its program , allowing international sanctions to be lifted . . . . The Obama administration also hopes ( these ) events will foster further cooperation when the U . S . and Iran participate in new Syrian peace talks , set to begin on Jan . 25 ? a process far more complex than the negotiations over nukes or hostages .
