Every January , my family cuts the base off the Christmas tree in order to display it in a glass topped coffee table . It ' s a long process : To keep the wood from rotting , we dry it out for several months , then coat the entire thing in polyurethane . We then use rub on numbers to mark the year . There is the base of the tree my brother pulled down as a toddler , and one from the tiny tree my dad had when he was serving in Saudi Arabia . The nearly three dozen bases make up a family time line like no other . Marley Cassels , Columbia , Missouri
