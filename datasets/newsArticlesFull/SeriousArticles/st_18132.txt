Ankara is often guilty of neglecting attacks on Isis and hitting the Kurds ( who are in so many ways the most effective force against the jihadists ) instead , smuggling weapons in the guise of humanitarian convoys ( something we saw the Russians doing in Ukraine ) , and being willing to support groups which are often jihadist in their own terms . Turkish military intelligence organisation ( MIT ) is every bit as cynically opportunist as the Russian military spy agency ( GRU ) , and Erdogan every bit as erratic , brutal and ambitious as Putin .
