? This is the same Andy Reid West Coast offense we know so well . Lots of short , safe passes to the running backs and tight ends , and a scheme that relies on yards after the catch and smart game management by Alex Smith , who threw a league low seven interceptions this season . They had a nearly 50 50 run pass split during the regular season , and use a lot of deception plays ( especially the end around to Albert Wilson in the running game ) and substitutions to make up for their limited offensive personnel .
