It ' s midnight back in Charlotte before Steiner and Bartolomeo head out past streams of other party hoppers and make their way to a swank hotel near the convention center . The lobby has a different feel than the Planned Parenthood party . Well dressed guests sit at a tiny table by the bar with a couple bottles of expensive Veuve Clicquot champagne . Sen . John Kerry stands in the corner having a hushed but animated conversation with two equally tall men . And more people carrying " We love Michelle " signs , now somewhat crushed , make their way toward the elevator .
