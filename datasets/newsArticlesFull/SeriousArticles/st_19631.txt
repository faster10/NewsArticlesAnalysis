If ISIS now seeks a global reach that is operational , then we have to refocus our strategy . The Administration policy to " disrupt , dismantle and defeat " al Qaeda has had some success . Eliminating Bin Laden is the best example of this . The laser like focus that characterized the fight against al Qaeda should be used as a blueprint in the effort to defeat ISIS . All resources the White House , DOD , the intelligence community , the FBI , Homeland Security and State must make taking on ISIS their priority . In addition , closer cooperation with regional allies , as well as with allies in Europe is essential , particularly with such things as stopping foreign fighters from crossing the border into Syria to join ISIS . In addition , we need to consider what role NATO can play with this effort .
