" He hates me " , Angie , 66 , told her fellow " Big Brother " contestants about why she hadn ' t spoken to David in almost 40 years . I remember being 14 years old , on vacation with my family in our cabin up north with a friend . As my friend and I stretched out on a bed in our room , I tried to explain to her the depression I was feeling , the lack of inspiration to do anything worthwhile . I was not quite 17 , America was very new to me , and I was distinctly uneasy and distrustful toward everything happening in my life that was putting me in these flat voiced , narrow eyed , champagneish rooms . I loved your music . " One feels he rather reluctantly inherited the position of being Goblin King as though he would really like to be down in Soho " , Bowie said to a BBC documentary crew in 1986 . Bowie , the innovative and iconic singer whose illustrious career lasted five decades with hits like " Fame " , " Heroes " and " Let ' s Dance " , died Sunday after a battle with cancer . I sat by that lake for hours , just pressing repeat on " Life on Mars " , " Oh , You Pretty Things " , and " Queen Bitch " . It was a transcendent moment . Yes , there would be times in the future when I would be confused and depressed and alienated .
