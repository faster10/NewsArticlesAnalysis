Morozov : We need to understand what exactly is being reduced as we transition from individual criticism to crowd criticism to soon , I ' m sure algorithmic criticism . It ' s not a straight line toward progress and objectivity that digital gurus claim it is . It should be our task ( or at least my task as an intellectual ) to show that we are being sold damaged goods , that the mere fact that some things are being " disintermediated " doesn ' t meant that we are transitioning to a superior cultural environment with better , more reflective criticism .
