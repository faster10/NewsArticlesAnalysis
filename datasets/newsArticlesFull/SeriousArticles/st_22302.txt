We all know the feeling of surrendering to the embedded biases of our devices . We let our cell phones ping us every time there ' s an incoming message and check our e mail even when we ' d best pay attention to what ' s going on around us in the real world .

This is just how everything runs when it ' s left on " default " settings .
