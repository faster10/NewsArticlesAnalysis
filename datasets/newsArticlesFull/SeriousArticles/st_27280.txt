Championship game losers were often penalized in the old BCS structure , as bowls did not like the negative momentum . There aren ' t a lot of data points , to use a selection committee term , for the playoff era . But last year , Georgia Tech fell one spot from No . 11 to No . 12 after losing by two points to Florida State in the ACC title game . The Yellow Jackets still went to the Orange Bowl , where they crushed Mississippi State . Arizona dropped from No . 7 to No . 10 after losing 51 13 to Oregon in the Pac 12 title game . The Wildcats still made the Fiesta Bowl , losing to Boise State .
