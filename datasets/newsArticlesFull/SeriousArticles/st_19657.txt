But just swapping costumes doesn ' t quite do that not in a permanent way , anyway . " The problem with nonwhite characters taking over the legacies of established white characters is that the changes never seem to stick , " says Yang . " The Asian American Atom got a sword in his belly . The African American Goliath got lightning bolted through the heart . The Asian American Wasp got eaten by a supervillain . And the African American Green Lantern simply receded to the background when it came time to make a major motion picture . The costume almost always reverts back to the original wearer . "
