This year s Bulls have strong perimeter defenders in the starting lineup in Butler ( annually an All Defense caliber wing at this point ) and Tony Snell ( filling in for Mike Dunleavy ) , but opponents that can manage to get past the first line of defense may find themselves having an easier time scoring in the paint than in seasons past . Mirotic , in particular , leaves much to be desired as a rim protector ( he ranked very low in Seth Partnow s rim protection metric at Nylon Calculus ) , and you can bet that opponents will use Gasol s man as the screener in pick and rolls in order to both get him in open space and force Mirotic to act as the last line of help defense . ?
