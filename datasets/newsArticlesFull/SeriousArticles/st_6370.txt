The only role a third party candidate can play is that of a spoiler , someone who chips off just enough votes from a major party candidate that he ? throws the election to the other guy . ? Ross Perot chipped off enough Republican voters in the 90s to secure wins for Bill Clinton . Ralph Nader chipped off a smaller percentage of the Democratic electorate in 2000 , but he still got enough to throw what should have been an easy Al Gore win to George W . Bush . You don t need a lot of voters to be a spoiler . Nader pulled it off with less than 3 ? percent ? of the vote .
