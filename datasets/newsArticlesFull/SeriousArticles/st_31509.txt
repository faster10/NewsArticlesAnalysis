Third set : Djokovic 6 1 , 6 2 , 2 3 Federer ( denotes server ) : A sign of Federer s muddled thinking comes when he lashes an easy forehand volley miles wide at 30 0 . He isn t able to relax against Djokovic . He s always worrying about making the shot perfect and as such , he ends up making error after error in his quest to get the ball out of Djokovic s bendy reach . Soon it s 30 all then it s 30 40 , Djokovic deftly flicking a gorgeous forehand pass from right to left . Yet Federer is grimly clinging on and he saves the break point with a smash , before somehow managing to hold serve . He s slowly beginning to get a bit of confidence , but it s probably come too late .
