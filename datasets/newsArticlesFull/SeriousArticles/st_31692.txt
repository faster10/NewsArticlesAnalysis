I have no way of telling who is right . Certainly , it ' s convenient to believe that torture never produces valuable information if true it ' s purely a matter of sadism and there ' s no earthly reason to condone it . But absolutist claims on either side strike me as implausible , and the committee might have been better off conceding that torture may have yielded important tidbits , but that they weren ' t worth the moral cost of betraying our own ideals and giving our enemies the idea that it ' s alright to torture captured Americans , because we do it , too .
