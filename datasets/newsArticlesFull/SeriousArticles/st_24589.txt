The family ' s claim to their land has been recognized by the Israeli Supreme Court , but the settlement of Anatot is nevertheless built upon it . Al Rifai family members have faced harassment for years while insisting on their right to access private land . The settlers of Anatot , enraged by the Israeli support of the Palestinian family , violently attacked the family and activists alike .
