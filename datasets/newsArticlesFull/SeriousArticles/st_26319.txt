Carolina Panthers at Dallas Cowboys : Kudos to Cam Newton , who on Monday night had an event at which more than 900 kids were fed Thanksgiving dinners and there was a " dabbing " contest in Charlotte . And kudos to Darren McFadden , who didn ' t necessarily have a long line of suitors piling up to sign him this offseason as a free agent , and is having a big year in Dallas . He helped Dallas hold on for its first win since September last week . McFadden won ' t get the same media love as Romo or even Dez Bryant or linebacker Sean Lee , but he may end up being the difference between being a playoff team and watching from home in January this season .
