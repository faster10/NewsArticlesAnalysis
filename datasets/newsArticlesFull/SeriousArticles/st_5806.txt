According to the U . S . Office of the Director of National Intelligence , which regularly releases an unclassified summary report about former detainees , as of January this year , 104 of the 614 detainees ( 17 ) released from the prison have engaged in " terrorist activities , " while another 74 ( 12 ) are suspected of doing so . It is impossible to assess the validity of the U . S . government ' s claim , referenced by McCain , that nearly 30 of the released detainees are confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorist activity because the government has not publicly released the names of any of these detainees for the past five years .
