How they got here : There ' s such a difference between being 16 1 and 17 0 at this point . The Panthers don ' t have to deal with constant attention for a push toward the first 19 0 season in NFL history . It would have been a fun story , but it ' s a lot less of a distraction for the Panthers in their pursuit of a championship to have that one loss . Of course the Panthers got to 14 0 before finally losing a game . Their hot streak continued right into the playoffs , as they led 31 0 against the Seahawks in the first half and held on in the second half for the win .
