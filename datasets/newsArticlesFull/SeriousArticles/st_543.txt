All of the inhabitants of the catacombs below Palermo ' s Capuchin Monastery are decked out in their Sunday best . Unfortunately , that Sunday was several hundred years ago , and the outfits have fared significantly better that the wearers . The mummified bodies and skeletons of some 8000 Palermitans from the 1600s through to the 1800s are kept in the catacombs for all to see , some so well preserved that they look eerily lifelike . Men and women occupy separate corridors , and within the women ' s area there ' s a special virgin only section . Spooky for adults , probably terrifying for the kiddies be warned .
