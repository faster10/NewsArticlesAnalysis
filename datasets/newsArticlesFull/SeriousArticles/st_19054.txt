What rouses the Angry American is perfectly plain : To put the point a little too simply , he or she is amid a class war and he is losing it ? primarily because it is said to be un American to acknowledge class warfare in our great nation , so the Angry American is unable to defend himself properly . Corporations , corporate donors , Congress , the Supreme Court , many state governments , the executive branch by way of its new trade initiatives and other such policies : These entities and institutions wage full dress class warfare by any other name , and all the Angry American can think to do is vote by way of a system that has been rendered a meaningless reenactment of what was once a democratic process .
