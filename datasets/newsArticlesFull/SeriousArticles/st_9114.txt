2 . Jake Browning , Washington : This was too easy for the Huskies . Browning led Washington to 45 first half points in their 52 7 annihilation of Oregon State . He was nearly perfect , finishing 18 of 20 for 211 yards and four touchdowns . The ultimate challenge comes next week , when the Huskies host Washington State in the Apple Cup . Browning began this regular season as a promising yet green true freshman he has the chance to end it by leading his team to victory over its rivals and securing bowl eligibility for Washington in a rebuilding year . That ' d be an impressive body of work .
