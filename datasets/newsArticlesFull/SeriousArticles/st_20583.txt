No one was fretting about the decor by the end of a gripping opening day of the 2015 Davis Cup final , which began with the shock of seeing Great Britain s Kyle Edmund storm into a doomed two set lead against Belgium s David Goffin and finished with Andy Murray levelling the tie at 1 1 after winning a battle of the mind with Ruben Bemelmans and the boozy home supporters who were crammed into the stands . It may have been drab and uninspiring on the outside , but it was a bearpit inside tight , atmospheric , deafeningly loud . The low position of the girders above the court added to the sense of claustrophobia and it was a typically eccentric Murray moment when he hit the roof with one shanked forehand . The buildup during the week was dominated by fears that the final would be cancelled because of security concerns after the terror attacks in Paris . The beautiful city of Ghent is 35 miles away from Brussels , where life is gradually returning to normality after Belgium s capital was placed under lockdown last Saturday , and a bomb scare on the local tram service on Friday morning was hardly an ideal way to start the day . It soon transpired that it was a prank . Someone has a very strange sense of humour .
