Intuitively , this favours the Grand Alliance like it did in Delhi . For example , Yadav ( 19 voted for NDA in LS polls ) and Kurmi ( 30 voted for NDA in LS polls ) voters , who chose the NDA in the Lok Sabha election , may have a higher incentive to return to their caste fold given the high ratings for Nitish Kumar . EBC voters ( 53 voted for NDA in LS polls ) are also likely to be more open to vote for the better leadership , given that this segment is not well represented in both the alliances . Leadership was one of the key factors which differentiated the BJP from other parties in the LS polls , and catapulted it to an an absolute majority .
