A study of students at the University of Washington found that black students there were the only campus group to suffer a clear statistical GPA disadvantage from a nasty campus climate : " Results indicate that campus climate is significantly related to academic achievement of African American students , as represented by GPA , accounting for about 11 percent of the variance . " That means black students facing adverse conditions are likelier to leave college early ? ? and would , presumably , be likelier to stay in what they felt to be a safe space .
