This situation is problematic for at least two reasons . First , refugee camps are intended to be temporary places to provide aid to refugees in the immediate aftermath of their flight , not a permanent solution . Yet this is what they have become .

Second , refugee camps are so badly funded by the international community that they can barely be maintained at a level that offers , well , refuge .
