Well , everybody s saying I m the perfect Sandy ? well , that girl is a perfect Rizzo . I couldn t think of a better character and role for her to really showcase what she can do . The first day of rehearsal we came in , she was so prepared and so on it . She just already embodied the character . They were doing Freddy My Love , just marking it , and we were standing there and Zach Woodlee , our choreographer , goes , She looks like she s gonna eat somebody ! Her raw sexuality as Rizzo is so good .
