Controversy continues to swirl around the comments made by Todd Akin , Missouri Representative and Senate candidate , that " legitimate rape " would only rarely lead to pregnancy . Initially , the media focused on the fallout of his remarks concerning issues of abortion , sexual violence and the effect on women voters . While Akin has vigorously recanted his remarks , and both Mitt Romney and President Obama have lambasted his statements , only more recently has attention been paid to the fact that Akin sits on the House Committee for Science , Space and Technology .
