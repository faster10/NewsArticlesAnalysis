This statement is a masterpiece . Sure , it s a syntactical trainwreck , but it s so thorougly Donald Trump . This is a performance artist deeply committed to his role . He doesn t have any relevant ideas or knowledge , and so there s nothing to debate . So what does he do ? He pulls out of the debate , comandeers the news cycle , and manages to suck all the oxygen out of a room he s not in . And he scores additional points by pandering to Veterans . Trumpites will love this move . Expect the Donald to receive a generous bump in the first post debate polls .
