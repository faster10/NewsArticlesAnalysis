There s nothing inherently offensive in that synopsis ( other than the lead of a TV series about an Arab family being played by a white Englishman ) but what it does say is that your Muslim neighbors might not be trustworthy . Homeland , 24 and Tyrant all feature Muslim characters embroiled in espionage or affairs of state . Tyrant is specifically about a family that lies about where they re actually from and who they actually are . Pulpy stories such as these are fine in a vacuum , but what the president points out is that those are the only stories there are .
