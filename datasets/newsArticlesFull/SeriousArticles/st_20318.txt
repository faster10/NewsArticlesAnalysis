Given the complexity of the Syrian problem , a political settlement looks very distant . Without a vision of what Syria might look like at the end of the war we are unlikely to get far . Perhaps the best is the enemy of the good , and a breathing space , which almost everyone can agree is the only option . This breathing space might be to once again return to a UN mandate territory . This has the advantage that , as an interim measure , it is hard to disagree with . We can argue about what this mandate might be , whether it should apply to the whole of Syria and for how long . It needs a huge amount of engineering and talking , but at least the talking will have started .
