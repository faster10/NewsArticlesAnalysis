This week was a jarring reminder of what s at stake in 2016 , Mrs Clinton said . For the first time ever , the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act . Thankfully , President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women , men , and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood ? including cancer screenings , well woman exams , and STI and HIV tests ? and taking away health coverage from 18 million people . Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win . We can t let that happen .
