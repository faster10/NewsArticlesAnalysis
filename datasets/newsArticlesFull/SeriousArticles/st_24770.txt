Siddique Malik , ? The ( Louisville ) Courier Journal : Many American Muslims have it wrong : They think if they just condemn terrorism , they can absolve themselves of the responsibility of rectifying the ideological perversion that collectively afflicts Muslims and is terrorism s root cause . . . . I have no illusion that the much needed serious debate aimed at Islamic reformation will occur among Muslims anytime soon . It can only materialize if it s triggered by American society at large . . . . Because true freedom of speech exists only in America , this debate can only happen in America .
