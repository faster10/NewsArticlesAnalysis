Elected to the U . S . Senate just five years ago as a Tea Party fave rave , he ' s now seen as the smart choice of establishment " moderate " conservatives who throw up their hands at the poor performance of Jeb Bush . He sure doesn ' t want to talk about his " furriner friendly , " and corporate friendly immigration plan any more than he wants to talk about evolution .
