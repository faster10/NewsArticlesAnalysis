After a pit stop in Qatar in November , where my senior leaders laughed at their mistake in trying to put me in a female barracks room , I landed in Afghanistan , and was immediately put to work . As a junior sailor , I found myself in a place I had never imagined : working as the lead liaison between foreign militaries , such as the British Armed Forces and the Australian Defence Force as well as domestic governmental agencies , including the CIA , FBI , and NSA . I was proud to serve my country in a mission critical role .
