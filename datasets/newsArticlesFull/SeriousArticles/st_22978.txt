To sum up : In 2008 , we saw Democrats increase their rolls from about 610 , 000 in Jan . ' 07 to 665 , 000 after the caucuses ( 55K ) . And in 2012 , we saw Republicans increase their rolls from 622 , 000 in Jan . ' 11 to 629 , 000 after the caucuses ( 7K ) . But in the past year from Jan . 2015 to Jan . 2016 both Democrats ( 19K ) and Republicans ( 11K ) have lost substantial members from their rolls . Again , we could see a flood of new registrants for Feb . 2016 . But right now , the numbers don ' t suggest new registrations . As NBC campaign embed Danny Freeman notes , the Sanders team has ALWAYS eyed registering new participants on Caucus Day . " You ' re in a state where you ' re allowed to register on Caucus Night . We don ' t need to add that piece to non registered caucus goers , we don ' t need to take the time to have a program for that because all we have to do is identify them to get them to caucus so they can register them that night , " Sanders Iowa strategist Pete D ' Alessandro told Freeman last month .
