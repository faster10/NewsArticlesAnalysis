After becoming the first country to legalize same sex unions in 1989 , Denmark is close to doing the same for same sex marriages . In 2007 , Nepal ' s Supreme Court ruled that the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual , transsexual and intersex ( LGBTI ) people should be protected and that a committee be formed to draft laws on same sex marriage . While the government has made some progress such as allowing a third gender option on the census full protections and marriage rights have yet to be enshrined by law .
