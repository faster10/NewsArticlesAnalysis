Whereas the British parliament authorized air strikes against IS in Syria , Germany has decided to deploy aircraft and a frigate in an effort to aid the French forces over Syria besides sending military trainers to Kurdish forces in Iraq . Juncker , President of the European Commission , rejected calls to rethink the EU s policy on immigration . US President Obama agreed with the French President in a meeting in Washington on 24 November that IS must be destroyed but he promised no new American means to that end besides more US French intelligence sharing . Apparently , Obama wanted to avoid overcommitting in Syria , having already announced in October the stepping up of operations against IS including the dispatch of about 50 Special Operations troops to help its Syrian enemies .
