Trailing the Seattle Seahawks by a point in an NFC Wild Card Game , all Walsh and the Vikings needed was a 27 yard field goal to send them through to the divisional round . I envision myself doing things like that at a different level so that s what I mean by being more involved and being more diverse when it comes to the offense we have , Peterson said . Minnesota fell to the visiting Seattle Seahawks 10 9 . Big props to Blair Walsh for owning up to his miss and handling it like a true professional . That s all it is . Seattle will play at Carolina for the fourth time since the 2012 season .
