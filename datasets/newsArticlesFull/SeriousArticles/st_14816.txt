The Donald maintains those donations ? along with all the other money he has stuffed into the pockets of politicians on both sides of the aisle over the years ? were simply ? just the cost of doing business in New York , which is a fair , albeit depressing , point . Wealthy businessmen , like corporations themselves , often cover their bases by sprinkling their donations around . And Trump has been incredibly successful in deflecting the critique that he s a hypocrite who has done more to put Democrats in power than Republicans by arguing that this was just smart business . But it s still funny just how many of his current opponents on the other side of the aisle were once his putative allies . Essentially , Trump is arguing that Hillary Clinton , who he once supported , once stood by Anthony Weiner , who he also once supported , and is therefore not a good candidate for women , and now that Trump has turned against both of them , he s better for women than Hillary .
