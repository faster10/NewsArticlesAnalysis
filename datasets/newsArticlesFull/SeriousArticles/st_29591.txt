It was more circumstantial than personal , though . Coughlin s arrival in 2004 was on the heels of the Jim Fassel Era when everyone enjoyed dealing with an unusually pleasant and accessible coach . Under Fassel , media access was virtually unlimited . During the offseasons I would occasionally just go to the old Giants Stadium , walk past the guards and just sit in the locker room until players showed up . Sometimes I d wait in the players lounge . I walked back to the trainers room once or twice , and nobody cared .
