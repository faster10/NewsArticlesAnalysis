" The incomes of the top one per cent respond to taxes in three ways : ( 1 ) the standard supply side channel through reduced economic activity , ( 2 ) the tax avoidance channel , ( 3 ) the compensation bargaining channel through efforts in influencing own pay setting . In other words , high earners will either respond to lower taxes by doing more productive work , by putting less effort into avoiding taxes or by putting more effort into negotiating for higher pay , as the post tax rewards for all three are now higher .
