Beyond Fitbit , wearables should get smarter this year , says John Curran , a managing director with Accenture , which researches and monitors CES every year . Last year at the show , we saw a real emphasis on aesthetics and the fashion aspects of wearables , says Curran , referencing visually appealing devices like the Withings Activit Pop . But this year , Curran thinks companies will focus more on the services that these devices can provide . For instance , the apps that connect to these devices will no longer just count calories or steps , but will start doing the math for owners , telling them how to lose fat or gain strength .
