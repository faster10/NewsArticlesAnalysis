Everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is . In pop culture , filibustering brings to mind Jimmy Stewart in " Mr Smith Goes to Washington , " speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees . Anymore the filibuster is an implied thing . When everybody realizes that if there aren ' t 60 votes to limit debate , senators don ' t generally spend much time debating at all . They just move on . Even when a senator mounts a long , all night speech , the outcome is usually pre ordained . Take Sen . Ted Cruz , the Texas Republican who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown . Even before Cruz started speaking , senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day . His speech was not a filibuster it was preaching to his political choir .
