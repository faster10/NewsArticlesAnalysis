To appear interested in the facts , Cruz references satellite data showing that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years . What he doesn t say is that his claim is based on a single study , conducted at the University of Alabama at Huntsville , which has since been discredited because it failed to account for the fact that satellites drift in their orbits over time , an error known to distort temperature records . Conveniently , Cruz ignores the findings of NOAA and NASA and the global scientific community which show that the earth is , in fact , warming . Even Exxon Mobil now accepts the reality of climate change .
