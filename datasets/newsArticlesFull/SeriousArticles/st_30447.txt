Beckham said he ' d been in contact , of course , with Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry about the Jets . Landry and Beckham are best friends who talk every day , so naturally Beckham has been picking Landry ' s brain . Landry had 13 catches for 165 yards and a touchdown in a loss to the Jets last week and has played them four times in the past two seasons . But Beckham also has spoken with close friend DeAndre Hopkins of the Houston Texans , who played the Jets in Week 11 , and was planning to call Amari Cooper of the Oakland Raiders , who played the Jets in Week 8 .
