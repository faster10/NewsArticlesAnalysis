The 2011 tropical cyclone season in the west Pacific has been about average , not significantly above or below usual events . We did have a few consecutive storms that made landfall in the Philippines and other parts of South East Asia in late September and early October , such as Haitang , Nesat , and Nalgae but that had more to do with a steering pattern caused by high pressure over the Pacific , not the monsoon . The remnants of these storms did make their way farther into South East Asia , which likely enhanced the monsoon trough , thus leading to higher than average rainfall in countries such as Thailand , Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam . Rainfall in most of Thailand is running 15 to 25 above average for the year ( with a vast majority of that rain coming in the monsoon months of May to October ) .
