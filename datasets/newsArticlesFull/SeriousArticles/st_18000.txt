Fox spent a reported 30 million on the comedy , which stars Sean Hayes , Will Sasso , and Chris Diamantopoulos , and marketed it to comedy craving men and young boys eager for a family option other than Mirror Mirror . This strategy proved effective : according to CinemaScore , the film played to audiences that were 59 percent male . Stooges earned a lackluster " B " CinemaScore grade , though crowds under 25 gave the film an " A " and crowds 25 and up gave it a " C " which could hurt its box office longevity . Still , this should prove to be a minor winner for Fox .
