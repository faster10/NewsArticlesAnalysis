They do a great job at complimentary football . When they get turnovers they turn them into points , Brady continued . They re good in the kicking game and the defense can tee off . It creates this snowball effect and then the game is out of hand . That s what happened last week to Houston . They had a seven point lead on the opening kickoff and then you feel like , man , we have to get back into this game . You don t want to get down 14 0 in the middle of the second quarter ? that s not the way you want to play this team .
