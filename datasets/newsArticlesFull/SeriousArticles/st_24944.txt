When my two siblings and I were very young , our nana started the tradition of hiding a small plastic bird in our Christmas tree ( it was notable for the Band Aid on its left leg , courtesy of a run in with the family dog ) . The three of us would search high and low to find the bird , which was supposed to bring the finder luck in the coming year . Once we were adults , our mom wanted us to continue the ritual with our own families , so she gave each of us a replica of a red cardinal . And ever since we ' ve enjoyed watching the next generation search for these birds . Beth Britton , New York , New York
