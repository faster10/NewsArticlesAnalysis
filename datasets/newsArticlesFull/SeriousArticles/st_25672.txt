The reason no lawsuit will be filed is sovereign immunity . The state , having created the courts , cannot be sued in them without its consent . Michigan , like other states and the federal government , has granted a very narrow consent through a tort claims act , detailing the very limited circumstances in which public agencies or officials can be sued . But as is common with such statutes , Michigan ' s protects agencies engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function and any government employee who is acting or reasonably believes he or she is acting within the scope of his or her authority . True , exceptions exist , but good luck enforcing them against those who made any of the many bad decisions leading to this crisis .
