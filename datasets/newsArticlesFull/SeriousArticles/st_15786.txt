BroadwayBlack . com ? is dedicated to highlighting the achievements and successes of black people on and off the Broadway stage . We are attempting to fill a void with respect to coverage of people of color , specifically black people , in theater . We are highlighting the fact , for example , that Norm Lewis was the first and only black Phantom of the Opera or Taye Diggs was the first and only black Hedwig in Hedwig and the Angry Inch . We find it important that we focus on the diversity that is in theater , allowing people to understand that theater can be accessible and entertaining for everyone , including people of color .
