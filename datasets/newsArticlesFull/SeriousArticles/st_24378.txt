PP : I ? think , Washington , and certainly the Obama Administration , realises , that a sudden collapse , without having a firmly supported set of agreements and understandings about what the new political order in Syria would be like , would be bad . President Obama in his , I believe that was in his speech to the UNGA , used the term managed transition so we re not talking about sudden collapse . I thnk , Washington realizes that would be bad . But as to the origin or why the idea of Assad must go is so persistent I think , this is the legacy of the Arab Spring , the high hopes that were gotten up , the idea that whenever there s unrest and there s a dictator in power Saddam Hussein was a dictator , he ought to be overthrown and we ought to try and make the government more democratic we can argue about whether that s feasible or not , but ? I think that s the psychology of politics involved .
