As Lindsey Graham and Scott Walker can attest , Trump normally doesn t miss when he takes direct aim at a rival . There are , however , plenty of reasons to believe that Carson might not be such an easy target for the blustery billionaire , even if he makes a more passive defense . In a recent Monmouth national survey , the former neurosurgeon was viewed favorably by 65 percent of Republicans and unfavorably by only 11 percent ? by far the best numbers of the candidates mentioned in the survey . Carson s numbers are even better in Iowa , where a mind boggling 84 percent of Republicans have a positive view of him compared to only 7 percent who view him negatively . ( For comparison : Trump was at 52 percent positive and 33 percent negative nationally , and at 53 percent positive and 38 percent negative in Iowa . )
