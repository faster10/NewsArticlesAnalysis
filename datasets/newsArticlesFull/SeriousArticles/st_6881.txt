The public has been down on big Wall Street banks and financial institutions for some time now . The General Social Survey , administered by the National Opinion Research Council , has asked Americans about their confidence in banks and financial institutions since 1973 . Between March of 2006 and March of 2010 , the percent of Americans with a great deal of confidence in banks and financial institutions plummeted 19 percentage points , from 30 percent to an all time low of 11 percent . According to a similar trend from Harris Interactive , the percent of Americans with a great deal of confidence in the people running Wall Street had already reached an all time low of just 4 percent by February of 2009 . These figures are not just a reflection of Americans ' dissatisfaction with the size of their bank accounts they also reflect the increasing belief that Wall Street is playing a game that only the bankers can win .
