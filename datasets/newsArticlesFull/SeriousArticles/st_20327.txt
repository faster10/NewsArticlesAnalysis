Breathed : " To Kill a Mockingbird " was a huge influence on my work . Harper Lee and I have over the years exchanged letters , which has been a massive delight . I can tell you that when I announced the end of my comic stripping career and that Opus the penguin was not only going to fade away but fade away permanently , I got a letter from Harper urging me to reconsider letting Opus go away forever . I should have written back and said , " The moment you bring Scout back , I ' ll bring Opus back . Is that a deal , Harper ? " Of all the people who should not be chastising me about stopping my career early , it would be Harper Lee .
