I was surprised by the gesture . Yes , in his online listing for the book he had said it was in " Near Fine " condition , but who really knows what those designations mean ? You see them all the time describing used books : " Fair , " " Good , " " Very Good , " " Near Fine , " " Fine " they would seem to be approximations . I had no complaints about the condition of the book I had bought from him . If I had paid 6 . 95 , and he had refunded 2 . 95 , and Amazon had taken its commission , how was he supposed to make a living ?
