Enlow ' s view of ? " the establishment " here obviously isn ' t a dumb swipe at the Human Rights Campaign or Planned Parenthood . It ' s a reference to corporate power . " How shit fucking gets done " thus restricts the realm of " shit " to things that corporate power is willing to go along with under the right circumstances . Enlow is essentially making a statement about priorities . Gender equality and gay rights are more important issues for her at least at the moment than limiting corporate influence in American politics or rethinking the nation ' s constant state of war .
