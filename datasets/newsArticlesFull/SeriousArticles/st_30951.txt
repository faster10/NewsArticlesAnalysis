I ' ll be perfectly honest : The SCLC has been persona non grata on the media platforms I have that reach millions of African Americans . Booking someone from the group on my Sunday morning news show on a black cable network , TV One , or my daily news segment on the Tom Joyner Morning Show , a syndicated radio show with a huge black audience , would be a waste of time . Why am I going to waste valuable time advancing the latest initiative from the SCLC when it ' s likely to go nowhere due to constant infighting ?
