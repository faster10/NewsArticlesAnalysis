Levi s Stadium , which opened in 2014 , is one of the first football stadiums built to make such mobile phone use a key part of the stadium experience . There are more than 1 , 300 Wi Fi access points inside , which connect to more than 40GB s of available internet bandwidth , four times more than the amount the NFL required all stadiums to offer by 2015 . Its infrastructure for handling wireless traffic is even sturdier , with all four carriers chipping in on an upgrade designed to withstand wireless traffic more than doubling last year s Super Bowl total .
