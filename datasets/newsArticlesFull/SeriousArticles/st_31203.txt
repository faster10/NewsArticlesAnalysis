Many of us have been lucky enough to escape the burn of bullying and racism . We might have walked through our schoolyards without hearing taunts from fellow students . We might have gotten the promotions we deserved at work . Our perfect American English may have averted giggles and impatience . We may have served in the armed forces without being treated any differently from fellow troops . And we might have been lucky enough to escape the perpetrators of hate crimes , like the laid off Detroit autoworkers who in 1982 beat Vincent Chin , a Chinese American , to death with a baseball bat after his bachelor party because they were bitter about competition from Japanese carmakers .
