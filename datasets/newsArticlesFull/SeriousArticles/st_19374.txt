In the race for the American Dream , we do not all begin at the same starting line . A case in point . When John F . Kennedy graduated from school , his father gave him 1 , 000 , 000 ( that ' s at a time when one million dollars was a lot of money ! ) . His Harvard education was 100 paid for . He didn ' t worry about the crushing debt of student loans , a burden that will take our young people the rest of their lives to pay off . When Donald Trump graduated , his father gave him a job in the family Real Estate business which had amassed 24 , 000 affordable housing units and 200 million in equity . While he was still in diapers , Donald Trump had more wealth than most of us could hope to accumulate in ten lifetimes . Thus , he enjoyed opportunities few of us can ever imagine .
