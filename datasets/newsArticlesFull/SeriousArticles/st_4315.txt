It ' s a modern day Western a souped up and dumbed down " Rio Bravo , " if you will with Schwarzenegger making like John Wayne as border town Sheriff Ray Owens , the last man standing between a runaway bad guy ( Mexican drug baron Eduardo Noreiga ) and his freedom . Charting a spectacularly erratic 24 hour course , the movie juggles self consciously hokey small town comedy with slick ( or at least semi slick ) high tech chase scenes as the road racing desperado leads Forest Whitaker and the feds on a merry chase through the Southwest in his prototype Corvette 01 .
