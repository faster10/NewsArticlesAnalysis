Mason : Yeah . I still really like playing music , and playing with other people is terrific . I was talking with someone about a charity record we did a year or so ago , and the rhythm track was Bill Wyman playing bass and me playing drums . I ' ve known Bill for 35 years or something , and it was great to finally end up playing together . It ' s always a little bit nerve wracking you ' re always alarmed at the prospect of f ing up and if you get through it , and someone says , " It ' s good , " it ' s a very warming feeling .
