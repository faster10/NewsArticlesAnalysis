Mullen : As with a lot of fiction , some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading . I wasn ' t a spy and I don ' t have any friends who were spies , as far as I know . The book changed a lot I went in different directions because the more I learned I would find a more believable way to advance the story . I think the initial idea I had wouldn ' t have worked as well and I don ' t think it would have made you think , " Wow , this guy knows what he ' s talking about . "
