It also means that Cosby still could have invoked his privilege and refused to answer deposition questions back in 2005 06 . Castor apparently disagrees with this he said that once he announced his decision Cosby no longer faced a risk of prosecution and therefore couldn ' t have invoked the privilege in the civil case . But that ' s almost certainly wrong . Cosby could have invoked the privilege as long as there was a non speculative chance that he could face prosecution . That bar was almost certainly cleared here , given what had happened up to that point and the non binding nature of the nonprosecution decision .
