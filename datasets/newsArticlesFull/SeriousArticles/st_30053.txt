Luckily , I was able to get back to the boat , drink my Red Bull , and everything was cool . That is one thing that happens : When you get really caught up when you ' re filming and you ' re getting amazing stuff , especially on the bottom , you can forget about your air supply . Once again , it wasn ' t really the shark that put me in danger , it was myself . I was running out of air and created this predator prey relationship where I became the prey and the shark just gave chase . If I didn ' t run out of air , I could have slowly ascended . The shark would have come up , circled around me , bumped some more . If you do things slowly and methodically , they respond that way as well . If you have to kick up because you ' re running out of air and you ' re freaked out now because he ' s coming after you . . .
