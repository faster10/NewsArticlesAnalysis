If that is not enough , the powerful ministries like home , defence and border affairs will be reserved for the men in uniform . Alarmed by the surging popularity of former political prisoner and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi , who was getting enthusiastic response during her election meetings , the ruling military backed Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) effected a controversial change in the statute . The MPs recently struck down a proposal which could remove the military ' s veto power on constitutional amendments .
