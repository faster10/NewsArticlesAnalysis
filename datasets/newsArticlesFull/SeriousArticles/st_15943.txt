Cruz constructed a contemporary world view that mirrors the Roman world in which early Christianity arose . Christians persecuted by the Roman state , overbearing taxation , economic troubles , loss of traditional values , a weakening of the Roman legions , an arising eastern empire , and a generalized fear of invasion by barbarian hordes are among many reasons given as contributing both to the fall of Rome and the emergence of Christianity as a viable religious movement .
