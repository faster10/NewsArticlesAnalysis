The Mets are embracing their nearly week off between the end of the NL Championship Series and the start of the World Series . New York plans to have some pitchers throw live to hitters this weekend after letting players with small injuries mostly rest on Thursday and Friday . I don t know if every team s the same . You know , we re going to ride that pitching . And by the way , our pitching right now could use a blow because we re pushing them pretty hard , manager Terry Collins said Friday . I m glad our starters are going to get an extra day .
