Katherine Russell : Raised as a Christian in Providence , Rhode Island , " Katie , " as she was known in high school , went to Suffolk University in Boston but dropped out before graduating . She married Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2010 in a small , private ceremony officiated by a Boston imam . She worked as a home health aide to support the couple ' s young daughter . Her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of Ailina and Bella Tsarnaeva , her sisters in law . By all indications , Russell has chosen to be near and with her dead husband ' s family in New Jersey , rather than with her parents in Rhode Island .
