I don t care , Thompson said when asked what it s like to have that moment play out with 20 , 000 leering fans watching in the stands . I don t give a damn . It s part our culture , part of growing and part of being a family . When a family member messes up , you have to tell him , let him know , and it s the same thing if we see Kyrie and LeBron making a mistake , then we will get on them , too . I don t care who is watching . It could be 10 million people watching . It s just accountability and getting us better .
