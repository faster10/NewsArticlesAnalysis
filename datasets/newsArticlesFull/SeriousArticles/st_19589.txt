We can see something here : a lower rate of titles for teams on short rest in long series and a higher rate of titles for well rested teams . The samples are small , so this very well could be noise , but teams that had five or more days of rest won long series five out of seven times . Conversely , teams with between one to four days of rest won 20 out of 44 series . That intuitively makes sense more rest should theoretically set a team up to perform better for longer . We just need many more years of baseball to draw on to help validate that idea .
