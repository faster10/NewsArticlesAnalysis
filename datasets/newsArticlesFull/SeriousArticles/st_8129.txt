Another problem is that Clinton is trying to wage the heart battle on issues of noneconomic inequality ? racism , sexism , homophobia , Islamophobia ? that ordinarily resonate with the Democratic base , and still do to some extent ( Clinton leads Sanders by wide margins among black and Latino Democrats , so far ) . But lots of Americans are still ( justifiably ) angry over the 2008 financial crisis and the lack of jailed bankers , or still struggling financially after decades of accelerated income inequality . Donald Trump has tapped into a similar electoral vein on the conservative side .
