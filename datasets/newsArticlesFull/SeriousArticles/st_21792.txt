When South Africa won the World Cup in 2007 , it was a bit different for me because I got injured in the first game and ruptured my bicep . Even though I was part of the team and got my gold medal for winning , it was a bit of an empty feeling . I never really felt that I deserved it , but that was a great day , ( especially ) when the team arrived back in South Africa to see the faces of millions of South Africans . I think that ' s the pleasure you get from playing rugby to see the difference that you can make in the lives of others .
