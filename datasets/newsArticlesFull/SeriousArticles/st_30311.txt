ABOUT THE BRONCOS ( 7 1 ) : Denver ' s top ranked defense will be without a pair of key cogs as linebacker DeMarcus Ware is plagued by a back injury while cornerback Aqib Talib is serving a one game suspension for intentionally poking Colts tight end Dwayne Allen in the eye . The Broncos ' stagnant rushing game , which is ranked 28th in the league , failed to get untracked versus Indianapolis and mustered just 61 yards on 22 carries in the first meeting with the Chiefs . C . J . Anderson rushed for 27 yards in that contest , but is reportedly fully healed after dealing with several injuries earlier in the season .
