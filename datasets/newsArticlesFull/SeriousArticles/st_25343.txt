There ' s a place in the city of Tijuana , Mexico , called El Bordo , which has always been somewhat reminiscent of a post apocalyptic movie scene . The name comes from " the border , " which is where it ' s located : right by the fence that separates the U . S . from Mexico , among the enormous paved canals that run through Southern California like concrete veins . Hundreds of people live in those canals , often in makeshift tents , the smell of sewage made ripe by the hot Tijuana sun . It ' s a place where many deportees try to get by . It ' s also a site of heavy drug use .
