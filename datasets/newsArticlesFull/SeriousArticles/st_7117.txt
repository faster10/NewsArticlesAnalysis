New Zealand will also test Brown ' s character and see if he really can turn the other cheek in the heat of battle . He is a fiery , feisty character on the pitch Mr Angry to his team mates and I like that attitude but you have to know exactly where that line is in Test rugby and avoid stepping over it . The All Blacks would love to get him involved in some verbals or a fracas of some sort because not only might it distract him it would get the whole Auckland crowd going and baying for English blood .
