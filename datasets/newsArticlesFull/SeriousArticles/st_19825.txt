It would merely restore the approach historically taken by states of determining , under principles of comity and full faith and credit , whether to honor a couple ' s marriage for purposes of state law . Churches should be able to decide what kinds of unions are sanctified by their denomination , but not what kinds of unions are accepted in the civil arena . As an example , the Catholic Church will not remarry a divorced person ( without an " annulment " ) , but divorced men and women are allowed to remarry under civil law .
