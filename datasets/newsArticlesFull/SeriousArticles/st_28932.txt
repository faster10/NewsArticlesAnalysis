ANDREW O ' NEIL : If it emerges that the 2016 test is a highly enriched uranium device , then I think we should be quite worried because I think what shows is that North Korea has mastered both the plutonium and the highly enriched uranium fissile material route to producing weapons . And why should we be worried about that ? We should be worried about that because that gives North Korea a dual track program and that in turn will allow it to manufacture more bombs with a greater chance of success .
