If I had looked beyond my Inca only vision , I would have discovered that the Inca Trail is just the tip of the Peru trekking iceberg literally iceberg if you go during low season . Several alternate treks land right in Aguas Calientes that can be booked mere days in advance . Though these treks do not enter Machu Picchu through the Sun Gate , many locals and travelers prefer alternate routes through quiet villages and isolated peaks , as they offer an often less expensive , more serene , untouched vision of Peru .
