It was probably a mistake to try to play a less than 100 percent Yoenis Cespedes in center field in Game 1 , and they paid for that gamble right away , when Alcides ' Escobar ' s long fly ball bounced off Cespedes ' leg for a freak inside the park homer . In Game 2 , they just seemed out of sync . Most of the infielders seemed either out of position or a step behind the play . And even Juan Lagares , the defensive whiz inserted in center , misplayed a catchable ball . They have to get their defensive game back if they are to have a chance against team that doesn ' t let up .
