" Catching Fire " is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease . It gets mileage out of setting up the Quarter Quell as some ultimate Fear Factor version of Deliverance , yet there isn ' t a moment of real dread in it . The film also sets up Katniss , with her sizzling ( in every way ) costumes and goth Cleopatra makeup , as the feral face of revolt , but the cliff hanger finale reveals that she is , thus far , a passive agent in this revolution . Lawrence plays her as a riveting icon of girl power , but I hope that in the upcoming sequels , Katniss gets to show another dimension or two to go along with her precocious , defiant strength . Grade : B
