What all parties should focus on is how to stop the war in Syria and Yemen , and stop the descent to chaos in Libya , Iraq , and Lebanon . ISIS is an enemy of Saudi Arabia just as it is an enemy of Iran . Iranian elections may generate a momentum of moderation , but this moderation requires engagement by the Iranian public to turn it into measures , but also a clear position by neighboring Arab countries that they oppose Iranian extremism and meddling in Arab countries , and that what they want is an end to sectarian escalation and economic attrition through warfare or oil prices . Let there be a political discourse that hits a chord with people ' s consciences and desire for prosperity . The pictures of the men , women , and children of Madaya is a living snapshot of war crimes committed by the countries backing the regime in Damascus , which starves its people as a weapon of war , and this must awaken the consciences of the public opinion in Iran . The Iranian public wans prosperity after living in austerity imposed by sanctions and Iran ' s expansionist policies from Syria to Yemen and Iraq .
