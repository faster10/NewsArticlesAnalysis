Music is medicinal . Music is healing . Music can transport you out of the now . Music can create transcendence . Music can reinvigorate pain . Music can take you back to the moment of first love . Music can make you time travel . Music can make you feel happy . Music can make you feel perfect . Music is your deepest , closest friend . Music can make you long for what is gone . Music can make you envision the future . Music can make you dance . Make can make you quiet and still . Music can produce tears . Music can produce laughter . Music can make you angry . Make can make you feel neglected .
