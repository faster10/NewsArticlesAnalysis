But what ' s most striking is Plant ' s vocal versatility . As a solo act , his songwriting has been spotty , if impressively versatile . But he ' s proved himself to be an excellent interpreter , from his 1984 " Honeydrippers " EP of old school R B and pop through Raising Sand . He does the same here , and the songs give him plenty to work with . He returns to the late , great Townes Van Zandt ( whose " Nothin ' " was a highlight on Sand ) for the bleak " Harm ' s Swift Way , " working a metaphor that turns the idea of time into a woman beyond a man ' s control . Plant doesn ' t oversing a whit , delivering poetic meditations on mortality with Griffin ' s harmonies clinging to him like a spangled death shroud .
