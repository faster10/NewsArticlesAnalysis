Nanette Gartrell , M . D . , the lead NLLFS researcher , was not surprised by the results . " The children we studied were highly desired , " she says . " They didn ' t result from a broken condom or too much alcohol . Their parents worked hard to have them and didn ' t take the privilege of having kids lightly . They took parenting classes and educated themselves . That ' s what makes for a good outcome , no matter what the family structure . They built strong communities for their families from the beginning . "
