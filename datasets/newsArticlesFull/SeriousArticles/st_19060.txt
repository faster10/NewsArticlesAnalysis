Paul Vallely , retired US Army Major General , told RT : " Erdogan s got to be realistic there if he wants to stay in power , and , of course , he s continuing to move Turkey towards an Islamic state . There s going to be more protests in Turkey , so he s going to have a lot of problems . But they ve got to move to shut down Turkey from supporting ISIS , and these cross border oil deals that are going on with the black marketers . At the same time , I applaud Russia for taking the initiative along with the French to destroy those convoys I ve been advocating that for over a year . Take out those tankers , 10 to 12 a day going north from Syria and northern Iraq across the Turkish border . And so we need to take a very positive action . I ve even encouraged the United States to declare war against ISIS , which they need to do . But Ambassador Churkin is going to be very frustrated with the United Nations , because they re not very positive in working towards rubbing out and shutting down the radical Islamic terrorist groups " .
