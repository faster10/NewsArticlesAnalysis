All told , two million African soldiers , workers and porters were directly involved in World War I . Though never fully acknowledged , Europe ' s Great war was a war of colonials and a colonial theater of war . As I reflect on this day , a public holiday ( Nane Nane ) for farmers in Tanzania , I remember a hundred years ago 750 , 000 square miles of land was inundated and destroyed , I remember the farmers who were forcefully dragged into this as porters . I remember Africans who fought other Africans for reasons unknown to them .
