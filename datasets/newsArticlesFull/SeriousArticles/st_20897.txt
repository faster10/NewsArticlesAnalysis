With the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) being the fountainhead of Hindutva , and the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government being strongly influenced by the RSS , we may ask : Are we moving towards a Hindu religious autocracy which would move the country away from rationality and reason and , thus , democracy ? Unfortunately , it seems so . In any rational and reasonable society as in a democracy , dissent is accepted as a norm and reasoned dissent is encouraged . However , in India at present , the space for reasoned dissent is shrinking day by day , being reduced as part of the public policy of the present government . Consequently , intolerance to any different view is increasing . Thus , on October 22 in Karnataka , a young Dalit student writer , Huchangi Prasad , was kidnapped and beaten up by a group of men for showing disrespect towards Hindu gods and writing about caste discrimination . Though the caste system has been the bane of Hindu society , it is now being practised with increased vigour . This is reflected in the growing number of crimes against Dalits , including the horrific incident in Faridabad last month where two Dalit children were burnt to death when a mob attacked their home .
