This astonishing collection of photographs was discovered in a rusty metal box by Peter Berry Ottaway , 71 , in the home of his late grandfather , Hubert Ottaway , who was a sapper ( or combat engineer ) in the Territorial Army between 1914 and 1919 . He captured the rare images while he was stationed in northern France . He worked with the Light Engineers Railway Companies who were tasked with supplying communication lines towards Belguim and upgrading trenches . Hubert ' s pictures provide a unique glimpse into life on the Western Front in the final 18 months of the Great War . He captured the aftermath of British offensives , including the Battle of Arras , and took photos of the devastation and desolation of villages which were razed in the path of armies from both sides during the conflict . Peter , who lives in Hereford , spent four years trying to get the images developed . After painstaking work , 40 of the 50 pictures were salvaged along with Hubert ' s diary .
