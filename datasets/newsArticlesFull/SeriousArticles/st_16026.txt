I think it s our players making great plays , offensive coordinator Sean McVay said . They re doing an excellent job . It starts with Kirk being able to recognize where the ball should go when we re throwing it , then the receivers or tight ends being able to make plays , linemen protecting when we re able to run the football efficiently . It s the backs reading out and everybody getting their combinations . It s a players game and I think they ve done an excellent job executing the plays that we ve been running .
