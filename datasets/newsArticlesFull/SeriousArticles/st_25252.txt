Silly dialogue is not the most serious problem with del Toro ' s rock ' em sock ' em monster mash . We ' ve come to expect a few groaners from our action spectaculars . But do the clich s need to be piled quite so high ? Raleigh is a loner who must learn to trust his new partner ( Babel ' s Rinko Kikuchi ) and heed the lessons of his stern commander ( Idris Elba ) . Few of the actors leave much of an impression . And the ones who do ( Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as a shrill pair of wacky scientists ) are grating .
