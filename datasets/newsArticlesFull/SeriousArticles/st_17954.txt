The gun trade has never been more profitable and anyone willing to let morals take a back seat has cashed in . An investment in gun maker Sturm , Ruger Co 10 years ago would have turned a profit of almost 800 per cent , making it one of the best performers on the New York Stock Exchange . Give or take a few bucks , that s about the same return as an investment in Apple over the same period . Smith Wesson is not that far behind ? over the past decade its share price has risen by almost 530 per cent . ?
