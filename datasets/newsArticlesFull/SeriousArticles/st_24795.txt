It looks like there will also have to be a new economic team . It is widely expected ( although not confirmed ) that Geithner won ' t stay much longer at Treasury . He has done four years and it ' s believed he wants to move back to New York . If he goes then one of the most important joists in the Obama economic team has gone . The chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke who has just launched QE3 will be there longer . His term doesn ' t expire until 2014 , about a year into Obama ' s second term . ( It ' s an ultimate irony that Bernanke will be gone if not reappointed before the 2015 date that the Federal Open Market Committee currently has as its target for keeping interest rates at exceptionally low levels ) .
