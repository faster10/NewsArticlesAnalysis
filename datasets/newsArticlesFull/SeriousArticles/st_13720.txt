John Terry , Steven Gerrard and Dany Alves are free transfers worth looking at . Each player will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens . I expect Terry to stay why would Chelsea let him go ? He is getting better with age . It ' s remarkable to think that Rafa Benitez tried to drive him out two seasons ago ! Stevie is more interesting he can still do a job for Liverpool and I hope he stays , but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable . If he does stay , I hope he settles down and just plays . There is too much ' let ' s make him a holding midfielder ' , or ' let ' s push him forward ' . Just let him play ! Barcelona ' s Alves isn ' t the force he used to be , but at 31 , he isn ' t washed up yet . I expect English clubs to push hard .
