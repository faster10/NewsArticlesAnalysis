Then , we discovered Makro 1 nestled in a small courtyard just a short walk from the historic St . Stephen ' s Cathedral in the heart of Vienna . The few outdoor tables were taken , but everyone seated at them generously invited us to join them . When we asked for a menu , a friendly lady in an apron pointed to the chalkboard , and we realized that there was a single offering of the day . So we each ordered the macrobiotic plate that featured sweet sauteed pumpkin , delicious quinoa , lentils and salad . It really felt like we were having a meal with a local family .
