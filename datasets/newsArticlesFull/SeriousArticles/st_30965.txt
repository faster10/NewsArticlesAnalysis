" The truth is that ' shadow banking ' is and always has been deeply entangled with the major ' too big to fail ' dealer banks that dominate Wall Street , " said Marcus Stanley of Americans for Financial Reform . " During the financial crisis , securitizations and other forms of ' shadow banking ' benefited from all kinds of implicit and explicit guarantees by the major dealer banks . The major reason that the financial disruptions created by the crisis spread to the giant banks at the center of the economy , like Citibank , JP Morgan Chase , and Bank of America is because these banks were connected to shadow banking in all kinds of ways .
