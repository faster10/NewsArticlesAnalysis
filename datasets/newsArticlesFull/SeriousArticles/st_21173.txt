Christie : " I don ' t see a lot of weakness on this stage , quite frankly . Where I see those weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage . I see a socialist , an isolationist and a pessimist . And for the sake of me , I can ' t figure out which one is which . But I will tell you this . The socialist says they ' re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free , except they don ' t tell you they ' re going to raise your taxes to 90 percent to do it . "
