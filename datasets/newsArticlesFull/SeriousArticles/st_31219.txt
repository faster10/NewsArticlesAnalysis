The comparison with 19th century Europe is hardly superfluous : worker ' s rights have been systematically weakened and are routinely violated in Turkey since the 1980s , to the extent that the country was " blacklisted " by the International Labor Organisation ( ILO ) in 2008 . Trade unions , once powerful and influential , have been emasculated and seen their ranks dwindle . Over a million subcontracted workers in the public and private sector are without job security , deprived of their right to join unions and participate in collective bargaining .
