The Department is committed to transparency , and the issues addressed in this report have the full attention of Secretary Kerry and the Department s senior staff . While the volume of State Freedom of Information Act requests has tripled since 2008 , our resources to respond have not kept pace , Kirby said . We know we must continue to improve our FOIA responsiveness and are taking additional steps to do so . . . . The Department has accepted all four of the Inspector General s recommendations , and we are taking steps to address each of them . We remain committed not only to transparency but to making our efforts in that regard as efficient as possible .
