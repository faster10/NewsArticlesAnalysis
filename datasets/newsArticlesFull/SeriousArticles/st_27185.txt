So why not impeach ? : " This does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanor level . This is a huge difference of opinion which can be litigated in the court of public opinion through elections , which should be litigated through Congress through appropriations and the power of the purse , and there are other routes that are being pursued . But in this case , I think the President has exceeded the statutory boundaries that are written into the laws . There are executive orders that are within the boundaries of statutes to implement and execute laws . But when you do things , regulations and executive orders , that exceed the statutes , the clear letter of the law , that is lawmaking . And the lawmaking occurs in the legislative branch , not the executive branch . "
