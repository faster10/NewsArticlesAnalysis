Well , it s a little different because the caucus system is very complicated , " Trump told co host Joe Scarborough . " I mean , you just never know what s going to happen with the caucus . I mean , you think everything s fine and it s not like you walk in and you vote and you walk out ? you re in and out in 10 minutes , or two minutes . The caucus system is a complex system that I was never familiar with . I mean , I was never involved with the caucus system . Don t forget , Joe : I m doing this for the first time . I m like a rookie . "
