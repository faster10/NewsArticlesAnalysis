The Bucks basically built the Warriors , with a little help from Denver ' s inability to re sign Andre Iguodala and Steve Kerr being interested in coaching . They passed on Thompson to trade for Stephen Jackson , which gave Golden State Thompson at No . 11 ( hat tip to the Kings and their terrible drafting , though ) , and then gave the Warriors the rim protector in Andrew Bogut just to get rid of Jackson , and took Ellis instead of Curry . Even with the Warriors ' smallball , they still need Bogut for defense and he was a huge part of their success last year and this season . All thanks to Milwaukee . Funny how these things trickle down .
