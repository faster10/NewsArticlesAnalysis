Who would ' ve guessed at the start of last year that a biopic about gangsta rap legends N . W . A ? starring producer Ice Cube ' s son as Ice Cube ? would not only become one of 2015 ' s biggest hits but also a legitimate awards season contender ? Give credit where it ' s due : Director F . Gary Gray and screenwriters Andrea Berloff and Jonathan Herman have wrangled a sprawling story about creativity , controversy and contracts into something that effectively conjures up the heady early days of West Coast hip hop . Rather than focusing on one storyline , the film tries to cover everything , and the result is a vibrant collection of vignettes , equally engaged with music making , celebrity decadence , institutional racism and a culture in transition . This is a vital , essential pop document , made with love , craft and understanding . The DVD and Blu ray add deleted scenes , plus interviews with the surviving members of N . W . A . ?
