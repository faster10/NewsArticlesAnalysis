JO : Well , there will be a diplomatic grumpy response to this , which is understandable given the other measures that NATO has taken in the wake of the Ukraine crisis . If NATO is an alliance of democracies ? why not have a referendum ? We have thousands of people demonstrating in Montenegro against this . It is done by means of lawmakers , but it is the same problem we have everywhere in the Western so called democratic world ? that the elite are doing things that people don t want . It applies to Denmark and Sweden , it applies to the US , it applies to France , it applies to Montenegro . So let s be democratic and get them into NATO if that is what the will of the people is .
