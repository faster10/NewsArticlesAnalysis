There s a time when you are alone at 3 o clock in the morning , 4 o clock in the morning , and I ll actually go on the computer and turn on when you can film yourself and have ongoing conversations , and in that sometimes you actually come up with some very interesting viable ideas , he said . It s just snatches , it s just something because we all have an inner dialogue . And quite often no one really calculates that into any kind of scripture . But we really are constantly probing ideas , what is life ? What is this , what is that ? It just goes in one ear and out the other . So yes I have long conversations with Rocky Balboa and every now and then there s a little piece of it that makes it onto the film .
