Another fact that is fairly widely known is that ISIS also has a well trodden trade route by which to get its crude oil out of the areas it controls and onto the world market . That route too , or at least a good chunk of it , crosses Turkish borders and it is impossible to imagine that large quantities of crude oil can simply vanish into the processing plants without being noticed , unless of course there s some sleight of hand being performed to legitimize the incoming crude . There are only two reasons that an official might agree to help launder a flow of oil intimidation or financial gain . Most of the clever money is on the latter .
