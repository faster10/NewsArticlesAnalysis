He s made Wall Street his central issue instead . The Sanders argument goes like this . Why does liberal reform get beaten ? Because businesses lobby against it . Ergo , cut big money out of politics and America will see more liberal reform . It s a handy coincidence that Sanders opponent is one of the people most associated with the interplay of money and politics . In the 1990s , the Clintons advertised their cosiness with big business as a way of reassuring centrist voters that they knew something about economics . This translated into policies such as deregulating the housing market and signing free trade policies that gutted US industry . After the Clintons left office , they stayed in touch with their old friends . Mrs Clinton made 675 , 000 for giving three speeches to Goldman Sachs alone . She claimed during the debate that she used the speeches to tell Wall Street that it was hurting America . I doubt that s true . If someone paid me 675 , 000 to give a speech they d get 90 minutes of unqualified praise . Heck , for that kind of money I d strip .
