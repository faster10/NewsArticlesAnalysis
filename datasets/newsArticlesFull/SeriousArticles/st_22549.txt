Ian O ' Connor , ESPN . com : " What were the odds in the middle of November that Manning would be in this surreal position ? He was 5 for 20 with four interceptions and no touchdowns against Kansas City , and he was pulled from the game with a shot foot and a shot arm . He had nine touchdowns against 17 picks for the season at that point , and then the younger , bigger , stronger , more athletic Brock Osweiler ripped off three consecutive victories , including one against the unbeaten Patriots . Just about everyone thought Osweiler had the job for keeps . The Broncos had actually started the transition to Osweiler in the offseason when they fired Manning ' s coach ( John Fox ) and coordinator ( Adam Gase ) , asked him to accept a 10 million pay cut ( Manning worked that down to a 4 million haircut instead ) , installed Gary Kubiak ' s Osweiler friendly offense , and instructed the fading legend to sit out more practices .
