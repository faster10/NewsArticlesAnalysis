Aldean : The best thing about touring with Luke is just the fact that he and I are legitimately friends away from the music business . I think that , unlike a lot of other artists in the business , you know , he and I actually pull for each other . We want to see each other succeed and do well . There ' s not a competition sort of thing there at all . He ' s one of my best friends . So obviously when he ' s out on stage and he ' s doing his thing and you see people going crazy , that ' s cool . It makes you feel good . And I think he ' s the same way .
