Britain ' s Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave Britain on their three week visit to New Zealand and Australia this weekend with their baby son Prince George . A " hub and spoke " system has been put in place allowing for the new parents to travel to engagements during the day and return to their son in the evening , much like parents the world over who trudge off to work in the morning only to dash home in the evening to catch baby before bedtime . Granted most parents in the workforce don ' t get to enjoy legions of adoring fans waving flags , parading " We love u ! " banners and requesting royal selfies , but perhaps this will give William and Kate a taste of their much longed for opportunity to feel " normal . "
