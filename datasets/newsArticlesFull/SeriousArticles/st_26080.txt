The former prosecutor also commented that he " hopes , for the sake of all persons involved , that this resolution brings an end to the tragic situation that began with the brutal murder of Christine Morton in 1986 and that was followed by the incorrect conviction and incarceration of Michael Morton . Mr Anderson continues to believe that Mr Morton ' s conviction resulted directly from a medical examiner ' s assessment of Christine Morton ' s time of death at 1 : 30 a . m . a time when Mr Morton was indisputably at home with his wife . Regardless of the cause of the wrong result reached in the Morton trial , in light of the DNA results obtained in 2011 , Mr Anderson has consistently expressed and continues to express to Mr Morton and his family his regret for Mr Morton ' s prosecution and incorrect incarceration .
