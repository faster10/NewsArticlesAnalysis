The reason why the Obama administration finds itself to run with the football metaphor so deep in its own territory with time ( meaning its own time in office ) running out , is because it has not attached as much operational importance to Assad ' s ouster as Russia and Iran have to his preservation . Fear of an Iraq like " slippery slope " has handicapped President Obama in Syria . Meanwhile his Russian and Iranian counterparts have acted with resolve to preserve a reckless , destructive , but useful client . They have done so fully aware that Assad , through a political survival strategy featuring mass collective punishment , midwifed ISIL in Syria and now sustains it . Neither Iran nor Russia loses sleep over the threats posed by ISIL to the West and the region . Rather they see the Raqqa based band of murderers , thieves , and rapists as a useful foil for their similarly unattractive client .
