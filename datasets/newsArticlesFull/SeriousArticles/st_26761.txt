None of this is to say that I want James Bond to get married , or even to repent his misogyny , which has become more interesting in the films as outside society has found it less admirable . But if each actor s tenure as James Bond functions as a separate series of films , it would be nice to see a Bond cycle that actually takes the character somewhere . Given that Bond audiences are accustomed to seeing the character reset each time a new actor takes up the role , there s actually more room to have Bond grow and change ( than , say , Iron Man ) , because successive actors and directors won t be saddled with previous Bonds ? plot and character developments .
