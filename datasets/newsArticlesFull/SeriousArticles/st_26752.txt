Skyfall had a clear idea animating its action and visuals : the blowback to the British Empire , particularly to the merciless way M ( Judi Dench ) treats her agents . The film begins with M ordering Moneypenny ( Naomie Harris ) to take a shot at a fleeing villain , even though there is a risk the younger woman will hit Bond , which she does , leaving him presumed dead . While Bond ends up returning to duty and the service of his country after a bombing , his adversary turns out to be one of M s former agents ( Javier Bardem ) , whom she gave up in a prisoner exchange , and who was deformed by an ineffective cyanide capsule meant to kill him .
