The memory of the moment the rockets rained down on his home comes to 15 year old Ahmed in ghostlike fragments . He recalls that there were five rockets in total and that after the first landed his instinct was to run out of the house . Ahmed , his brother , mother , aunt and grandfather were outside of their home when the second rocket landed nearby . His 5 month pregnant mother held his 3 year old brother in her arms . The shrapnel burned through her torso and killed her instantly . Ahmed lay on the ground bleeding with shrapnel wounds in his leg .
