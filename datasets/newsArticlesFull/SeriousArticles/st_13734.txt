It ' s best to let the Iowa Democratic Party explain : " On caucus night , Iowans in each precinct elect delegates to their county conventions , but the winner of the caucuses will be the candidate who accrues the most state delegate equivalents . State delegate equivalents are calculated using a ratio of state to county convention delegates . In other words , the ratio determines how many delegates the candidate would receive for the state convention based on the number of county convention delegates a candidate receives . "
