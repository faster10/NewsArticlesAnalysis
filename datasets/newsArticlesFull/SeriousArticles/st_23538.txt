Smiling or joking during an embarrassing loss is frowned upon by fans and pundits in professional sports . Coaches and players are supposed to wear every emotion on their sleeves and be visibly shaken by losses so we know that they ' re as focused on winning as we are for them . But sometimes , there ' s not much more you can do when getting your behind handed to you than joke about it . When you ' ve been around as long as Gregg Popovich and accomplished what he has as a coach , one big regular season loss isn ' t going to keep you from getting these jokes off .
