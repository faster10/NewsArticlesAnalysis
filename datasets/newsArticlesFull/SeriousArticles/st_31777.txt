Elway walked off into the sunset after his two titles , and he was the man responsible for bringing Peyton Manning to Denver ? and , ultimately , in bringing him back this season for what we assume is one final run at a ring . Few remember it this way , but Elway was something of a game manager , too , when the Broncos won it all after the 1998 season . Manning has played two straight turnover free playoff games after turning the ball over 18 times in parts of 10 games this season . He played a cleaner game in the AFC championship than his rival , Brady , and has endured foot , shoulder and rib injuries ( as well as public ribbing over his arm strength ) ? to get back to his fourth Super Bowl . Manning is 1 2 in the big game , and though there are great quarterbacks such as Fran Tarkenton and Jim Kelly with worse Super Bowl win loss records , this one clearly weighs heavily ? ? fairly or not ? ? in the public perception of Manning s legacy all time . Could he walk after Super Bowl 50 , win or lose ? It s very possible .
