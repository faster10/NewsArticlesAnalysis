Donna Beckum of Orab , Ohio It was a great honor to watch Bindi ' s show several times this past weekend . She is sure a chip off the ol ' block ! I will never forget Steve and his remarkable quest . I will continue to watch Bindi and all of the " Crocodile Hunter " episodes that are rerun . You just never get tired of watching them . I pray that God blesses Terri and her children and that Bindi continues to carry on where her daddy left off . Steve Irwin was an icon and certainly made a difference . He will never be forgotten !
