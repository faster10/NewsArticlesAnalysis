So stop trying to please them . It s clear the only real way to stop the squawking and crying and false accusations of liberal media bias is to start lying on behalf of conservatives . Anything short of that , and the crybaby routine , complete with conspiracy theories , will continue . You can t win this game , so why even play ? It s time for journalists to start tuning out conservatives complaining about liberal media bias and political correctness . Those are nonsense words used to justify conspiracy theories , and should be treated with the contempt they deserve . Instead , report the facts and when the right goes ballistic , ? remind yourself that they re no better than anti vaxxers and people who think the government faked the moon landing , and their crank theories don t deserve the attention it takes to block them on Twitter .
