I met Escalante once in the late 1980 ' s at a black tie affair in Washington . But , the more memorable encounter took place a couple of years earlier , while I was in college . I had placed a long distance call to Garfield High School and left a message . A student group on campus wanted him to speak . To my surprise , after seeing a message that the school receptionist had scribbled down as being from simply " Ruben at Harvard , " he called me back . To my amusement , I soon realized the reason he did was because he thought I was another Ruben at Harvard a former student .
