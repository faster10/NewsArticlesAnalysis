Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton likely knows where these terror dollars are coming from . In a 2009 memo , Clinton stated that Saudi donors were the largest funders of Sunni terrorism . Cables tied Saudi funding to al Qaeda , the Taliban , Hamas , and other militants , and also said that Saudi government was in contact with the Haqqani network . ( This didn t stopped the Clinton Foundation from accepting between 10 and 25 million in donations from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia or between 5 and 10 million in donations from the state of Kuwait . )
