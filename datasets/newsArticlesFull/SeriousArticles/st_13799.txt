AT : We have a very young demographic 85 of our populations are under the age of 35 . We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture . Yet , entrepreneurship is not in the education system . Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance ? And it ' s something , frankly , that I am extremely passionate about , because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants , etc . It ' s going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises . So , it ' s great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system , and innovation is totally embedded into that .
