" As a military veteran , American citizen and taxpayer , I find this piece of ' legislation ' highly offensive , " a commenter said on the ASUCI ' s Facebook student page , in one of the more mildly worded complaints . " This is a public school , supported by taxpayers , ( yes , I know , most of you pay tuition , as well , but that does not cover the entire cost ) , and it is appropriate to display the United States Flag on campus . Please reconsider your actions and rescind this resolution . "
