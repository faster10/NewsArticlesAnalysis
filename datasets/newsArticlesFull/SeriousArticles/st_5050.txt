The result is that our defence strategy seems to fall time and again between two stools . As someone who lives in Mumbai within walking distance of the hotels , restaurant , railway station and other places that came under attack eight years ago , I can report that they are as vulnerable today as they were on 26 11 . Coastal security is in even worse shape . All that has changed is that a handful of poorly trained , unarmed guards have been posted here and there . They sit around sleepily on most days , and when there is a high alert conduct random checks . This is not how we will win a war being waged on us by an enemy who sees India as an existential threat .
