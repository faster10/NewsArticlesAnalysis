Consider productivity : India ' s ranks 60th in the world on the World Economic Forum ' s ranking of countries by competitiveness ( China is 29th ) . Or consider ease of doing business : the World Bank ranks India 134th in the world . If you want to start a business , the World Bank says India ranks 179th in the world in other words , go ahead and explore opportunities in 178 other countries before you settle on India . It ' s as good as putting a " closed " sign on the shop door .
