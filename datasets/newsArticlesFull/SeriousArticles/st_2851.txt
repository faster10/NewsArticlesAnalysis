When Sophie was 4 years old , we discovered that her mercury levels were elevated . We were already concerned because her learning had leveled off and in some notable ways even backslid . But it was only by chance that we realized she was being poisoned . Because we lived in an old house with lead paint , we had been following our pediatrician ' s advice to have our children tested regularly for lead and other heavy metals . Only because of this were we lucky enough to learn about our daughter ' s elevated mercury levels before it was too late .
