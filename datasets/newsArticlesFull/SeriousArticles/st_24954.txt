When visiting the beach , where there is limited shelter available for taking cover during a thunderstorm , the weather service advises people to run for their cars at the first sign of thunder or lightning in the distance . The agency also warns against taking cover under the beach picnic shelters . It says water , wet items , like ropes and metal objects , including fences and poles , are big dangers during lightning storms because water and metal are both great conductors of electrical currents .
