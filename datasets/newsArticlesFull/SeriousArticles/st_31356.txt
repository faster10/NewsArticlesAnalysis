For the Broncos , it starts with avoiding mistakes . They played just their second turnover free game of the season last Sunday against Pittsburgh ? and their first one with Peyton Manning at quarterback this year . That needs to continue , because the Patriots are 144 12 under Bill Belichick when winning the turnover battle , and they have won 35 of their past 37 games when doing so . They also are 15 0 in the postseason under Belichick in that scenario . The turnover margin was even in the teams Week 12 meeting .
