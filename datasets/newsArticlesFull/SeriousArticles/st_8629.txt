DeAngelo Williams out . Pittsburgh ' s lead running back has been officially ruled out for the game , meaning Fitzgerald Toussaint and Jordan Todman will be handling the Steelers ' rushing duties . Between them , the pair had 22 carries for 64 yards during the regular season . Williams , who emerged after Le ' Veon Bell ' s season ending Week 8 injury against the Bengals , rushed for 907 yards and 11 touchdowns on 200 carries . Against the Bengals last month in Week 14 , Williams rushed for an average of 3 . 3 yards ( 23 carries , 76 yards ) . So sure , he didn ' t have a big impact in the last game , but his 7 . 9 yards per carry average after Bell was hurt in the November game proved how dangerous he could have been . It ' ll be interesting to see how his absence affects Pittsburgh ' s backfield blitz pickup for quarterback Ben Roethlisberger , too .
