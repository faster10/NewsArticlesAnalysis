The biggest challenge of any NBA coach isn t dissecting game tape or designing plays , it s making multi millionaires believe you aren t wasting their time , that they have reason to believe that you can somehow make them better . In Walton s case the demand is even greater . He s had to get a team that won the title last spring to play as hard as they did last season . Even an established coach finds this hard to do in November when the players are still coming off the glow of the previous year s championship . It s nearly impossible for a fill in who has never been a head coach before .
