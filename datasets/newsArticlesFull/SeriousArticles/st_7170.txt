And so it was with the Obama administration last July when it had to sell the nuclear deal with Iran to both Congress and the American people . It was not as if Iran sent a couple of high ranking clerics to Washington , DC as surety for the deal . Nor could the United States point to anything specific that Iran did as an immediate result of signing the agreement . Everything was a promise : to dismantle 13 , 000 centrifuges , cap the enriching of uranium at low levels , and ship nearly 10 , 000 kilos of the radioactive material out of the country . If and only if Iran fulfilled these promises , the United States would lift nuclear related sanctions and release tens of billions of dollars in frozen assets .
