I wish I thought it was possible , but I don t . In the U . S . , long shot left wing candidates always claim that they will win by mobilizing alienated nonvoters or wooing back the white working class , and it almost inevitably proves to be a fantasy . In the extremely unlikely event that Sanders won the Democratic primary , I m convinced he d lose , overwhelmingly , to a fanatical reactionary Republican who would hasten America s devolution into a third world hellscape . But if I actually thought that we were on the cusp of a democratic socialist revolution in the United States , then yes , I would feel indignant about anyone who thought that breaking the ultimate glass ceiling was more important .
