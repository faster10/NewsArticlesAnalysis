The ball handling over , Curry started shooting and the bold strokes really began . He worked his way around the floor hitting 3 pointers that looked like trick shots but are part of his in game repertoire . One 3 came from the tip of the Bulls horn near the midcourt logo .

This was Curry turning an NBA basket into his own personal Nerf hoop to everybody ' s amusement .
