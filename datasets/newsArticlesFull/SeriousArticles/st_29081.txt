Having more education is one of the biggest predictors of women having careers . But it ' s also one of the biggest predictors of women ( and their husbands ) doing more child care , according to a forthcoming paper by Paula England , a New York University sociologist and research fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families , and her collaborator , Anjula Srivastava . Educated mothers are much more likely to work outside the home and to return to work within a year after the birth of a child . They also tend to have fewer children than their less educated counterparts . Yet on average , they spend more time in direct interaction with their kids than less educated women .
