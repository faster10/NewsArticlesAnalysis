With Edelman available , the Patriots were a better offense on third down ( 6 of 12 ) and shifted to more of a three receiver attack ( 47 of the first 50 snaps ) . How much does quarterback ? Tom Brady ? rely on Edelman ? Start with how he targeted him a team high 16 times on Saturday , and you get the idea . Edelman , who broke a bone in his left foot Nov . 15 and returned for the first time Saturday , didn t play in the Patriots 30 24 overtime loss to the Broncos on Nov . 29 . The Patriots were 2 of 13 against the Broncos on third downs in that game . Edelman s presence promises to yield better results .
