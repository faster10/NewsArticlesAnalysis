The moment of truth has arrived , and tonight the serious talking will begin . When David Cameron and Donald Tusk , president of the European Council , sit down for a three course dinner and fine wine at Downing Street this evening both men will have one overarching objective . They may come from different political traditions and have views about Europe that are , in many respects , profoundly at odds . Cameron leads a trenchantly Eurosceptic party , much of which is deeply hostile to Brussels . Tusk , on the other hand , is a bearer of the European torch , a true believer who boasts a string of medals for his contribution to European integration , including one awarded by Jean Claude Juncker in 2013 for his role in facing down Eurosceptics in his native Poland . Yet the prize they both crave over the next few weeks is precisely the same : to find common ground and a deal that will keep the UK in a reformed EU , averting a Brexit that would constitute the biggest blow to the European project in its history .
