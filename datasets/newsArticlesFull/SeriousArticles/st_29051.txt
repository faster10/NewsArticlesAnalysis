Lewis : Oh wow . the great thing about Neville what message he conveys that J . K . Rowling wrote for him was that you can have any kind of disadvantage at the start of your life and it doesn ' t define you . You can still go on to be whoever you want to be . As long as you have friends around you and you have a belief in doing the right thing , you can go on to be a hero . It doesn ' t matter what humble beginnings you came from . I think that ' s really inspiring . I think that ' s a really nice life lesson .
