Pollsters have noted differences in their results when they change their assumptions about voter turnout . Trump ' s success in particular depends on first time voters registering and showing up to caucus . A recent Monmouth University poll found that when likely Iowa caucus goers are polled , Trump leads Cruz 30 percent to 23 percent . However , when the pollster narrows the sample size to registered Republicans who have a history of voting , the odds shift in Cruz ' s favor and he leads Trump 28 percent to 23 percent .
