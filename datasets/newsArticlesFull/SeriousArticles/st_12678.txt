While I m no lawyer , I do work with several and based on what they tell me , UIGEA s language on fantasy sports betting trumps the other laws for two reasons . In legal theory , the rules of statutory interpretation , there is a doctrine known as lex posterior derogat legi priori ? or in plain old English , the maxim of construction ? ? which holds that the more recent or younger of two conflicting statutes governs . Similarly , lex specialis derogat generali , states that the more specific law prevails over the more general one . So , as long as sites adhere to the requirements of the so called UIGEA fantasy sports carve out , they are legal .
