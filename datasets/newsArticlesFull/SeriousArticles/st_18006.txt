The Clippers lead the league in backhanded compliments of the Warriors title , which should make the division race and intense rivalry all the more intriguing . Throw in their desire to move past their playoff collapse and the dramatics surrounding DeAndre Jordan s free agency , and it s clear why the Clippers are ready to settle things on the court . The components of last year s top ranked offense ( Jordan , Chris Paul and Blake Griffin ) remain in tact and surrounded by capable scorers such as J . J . Redick and Jamal Crawford , as well as the newly acquired Paul Pierce and Lance Stephenson . Chemistry could be a concern , but the added depth is also welcome .
