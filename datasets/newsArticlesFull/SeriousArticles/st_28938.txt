Sometimes the changing of the guard is as obvious as the progressions of No . 1 singles on the Billboard charts . In early 1964 , Bobby Vinton ' s " There ! I Said It Again " gave way to the Beatles ' " I Want to Hold Your Hand " on the singles chart and , just like that , the British Invasion dawned . Similarly , on January 11 , 1992 , Michael Jackson ' s " Dangerous " was knocked out of the top spot on the album chart by three scruffy lads from Washington state , and the indie grunge gold rush was on . The Super Deluxe edition of Nirvana ' s 1991 classic includes the original album as well as studio outtakes , live cuts and most interesting of all Butch Vig ' s original mix .
