EB : ? Well , I think it all comes down to making sure that you exonerate the American people . So neither Donald or Bernie is blaming the average American . Donald Trump is blaming foreign people . China , Hispanic immigrants to the United States and Muslim refugees . He ' s blaming all of those people . Sanders is pointing to big money , Wall Street , establishment politicians who are taking basically bribes from lobbyists . So in both cases , you don ' t direct guilt at the American people . And so in that way , it doesn ' t look like you ' re impugning the real America , quote unquote . You ' re going after people who are either interlopers in the American dream or stealing from real Americans . ?
