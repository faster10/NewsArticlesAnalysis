Lynch battled through a number of injuries even before this latest , most serious one , and never really looked quite right . The veteran averaged just 3 . 8 yards per carry in his seven games , while rookie Thomas Rawls has managed 5 . 6 yards per carry , racking up 369 more yards than Lynch on just 30 more attempts . When it comes to the running back position , the Seahawks are actually better off , because their replacement is actually an improvement on Lynch .
