Fox Business Network ? averaged four national polls to decide which Republican presidential candidates to include in the Tuesday debates . ? But unlike other networks that have hosted debates this year , Fox Business used stricter criteria and only the last four polls of its choosing . In addition to moving Christie and Huckabee to the " kids ' table " ? of underperforming candidates , that strategy also ended up kicking Sen . Lindsey Graham ( S . C . ) , former New York Gov . George Pataki and former Sen . Jim Gilmore ( Va . ) ? off the debate stage altogether .
