At least the guys behind the night s big winner , The Revenant , were ready when they accepted their trophies for best drama , best actor ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and best direction ( Alejandro Gonz lez ? I ? rritu ) . DiCaprio seemed to satisfy the traditional requirements for a speech : getting a tiny bit teary eyed , thanking the big names ( I ? rritu , costar Tom Hardy ) , and the under appreciated talents ( his make up artist ! ) , before closing with a sincere , this isn t just about me message about indigenous people . But it was I ? rritu who scored the best line . Acknowledging the film s famously grueling shoot , he said , We all in this room know very well that pain is temporary , but a film is forever , right ?
