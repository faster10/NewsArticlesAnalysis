PP : Well , it s a very good question , it s going to be very difficult , but I think as far as what our governments , U . S . and Russian , and other outside governments are concerned , what they can do is to take stock of the leverage and influence they have with the internal parties that doesn t mean they can just say : Do this , do that and the internal parties will obey , of course not , but they do have influence . This was the basis for how I saw the Russian intervention . However much of a complication that it certainly is , as having a couple of aspects to it , that do pose an opportunity . Presumably , this additional Russian military assistance , does increase the Assad regime s and the dependence of president Assad himself , their dependence on Russian support , and that ought to give Moscow more leverage that it had before . The other thing is that insofar as the government of Russia is expending resources and will sustain casualties if it continues its effort , that gives an added incentive to President Putin to do what he can to try and resolve this conflict and not just let it go on and on for years . Russian government has no interest , I m sure , in propping a beleaguered regime for years and years , that simply doesn t do Russia any good .
