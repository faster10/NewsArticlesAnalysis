Just to go back to the original question about Trump : When Republicans decided in the House not to take up the immigration bill that passed the Senate with considerable Republican support , including for a while Marco Rubio , they started putting out all sorts of rhetoric about how people were flowing across our southern border illegally . They were saying this at a moment when net immigration from Mexico was below zero ? because of the recession , people were going back . But if everything was as bad as they said it was , why shouldn t people vote for Trump instead of the party establishment ? So I think there has been this sloganeering to appeal to the angriest parts of the right to keep it mobilized , when the party leadership had no real intention of acting on what the full implications of that rhetoric were .
