The UNHCR ' s regional response plan for 2014 catalogs the range of basic human needs of these millions of displaced persons : protection , including protection from sexual violence , shelter , food , health care , water , sanitation and hygiene . Over the long term , the displaced will have to recover their livelihoods . Children will need to resume their basic education to prevent a " lost generation " of Syrian children . If the United States is going eventually to " put boots on the ground , " providing these basic needs in both the near and long term should be the primary mission of the courageous Americans who deploy to the region .
