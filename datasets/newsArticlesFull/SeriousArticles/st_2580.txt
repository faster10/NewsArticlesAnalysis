The danger is that any Republican who gets elected will opt for a policy of isolation and re imposed sanctions as a way to appease his voters without actually launching another war .

At a time when the region is prone to deeper and more dangerous fractures with each passing month , staking out an uncompromising position is neither bold , nor reckless . The question for now is whether the GOP can avoid that temptation .
