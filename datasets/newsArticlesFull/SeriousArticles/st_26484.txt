All the chatter following the Broncos 20 18 AFC title game victory over the Patriots was how the Denver defense battered Tom Brady , and that was indeed the case . However , Manning didn t get off scot free in that game , being sacked three times and knocked down plenty more . The offensive line has been make shift all season because of injuries , and now they have arguably their toughest task of the year in the Panthers front seven . Even with Thomas Davis limited ( if he plays at all ) with a broken arm , Star Lotulelei and Kawann Short lead the defensive line , while All Pro linebacker Luke Keuchly is the defensive anchor . They could have a field day lighting up Manning if the line fails to protect him .
