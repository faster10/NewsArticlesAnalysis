Movies like ' Bridge Of Spies , ' ' Mad Max : Fury Road ' and ' The Martian , ' which have received the Best Picture nomination , were released in India last year and the Box Office numbers were not encouraging . While such movies are often re released after they score a nomination in hopes of attracting more audiences , it is yet to be seen whether such a move will work . The release dates of ' Room , ' ' Brooklyn ' and ' Spotlight , ' which have all been nominated for Best Picture , have not been decided as of now .
