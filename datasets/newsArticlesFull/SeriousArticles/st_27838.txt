The Syrian conflict is a very complex multi party conflict . If there ' s another way to provide the diplomatic space needed for a political solution , I have not identified it . Some colleagues have already reminded me that the UN has never solved a high stakes geostrategic conflict . And utilizing an obscure multilateral mechanism that will involve a highly unusual revocation of sovereignty is close to impossible . However , the UN ' s universal membership and legitimacy can provide an umbrella under which the Assad regime and non IS Syrian rebels , the Iranians and Saudis , and the United States and Russia find the means to halt IS ' s barbarous advances and allow Sunnis , Shiites , Kurds , and others to live alongside each other without a strongman imposed peace .
