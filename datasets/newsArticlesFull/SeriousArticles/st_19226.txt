Despite what the sadKanye meme would lead you to believe , he ' s feeling pretty good . " ( W ) e got the Vogue cover , Steve McQueen won the Oscar , we finally got married . . . You know ? We have a child . We ' re a family now . I am an arbiter of taste , and people think that I have the ability to make things cool or if I ' m doing it , it should be cool . And I feel that this stuff ' s starting to be cool . And that feels good to me . Because I don ' t like walking around with people thinking I ' m doing uncool s , because there ' s nothing I ' m doing that ' s uncool . It ' s all innovative . You just might not understand it yet . But it ' s cool . Family is super cool . Going home to one girl every night is super cool . Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool . Not wearing a red leather jacket , and just looking like a dad and s t , is like super cool .
