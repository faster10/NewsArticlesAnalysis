Now I ' m on a roll . I spot a soft camel coat for 79 . 95 ( 63 . 30 ) that would be 89 . 99 at home , saving me more than 25 , a pair of comfy leather ankle boots for 69 . 95 ( 55 . 38 ) that are 69 . 99 in the UK and a stripy top for 12 . 95 ( 10 . 25 ) . Unfortunately , a pair of silver kitten heels I ' d coveted at home were sold out and the store is generally lacking in glam shoes , but a pink and black party dress with jewel embellishments is there for 49 . 95 ( 39 . 52 ) , a saving of about 20 on buying it in Britain , where it would cost 59 . 99 .
