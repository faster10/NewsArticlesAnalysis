If you really object , rather than saying so outright , you can hint around , like Sandra Pierce of New York City does . " I ' ll say something beforehand to the mom about how nice it is outside and how my sons really love to play football in the yard , " she confesses . Or offer to host at your place , as Phil Corwin of Bellmore , New York , does . " I can ' t dictate to other parents , but I can make them happy . Most parents are more than happy to dump their kid at your place . " Well said , Dad !
