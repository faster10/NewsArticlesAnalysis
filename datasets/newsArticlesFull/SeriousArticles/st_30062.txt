Lowson Robinson , who has been working on a model village in his garden in Cumbria for more than ten years , said : ' The village looks lovely in the snow . There was a little flurry yesterday but I didn ' t expect it to lie . ' The retired coal miner , 67 , added : ' It ' s snowing today and I think it might continue until the weekend but then that should be it for the year . The weather here can get pretty bad and we get a lot of snow so it ' s hard to tell but spring should be just around the corner . ' Yesterday , forecasters said there is a risk of rain across the country for the rest of the week and it will continue to be a bit colder than the seasonal average .
