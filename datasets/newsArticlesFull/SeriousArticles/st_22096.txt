" We might have played it for her , but it definitely wasn ' t a Katy Perry record , " Dr Luke says by phone from Conway Recording Studio in Los Angeles . " We had it for a while . I wanted to make sure it didn ' t sound like everything else I ' ve done . I brought it into Billboard , and he just killed it . It can be hard in the verse , and the bridge is super , super hard , but the chorus is super pop . You can play that chorus acoustically on a guitar and it ' s still going to sound great . "
