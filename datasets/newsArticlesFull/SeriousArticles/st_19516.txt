" New Hampshire is fortunate to have a strong , principled senator in Kelly Ayotte , who stood up and cast a courageous vote in support of the Violence Against Women Act , " New Day for America spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp said in a statement Sunday . " This was actually one of the few votes that Senator Marco Rubio showed up for , but he voted no and is going to have a tough time explaining to New Hampshire voters why he turned his back on women . When John Kasich was in Congress , he voted twice to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act . "
