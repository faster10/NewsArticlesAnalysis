Sylvia was written in 1995 , so that makes it pretty old in dog years . The director Daniel Sullivan can t teach it many new tricks , but he can give it a typically adroit and able production . Broderick , who sometimes underplays his roles , is a glove like fit for the moony , diffident Greg . White plays Kate as tightly wound , but not entirely unsympathetic and she allows herself a few moments to showcase the daffiness she otherwise keeps buttoned up and belted in . Robert Sella , in a variety of roles , oversells his punchlines , but he still has a way of making them very funny .
