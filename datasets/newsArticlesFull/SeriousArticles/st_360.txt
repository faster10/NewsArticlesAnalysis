Unlike the mock up car Google first shared in May , this version is fully functional . It even has real headlights . The round , white and gray car is designed without permanent driving tools like a gas pedal or wheel . However , to comply with California state law , there are still removable , temporary controls for the required " safety driver " a real person who needs to be in the car and ready to take over in an emergency . The goal is to eventually remove any interior controls so that passengers can take a nap or knit while the car does all the work .
