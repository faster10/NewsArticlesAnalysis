All the other groups are in a state of collapse . The outsider electeds 5 poll average peaked at 37 . 2 all the way back in March , 2014 . They haven t been above 20 since July , and now stand at 12 . 8 . We ve already seen how the Tea Party Koch block has fallen . The establishment electeds peaked at 33 5 poll average again , and stand at 16 . 2 today ? less than 1 6 of the total voters . Even they haven t been above 20 since late August . Remember when summer was supposed to be the silly season , and now was when things were supposed to get real , with the grown ups back in charge ? Things are so bad for the establishment that even if Bush had totally dominated , driven every single other establishment candidate from the field , and captured all of their voters , that would only give him 16 . 2 ? barely more than half of Trump s total , and 4 points behind Carson .
