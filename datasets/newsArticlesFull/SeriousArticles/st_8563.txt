Just getting to the Esteros del Ibera is a challenge . My journey started with a 10 hour , 700 km overnight bus ride from my home in Buenos Aires to the small town of Mercedes in Corrientes Province . From there , cameraman Eduardo Aragona and I drove two hours on a bumpy , red dirt road to arrive at the Estancia Rincon del Socorro , the traditional Argentine ranch that the Tompkins operate , and where guests from around the globe come to get up close looks at rare species of capybara , caiman , deer and scores of birds .
