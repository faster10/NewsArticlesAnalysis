If you haven ' t done anything but take the parishioners money to show off financial prosperity while your members are struggling while your members have to go through appointments or levels of doors just to meet with you then YOU don ' t have the right to be a pastor . Pastor Jamal Bryant was absolutely right when he said that you will NOT find 100 Imams , Rabbis , and even White Clergy have a private meeting with Trump , so why must you do it ? So before you stand up and endorse behind a man who truly doesn ' t care about our communities before he pays for your extended garage or another jet plane or another house or car while your members are struggling , look at yourself in the mirror and get our house and soul in order .
