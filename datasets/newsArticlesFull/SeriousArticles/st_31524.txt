If you like your health plan , would you get to keep it under President Sanders ? That ' s also unclear . Sanders advertises his plan as " Medicare for All " but part of the reason Medicare is so efficient and inexpensive is that the federal government doesn ' t pay doctors as much to treat patients on Medicare . For that reason , many doctors won ' t treat Medicare patients . Sanders doesn ' t say at what rate health care providers would be compensated under his plan , and that ' s a huge unanswered question for your doctor . If your doctor chose not to participate in Sanders ' s program , you might have to buy a private insurance plan and pay separately for that coverage along with the increased taxes .
