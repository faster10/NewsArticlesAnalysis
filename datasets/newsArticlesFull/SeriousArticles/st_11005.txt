Saudi Arabia has not been able to carry along even some GCC countries on some important issues including recent breaking off of diplomatic ties with Iran and its approach towards brotherhood . Current Saudi effort for regional leadership is also faulty as it has not been able to dispel the impression that it is not focused on anti Iran sentiment the 34 country counter terrorism alliance could have sold out well but again two limiting factors are blocking the way , instead of putting it , at least , notionally under OIC command , Saudis decided to head it themselves and then let the impression go around that it could be a Sunni alliance against the Shiite . No right minded Sunni strategist could out rightly support such a sectarian direction of any international counter terrorism effort . At public level , Saudi foreign minister Adel Bin Ahmed al Jubeir did a good job by wading off such perception during their visits to Pakistan on January 07 . There is certainly sufficient strategic space a Muslim counter terrorism narrative and Muslim counter terrorism military effort through broad based coalition effort . Such an effort is required because it the Muslim countries that have suffered the most due to terrorism and what is being done by the international counter terrorism effort . While doing so the architects of coalition should keep in mind that the US led international effort counter terrorism effort failed because it stereotyped Muslims as terrorists . Any Muslim effort must not make a similar mistake .
