Love wasn t the only one thriving off James s unselfishness , with J . R . Smith knocking down some shots early and the Cavs as a whole moving the ball and capitalizing . Irving finished with 21 points , getting his turn with a 10 point fourth quarter . The stars all contributed , the effort never let up , and 67 points in a half against the vaunted Spurs defense was a season best ? and worst for the two sides . The Cavaliers leader set the tone , and it rubbed off . . . Smith even made an extra pass in the third quarter . ?
