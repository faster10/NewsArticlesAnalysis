I hope Roy will be telling them : ' You play for Liverpool , Manchester United , Chelsea , Arsenal , Manchester City , Everton . . . but this is England . Some of you may have won titles and Champions League medals , but that was playing for your club . This is the World Cup , this is the whole country . This is England v Italy and this is the biggest game you have ever played in your lives . So let ' s prepare and play as if our lives depend on it , let ' s really make things happen , go and win it . '
