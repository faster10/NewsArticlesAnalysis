To the extent a Republican moderator has a stake in the outcome , favoring one or another candidate , he or she would be more objectionable than mainstream media reporters who are not rooting for a particular candidate . Say what you will about John Harwood , but he was an equal opportunity aggressor . In that regard , the playing field was leveled . ( The better debaters ? including Cruz , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Sen . Marco Rubio ( R Fla . ) ? rose to the occasion and turned the tables on the sneering moderators . )
