Mackay signed Leon Clarke on loan from Wolves and Sheyi Ojo on loan from Liverpool , and also snapped up the Cameroon defender Gaeten Bong on a short term deal . Kim , though , is available as a free agent . He joined Cardiff in 2012 from Cerezo Osaka in Japan and quickly established himself under Mackay as the Bluebirds won promotion to the Premier League at the end of his first season . Kim scored his first top flight goal in a 2 2 draw with Manchester United in November 2013 , but has appeared only twice in the Championship this season and had his contract cancelled by mutual consent on January 24 .
