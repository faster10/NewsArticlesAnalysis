Meanwhile , Nishiyama said there is a plan to inject nonflammable nitrogen into reactors 1 , 2 and 3 to prevent the risk of another hydrogen explosion like the ones that extensively damaged the unit 1 and 3 housings in the days following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami . A buildup of hydrogen is an early sign of damage to a reactor ' s superheated core , but Nishiyama said no alarms had been sounded about rising pressure and that adding nitrogen would not force engineers to release hydrogen from the reactor vessel .
