Government failed you , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder told his constituents in his annual State of the State address on Jan . 19 . You deserve better . The comments were addressed specifically to the residents of Flint , who ve been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water for more than a year , after the city began using its polluted river as its main water source to save money . We will be there with long term solutions for as long as it takes to make this right , the governor went on . Republicans gave Snyder a standing ovation . Democrats in the statehouse were not impressed .
