" John Carter , " for whatever it ' s worth , isn ' t quite as dismal a movie as it is a moneymaker . Thirty , even 20 years ago , it might have been exotic enough to be taken for pop cultural innovation . Now it comes across as a lumbering , good natured oaf who happened to stumble into the marketplace at the wrong time . On the other hand , " The Hunger Games , " with its reality TV on toxic drugs premise , is so very much " of its time " that it ' s tempting to think much of its imagined future has already arrived . ( Do you feel a draft ? I do . )
