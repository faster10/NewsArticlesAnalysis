If there s a danger in the contest between Clinton and Sanders , it s the belief ? arguably justified , given the fracases over debate scheduling and voter contact files ? that the Democratic National Committee has placed its thumb on the scale for Clinton . An Obama endorsement for Clinton ? his first Secretary of State ? would make this even worse , fueling anger among some segment of Sanders supporters . Which , if Clinton won the nomination , would make reconciliation more difficult . And on the other end , an Obama endorsement for Sanders could rekindle the tensions of the 2008 primary , especially among Clinton s strongest and most dedicated supporters .
