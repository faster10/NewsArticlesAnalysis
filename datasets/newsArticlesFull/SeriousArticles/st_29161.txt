To harvest palm oil in an environmentally safe way , high carbon stock forests , peatlands , and high conservation value forests must be avoided for development , said Sumargo . He added that the Indonesian government has routinely granted concessions for oil palm development in forested areas , which has led to widespread deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan . The UCS also claims the government issues land leases on favorable terms to an elite , influential pool of investors . For example , the Sinar Mas Group , which owns one of the country ' s leading palm oil growers refineries , is controlled by the powerful Widjaja family empire . The company has been an ongoing target of heavy criticism from green groups for contributing to mass deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife .
