In post Iowa ads and interviews , Rubio s campaign , a pro Rubio super PAC , and the candidate himself are pitching him as the only candidate who s broadly acceptable to Republicans . That s an exaggeration . The ABC Post survey did find that when Republicans and Republican leaners were asked whether they would accept each candidate or find him unacceptable as the nominee , Rubio ranked first , with only 22 percent calling him unacceptable . But Cruz did almost as well , with a 26 percent rejection rate . And Trump wasn t far behind : 65 percent said he was acceptable 32 percent called him unacceptable . The NBC Journal survey posed a slightly different question : whether you could see yourself supporting that person for the Republican nomination . On that question , Rubio outscored Trump , but Cruz outscored Rubio . Twenty eight percent of Republicans said they couldn t support Rubio . Only 25 percent said they couldn t support Cruz .
