The results point to patterns in what happens when states intervene to try to help their preferred actor , and the results are strong and consistent that interventions rarely work to promote peace or reduce violence . For example , my own research has shown that the likelihood of a civil war lasting for four years without an intervention is 37 , but if there is an intervention the likelihood that it lasts for four years is 60 . The intervention accounts for the 50 increase in the length of the war .
