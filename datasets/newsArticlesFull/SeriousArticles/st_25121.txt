Among the weekend openers was Warner Bros . ' R rated comedy " Tammy " ( C Cinema Score ) , which managed to take in just 21 . 2 million in its first weekend in release and 32 . 9 million across the five day , cooling star Melissa McCarthy ' s recent box office hot streak . The second place opening isn ' t a disaster by any means " the pic only cost 20 million to produce " but it also didn ' t meet the studio ' s modest expectations ( 37 million across five days ) . On top of that , the lousy Cinema Score means that this one will drop hard and fast .
