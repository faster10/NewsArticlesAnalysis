PP : Excellent question , and we really ought to add that to the couple of points I made earlier about why the training and equipment program has yielded such puny results for a lot of expenditure . It is impossible for the most part to predict , while a civil war is going on , who is going to follow a moderate political course or an extreme political course once the dust settles , and we have some new political order . Fighting a civil war is an inherently immoderate thing to do , so in that sense , anyone who picks up a gun and starts shooting fellow Syrians is an extremists but that doesn t tell us anything one way or another , as to who is going to be radical jihadist , who is going to be moderate islamist , or who is going to be extreme or not extreme if they were give political power and that has been an additional problem with this so called vetting of rebels to see who would or would not receive Western aid .
