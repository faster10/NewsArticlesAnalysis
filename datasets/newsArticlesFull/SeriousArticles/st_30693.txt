Moscow and Washington ' s disagreement goes back to the beginning of the Syrian civil war , as I reported more than three years ago . In September , President Vladimir Putin went a step further in accusing the U . S . of supporting terrorists in Syria in his address to the U . N . General Assembly .

" He said it was irresponsible " to manipulate extremist groups and use them to achieve your political goals , hoping that later you ' ll find a way to get rid of them or somehow eliminate them . "
