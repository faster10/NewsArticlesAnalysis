One would never argue that the chaos into which the Middle East now descends is all President Obama s doing . It is not , by a long way . The music simply stopped on his watch , and it is he who is left to grope for a chair . No solicitude and no empathy , however . The bitter reality is that our hope and change president , as a drone addicted assassin signing death warrants on a routine basis , bears as much responsibility for the messes he now confronts as any of those predecessors who shaped them .
