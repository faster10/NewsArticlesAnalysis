Bacosa recalls getting a signing bonus of about 3 , 500 ( " I think Ted Turner paid me out of his own pocket , " he said ) , with a monthly salary of 575 and a deal on an apartment with wall to wall carpeting . His pro career was brief . He went 5 2 with a 4 . 35 ERA and six saves in the Pioneer League ( rookie ball ) with Idaho Falls . He could have gone to spring training the next year but declined , choosing instead to write a letter to then Braves VP Hank Aaron explaining his decision to go back to school . Only one player from that Idaho Falls team made the majors , outfielder Tony Tarasco .
