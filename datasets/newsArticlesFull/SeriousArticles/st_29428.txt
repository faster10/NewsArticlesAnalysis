When mere mortals like the rest of us try to decide who is deserving of hero worship , we should temper our expectations . Humans will disappoint . The truth is I am almost allergic to hero worship ( despite that recent tweet . ) There are people I admire , but I think it ' s best to focus on the qualities of individuals when I find them to be inspiring and worthy of admiration whether it ' s a girl from Pakistan or a particularly courageous and wise public figure . I try to appreciate moments of heroism and impressive personality traits .
