There have been a number of documented cases where police have found corpses burned almost to ashes but no burned furniture around them . Temperatures of 3 , 000 degrees would be required to burn a human body to this extent , yet in these cases only smoke damage is reported . Puzzled scientists have come up with the ' wick theory ' to explain such events . The theory is that the human body can become an ' inside out ' candle . The person ' s clothes are the wick , while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance , that keeps the blaze going . Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient , with the bottom half of the bodybeing cooler than the top . A grisly aside is that greasy stains left after such an event could be a residue for the person ' s body fat . The combustion would not be ' spontaneous ' however , because it would need an external source to start it off , such as a cigarette . Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark . Home Office pathologist Professor Michael Green told the BBC in 2005 : ' The way the body burns the so called wick effect seems to me and to my colleagues to be the most scientifically credible hypothesis . ' A body would take around five hours to burn in this way to ashes . Victims are often elderly , sick , or under the influence of alcohol , which might explain why they would not have been able to escape .
