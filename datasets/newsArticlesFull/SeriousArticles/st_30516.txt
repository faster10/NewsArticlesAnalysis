I unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech . Unfettered free speech is essential to any democratic and pluralistic society . So I support the right of Charlie Hebdo to print the most outlandish , offensive cartoons it can come up with . And , to give another example , I support the free speech rights of French comedian Dieudonn M ' bala M ' bala even though I personally find his anti Semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons I ' ve seen .
