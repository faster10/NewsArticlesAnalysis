Bush reminded the audience about the importance of education in ensuring equality for all . " It is not a coincidence that many of the defining struggles of the civil rights era from Little Rock Central to the University of Mississippi took place in educational settings . Those who engage in oppression and exploitation always deny real learning . Those who fight oppression always insist on equal education . Through civil rights laws , we assure justice in the present . Through education , we secure justice for the next generation . "
