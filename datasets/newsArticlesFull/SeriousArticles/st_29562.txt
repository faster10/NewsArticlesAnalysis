I ' ve written quite a bit about medical myths , so I ' m always a bit skeptical about medical " knowledge . " But one thing I , and I ' m sure many of you , think we understand is obesity . After all , weight issues crop up in media constantly . Just last night , Gov . Chris Christie was joking about donuts and his weight on The Late Show with David Letterman , and the First Lady ' s weight is once again a subject of discussion in the Washington Post even though by any objective standard she ' s in great shape .
