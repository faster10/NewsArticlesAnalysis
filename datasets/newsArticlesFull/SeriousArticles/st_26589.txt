Bernie was a lot better last night than he was in the previous debates . He ' s making his basic case in much more varied ways , rather than simply repeating the same line over and over again ( I don ' t think he actually said " millionaires and billionaires " once last night , but I admit I could be wrong I wasn ' t counting , or anything ) . He ' s doing a much better job of not letting Clinton define his positions for him , and a much better job of pointing out where Clinton ' s spin veers off into the unbelievable .
