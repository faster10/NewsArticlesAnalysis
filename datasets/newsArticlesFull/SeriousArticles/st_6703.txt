The fact of the matter is the majority of individual acts of executive clemency in our lifetime have been pardons , which simply restored the civil rights of the recipients . No one was sprung from jail . Violent criminals were not tossed into the streets . Judges and juries were not overturned . Recipients have typically committed minor offenses , many involving no incarceration whatsoever , and usually , many years if not decades before pardon . FBI background checks documented they had integrated back into society as law abiding productive members . Their pardons were not " gifts " so much as they were well deserved recognition .
