Things have been civil so far in the presidential race ( no , really ! ) But with two weeks to go before voting starts , ? things could get ugly . So what ' s left to say about any of the candidates that Donald Trump hasn ' t already said ? Hillary tried out painting Sanders as pro gun and anti Obamacare last night . On the GOP side , Jeb Bush is calling Marco Rubio a flip flopper on amnesty in ? a recent TV ad . ? Trump has been attacking Ted Cruz ' potential citizenship issues this month , and is ? now blaming Cruz , via bank shot , for Obamacare ? ( because Cruz supported John Roberts ' nomination to the Supreme Court Roberts ' votes preserved Obamacare . ) And then to take it one step further , Trump invoked 9 11 in a tweet in ? response to Cruz ' criticism of " New York values . " ( Cruz really should have seen this coming , right ? )
