" We wanted to design a place that feels like your home , " Zuckerberg said on stage Thursday , wearing a gray T shirt and one of those ear clip headsets you see on Old Navy employees . " Where you tell your story online is really personal . You invest a lot of time in it and you curate it . You link to it and you tell all your friends to find you there .
