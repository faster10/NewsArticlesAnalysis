Is it thawed yet ? Many Thanksgiving dinners are made with frozen turkeys , but thawing takes time . The general rule is it takes 24 hours of thawing time for every four pounds of turkey , which means a 12 pound bird ( which is about the smallest size stores sell ) needs 3 days to thaw . That doesn ' t mean you have to wait until Friday to cook Thanksgiving dinner . Instead , you ' ll need to use the quick thaw method . Leave the turkey in its original packaging , and put it in the sink and cover with cold water . You ' ll need to change the water every 30 minutes , so don ' t start this process and leave the house . It will take 30 minutes per pound , so a 12 pound turkey will take 6 hours to thaw .
