North Korea s announcement Wednesday coincided with a suspicious 5 . 1 magnitude quake near the underground site where North Korea has previously conducted three nuclear tests in 2006 , 2009 , and 2013 , says Melissa Hanham , a senior research associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies . While many experts doubt that North Korea s claims are accurate , the development , if true , would represent a major advancement of the belligerent regime s nuclear capabilities . A hydrogen bomb , nuclear expert Joseph Cirincione agrees , is 1 , 000 times more powerful than the kind of atomic weapon that the U . S . used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II . But even if the blast is smaller than Pyongyang claims , North Korea s nuclear program is steadily advancing with an estimated arsenal of 10 to 16 atomic weapons , which could total 20 by year s end .
