This is probably the best lens to view Ben Carson with ? and anyone else who actually does manage to gain some momentum . Facts will not be an issue during the GOP primary , only the crafting of appealing fantasies will matter , and anyone who is capable at that , a la Donald Trump , has a shot at going all the way . But winning the nomination will not be the ultimate prize this cycle . Reshaping the issue landscape will be . Given how grotesque it already is , I shudder to think what that will look like in the end .
