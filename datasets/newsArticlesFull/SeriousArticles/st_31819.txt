Oil prices , following a 15 year boom and bust pattern , have shown a common thread so far , i . e the reorganisation of the oil supply structure .

The players in effect stayed the same , with Saudi Arabia , the US and the recent entrant China , followed by Russia and the rest . Despite the characters playing mildly differing roles in the last two decades , it might be possible that the very theatre of energy play , is due for a shift in the coming decade .
