" This is in reference to the speculation and questionable reporting surrounding the death of my son Sage , " Stallone said . " Because when a parent loses a child there is no greater pain . Therefore I am imploring people to respect my wonderfully talented son ' s memory and feel compassion for his loving mother Sasha , because this agonizing loss will be felt for the rest of our lives . Sage was our first child and the center of our universe and I am humbly begging for all to have my son ' s memory and soul left in peace . "
