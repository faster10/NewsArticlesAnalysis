Perry was on the defensive all night and , despite his reputation nationally , he came across as " liberal " on some issues , criticized from the right on the vaccination issue , immigration , and Afghanistan .

And once again , Romney was able to escape unharmed from a not so friendly crowd by shifting his attacks toward Perry and tacking away from some of his more center right positions .
