Imagine you ' re traveling from Sacramento , CA to Richmond , VA on a flight you ' ve been anticipating for a couple of weeks so as to reunite with the family members you were missing for quite a while . At the airport , you ' ve gone through all the security inspections and passport check , handed over your laptop and iPad devices for " additional screening " , taken off your shoes at the request of the guards talking to you grimly , emptied your pockets having no option but to allow the security officer unzip your wallet and find how much money you ' re carrying while he is actually looking for something suspicious , and finally boarded the plane , fastened your seatbelt , adjusted your pillow and just given a call to your brother before the taxiing to let him know that you ' re on the way .
