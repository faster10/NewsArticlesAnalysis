The blogger death toll gets higher in Bangladesh if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . In January 2013 , blogger Asif Mohiuddin , who wrote critical commentary on religion , Islamist groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by Islamists . In February 2013 , blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider , who had written about Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups , was hacked to death by members of an Islamist militant group , according to police investigations . Later in 2013 , Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . While arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions .
