" I know there ' s a lot of things that they ' ll say , ' Hey , why didn ' t you do this or that ? ' " Caldwell said . " And there ' s always been hindsight and that kind of stuff that you look at it and there ' s probably a number of things that we could look at someone could come up with a little different idea . But the fact of the matter is , I ' m proud of the way our guys played . They played tough , we were ready for a big game and I think we played that way up until all of about a couple flashes of that ballgame . "
