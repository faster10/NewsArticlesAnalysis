British people may have gone to join the " Islamic State ' " hoping to find a new sense of purpose and self expression , and perhaps the British fighters associated with Foley ' s death believe they have succeeded . But they are not the product of the United Kingdom . They are the product of something far deeper , rooted in the evolution of their own societies and the transitional period between immigrant parents and integrated children . If society is not fluid , and does not accept the rough ride that fluidity can bring , it will not move forward . Terrorism , as expressed by Foley ' s executioner , is reactionary and backward looking . It offers nothing to anyone .
