What to do about the offensive line ? Two of Kansas City s veteran offensive linemen , Jeff Allen and Donald Stephenson , are unsigned going into next season . Based on the Chiefs recent history of letting their veteran linemen depart as free agents , there s little reason to expect they will return next season . That leaves tackles Eric Fisher and Jah Reid , guards Laurent Duvernay Tardif and Zach Fulton and center Mitch Morse as players the Chiefs can count on for next year . That s not enough , particularly if the Chiefs are hit with another rash of injuries like the one they went through this year . The Chiefs also have some developmental prospects , and veterans Ben Grubbs and Paul Fanaika will be coming off the injured reserve list . Even so , the Chiefs have work to do here . They also need to decide whether Fisher , a former overall No . 1 draft pick , is good enough to be their left tackle . He was improved this season but still has to get better if he s going to be the long term answer .
