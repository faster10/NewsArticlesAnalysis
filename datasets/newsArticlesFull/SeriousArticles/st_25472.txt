But Clinton appeared to stumble in attempting to explain her position on the death penalty . She said she would not be disappointed if the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty . I would breathe a sigh of relief about that , because I think many states have gone way too far , she said . But she defended the use of capital punishment for terrorists . In the federal system , I do have some questions about removing it completely for terrorism , she said , pointing to the Boston Marathon bombers and suspected 9 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as examples . There are some really heinous crimes that are , in my view , still arguably ones that should potentially have the death penalty .
