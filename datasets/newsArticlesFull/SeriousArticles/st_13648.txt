The pilots did get a warning about an impending stall about seven seconds before the plane hit the sea wall . But why was there only a seven second warning ? Could systems be reconfigured so that warnings about potential stalls are issued sooner ? To be sure , earlier warnings might yield a proliferation of false alarms , but might that price be worth paying so that true alarms arrive in time to be useful ? Had Asiana Flight 214 been warned seven seconds earlier , we might never have heard about it .
