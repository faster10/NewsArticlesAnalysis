What has happened to Obama s pledge seven months ago to re evaluate US policy on Israel ? At the UN the US as usual digs in its heels when Israel is admonished . France has suggested that the UN Security Council adopt a resolution that would outline the basic parameters of a just political settlement . The proposal would contain a deadline for agreement . If broken by Israel the rest of the world would be encouraged to pressure it with a tight economic boycott . This is the best idea suggested in a long time . Europe alone , Israel s biggest trade partner , could bring Israel to its knees . Failing success in changing Israeli minds a one state solution is surely inevitable . The present partial de facto one will become a sort of de jure one .
