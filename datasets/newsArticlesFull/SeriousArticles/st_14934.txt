Conventional wisdom is often wrong ? ? ? not because the analysis is necessarily flawed , but because people try to settle questions prematurely . And in the case of Bush s campaign , I think pundits are sounding the death knell too soon . It is true that his debate performances have not been good , and the idea that the way to slow Sen Marco Rubio s ( R Fla . ) rise would be to launch a peevish , non sequitur attack on Rubio s Senate attendance record was particularly weak . If Bush thought of that himself , he needs to check his improvisational instincts , and if his team is to blame , it suggests a significant deficiency in their Ideas Department . But the half life of any single debate performance that doesn t include a defining Perryesque Oops moment is not very long . Bush didn t do well but he did not self immolate . ( In full disclosure , I worked for Jeb Bush s father and was certainly a supporter of his brother s campaigns , but I have no particular alliance to any Republican in 2016 . )
