Muslims deserve more . We deserve to have our humanity acknowledged not only when an easy , laughable target like Trump challenges it , but also when it ' s assaulted by America ' s partners , by forces Washington can ' t bring itself to care about and by the U . S . government itself . We deserve a conversation that features our voices and arguments from people other than conservatives competing to be the most hateful , or liberals sparring for the shiniest pluralistic credentials . I feel ill when I hear Republican presidential candidates talk about barring Muslim refugees from the country . But I don ' t feel much better when I see liberals eager to bash American imperialism stay ? oddly silent about human rights violations by non U . S . actors , and suggest that ? bloodthirsty dictators like Saddam Hussein ? are " better " for the world . Whose world is that ? What kind of " better " is this ?
