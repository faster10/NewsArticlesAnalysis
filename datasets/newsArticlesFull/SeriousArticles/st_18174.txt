The Bulls triangle offense was a breath of fresh air during what was an increasingly stagnant NBA scene in the mid 1990s . The veteran team didn t push the ball at Golden State s level ( slowed down to 20th in pace , in comparison to Golden State s No . 3 ranking this year ) , but the squad s ball movement flew in the face of an NBA that was more than content to run dull two man games that the Bulls happily loaded up on defensively ( to the tune of the league s top defensive ranking ) while laughing down its sleeves at the two man ideal offensively ( to the tune of you guessed it ) .
