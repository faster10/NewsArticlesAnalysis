" I did idolize Kobe Bryant . I studied him , wanted to be like him , He was our Michael Jordan . I ' ve been disappointed this year because you guys ( the media ) treated him like ( stuff ) . He ' s a legend , and all I hear is about how bad he ' s playing , how bad he ' s shooting and it ' s time for him to hang it up . You guys treated one of our legends like ( stuff ) , and I didn ' t really like it . So hopefully now you can start being nice to him now that he decided to retire after this year . "
