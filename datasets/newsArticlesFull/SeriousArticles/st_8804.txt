One of the good ideas in yesterday s Autumn Statement was the scrapping of a previously announced bad idea , namely the tax credit changes announced in the Summer Budget . Under those plans , the rate at which tax credits are withdrawn with income would have been raised from 41 to 48 , and the income level above which that rate applies would have been slashed from ? 6 , 420 to ? 3 , 850 . The savings this would have produced would almost certainly have been of the false economy variety , because it would have undermined work incentives . Low paid employees would have lost 80p for every ? 1 in extra gross earnings . Sure , spending on tax credits would have gone down . But it would also have led to lower work levels , and therefore , eventually , to higher spending on other types of benefits .
