The tea party stands for a series of propositions that don ' t meet the reality test : that deficits matter more than jobs , that cutting deficits and tightening credit will accelerate economic growth , that high taxes and over regulation are the most important reasons that growth has not revived , and that America still offers the world ' s best opportunity for the poor to rise . Tea party plans call for a radical shift in the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor and promise big reductions in government spending without touching any of the benefits of current retirees .
