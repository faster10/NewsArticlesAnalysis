As I have said from day one I want to see debates . I love debates . I think it s good for the Democratic Party , I think it s good for the people of this country , but you ve got to do it in a rational way , you just can t do it because some network says this and some network says that , Sanders said . I would hope that in the very short future we can develop a series of debates , and I think . . . Illinois , Ohio , California , New York state are some of the states we might want to be looking at .
