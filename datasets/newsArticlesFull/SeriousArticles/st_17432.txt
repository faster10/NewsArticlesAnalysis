Jennifer Brower of Alexandria , Virginia Ray Downey , the most decorated firefighter in the history of New York City , a tireless soldier in the battle for the safety and security of the people of the United States , and an amazing father and grandfather , died in the command post in New York City on September 11 , 2001 . I had the honor of getting to know Ray through our work on the Gilmore Commission . My daughter is named after him , and he is a constant source of inspiration whenever I am scared to do things . I do not know whether he was scared , but it certainly never stopped him .
