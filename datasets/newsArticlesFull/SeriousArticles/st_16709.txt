Johnson : When I was a kid looking up to all the greats that were on the covers coming up , and then to be one of those guys on the cover , it ' s surreal . Knowing that millions of fans took part in the campaign , and to be the one they selected to appear on the cover of the game they play every day is an honor . To make it this far , and to beat out guys like Cam and Aaron Rodgers , a Super Bowl winning quarterback , it ' s surreal to say the least . Much love to all the fans who voted for me .
