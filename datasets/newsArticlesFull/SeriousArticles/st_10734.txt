Baumgartner needed a pressurized suit because the atmosphere is very thin at such high altitudes , as well as very cold . If you ' ve ever taken a long distance flight that shows the airplane ' s location and other data , you know that such planes fly at about 35 , 000 to 40 , 000 feet , which is about seven miles up , and temperatures are well below freezing . Add in the wind chill since falling through air is the equivalent of standing still in a wind and unprotected warm blooded animals would freeze quickly .
