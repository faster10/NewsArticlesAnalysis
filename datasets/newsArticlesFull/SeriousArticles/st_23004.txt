After his initial failed run at the White House , Huckabee immediately scored his own show at Fox News . During his ? Fox tenure , Huckabee became an accomplished snake oil salesman , pitching a slew of sham products . He endorsed Goldline , a precious metal retailer that targets conservatives and survivalists on right wing radio with fear based advertising ( Goldine was later forced to pay 4 . 5 million for defrauding its customers ) . He also promoted a dubious diabetes treatment , an especially sordid thing to do for money . Huckabee even used his show on Fox to grow his email list , which he promptly rented to corporate hucksters .
