It ' s been a bit easier of late , though , largely due to injuries . The Panthers lost both Charles Tillman and Bene Benwikere to season ending injuries during the last few weeks of the regular season , which pushed midseason signing Cortland Finnegan into a prominent role . And Finnegan has not exactly been great in that role . Over the last four weeks in which he ' s been receiving regular snaps at that spot , he gave up 14 catches for 183 yards to slot receivers alone . Count on Palmer to pick on Finnegan if he spies a one on one matchup in the slot .
