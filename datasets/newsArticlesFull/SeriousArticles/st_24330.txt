I spent a day last week in San Francisco investigating construction of Super Bowl City , the pop up NFL theme park in Justin Herman Plaza , just across from the Ferry Building . Free to the public . People are advised to take public transportation . Naturally , because I am a car loving South Bay citizen , I drove . I parked in Lot A across McCovey Cove from AT T Park and walked the mile and a half along the Embarcadero to the Ferry Building . Wasn ' t bad . But my first amusing sight was passing by the Giants Dugout Store and in the front window ( as well as occupying the entire front of the store ) was Super Bowl 50 merchandise . So , even the Bay Area ' s foremost baseball merchandising machine is cashing in on football fever .
