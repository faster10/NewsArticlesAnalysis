Many believe recognition of a Palestinian state would exacerbate already poor relations between the Palestinian Authority government and Israel . Some politicians in Israel have called for unilateral responses to the Palestinian bid including the outright annexation of territory in the West Bank , the withholding of tax revenue collected on behalf of the Palestinians , and the cancellation of various parts of the 1993 Oslo accords that created the Palestinian Authority . Potential moves like this and what some believe could be a rising level of Palestinian frustration at unmet expectations could add a great deal of tension on the ground and contribute to the possibility of an outbreak of violence . Palestinian Authority leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on Israel to be more reasonable in future negotiations .
