Langewiesche : It all relates to flight control characteristics and how the stick feels in your hand . . . . The attitude or the pitch of the airplane stays where you put it , it ' s an airplane that responds in an extremely docile manner to the control stick when it ' s flown by hand . . . .

The airplane will take over , and it will override the pilot , and philosophically that ' s a really provocative thing to do .
