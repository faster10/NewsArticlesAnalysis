There have been many memorable home runs in postseason history , but there s only one home run turned single . The Mets and Braves played an epic Game 5 in the 1999 NLCS . The Braves took the lead in the 15th inning , but the Mets rallied to tie . With the bases loaded and one out , Robin Ventura hit a drive to right field that sailed over the fence . But in all the excitement , Ventura didn t even make it to second base as the Mets mobbed him halfway there . The official scorer awarded him a single and the Mets were winners .
