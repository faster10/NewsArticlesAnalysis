Bryant would need to play until he ' s 41 years old to reach this marker . That seems absolutely crazy now . Yet what if Bryant were to get in a good health groove , and manage to maintain a level where he could be a starter not a star , but a starter and enjoy watching this Lakers team become whatever its ceiling ends up being ? It ' s not completely 100 percent out of the question , especially given the fact he might be able to bump that scoring output a bit on some nights . He ' ll just need to play five more seasons . Good luck with that , Kobe .
