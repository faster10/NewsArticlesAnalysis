The standard caveat applies for Walsh s miss , though : the game shouldn t have come down to it . Minnesota had a great chance to score a touchdown in the first quarter when Seahawks punter Jon Ryan received a low snap and couldn t scramble for the first down . But with first and goal at the seven yard line , Adrian Peterson ran into the line twice . A third down pass was incomplete and Walsh had to settle for the field goal . The Vikings defense set up good field position all game , as Minnesota s two other scoring drives totaled just 28 and 19 yards . Not punching anything in for a touchdown gave Seattle the opening for a fourth quarter comeback .
