He has attracted enough flak to have taken down a less resilient artist . But Gervais is more than capable of defending himself against negative reviews . He declares that , " Everything ever made has had mixed reviews , and why not ? Everyone is different . I know people who think that The Office is the best thing they ' ve ever seen , and I know people who think that The Office is the worst thing they ' ve ever seen . Why turn out something safe and homogenised ? What ' s the point of that ? The more challenging and less anodyne something is , the more mixed its reviews will be . I wouldn ' t have it any other way . Anything that polarises people is probably saying something . An artist moaning about the critics is like a sailor moaning about the waves . They ' re there . Deal with them or don ' t get on the boat . "
