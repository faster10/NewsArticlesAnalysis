Hijab was referring to lifting the siege of towns and villages inside Syria , an end to bombardment by the Syrian and Russian air force , and to a general amnesty to set all political prisoners free . He also asked to end the targeting of civilian neighbourhoods and to control the chaotic access to arms on the Syrian battlefield . Hijab , who defected in the spring of 2012 , expressed deep concern over De Mistura s insistence that talks take place with no pre conditions . The UN mediator urged the opposition to attend the talks and make themselves heard in their demand for Al Assad to step down , but was equally clear in saying that this cannot be a precondition for talks , as neither the Americans , nor the Russians , or Syrian officialdom , would accept such a condition .
