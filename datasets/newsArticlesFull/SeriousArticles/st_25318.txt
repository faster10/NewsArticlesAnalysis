And finally , to end on an amusing note , a town in New York is the latest example of life imitating art . Or , more precisely , life imitating South Park . In specific , the episode dealing with the South Park flag . The ironically named town of Whitesboro , New York got some scrutiny for their bizarre official image , but in the end chose to stick with their town seal depicting a white man choking a Native American . No , really click that link if you think we ' re making this up . It ' s absolutely impossible to read the image any other way , especially when you consider that this is actually an updated seal ( the original one had the Native American almost lying on the ground , while being choked ) . The town says the image " depicts a friendly wrestling match between village founder Hugh White and an Oneida Indian . " Um , OK . Sure , if that ' s what you say . We wonder , however , what the average Oneida would think about the matter .
