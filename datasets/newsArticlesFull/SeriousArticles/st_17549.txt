It ' s somewhat embarrassing to the NFL when a division winner has a sub . 500 record and hosts a playoff game , but it has happened before , and the team in question has managed to win . Last year ' s Carolina Panthers won the NFC South at 7 8 1 and beat Arizona in the first round . The 2010 Seattle Seahawks won the NFC West at 7 9 and beat the defending Super Bowl champion Saints in the first round . And while they weren ' t under . 500 , the Tim Tebow Denver Broncos of 2011 won their division with an 8 8 record and beat the defending AFC champion Steelers in the first round .
