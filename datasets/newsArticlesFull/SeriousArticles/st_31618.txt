Once again , Tom Brady was a ( S ) urvivor . It wasn t his greatest day , but can you blame him after being hit a career high 23 times ? The results of all the concussive chaos were poor decision making and inaccuracy . The Broncos repeatedly took away his first option , forcing him to hold the ball an average of 2 . 43 seconds . Most of the season , that number barely was higher than 2 . Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips scheme put pressure on the Pats line to protect longer . It couldn t . Brady completed 48 . 2 percent of his throws , threw three picks ( the one on the two point conversion doesn t really count , but it ended the season ) and converted only 2 of 15 third downs ( 13 . 3 percent ) . On the first interception , he never saw linebacker Von Miller drop in coverage on tight end Rob Gronkowski and then widen out to put himself in the passing lane . On the second , he was fooled by Phillips call , believing he had running back James White one on one with a linebacker . Safety Darian Stewart undercut White and made the pick of a ball that was underthrown because defensive end Malik Jackson was in Brady s grill . Brady had an awful 18 . 1 passer rating at halftime , and even after Denver lost its safeties in the fourth quarter , the defense kept flattening him , twice forcing hurried fourth down throws that ended key drives . Still , Brady lofted a perfect fourth and 10 pass to Gronkowski for 40 yards . Four plays later , as he was falling backwards from another hit , he lofted a great ball between two defenders , and Gronk went up to snare it in the end zone , reminiscent of Dwight Clark from Joe Montana . Any quarterback would have been rattled by all the hits , but few would have stood tall enough to come within one pass of overtime .
