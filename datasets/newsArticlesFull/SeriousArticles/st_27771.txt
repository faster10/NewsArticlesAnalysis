Who needs the USA ? " Transformers " had a relatively mediocre turnout in America , grossing less than 250 million good enough to become the No . 2 film of the summer , but only No . 4 among the four " Transformers " films . On the other hand , overseas the film picked up 821 million including more than 300 million in China , becoming that country ' s highest grossing film of all time . That was no accident : China is the second biggest film market in the world , and Hollywood is catering to it more and more .
