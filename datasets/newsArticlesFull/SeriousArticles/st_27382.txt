I ' m coming around to the idea that fans under 35 or so just have no idea what a good tactical manager looks like . We ' ve given ourselves over to this notion that a manager ' s job is almost entirely in the clubhouse , in managing the people . There ' s always been that element to the job , but there used to be a lot more baseball to it and a lot less babysitting . All of the trends over the last generation or so have taken the thinking out of managing ? set bullpen roles , set lineups , strict five man rotations , small benches with few tactical options ? in a way that leaves fans who don ' t remember Earl Weaver and Whitey Herzog and Billy Martin and Davey Johnson with no frame of reference . Most fans didn ' t grow up playing Strat O Matic , so they don ' t get why walking the bad No . 8 hitter to face the pitcher is a bad idea . They just see the out , and not the difference between the pitcher leading off the next inning and the leadoff man doing so . It becomes harder and harder to explain why these things are important when not only are there so few managers doing it better , the industry is so obviously not selecting for those skills .
