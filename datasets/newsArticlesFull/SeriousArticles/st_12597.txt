Although the two sets of circumstances are different and Mr Cameron has the authority to order military action without going to Parliament , his reticence is understandable . He has promised not to exercise his prerogative without the endorsement of the Commons and while most MPs were willing to countenance British warplanes bombing Isil positions in Iraq , many remain oddly coy about the same aircraft attacking similar targets a few score miles away in Syria . The Prime Minister will not risk a vote unless he can win it because another defeat would be a political and diplomatic calamity . However having got this far , not risking a vote would also have serious consequences .
