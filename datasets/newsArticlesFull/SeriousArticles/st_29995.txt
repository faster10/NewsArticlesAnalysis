The plot gets overcomplicated when the villainous Lydia ( " Modern Family ' s " Sofia Vergara ) , offers to pay the Stooges what they need to off her nerd husband , Teddy ( Kirby Heyborne ) , a former orphan himself . The actors deserve a full throated woo woo woo ! But the gags don ' t blossom with repetition . The Stooges were always better in short doses . And 90 minutes of PG nyuk nyuk nyuk can seem like an eternity . Even when Moe hooks up with the cast of " Jersey Shore , " this century ' s bottom feeding purveyors of lowbrow comedy , the jokes grow stale . For the Farrellys , " The Three Stooges " is a labor of love . For non believers , it ' s merely a labor .
