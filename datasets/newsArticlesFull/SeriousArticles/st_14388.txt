Former Liverpool legend , Stan Collymore wrote in his column for the Daily Mirror that Man Utd should stop messing around and sign Jose Mourinho . He wrote : But just because Guardiola went on to achieve special things at Barcelona does not automatically mean Giggs will do the same at Manchester United . Guardiola is one of the most obsessive men you will ever meet in his craft and he has an ability to verbalise his exact thoughts . Giggs , on the other hand , is quite shy , and sometimes I look at his eyes and wonder what s going on behind them . When we were players , there was nothing about him which made me think he d make a great manager one day , and even though many believe he will succeed the beleaguered Louis van Gaal when time is ? eventually called on his troubled reign , I haven t seen anything to change my mind .
