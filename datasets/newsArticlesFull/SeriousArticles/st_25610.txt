Edelman wasn t around back in Week 12 when the Patriots lost in Denver , 30 24 , and the Patriots went just 2 for 14 on third downs . It was gross . Brady went Edelman s way four times on third down last weekend against Kansas City in the Divisional Round , moving the chains on a pair of connections ? ( matching their third down conversion success of two months ago ) . And just having Edelman on the field , even if he s blanketed by Talib , will open the field for Brady s other targets , guys not named Keshawn Martin this time around ( though Martin may play a role in this one too ) . All of that will make it much more difficult for the Broncos defense ? to key in on Rob Gronkowski .
