Some patients in Devinsky ' s trial also did worse while on cannabidiol , but he thinks there ' s no way to tell if it was because of the drug or something else . He says we won ' t know until a full clinical trial has run its course . Without that , the perceived effects of the drug might be a placebo effect or it could be some other confounding factor that hasn ' t been caught in the study . What ' s more , a few hundred patients isn ' t a lot of patients , and doctors still need to see what will happen when a patient is on cannabidiol for more than a few months .
