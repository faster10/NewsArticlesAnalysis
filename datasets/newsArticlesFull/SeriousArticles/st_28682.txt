Cooke : We had a pleasant communication together through e mail . He was really generous with his time with me . In order for the project to go forward , he had to approve it . He really didn ' t at first . I think he eventually saw that we weren ' t interested in taking Parker and doing what we wanted with him . We were very interested in having him show us what he thought this could be or should be and taking it from there . At that point he definitely started to get more excited about it . The thing that really sold it , he asked me a few questions about how I planned to write it . I e mailed back , " I don ' t plan on writing anything if I can help it . I plan on using your words wherever possible . That ' s the reason I ' m going to do the stories in the year they were written , so that I don ' t have to rewrite your stories to accommodate cell phones or all the other things that have happened in the world . I want your words on the page . " I think he really appreciated that . Of course I wish he had lived to see this , because I think he would have been delighted . I know his family has been very happy about all of this . We ' re really proud of the books and what they ' re doing for Donald ' s legacy .
