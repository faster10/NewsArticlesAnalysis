If all the cards fall the right way and Cruz is unable to win anywhere where there isn t a large evangelical population and Trump decides he wants to go back to playing golf and none of the rest of the establishment pack can climb out of the pile , maybe Rubio will be able to bridge the gap between the conservative movement and the establishment as he s now promising on a loop . And that s making the huge assumption that the anti immigration fetishists will hold their noses and vote for him despite his one apostasy . But that still doesn t solve their problem . Rubio is so far to the right and the party is so hostile to racial and ethnic minorities that they cannot win a national election . He s got a Hispanic last name and a beautiful young family , but his record shows he s just another right wing extremist .
