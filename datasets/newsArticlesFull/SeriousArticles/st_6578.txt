The answer , as of Saturday , is " maybe . " And anyone who tells you anything different is making it up . The Giants themselves don ' t know whether they will make a coaching change at the end of this season . As it so often does , the decision could come down to the way the Giants finish . They could play hard to the end , stay in the race and maybe even steal away with a historically attainable NFC East title . They could also shut it down , become noncompetitive and tune out Coughlin ' s message , if they want to make it clear it ' s time for a change .
