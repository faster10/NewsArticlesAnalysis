PLUTA : Although , well , Flint has a new mayor , Karen Weaver . The former mayor , Dayne Walling , was swept out of office amid voter anger over this water crisis . You just referred to Gov . Snyder ' s state of the state address . Karen Weaver actually skipped that , even though it was largely devoted to Flint . She was in Washington for a meeting of the national conference of mayors . She met with the president , Michigan ' s congressional delegation . And in a public forum , she asked if this would ' ve happened if Flint wasn ' t a community that was poor and wasn ' t a community that ' s mostly African American . And it ' s worth pointing out that now , Gov . Snyder says he wants to take a lot of the authority that was seized by the state in Flint and actually transfer it back to the Flint mayor .
