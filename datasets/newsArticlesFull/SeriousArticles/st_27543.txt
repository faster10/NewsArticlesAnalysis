" If you ' re enjoying it , why do something else ? And what would you do ? Well , a good answer is ' Take more holidays , ' which is definitely on the cards , but I don ' t seem to do that . I love what I do so much that I don ' t really want to stop . I ' m just kind of casually keeping an eye on how I feel , and onstage , it feels like it ' s always felt . So for the time being , the band ' s hot , I ' m really enjoying myself , still singing like I sang , not experiencing , touch wood , any sort of problems to speak of . If it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it . "
