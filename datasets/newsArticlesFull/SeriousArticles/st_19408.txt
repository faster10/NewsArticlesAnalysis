The curious relationship between state run lotteries and taxes does not end there though . Even when someone wins the lottery , the winnings are subject to special withholding taxes at the state and federal levels . If someone wins the 640 million jackpot , they would be immediately subject to a 25 federal withholding and state withholding rates as high as 12 . Their total income tax burden on the winnings might be more depending on how they invest that income and what credits and deductions they take next April .
