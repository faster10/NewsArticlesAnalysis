While Russia has been accused of targeting primarily anti Assad forces with its air campaign , if true , its focus is likely to change as a result of the Metrojet bombing . Undoubtedly , Mr Putin will shift focus more toward eradicating IS , which has the benefit , from Moscow ' s perspective , of also serving to support Mr Assad . The U . S . is slowly coming to the realization that the alternative to Mr Assad is either IS or some amalgamation of jihadist groups none of which are an acceptable alternative . Israel decided years ago that it preferred the devil that it knows ( Mr Assad ) . The U . S . should take a page out of Jerusalem ' s play book . Do we want yet another example of a strong man ousted in favor of chaos , as in Iraq , Libya and Yemen ?
