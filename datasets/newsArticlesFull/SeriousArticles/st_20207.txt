If White ' s afraid of modern women , it ' s because he ' s always fetishized the past he ' s a man so bugged out by technology , he once built a guitar from three nails , some wood , and a Coke bottle . Musically , that nostalgia for simpler times works here . Now a Nashville resident , he ' s recruited pedal steel players , harpists , and violinists for a set so vintage in style with nods to ' 70s country ( ' ' Blunderbuss ' ' ) , ' 60s garage ( ' ' Sixteen Saltines ' ' ) , classic rock ( ' ' Freedom at 21 ' ' ) , and the blues ( ' ' I ' m Shakin ' ' ' ) that it ' s sequenced to play on vinyl .
