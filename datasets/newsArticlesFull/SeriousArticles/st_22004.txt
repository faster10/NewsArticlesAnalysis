She spent exactly an hour dismissing poor Hsieh Su wei of Taiwan , 6 1 , 6 2 , shortly before Sharapova beat the Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6 2 , 6 1 in 71 minutes . In the first round , Williams began the defence of her title rather more tentatively , and gave herself an A for effort in beating the Italian Camila Giorgi . On day three , she had recovered her composure and her court presence . She looked scarily strong again . That first round helped me because I was really just fighting . I gave a big effort there , said the American . Today I just wanted to stay focused for the whole time . I don t think I made that many errors ? and I moved much better . So , slowly but surely , I m feeling a little bit better .
