The couple also appears to have made financial plans for their family after their deaths , with investigators discovering that about 28 , 000 was deposited into Farook s bank account two weeks before he and his wife carried out the attack . It is believed to have been from an online lending company , federal authorities said . Some of the money ? 10 , 000 ? may have gone to reimburse Marquez for the use of his weapons so that Farook s name would not be on file in connection with the rifles . Withdrawals totalling 15 , 000 appear to have gone to Farook s mother , Fox News reported .
