And as if those obstacles to accurate polling were not enough , there is also the Trump factor . As Donald Trump is no doubt aware , polls measure first and foremost name recognition , and his is very high given the success of his " Apprentice " reality TV show . And so unless pollsters are very careful , polls of voter intentions with respect to Trump may well consistently over state the breadth and depth of his support . One good test of that problem will likely come in the South Carolina GOP primary to be held on February 20th . As of today , the polls indicate that Trump is leading there , despite the presence of large numbers of white , evangelical Christians who seem likely on election day to support Ted Cruz .
