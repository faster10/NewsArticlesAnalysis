What To Watch For : The Steelers might want to seriously consider doing nothing but rush the ball . The Browns are the second worst in the NFL , giving up nearly 5 yards a rush . Even when the Browns stack the box , they can ' t stop anyone , and any team that has shown any conviction to sticking with the ground game has eventually run it down their throats . For as much as the Browns ' offense has overcome its limitations by and large , the pathetic defense is what ' s doomed their season . There ' s no reason for Steelers to get cute here Still baffled most weeks when Duke Johnson carries the Browns offense with first half check downs and then never gets targeted in the second half . He ' s the closest thing the Browns have to someone who they can run the offense through Gary Barnidge defies the odds each week and I like him to get in the end zone against a Steelers secondary that has slipped some in recent weeks Would be silly not to run a bevy of bootlegs and at least a handful of designed runs for Manziel . Forget this idea of turning him into some pocket passer right now The Browns have allowed at least 24 points in seven straight games Landry Jones is in sync with Martavis Bryant . He will see oodles of targets .
