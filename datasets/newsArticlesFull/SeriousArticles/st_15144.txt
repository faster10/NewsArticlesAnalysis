An anxiety sufferer can feel as if he too is imprisoned in his own mind , but with the demonic twist that his mind can think of nothing but itself . Anxious thoughts are radically personal thoughts . Their central concern is what affects you , what threatens you , what you need , you regret , you dread , you fear . Anxiety is a condition of near total self absorption , made only worse by the fact that the sufferer typically realizes that he is being self absorbed and grieves over his sad inability to see past himself .
