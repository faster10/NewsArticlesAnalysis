Smith : The first thing I would suggest is a drug test . And I know that that ' s not required . And I also know that he ' s not really going to have a problem with swimming in 2012 . But I would just show that hey , I ' m clean , I ' m doing great . The next thing I would do is go out there in the public and talk about the troubles with working with drugs and really show the public that you are not about drug use , you are not about doing bad things in public . You are only about supporting the rules of WADA , the World Anti Doping Agency , and supporting their drug testing program . So you can show that , hey , this is a minor incident , not a big deal . And really what it ' s all about is remaining clean .
