Speaking of Rubio and TV ads , NBCNews . com has a piece looking at Conservative Solutions Project , the 501c4 outside group that has aired nearly 8 . 5 million in TV ads before Rubio ' s campaign started its own ads this week .

Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center tells NBC News . Earlier this month , the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 , another campaign finance watchdog , asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into Conservative Solutions Project . " The publicly available facts indicate that Conservative Solutions Project is little more than a single candidate 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , with no other mission than to advance the presidential aspirations of Marco Rubio , " the Campaign Legal Center said in its statement calling for an investigation .
