While the building of new nuclear power reactors in the U . S . was slowed , the world increased its nuclear fleet to more than 430 reactors . Even today more than 70 new reactors are in some phase of project development and construction globally . In 2010 , two forward thinking utilities in the southeastern U . S . made an investment in the future to protect stable pricing and hedge against pending environmental regulations that penalize carbon emissions . They committed to building four new Westinghouse advanced generation nuclear power plants the first in the U . S . in 30 years . The utilities understood that a balanced fuel portfolio creates stability , predictable costs , and hedges price and supply volatility in the natural gas market .
