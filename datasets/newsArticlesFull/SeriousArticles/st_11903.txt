I ' m just competing for the one day on Friday so I ' ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that . As well as being supported by the National Lottery I am supported by the philanthropist Barrie Wells , who also sponsors Jenny Meadows so I ' ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on Sunday . If I ' m rooting for any athlete other than myself it ' s going to be Jenny because she ' s had such a tough past . She ' s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event .
