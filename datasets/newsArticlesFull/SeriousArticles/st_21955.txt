The 10 episode series can attribute some of its appeal to the popularity of The Jinx , without the celebrity angle that made Robert Durst s tale so irresistible to HBO . But the twists and turns on Making a Murderer are so crazy and real that the series stands on its own .

When these people are found innocent of any wrongdoing in the first arrest , by Wisconsin Attorney General Peggy Lautenschlager , you realize even the most innocent man doesn t stand a chance when statewide corruption stacks the deck against him .
