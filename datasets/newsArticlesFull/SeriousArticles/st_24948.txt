Our tree is covered with mementos instead of ornaments . We have key chains from trips ( Germany , the Grand Canyon ) my grandmother ' s credit cards from high end stores , like Harrods in London and the hook my brother wore when he played Captain Hook in second grade all of which are hung with green ribbon . During the year , we keep the more fragile items ( origami swans , napkins with funny quotes scribbled on them , business cards ) pressed between the pages of a Life magazine from the 1960s , which is when my parents started this tradition . Flipping through that magazine is a beloved part of the occasion now , too . Genna Hinkle , Saratoga Springs , New York
