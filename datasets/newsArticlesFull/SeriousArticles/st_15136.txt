The Bucks have been stingy to opposing point guards all season and their ability to defend the pick and roll is a major reason . Milwaukee is long , especially when Michael Carter Williams comes off the bench for defense , and the Bucks often double team the pick and roll ball handler once the high screen comes . The result : The Bucks give up the fewest points per game to opposing pick and roll ball handlers in the league by almost four points per game and more than six points per game fewer than the league average , according to Synergy Sports . CP3 , who runs a pick and roll on more than 50 percent of his plays , has been a risky option as a high priced point guard this season and tonight definitely is not the night I would want to use him .
