" I ' m truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs ' death . Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends , and to everyone Steve has touched through his work . Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago , and have been colleagues , competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives . The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had , the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come . For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him , it ' s been an insanely great honor . I will miss Steve immensely . "
