The existing Keystone 1 tar sands pipeline has spilled more than 12 times in its first 12 months of operation . In July 2010 , a spill of more than 800 , 000 gallons of toxic tar sands crude from the Enbridge pipeline contaminated more than 30 miles of water and shoreline along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan . This created public health problems , threats to groundwater , widespread fish kills , and destruction of wildlife habitat , contamination that is still being cleaned up at a cost exceeding 700 million . Downstream landowners like me are thinking this is a preview of coming attractions if Keystone XL is built .
