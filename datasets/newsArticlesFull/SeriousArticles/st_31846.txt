The managerial search is just getting started , and they aren ' t rushing things just because the Nationals are expected to hire one of two potential Dodger candidates , Bud Black or Dusty Baker . Gabe Kapler is the early favorite , anyway . Kapler is seen a huge up and comer by folks in the front office , but he is also said to have annoyed a few players in the farm system with his diet suggestions . Kapler is in perfect physical condition ( he has as close to no body fat as can be found ) , and he apparently kept as close an eye as possible on the diet habits of minor leaguers . That ' s the sort of attention to detail his bosses may admire .
