Such events are rare , but not unprecedented . An object entered Earth ' s atmosphere in 1908 before breaking up over Siberia . The force of the explosion laid waste to a dense area of forest covering more than 2000 square kilometers . It is not hard to imagine the devastation of such an event over a more highly populated region . The Earth is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space . The largest is found near the town of Vredefort in South Africa . The impact of a much larger asteroid perhaps as big as 15 kilometers across is famously thought to have finished off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
