No smoke in the speaker s office : House Speaker Paul Ryan thinks his new office stinks . Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican , is moving into the office space previously occupied by the now retired John Boehner , who is a smoker . Ryan now wants to get rid of the smoke smell , and said he will most likely rely on an ozone machine to detoxify the environment . You know when you ever go to a hotel room or get a rental car that has been smoked in ? That s what this smells like , Ryan said on Sunday on NBC s Meet the Press . The New York Times writes deeper cleaning and a carpet change would come later , and taxpayers would be expected to foot the bill .
