In other words , as Hollywood moved left and the Republicans moved right , they passed each other on the political spectrum . One wonders whether Shirley Temple would have felt as comfortable identifying herself with the GOP today as she did in the 1960s and 1970s . My guess is yes . After all , her Republicanism persisted ( she was still campaigning for George H . W . Bush in 1992 ) and , as a child rather than an adult star , she had nothing to lose in terms of Hollywood clout by going public with her conservatism .
