My theory is that the NFL has ripped a page from the WWE playbook . I came of age in the days of the WWE s granddaddy , the World Wrestling Federation , when the storylines were just as exciting as the actual rasslin matches . It was a world of clear cut good guys ( Bruno Sammartino , Andre the Giant , Chief Jay Strongbow ) and clear cut bad guys ( Hans Mortier , Professor Toru Tanaka , Gorilla Monsoon ) , and their various spats , grudges and rematches created a world in which athletics and soap operas lived in noisy , entertaining harmony . The WWE still uses this recipe , only now in high def .
