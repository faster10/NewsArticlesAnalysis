You also can make the case that the degree of difficulty for Newton ' s passes has been greater than Brady ' s . Cam is throwing passes downfield like few other quarterbacks in football this year . He ' s averaging 10 . 6 air yards per attempt this season , a figure topped only by Palmer , who is two hundredths of a yard ahead . Newton is getting little after the catch from his tightly covered receivers , who are 27th in the league in YAC , averaging 4 . 6 yards per reception . And it ' s not as though teams are keeping guys in coverage to defend against those wideouts Cam is being blitzed more frequently than any other quarterback in football so far this season .
