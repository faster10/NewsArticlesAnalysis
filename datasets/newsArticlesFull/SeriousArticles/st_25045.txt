Three of the co plaintiffs are from San Antonio , but overall more than 2 , 000 patients could be affected in south Texas and over 13 , 500 patients across the entire state . The privileges are significant because they d been granted to a Planned Parenthood doctor and played a role in the Columbia clinic obtaining a license to begin offering abortions in August .
