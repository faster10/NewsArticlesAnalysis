A funny thing has happened in a Republican presidential race dominated by Donald Trump and ( to a lesser extent ) Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio : Chris Christie ? who s stuck in single digits in national polls ? has become the target in New Hampshire . Just look at all of the TV ads in the Granite State , as NBC s Kailani Koenig and Alex Jaffe have observed . John Kasich s Super PAC has ? whacked Christie over New Jersey s budget deficit Jeb Bush s Right to Rise Super PAC ? jabbed the New Jersey governor ? ( as well as Kasich ) and yesterday , Marco Rubio s Super PAC ? threw the kitchen sink at Christie . One high tax , Common Core , liberal energy loving , Obamacare Medicaid expanding president is enough , the Rubio Super PAC ad goes . Bottom line : It seems that the groups backing the other candidates in the Establishment Lane ? Bush , Kasich , Rubio ? see Christie as a threat in New Hampshire , where the New Jersey governor ? is polling higher ? than his national average . The challenge for Christie is whether or not he has the money to fight back . While the Super PAC supporting him has spent nearly 9 million over the airwaves ( almost all in New Hampshire ) , his campaign had just 1 . 4 million in the bank as of Sept . 30 . And our hunch is that Christie s financial situation didn t improve from October to December . Will the New York money crowd that pined for Christie four years ago come to the rescue ?
