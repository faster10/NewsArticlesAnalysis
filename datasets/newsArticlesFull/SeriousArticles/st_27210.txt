Of course , there is an argument against calling it a coup , which few seem to be considering at present . A coup is usually understood to be an action that replaces the authority of a civilian regime by a military one . If what happened in Egypt is considered to be a coup , it takes for granted that there was indeed a civilian regime that had absolute authority over the institutions of the state , and a military under complete civilian authority . That assertion in the context of the Egyptian political arena is questionable .
