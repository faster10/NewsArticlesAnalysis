The CDC has said that Zika is not expected to pose as much of a threat to the U . S . as it has to Brazil and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean . But officials said they do expect to see some locally transmitted cases occur in the United States . " We will see mini outbreaks like in Florida and in Texas that can be well controlled with mosquito vector control , " said Dr Anthony Fauci , director of the U . S . National Institutes of Health ' s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
