Gahan : There ' s many records that have been pivotal for me . If I were to name one , it would be " Ziggy Stardust . " It changed my life . The same thing happened when punk rock came along and I heard the Clash for the first time . I was 16 or 17 years old . It made me feel like I belonged to something . Music has always done that and continues to do that for me . Lately , a record that I bought that I ' m really listening to a lot is the new Spiritualized album , " Sweet Heart Sweet Light . "
