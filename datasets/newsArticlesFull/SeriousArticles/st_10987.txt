I can never go NEAR one of those in real life I ' d spend all our money I love American muscle cars from the 60 ' s . . all of them . . Chargers , Chevelles , Mustangs , Vettes , Camaros , GTO ' s . . . of the new stuff , there ' s some greats out there from all the American manufacturers . And while I woudn ' t kick an Aston Martin Vanquish out of the garage . . . its like an addiction I have to avoid ! '
