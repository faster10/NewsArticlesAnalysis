When I met Ashin Wirathu , a controversial Buddhist monk who has driven much of the anti Muslim campaign in recent years , he was unrepentant and trotted out a litany of conspiracy theories about the country ' s Muslims , which include ethnic Chinese as well as Rohingya . Ms Suu Kyi ' s supporters defend her relative silence on this issue , arguing she cannot take the political risk of alienating the monks . Mr Wirathu , who told me he would like to see Ms Suu Kyi as president one day , was smug when he talked of the enormous influence wielded by monks , particularly in rural areas . " The people listen to us , " he said with a smile .
