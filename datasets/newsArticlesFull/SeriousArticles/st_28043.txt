CRUZ HIGHLIGHTS CONTRAST WITH TRUMP . In the final weeks before the Iowa Caucus and New Hampshire primary , Republican candidate Ted Cruz is talking more about Donald Trump than he ever has before on the campaign trail . On Monday night in Whitefield , New Hampshire , made it clear he will go far and hard to show the policy differences that distinguish him from his chief opponent in the Republican presidential field , giving voters specific issues that show a distinction between himself and Trump . Cruz started the second day of his New Hampshire bus tour with only a brief reference to Trump , saying that he ' d hire him to build a wall on the border , ABC s JESSICA HOPPER notes . But as his campaign bus navigated winding snowy New Hampshire roads , Cruz began to add more lines about the real estate mogul in his interactions with New Hampshire voters . http : abcn . ws 1ZzzysV
