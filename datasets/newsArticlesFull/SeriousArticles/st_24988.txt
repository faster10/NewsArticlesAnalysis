Trump has repeatedly drawn protests for his policies on immigrants , racist remarks , and his demeaning and derogatory opinions of others in the presidential race . Trump was also recently videotaped apparently mocking a disabled reporter , but Trump denies that he was making fun of the reporter . Trump was visibly irritated by being interrupted repeatedly at the rally but kept talking until he had to cut the speech short . Protesters felt that they had accomplished what they went to the rally to do and tweeted about their victory . In addition to the protesters inside the arena , there was a crowd of protesters outside as well , as shown in this Facebook post .
