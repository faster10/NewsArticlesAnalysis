Think back to 1960 . The federal government regulated the price of every airfare . It regulated every rail , truck and shipping route . It regulated the price of natural gas . It regulated stockbrokers ' commissions . It regulated the interest rates that could be paid on checking accounts . It told most farmers how much they could grow of what commodity . It regulated what kind of political and religious comment could be expressed on the airwaves . And of course it conscripted millions of young men beginning their careers into the armed forces .
