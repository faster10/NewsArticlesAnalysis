" In a lot of horror films , the beloved protagonist ultimately gets away , if only for that particular episode or that particular movie in a series , " Oliver said . " The anxiety we feel when we ' re watching the show is palpable , ( and ) when that protagonist escapes , even by only a hair , then that ( anxiety ) feeds into our joy at this person ' s survival . So we don ' t feel a little bit happy , we feel really happy . It ' s like watching a close sporting event it ' s a lot more thrilling if your team wins after a really close game than after a landslide . "
