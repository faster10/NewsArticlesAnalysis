On a night that served as the anniversary of the last world championship for both the Royals ( 1985 ) and the Mets ( ' 86 ) ? as well as the birth of Mets reliever Jon Niese ( also ' 86 ) , who pitched two shutout innings ? a trip around the bases could do well as a metaphor for the circle of life . Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar scored the first and last runs of the game nearly five hours apart . The first came on a standup , inside the park home run . It was the first leadoff home run in a World Series game since the very first World Series , in Game 2 in 1903 .
