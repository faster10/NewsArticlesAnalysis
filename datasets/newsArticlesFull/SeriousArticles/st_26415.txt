Like most scientists , I toil in obscurity to make my small contribution . Maybe we scientists are missing the point . The problem with toiling in obscurity is that no one hears us . We need better special effects . Getting our messages across can save lives , although it will involve getting houses off flood plains , coastal bluffs and debris flow fans . In general , folks don ' t appreciate having a scientist , or government official , suggest they move . Perhaps there is another approach . It took a massive information campaign to dramatically cut consumption of cancer causing cigarettes , surely we can motivate people to examine the facts in this case and do things that are ultimately good for all of us .
