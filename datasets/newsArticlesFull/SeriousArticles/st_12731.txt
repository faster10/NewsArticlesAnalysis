Enter AlphaGo , an artificial intelligence ( AI ) computer program designed by Hassabis and his colleagues . AlphaGo is programmed using so called deep neural networks , which are inspired by biological brains . The networks have millions of neuron like connections that AlphaGo can rearrange as it plays . In essence , the program reprograms itself in order to " learn " the optimum strategy . Similar networks have proven remarkably effective in recent years at learning tasks such as recognizing objects in photos .
