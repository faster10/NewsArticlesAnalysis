We are also dealing with a surge of cheap imported products into the domestic market . In village markets on Java island , we now see potatoes and chillies imported from China at a very low price . The minimum production cost of potatoes in those villages is 7 , 000 rupiah a kilo , but Chinese potatoes are sold at 2 , 500 rupiah . This discourages farmers from producing , ultimately raising unemployment , encouraging more people to migrate away from rural areas and putting pressure elsewhere in the system , especially in our already stressed urban areas .
