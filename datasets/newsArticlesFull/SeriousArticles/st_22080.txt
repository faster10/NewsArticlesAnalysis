TASCH S TONIC : These two seemed destined to meet in the conference title game , and the way things were looking in the second half of the season , I thought for sure the Cardinals would win such a matchup . Their play against the Packers gives me pause . Carson Palmer , who to be fair made his share of great throws , nearly cost Arizona with his interceptions and a few other throws that almost turned into turnovers . The Cards also allowed Jeff Janis to look like an All Pro receiver . Carolina seemed to take its foot off the gas after opening up a huge lead against Seattle , but the Panthers so often find ways to win , especially at home where they re 9 0 this season , winning by at least three points in each game .
