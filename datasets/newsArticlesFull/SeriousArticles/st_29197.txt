Tucked away next to the airport , of all places ( but away from the flight paths , so jet noise does not intrude ) , Casita de Maya provides the perfect headquarters for a getaway . The four rooms , beautifully appointed in earthy colors , open onto a pretty little courtyard with a pool . Owner Dan Komorowsky and his staff can answer any question about the island and arrange expeditions . They also know when to disappear and give guests time for themselves . Rates from 59 281 214 1122 or casitademaya . com .
