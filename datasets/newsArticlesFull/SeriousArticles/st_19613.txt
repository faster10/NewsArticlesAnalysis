Spectre does add one new wrinkle to Blofeld , and it ' s a big one : his motivations for going after 007 are personal , not political . In his childhood , Blofeld ' s father took the recently orphaned James Bond under his wing , and encouraged Blofeld to think of Bond as a " brother . " ( It should really be a red flag when your big twist unintentionally recalls the twist at the end of Austin Powers in Goldmember . ) Blofeld , seething with jealousy , killed his father and faked his own death , receding into the shadows . In the decades since , he has somehow built a criminal empire so vast it can accurately be described as existing " everywhere . " And what has Blofeld done with all that power ? Obsessively orchestrated every single terrible thing that has happened to Daniel Crag ' s 007 . That ' s right : Spectre recasts the entirety of Daniel Craig ' s run as 007 by insisting that all of Bond ' s hardships in Casino Royale , Quantum of Solace , and Skyfall were a direct result of Blofeld ' s careful machinations .
