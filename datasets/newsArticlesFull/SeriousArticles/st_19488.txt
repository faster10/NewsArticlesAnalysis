Thomas : We didn ' t want it to be a big famous star because we didn ' t want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be , where it ' s like , " Oh , it ' s Anne Hathaway and I think blank of Anne Hathaway . . . . " You ' re waiting years to meet this woman , and it ' s like , " Oh , he ' s in love with Amy Adams just like the rest of America is . " The whole idea is that Ted ' s never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience . " Cristin Milioti is she ' s a fantastic actress and she ' s been in Broadway musica Once , and it ' s a Tony nominated , wonderful musical but she hasn ' t done a ton of big TV parts or bigger film parts . It seems so much more interesting and so much more ted to find someone special and unique and new , someone that we haven ' t seen before and the whole idea is that Ted ' s never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience .
