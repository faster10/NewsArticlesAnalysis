I think it s important to understand that there s nobody that s going to go in and just take Julian s place , including Danny ( Amendola ) McDaniels said . Danny s role is going to be filled with things we feel good about Danny doing , and then there might be some other people who are going to need to do some things that maybe we haven t asked a whole lot of them as well . So I think that all our players , Danny included , would understand and respect the opportunity to go in there and maybe carry and handle a little extra burden .
