It would be in line with the Second Amendment . A single shot law would not impinge on an individual ' s right to bear arms . We could still own guns it just wouldn ' t be possible to commit mass murder with them . It ' s a well established rule of American Law that no right is absolute . For instance , the First Amendment , which guarantees freedom of speech , does not give us the right to yell " bomb " in a crowded theater . It ' s already illegal to own a fully automatic weapon without a special ATF license so banning semi automatic guns is not a far stretch . When the Second Amendment was written , it referred to single shot guns it ' s what the authors of The Constitution had in mind when they talked about " a right to bear arms . "
