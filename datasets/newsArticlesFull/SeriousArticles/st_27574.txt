PESCA : Well , some people might not even know that in England , where gambling is legal on sporting events , tennis is the second most popular thing to gamble on other than soccer . And this is a you know , football as they call it this is a country where horseracing is very established . Tennis offers year round play , and there are people from every continent who ' ve been champions . But also , it gives rise to the specter of match fixing , and that seems to have happened . The website BuzzFeed , along with the BBC , did a massive investigation . They unveiled their findings right before the Australian Open , and it indicated that there are 16 core players on the men ' s side who have been engaged in some level of match fixing . These players are in the top 50 . A lot of them , they said , were at the Australian Open . They didn ' t name the players , but they seemed to have a lot of good evidence that this was going on . And it ' s especially easy to see why it would happen because when we say top 50 , that seems impressive . But at the lower rungs , a lot of these guys are playing tournaments where the prize money might be a couple hundred dollars for the first round , but the amount gambled on that first round match might be in the thousands . And so , tennis has a pretty serious problem that they haven ' t been doing a lot to address .
