The kitchen in his condo was small and modern , with a little eating counter and bar stool . I didn ' t know exactly what sizes liquor came in , but I could tell that the Beefeater bottle on the counter was the big kind . There was still some liquid left in it , but not much , only a tiny bit at the bottom . Next to it was a pumpkin pie . It was the storebought variety in a tin shell , not like the pies my mother made from scratch for Thanksgiving . The center had been scooped out , as if by a scavenging animal . There were no slices , just an ugly hole in the middle .
