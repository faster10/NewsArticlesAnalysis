The interdisciplinary team at Leicester that worked toward Monday ' s revelations deserves huge plaudits . From the desk based research that pinpointed the spot to dig , to the digging itself , to the bone analysis , the DNA work and the genealogy that identified Richard ' s descendants , all of it is worthy of the highest praise . Hat tips , too , to the Richard III Society , as well as Leicester ' s City Council , which pulled together to make the project happen and also to publicize the society and city so effectively .
