Refugee vetting has an excellent record . Of 785 , 000 refugees admitted to the US since 9 11 , just three have been arrested for terrorism related charges , according to the Migration Policy Institute in Washington . If Republican governors are concerned about security risks , maybe they should vet who can buy guns . People on terrorism watch lists are legally allowed to buy guns in the US and more than 2 , 000 have done so since 2004 . The National Rifle Association has opposed legislation to rectify this .
