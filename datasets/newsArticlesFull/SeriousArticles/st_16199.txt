Laughs That s a scary thought ! To be honest , I didn t pay any attention to the mythology episodes . I knew that s what people wanted to see , and I knew that was one of the reasons why the show became popular , but I didn t have much interest in it . I wasn t asked to work on them , so I didn t pay too much attention to them . The mythology ones were pretty much , for the most part , all Chris and Frank . It was understood they were the ones who would do those episodes , and everyone else just focused on your own standalones . That s how it was then , and that s kind of how it was now .
