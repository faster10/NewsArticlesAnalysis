China is likely to beat all these teams to the punch . A few weeks ago the Chinese announced that the Chang ' e 3 lunar rover will be launched by the end of the year . If successful , it would be the first soft landing on the moon since the Russian Luna 24 in 1976 . Less than a decade old , China ' s space program is well funded and aggressive . China has put 15 astronauts in orbit and plans to complete a 60 ton space station by 2020 . Following Chang ' e 3 , they plan sample return by 2020 and a manned landing by 2025 . So , more than half a century after Eugene Cernan left the last human footprint on the moon , the next may be made by someone who speaks Mandarin .
