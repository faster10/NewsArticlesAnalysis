But more importantly Focac , after a long incubation of over 15 years , is now more than ever speaking to Africa s needs , creating a synergy between China and Africa s development strategies . This is a dynamic collaboration given that the combined population of the PRC and Africa totals 2 . 4 billion people , or a third of the world s population .
