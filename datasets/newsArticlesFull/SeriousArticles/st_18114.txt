If you want to have an argument over how government policy should or shouldn ' t be applied to climate change issues , that is fair . If you want to fund further data collection ( by reputable entities ) to add to our understanding of climate phenomena , that too is reasonable . What is not reasonable is to discredit years of scientific data without any scientific basis for doing so and to ask for a do over . Such data takes years to collect after all , and should not be used as a stalling tactic .
