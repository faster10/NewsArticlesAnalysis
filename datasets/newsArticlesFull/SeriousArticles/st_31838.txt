Harris : No , not yet . Short stories put your name in the path of the reading public , and therefore publishers . Publishers will take you much more seriously if you ' ve had several short stories in reputable markets like magazines or anthologies . I don ' t know how much credence they ' d put in a book proposal by a writer who ' d written games , but I ' m willing to believe that is mounting . I think any way you can get published is good though , as long as you ' re getting paid for it . I don ' t know if games have the power to create a career , but they certainly could add to one .
