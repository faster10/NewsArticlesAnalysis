Never officially released and mostly known to hard core collectors , the actual music on the " Bootleg Recordings " consists of outtakes , live versions and two demos of songs the Beatles wrote for other artists . The motivation for its release is complex , extending beyond immediate sales considerations . Due to a recent European Union ruling , the copyright to this material would expire in 2014 if it remained unreleased . So the sudden appearance of " Bootleg " on the marketplace may in part be a legal ploy for Apple Records , the company the Beatles began in 1968 .
