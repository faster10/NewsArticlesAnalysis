But I have noticed a growing impatience with prayer in our culture . You see it in the papers or on Twitter . When people say they re praying for someone or something , the attitude in some quarters seems to be , Don t just pray do something about it . But the thing is , when you are praying , you are doing something about it . You are revealing the presence of God . Whenever people are in grief or even when they re about to start a great undertaking , they feel the worst pain of all : They feel alone . How am I going to get through this ? Why is this happening to me ? My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ?
