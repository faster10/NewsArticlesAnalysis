On what type of player can play holding midfield : You need someone who thinks ' what is best : Attack ? Defence ? ' You have to know when to take two or three steps to make space , then you know you will be able to pass to someone between the lines . Players don ' t have to move . Pep says this always to Mario Goetze ( jumps up and starts pointing ) . ' You don ' t run ! Stay there ! The ball will come to you . Don ' t move ! ' He shows clips to the team of Goetze standing still for 10 seconds . Pep works so much about the positional game . It is not about running everywhere . It is about you staying there and the others have to work to get it to you .
