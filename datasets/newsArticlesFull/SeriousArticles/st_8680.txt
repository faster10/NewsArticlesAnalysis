" Young Americans " " After Bowie killed off Ziggy in 1973 , he moved through guises including the edgy Aladdin Sane before going to the United States and immersing himself in the sound of Philadelphia soul . Produced by frequent collaborator Tony Visconti and featuring a roster of funk and soul talent that included guitarist Carlos Alomar and a young Luther Vandross , his 1975 album " Young Americans " was a complete change of pace , and featured the exuberant title track and the acid tipped dancefloor filler " Fame , " co written by John Lennon .
