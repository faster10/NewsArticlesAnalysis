When you re working in New York , you have a day to day existence with African Americans in the industry here , added Moore . But I can fly to LA for two or three days of meetings and never encounter an African American person in any position of power . I can very easily leave LAX , go to a West Hollywood hotel , have a meeting in Burbank , another meeting in Century City and another in Santa Monica , go back to LAX and never encounter an African American who isn t in a service position . I love LA but the problem has to get fixed there .
