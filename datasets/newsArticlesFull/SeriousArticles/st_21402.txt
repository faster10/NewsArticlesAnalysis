Rubio ' s entire candidacy is built on the notion that he is from a " new generation of leaders " unlike all of the old farts running for President . He may be from a ' new generation ' but his position on the issues would make your great grandfather blush . He supports privatizing Medicare , opposes comprehensive immigration reform , questions the climate science consensus , and thinks pursuing equal pay for women is just " wasting time . " His platform is the political equivalent of the present day hipster couple choosing to live in the Victorian era . Just plain creepy the more you learn about it .
