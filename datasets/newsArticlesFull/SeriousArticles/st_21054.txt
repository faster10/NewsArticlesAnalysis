Since September , the politicians ' race has been conducted as if the populists ' race doesn ' t matter , or as if the risks of engaging the populists are greater than the upside of taking them on . Political elites have all kinds of theories for why the populists ' race is no big thing . Silly season always comes to an end , doesn ' t it ? Perhaps Trump will say something that finally , really gets him in trouble . Perhaps voters aren ' t really paying attention now , but when they do , they ' ll come join the grown ups in the politicians ' race . Maybe Trump and Carson are just riling up the low information voters , the people who won ' t ultimately show up to cast ballots . Or maybe once the party apparatus rallies behind a real candidate , these non politicians will fade for good . Trump and Carson aren ' t building real ground organizations . They can ' t win .
