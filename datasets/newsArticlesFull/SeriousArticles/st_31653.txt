U . S . President Barack Obama : " I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing today of Vaclav Havel , a playwright and prisoner of conscience who became president of Czechoslovakia and of the Czech Republic . Having encountered many setbacks , Havel lived with a spirit of hope , which he defined as ' the ability to work for something because it is good , not just because it stands a chance to succeed . ' His peaceful resistance shook the foundations of an empire , exposed the emptiness of a repressive ideology , and proved that moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon . "
