ML : For me , casting is probably more important than it is for most people . If someone has written a conventional script then a range of actors could do that role . I find actors with whom I can collaborate to create characters , so I have to have actors that are brilliant , who are very intelligent and not all actors are very intelligent , who are versatile , who are character actors and not all actors are , that have a sense of humor , that have a sense of society and commitment , who aren ' t just narcissistic which a lot of actors are , and people who are patient and courageous . Working with me on these things is dangerous .
