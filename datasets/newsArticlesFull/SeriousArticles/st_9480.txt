A few hours before the third Republican presidential debate on Wednesday ? night at the University of Colorado at Boulder , I was hunched over my laptop , either hard at work or studying Google Maps to determine the nearest dispensary of a form of medication ( absurdly ) not yet legal in the Empire State , when I overheard some gasbag ( and trust me , being a bloviator of the first order myself , I know the type ) holding forth about Jeb Bush . About how the debate was a do or die event for the former Florida governor . A make or break moment with everything on the line , in which the stakes were the whole ball of wax . Etc .
