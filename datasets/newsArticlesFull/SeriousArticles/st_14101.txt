The Royals won this game because of course they did , because this is the kind of game the Royals always seem to win in the postseason . They should ve scored more runs , and they made mistakes along the way , but then of course Gordon elevates a 97 mph sinker 438 feet over the center field wall , and of course scheduled Game 4 starter Chris Young pitches three innings of scoreless relief , and of course Hosmer gets a chance to make up for his error more than 5 hours after the first pitch ? no World Series game has ever gone longer .
