We deploy about 30 ground based interceptors in silos in Alaska and California . These systems have some ability to hit a long range rocket , like the Unha 3 should it be turned into a missile and aimed at the U . S . Some in Congress will no doubt demand that we deploy more . We are fielding interceptors at sea aboard Aegis class destroyers and cruisers that have some capability against short range missiles , with plans to grow the program to longer range missiles and deploy them in Eastern Europe . The U . S . Defense Department just recently approved arms sales to Japan to help that nation upgrade its Aegis anti missile system . Pressures will mount to deploy more capable anti missile systems in Asia .
