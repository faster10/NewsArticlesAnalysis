WHAT DONALD TOLD BARBARA : In an exclusive interview with ABC ' s BARBARA WALTERS yesterday , Donald Trump , currently at the center of a political firestorm over his proposed ban on Muslims entering the U . S . , responded to critics ' concerns that his rhetoric might help ISIS attract new recruits . " I ' m the worst thing that ever happened to ISIS . The people in my party fully understand that they ' re running against me . For the most part , they have no poll numbers . I ' m leading by a lot . They get it . They ' re trying to get publicity for themselves , " Trump said . " You know when I came out against illegal immigration , everybody said the same thing . Two weeks later , everybody was on my side , including the members of my own party . " As ABC ' s ENJOLI FRANCIS notes , Trump released a statement on Monday calling for a " total and complete shutdown " of Muslims entering the U . S . until " our country ' s representatives can figure out what is going on . " " It ' s short term , " he told Walters of the proposed ban . " Let our country get its act together . . . . It could be very quickly if our country could get its act together . . . . We need toughness and smartness and we have to do it quickly . " When asked whether he regretted the proposal , Trump said : " Not at all . We have to do the right thing . Somebody in this country has to say what ' s right . " http : abcn . ws 1TzIFYI
