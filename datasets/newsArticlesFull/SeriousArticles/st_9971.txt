" The times I ' ve heard about challenges , there have been people in those communities defending my book . In one , there was a school board meeting to decide whether to remove my book from the library , and a parent read aloud one scene without context . It took a student at the school , stepping up to the microphone , to teach those adults about context . As a result , the book remained in the school . Other times , principals have concerns about my book being used in the classroom , and a teacher will contact me to see what I can do to help the principal make a decision . I send them e mails from readers expressing what they gained from reading the book . I know why I wrote my book , and I know what readers are getting from it . I would have no problem attending a meeting if I thought it would help the decision makers be less afraid . "
