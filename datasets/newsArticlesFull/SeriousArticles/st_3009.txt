It seems clear that The Force Awakens intends to recapture the old magic while appealing to a new generation of moviegoers . Although Lucas has no official involvement , The Force Awakens will bring back Hamill , Fisher and Ford in their original roles while introducing new characters played by an ethnically diverse young cast led by Daisy Ridley , John Boyega and Oscar Isaac . The screenwriters include Lawrence Kasdan ( The Empire Strikes Back ) and director J . J . Abrams , who reinvigorated the Star Trek film franchise .
