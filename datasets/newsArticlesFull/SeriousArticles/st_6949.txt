I know that to defend proposals targeted at Muslim Americans as well as Muslim immigrants by claiming the Constitution does not prevent such action is a fundamental misreading of our founding documents . Slavery was justified using the same rationale until 1865 , but it was always wrong . Denial of the suffrage to women was not prevented by the Constitution either , until 1920 , but it was always wrong as well . The Constitution may be our rulebook , but the Declaration of Independence sets forth the core values which the rules are meant to protect . When we forget the Declaration , all manner of xenophobic actions get rationalized as " Constitutional . " " Constitutional permissibility " is no justification for injustice . The Declaration has been a shining beacon with which America has lighted the world . When we dishonor its core values , that guiding light dims and America loses its moral force at home and abroad .
