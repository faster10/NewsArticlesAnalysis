Our favorable immigration policy and liberal treatment of the millions of people working without legal documents means our population will grow from 312 million today to 439 million in 2050 . Hispanic babies , 83 million of them , will account for 65 of that growth . This is where the total fertility rate comes into play again , 2 . 84 for Hispanics , but only 1 . 84 and trending much lower for non Hispanic whites who will only add 4 million babies to the melting pot . Keep in mind that those Hispanic babies born here to Mitt Romney ' s " self deportation " candidates are all red blooded American citizens our future Navy SEALs , entrepreneurs , middle class working Americans and maybe even a president .
