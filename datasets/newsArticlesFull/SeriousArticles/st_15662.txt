Brees entered Week 8 ranked QB25 in fantasy football scoring with eight touchdown passes in seven games . Granted , he missed the Panthers game due to injury , but popular opinion was Brees would finish as a Top 8 fantasy quarterback . Perhaps , the first step towards achieving the expected came against a Giants defense which had allowed the 10th fewest fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks ( 15 . 3 ) . Brees had one six touchdown performance and an insane eight five touchdown performances before torching the Giants secondary to the tune of 40 50 passing for 511 yards with seven touchdowns and only one interception . He joins , fittingly , seven other NFL quarterbacks in that fraternity . Peyton Manning is on that list . He has seven touchdowns heading into Week 8 .
