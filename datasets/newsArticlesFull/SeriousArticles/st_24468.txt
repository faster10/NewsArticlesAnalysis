Phyllis Bennis : I think the question of US boots on the ground has been true for over a year now . We ve had at least 35 , 000 troops in Iraq that went back last year and I don t think most people in this US country recognize the difference any more than they would in Russia if and when Russian troops or volunteers are sent to Syria if somebody tries to claim they are not combat troops , nobody would believe that either . These are troops engaged in combat . They are advising , they are supporting , they are arming , they are training and they are fighting with forces on the ground . So , the notion that there are no boots is simply not the case . We also know that besides 35 , 000 US troops on the ground in Iraq there are an unknown number of other Special Forces and CIA forces on the ground . Maybe they wear sneakers rather than boots . But there is no question that US forces have been fighting directly in Iraq for more than a year now .
