I appreciate Melissa s gracious framework for the Golden Globes . The grumpy pants that I am , I often default to The Globes are meaningless ! harrumphing , a cynical posture shaped by years of reporting about the curious practices of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and nominations as flighty as a Butterfly . ( A deep cut of Golden Globs madness there sorry I m so old . ) It s not all their fault . Hollywood studios often manipulate the group s vulnerabilities and flawed processes to push their own agendas . See : Fox successfully lobbying to get The Martian in the movie musical or comedy category . I d like to see Matt Damon science the s ? out of that puzzler . Is this the first time a nomination implicitly ruins a movie ? It was a sci fi Castaway tale of life or death survival ? and we re saying that s a comedy ? I get it , Ridley Scott s thrilling fiction is , at heart , a celebration of Right Stuff ingenuity , optimism , and global cooperation , and it meets the classical reductive definition of comedy , but the journey deserves its suspense . The nod should come with a Spoiler Alert .
