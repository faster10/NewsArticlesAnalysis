My dad actually had a couple of encounters with Phil Everly years later , while working in California . He was shopping at Vons in Burbank when he saw Phil and his then girlfriend Patti buying groceries . Star struck and too polite to approach them , he didn ' t take his chance to say hello . However , not long after , he found himself dining in a Los Angeles restaurant on the next table to the couple . This time he made his move , and was able to finally meet his idol who was impeccably warm and polite . Sadly , in his excitement , my dad forgot to tell him about the record .
