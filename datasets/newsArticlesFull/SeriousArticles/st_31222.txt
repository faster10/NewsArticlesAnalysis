Retirement ' s a dirty word to her . ' I try not to think about it , ' she says . ' Actors are lucky because we don ' t have to retire . We can if we want to , of course , and sometimes the business retires us , which is a bit sad . I do get tired occasionally , though , and think , " Why am I doing this ? " After Boomers I ' ve got another job coming up , and a play after that . There have been times I ' ve turned things down and then wished I ' d done them , but it ' s nice to have a choice . '
