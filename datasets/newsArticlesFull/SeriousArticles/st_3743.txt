It points to two federal lawsuits that had been settled for millions after whistleblowers came forward about false Medicaid claims that had been filed . The court granted certiorari review of a challenge to provisions of Texas House Bill 2 ( HB 2 ) . The clinic stopped offering abortions in 2012 after the staff doctor moved away . These are the same restrictions that former Democrat Texas Senator and Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis temporarily blocked during her 13 hour filibuster . They deserve to not only be denied taxpayer funds , but completely shut down !
