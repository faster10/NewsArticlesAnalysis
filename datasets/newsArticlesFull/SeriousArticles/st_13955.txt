I d much rather have won them than lost them , but they won t have any bearing on this week or what the matchups are , Brady said . It s a totally different team and game and situation and so forth , but they just have a great organization . They ve had a great organization for a long time . They ve got a great history with a lot of players , one of the oldest franchises in the NFL , so there s just a lot of history with the team . They re tough on defense , so we re going to have to play well .
