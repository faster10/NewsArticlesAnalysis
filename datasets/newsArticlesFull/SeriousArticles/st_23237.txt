Quarterback Carson Palmer made a number of uncharacteristic mistakes and throws against the Packers . How much of Palmer ' s problems can be attributed to an injury to his index finger on his throwing hand is unknown . Palmer was sacked three times and pressured often as his offensive line struggled to slow the Green Bay pass rush , making Palmer uncomfortable in the pocket . Palmer wasn ' t helped by an almost non existent running game . They gained just 40 yards on the ground against Green Bay and they ' ll need to find some semblance of a running game against the Panthers .
