I ' ve gone on at length here , which might seem like a waste of time for something that could be quickly expressed in a sentence . Just because the Royals have a lot in common with some other team from the past doesn ' t mean they ' re guaranteed to end up at the same destination . But I ' m struck by just how similar these two teams really are , in just about every area , and it ' s worthwhile to be reminded of previous editions of this kind of ballclub . The Royals didn ' t invent this . They ' re just playing the hell out of it . They ' re playing in a way that would make Mike Scioscia proud , because they ' re playing like the champion Angels , and now they ' re close to holding the same trophy . The Royals have staged their comebacks . The Angels had a late inning miracle of their own .
