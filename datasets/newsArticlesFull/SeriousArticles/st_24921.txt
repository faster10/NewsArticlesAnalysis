The President , according to the White House , has directed the Department of Homeland Security to " create " a " new deferred action program " that will give millions of people here illegally " work authorizations " for at least three years . It establishes extensive new criteria by which people can register to be exempt from deportation . DHS will likely have to employ thousands of bureaucrats to process those who " come forward and register , submit biometric data , pass background checks , pay fees , and show that their child was born before the date of this announcement . " Applicants supposedly will also have to prove they have been in the United States for at least five years and will have to pay taxes .
