No , it wouldn ' t cause a civil war . There was an assault weapons ban in place in this country from 1994 to 2004 . The ban didn ' t cause an uprising and there were a lot more gun owners then than there are now . I understand that an assault weapons ban is not exactly the same thing as a semi automatic weapons ban but come on , really , a civil war ? Only about one in three Americans are gun owners and are a dying breed they ' re mostly older people like me and as time goes on their numbers dwindle . So less than 33 percent of our population would have to compromise , yet virtually 100 of mass shootings would be eliminated and every American would benefit . Seems like a pretty good trade off to me . A similar law went into effect in Australia in 1996 and they have not had a revolution or a single mass shooting since . If Australia , a nation not unlike ours , can do it so can we .
