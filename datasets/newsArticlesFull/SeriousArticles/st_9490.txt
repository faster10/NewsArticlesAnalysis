Political incorrectness is piping hot stuff for steaming mad voters across the country , especially Republicans , who are enraged and scared . They got screwed by a system and left behind . Good manufacturing jobs are gone , wages are stagnant and the prospect for their kids is bleak . There ' s no pension , no gold watch , no comfortable retirement in Florida , so they rally behind salesmen like Trump and LePage who point to all the poor people and minorities on the street and peddle the oldest elixir in the book . " It ' s them ! Look how dirty they are . It ' s the welfare system causing your problems . "
