There is a further reason why ISIS may find it more easy to find and use potential suicide bombers outside the caliphate . One of the setbacks it has suffered this year is the loss of its main border crossing between Syria and Turkey at Tal Abyad , which was captured by the Syrian Kurdish People ' s Protection Units ( YPG ) in June . Half the 550 mile frontier between the Tigris and Euphrates is now held by the YPG , so ISIS access to the outside world is much more limited than before . The US has put intense pressure on Turkey not to allow ISIS and other Salafi jihadi groups to cross the border into Syria west of the Euphrates . Volunteers who might previously have travelled through Turkey to join ISIS in Syria will now stay at home and provide a pool of committed manpower for use in suicide operations .
