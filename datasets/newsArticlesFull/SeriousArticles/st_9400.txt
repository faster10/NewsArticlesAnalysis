I wrote about this two months ago , and it looks as if the GOP has no more of an idea of how to handle the increasingly xenophobic , racist Trump Wehrmacht as it steamrolls the rest of the field than it did in September . The operatives quoted in the WSJ sound as if they are using a playbook that has served them well in their careers , with talk of outrageous television ads that attract media attention and show Trump s position as stray ing from GOP orthodoxy , despite the fact that the candidate has stayed far ahead in every poll while inveighing against some of the governing philosophies ? lowering taxes for everyone , acknowledging that income inequality is a problem for society ? that have come to animate the modern conservative movement .
