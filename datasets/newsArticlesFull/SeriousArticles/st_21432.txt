Piazza long ago admitted to doing what are now considered performance enhancers by MLB specificially Androstenedione but at a time when it was sold in legal , over the counter supplements . Piazza says he stopped using Andro after reporters found the substance in the locker of Mark McGwire in 1998 . Piazza also has said that , as a player , he took amphetamines , which also are banned now but weren ' t when he was active ( although it ' s questionable if Piazza , or any other player , took " greenies " legally ) .
