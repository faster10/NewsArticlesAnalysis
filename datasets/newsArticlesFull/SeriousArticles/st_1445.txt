My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world . I finished my B . A . and a diploma of business studies , and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development . I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management . I know it is a good ambition to be Ph . D . holder and a worldwide researcher , but as Palestinian girl , I have fewer opportunities , not because I am not qualified or hard working enough but because I am Palestinian .
