I m in it , because just last week , we re watching our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law , because a weak kneed , capitulator in chief has decided America will lead from behind . And he , who would negotiate deals , kind of with the skills of a community organizer maybe organizing a neighborhood tea , well , he decided that , No , America would apologize as part of the deal , as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow , and we apologize , and then , we bend over and say , Thank you , enemy .
