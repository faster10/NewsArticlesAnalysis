In our trials , Expedia ' s flexible search came up with only the most popular routes , so your route may not qualify . Orbitz ' s flexible date calendar gave a nice overview of fares on various days , but departure times were not initially shown . Travelocity provided a few different ways to search flexibly either within a few days of a selected date , or over selected months but like Orbitz it failed to show dates and departure times right away . Finally , relative newcomer Trax . com ' s flexible search tool lacked a " search nearby airports " feature , which meant it gave you fares from major airports , but missed cheaper fares departing nearby . In short , Kayak is your best bet for a flexible date search .
