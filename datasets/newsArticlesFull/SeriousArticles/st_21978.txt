At first , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the ads , but a district judge ruled the ads were protected under the First Amendment . The ads follow similar ads in San Francisco as well as posters at New York ' s Metro North train stations that made unsubstantiated claims about the number of people killed in terrorist attacks since 9 11 . The Metro North ads denied their bigotry by stating , " It ' s not Islamophobia . It ' s Islamorealism , " claiming the actions of a few represented the " reality " of Islam . But when did it become acceptable to spread bigotry against any American religious , racial or ethnic group in the name of " realism " ?
