Munoz : If you share , share anything you have you ' re not using like clothes , toys , share it to make other people happy . People in this country cook more than they need and two days later it goes from the refrigerator to the garbage . If you see someone standing on the corner and have 2 , buy them a cup of coffee and a piece of bread . I ' m doing it seven days a week , but just do it once in a while and you ' ll feel what I feel . And when that person is smiling at you you ' ll know you ' re doing something good . Do it from the inside .
