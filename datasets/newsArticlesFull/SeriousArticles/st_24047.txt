Before I begin , a few technical notes are in order . First , data comes from the Real Clear Politics Republican poll tracking page . The last column I wrote used the data from November 8th , on the RCP graph ( every time I say " since last time " below , this is what I ' ll be referring to ) . And my own categories , as before , are divided into four levels : those with no chance of winning the nomination , those with a slim or longshot chance , those with a decent shot at winning , and those with a great chance of becoming the nominee . These are fairly arbitrary divisions , but they ' re what the race has so far seemed to require .
