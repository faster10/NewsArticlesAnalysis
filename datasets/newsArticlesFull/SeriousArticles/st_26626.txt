Hewitt will fittingly take on the non playing captaincy role of Australia s Davis Cup team in his first tie against the United States in Melbourne in March . The player known as Rusty had a healthy entourage in his box against Ferrer on Thursday . I had a good hit out with Fed yesterday , hit with Murray this afternoon hitting with the best guys . He fought to the last even when defeat was inevitable . He s unbelievable . Hewitt pressed as his opponent upped his intensity . Every unforced error with a collective sigh . Yeah , he played in the World Tour Finals as well .
