The news of his death came suddenly to the BBC . When he pulled out of presenting Children in Need last year , his first absence since it was launched in 1980 , there was a warning sign . Although his illness was short , his death was a shock . Radio 2 s tribute this morning , Remembering Sir Terry Wogan , was mounted at almost no notice , presented with grace by Mark Goodier , and beautifully produced by Alan Boyd , Wogan s producer for many a year , sequencing songs that were Wogan favourites ( Elton John s Crocodile Rock , country ballads ) between a tide of listener tributes .
