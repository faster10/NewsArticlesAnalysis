The Chiefs passing game was anemic in the first half , as Smith completed only 10 of 21 passes for 65 yards . Smith eventually got it going in the second half , especially when he completed five of six passes on a touchdown drive that gave the Chiefs life when trailing 21 6 . But with Jeremy Maclin hobbled , and Travis Kelce effectively taken away , the passing attack didn t have enough juice to beat the defending champs in a road playoff game . Smith , who was only sacked once , finished 29 of 50 for 246 yards . Pro Bowler Kelce was held to only 23 yards in six catches .
