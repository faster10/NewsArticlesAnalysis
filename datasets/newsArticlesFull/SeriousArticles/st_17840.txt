Now , we do realize that , for a very long time now , the head of the D . E . A . was expected to on a regular basis make up bizarre assertions which were backed up by absolutely nothing . I mean , it was part of the job description , almost : " Must be able to pull nonsense out of your butt during a press conference , and then act as if whatever you ' ve just made up is the actual truth . " The same went for the " drug czar , " the head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy ( who was really nothing more than Chief Propagandist on the subject ) .
