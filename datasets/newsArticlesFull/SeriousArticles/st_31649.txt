This is surprising because the Big Bang Hubble expansion implied that very distant regions should never have been in causal contact . How then could they be so similar ? Here is a simple analogy : Imagine a thermos of ice water and a thermos of hot tea . As long as these two liquids are separate , they will have different temperatures . But if the two liquids are combined , the mixed liquid will quickly reach an intermediate temperature . Similarly , two well separated regions of the universe can be alike only if they were at one time in contact .
