A senior official familiar with the investigation said authorities suspected that as many as 20 people in Europe had been involved in planning , supporting and executing the attack . Just as in January , when two brothers , Said and Ch rif Kouachi , staged a bloody siege in Paris , some of the attackers this time were also related . Brahim Abdeslam , 31 , blew himself up Friday night inside a busy cafe . His 26 year old brother , Salah , who allegedly rented a car that was used in one of the attacks , is on the run . A third unnamed brother was apprehended in Belgium .
