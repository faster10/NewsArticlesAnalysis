Star Wars snubbed : ? The biggest movie of the past year , and without taking inflation into account the most successful U . S . domestic release of all time , was not able to make it into a crowded Best Picture race , despite boasting across the board rave reviews . The film may have suffered from being kept under wraps until late into the awards season , and the fact that two other big , action crowdpleasers , Mad Max : Fury Road and The Martian , were already in the race . Still , for fans of this resurrected franchise the five nominations the movie did receive , mostly in technical categories , felt like a consolation prize . Sidebar : In a less competitive year , Harrison Ford would have and should have made it in the Best Supporting Actor race for his touching return to his signature role of Han Solo .
