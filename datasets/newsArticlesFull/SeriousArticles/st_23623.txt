Trump s event was nothing like that . Frankly , Trump ? 23 years older than Obama was back then ? could have been asleep on his plane ? by 8 : 30 . One would think this would be an odd way to wrap up this Iowa journey , a muted elegy rather than the s t kicking storm of chaos we have grown accustomed to . But since when has anything Trump done in this campaign made sense ? And since when has any of that made a lick of difference in his results ? Trump has said that he could shoot people on Fifth Avenue and his numbers would go up . Hopefully it won t come to that , but I m sure there are bewildered pollsters who would be legitimately curious to find out if he s right .
