Suspecting Reyes was in the country illegally , the sheriff ' s deputies handcuffed the mother and placed her children in a squad car and drove them to the sheriff ' s station . Then they called Immigration and Customs Enforcement , which put a " hold " on her that resulted in her being locked up in the county jail for nearly two weeks without a lawyer . When ICE agents finally visited the jail , they determined she was in fact in the country illegally and took her into custody and put her children in foster care while she was being detained . Now Reyes is awaiting deportation .
