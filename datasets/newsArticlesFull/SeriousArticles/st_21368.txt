The heat of a blazing sun was mitigated only by a frequent breeze and unseasonably low humidity . Still , one member of the U . S . Army Band , apparently feeling the effects of the sun as she stood there in her blue wool tunic , calmly stepped out of formation , walked to the one corner of the parade ground with any shade and sat down . By the end of the event she was back on her feet and appeared fine . ( Note to the U . S . Navy , today is perfect example of why your tradition of wearing lightweight , all white , cotton polyester blend uniforms on hot days is very smart move . )
