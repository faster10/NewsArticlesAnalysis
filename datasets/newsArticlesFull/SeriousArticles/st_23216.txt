Munoz : In these 6 years we ' ve been doing it , I ' ve missed one day because of a snowstorm . And we ' ve distributed 121 , 000 meals over the years , might be more . But every day we make 120 to 140 meals . For the last few months , every piece of bread I get I bring in the morning with soda or water that I buy . Besides meals , we provide hot coffee , tea , a piece of cake and sometimes my mom makes chicken soup . And when I have money I provide fruit . When I have a budget , when winter is here , I provide caps , underwear , winter hats , scarves , boots . And this time of the year , on the website , I ask for coat donations . I need about 100 coats because these guys sleep on the street .
