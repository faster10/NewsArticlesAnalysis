Unfortunately , Paul ' s political style sometimes comes across as slightly entitled . He understands himself as a conviction politician , and can sometimes be baffled when activists and voters fail to understand or share his strategy . He seems to lecture Republicans in a way that can come across as condescending , as if to emphasize that if they really believed in small government , then of course they owed him , and his policy views , their support . No one likes to be told what they ought to believe and do in this way . Sometimes , in his effort to reach out to audiences beyond the usual Republican tent party , he seemed to want credit for just showing up , as when he went to Howard University and explained what students there already knew ? that their grandparents and great grandparents were more likely to be Republicans .
