Baltimore Ravens : The Ravens have a franchise quarterback in Joe Flacco and they already addressed their backup situation by signing Ryan Mallett late in the 2015 season . This makes it very unlikely that Baltimore would have any interest in Manziel . After bringing in Mallett , why would the Ravens want to take a chance on a second quarterback with a history of behavior problems ? Mallett is signed through the 2016 season , when he is scheduled to make 1 . 5 million ( plus an additional 1 million if he plays 10 percent of the Ravens ' snaps ) . The Ravens typically don ' t carry three quarterbacks on the 53 man roster , so unless something happens with Mallett this offseason , there is no need for an additional quarterback in Baltimore .
