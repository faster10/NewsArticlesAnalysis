This attitude on the left is part of the problem , and proves the Democratic establishment has yet to understand what Bernie Sanders is doing . Bernie s campaign is trying to redefine what constitutes the mainstream . If Clinton or Bloomberg or Rubio or Bush is mainstream today , it s because of a lack of voter participation , because the majority of the country doesn t vote . Sanders understands this , and his campaign aims to energize a restless majority , whose interests aren t reflected in the Washington consensus .
