" I think there is a danger in the West ' s tendency to interpret all North Korean actions in the context of topical events , in other words , by saying everything North Korea is doing is aimed at ensuring a smooth succession for Kim Jong Un , " said Brian Myers , author of " The Cleanest Race , " an authoritative study of North Korean propaganda .

If you are a military first regime , you flex your muscles this is what North Korea is , and this is what it does . "
