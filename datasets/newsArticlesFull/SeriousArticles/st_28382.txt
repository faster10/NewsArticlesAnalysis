When ? Cam Newton and Carson Palmer take the field on Sunday , both will be looking to earn a trip to the Super Bowl for the first time in their careers . Both quarterbacks just finished career years : Palmer posted career bests in passing yards ( 4 , 671 ) and touchdowns ( 35 ) this season , while Newton also managed career ? highs in touchdown passes ( 35 ) and passer rating ( 99 . 2 ) . Both are playing largely mistake ? free football too , with Palmer throwing 11 interceptions this season and Newton throwing 10 , both career ? lows in seasons with at least 13 games . Not bad for the supposedly second ? tier quarterback matchup of the weekend . ?
