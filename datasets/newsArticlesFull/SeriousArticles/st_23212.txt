I understand why candidates and their handlers want to turn these debates into dry recitations of policy proposals with little interaction ? ? either between the candidates or between the moderators and the candidates . That ' s the safest possible space . ? Per my point above , every single person running for president ? Democrat and Republican ? can give you somewhere between 30 seconds and three minutes on any issue . But what does that actually tell us about these candidates ? That they can memorize a series of talking points about the issues of the day ?
