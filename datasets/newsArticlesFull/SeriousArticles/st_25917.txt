The 31 year old Todd had been working for a year and a half at the Singapore government ' s Institute of Microelectronics ( IME ) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the United States . He was part of a team researching uses of Gallium Nitride ( GaN ) , a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures . Documents found on Todd ' s laptop after his death reportedly indicate IME may have had plans with Chinese telecom giant Huawei to co develop an amplifier using GaN . Such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses .
