After a very long day in Kruger national park , with five rhinos sent to new homes and three elephants freed from their collars ? like this sedated female ? I decided to take a moment . I know how lucky I am to have these experiences , but hearing stories from people on the ground about how bad the situation really is upset and frustrated me . How can it be that 30 , 000 elephants were slaughtered last year alone ? And for what ? Their tusks ? Seeing huge carcasses of rhinos and elephants scattered across Africa with their horns and tusks missing is a pointless waste of beauty .
