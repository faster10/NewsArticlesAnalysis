YDSTIE : Gerard is referring to OPEC , the group of oil exporters led by Saudi Arabia who once could set a ceiling and floor for oil prices . But the Saudi ' s have been pumping freely , doing their best to drive prices lower and force U . S . producers out of business . On Tuesday , the Saudi ' s cut prices once again , this time for sales of oil to Europe . The move was largely interpreted as an effort to keep Iran , also an OPEC member , from regaining its traditional market in Europe as sanctions are lifted this year . Dan Katzenberg says that could weaken OPEC further and send prices even lower .
