" Here ' s the reason I voted the way I voted : If you are a gun shop owner in Vermont and you sell somebody a gun and that person flips out and then kills somebody , I don ' t think it ' s really fair to hold that person responsible , the gun shop owner , " he told NBC News last month . " On the other hand , where . . . there is evidence that manufacturers , gun manufacturers , do know that they ' re selling a whole lot of guns in an area that really should not be buying that many guns . That many of those guns are going to other areas , probably for criminal purposes . So can we take another look at that liability issue ? Yes . "
