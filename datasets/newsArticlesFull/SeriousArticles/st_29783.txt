Now keep in mind birth control pills require a doctor ' s prescription , but a drug that is more powerful doesn ' t ? The effective ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and this is also found in daily oral contraceptives . Some forms of birth control that require a prescription have levonorgestrel , while Plan B has significantly more of the synthetic hormone . Do we really want our daughters putting something like this in their bodies without a doctor ? I still want Mom and Dad in on this .
