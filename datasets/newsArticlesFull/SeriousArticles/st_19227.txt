Pretty much learning to deal with success , he said is the biggest one . One of the things that coach talked about early on was managing success and being prepared for you guys , the media . . . I told the guys , don t be surprised about the questions that you get , the scrutiny is going to be more . As Coach Ditka used to always tell us , They like to put you on a pedestal , but remember , that pedestal gets high , so it s a long way to fall . So just things like that . Trying to remind these guys to maintain their focus , to handle our success , and just be prepared .
