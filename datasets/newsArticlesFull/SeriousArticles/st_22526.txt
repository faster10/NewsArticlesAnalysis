It s a real shame that the Ravens weren t able to get things going on offense , the defense played great football and did everything in their power to help the team win . The linebackers were relentless . Daryl Smith , who lead the charge with nine tackles , and the rest of the linebacker unit helped keep the Dolphins in check . They were asked to do a lot because the Dolphins ran the ball early and often . The defensive line didn t do a great job of keeping the running backs in check as Miami was able to run for 137 yards .
