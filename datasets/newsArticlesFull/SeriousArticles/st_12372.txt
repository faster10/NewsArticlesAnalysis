The media is enabling Trump ? to hang himself . He s chosen a campaign strategy of using media attention to lock up roughly one quarter of the primary vote , and in doing so , mortgaged off his chances of winning the presidency . He enjoys being the polling frontrunner , an honor he only gets by virtue of the absurdly large Republican field . If there s one group that really could enable Trump s ability to become the nominee , it would be the crowded establishment lane , if it ever gets around to its much needed self winnowing .
