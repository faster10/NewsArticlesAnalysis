Clocking in at an exhausting 163 minutes even without some of the book ' s various subplots , the film forfeits momentum and suspense for a jerky succession of expository dialogue scenes , interspersed with occasional flashes of grotesque ultra violence . It ' s all invariably filmed in Snyder ' s spasmodic , stop go trademark style and accompanied by a jukebox score that ranges from Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to Nena ' s " 99 Luftballoons . "
