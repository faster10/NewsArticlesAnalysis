Greene : We ' re a white Jewish family in Atlanta , but Atlanta is a major city for eastern African immigrants . So our children are in touch with the Ethiopian diaspora , and they feel very much a part of that . Atlanta is full of Ethiopian restaurants , markets , festivals . For a while , my kids were playing on weekends with an Ethiopian soccer league . I have an Ethiopian baby sitter who speaks to them only in Amharic so they won ' t lose their language , and we always have Ethiopian food here .
