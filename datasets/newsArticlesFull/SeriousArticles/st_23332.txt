Up first : Jen Hirsh on the Beatles ' " Oh Darling . " Maybe they showed too much of her too soon . I ' d been really excited about Jen heading into this week , but the magic was gone . I agreed with Jimmy that Jen should have stayed miles away from Adele on Wednesday and this last performance of hers seemed just as desperate in terms of what he called " vocal pyrotechnics . " She changed much more of both melodies than she needed to . It ' s always a fine line on Idol wanting to make something your own vs . going too far .
