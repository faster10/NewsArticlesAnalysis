Missouri police on Wednesday quickly arrested Hunter Park , 19 , a student at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla , Missouri , a sister campus to the main university in Columbia that was the scene of protests since last week . Park was arrested on suspicion of making a terrorist threat toward black students and faculty at the University of Missouri . The incident follows weeks of protest over how the university handles student racial concerns and resulted in the departure of two senior university officials this week .
