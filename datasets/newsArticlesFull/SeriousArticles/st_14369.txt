It is often forgotten that this was a bipartisan campaign . A Republican president , Richard Nixon , and legislators from both sides of the aisle expanded the War on Poverty in the early 1970s . Nixon extended the reach of the food stamp program , added an automatic cost of living increase to Social Security and instituted the Supplemental Security Income system to benefit disabled adults and children . He even proposed a guaranteed national income though that died in the Senate after passing in the House .
