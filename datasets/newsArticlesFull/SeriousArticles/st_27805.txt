Do you spot the flaw ? It is found in the screaming disconnect between these two ideas : We are talking about a strategy that cedes Trump the long sought Iowa ? New Hampshire double and a dozen or so additional states over the course of a month and then bets on Trump losing the nomination . And losing it , at that , to someone like Rubio or Bush . Does the Republican establishment , after seeing all that it s seen so far this cycle , still operate under the impression that Trump would lose in a head to head matchup to either Rubio or Bush , something directly contradicted by recent polling ?
