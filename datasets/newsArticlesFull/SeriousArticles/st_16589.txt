FILE In this Nov . 6 , 2013 file photo , Sen . Rand Paul , R Ky . speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington . This is a year of auditioning , positioning , networking and just plain hard work for people who are considering running for president in 2016 . You could see them stirring in 2013 as they plugged holes in resumes , took preliminary steps to build potential campaign organizations and made carefully calibrated moves to get better known by Americans generally and key constituencies in particular . Most but not all are ticking off items on what could be called the presidential prep checklist . And they ? ve got baggage to deal with . ( AP Photo J . Scott Applewhite , File )
