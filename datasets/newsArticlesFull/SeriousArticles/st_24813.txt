EB : ? I think it ' s difficult for them to respond to that message because they would have to acknowledge that they are the establishment and we live in this weird climate in the United States where because being an outsider or a maverick or going rogue is always superior to being a crusty old guy just because of the kind of country we are , the way that we were founded . No candidate wants to stand up and say , Yes I am the old guard . I am the established power . I am the power elite . Everyone wants to be the grassroots populist man of the people type candidate . And I don ' t think voters are going to believe that . Hilary Clinton has been Secretary of State . There ' s no way you can identify her as an outsider when she ' s inside the current administration . But I ? think that ' s going to be a real challenge . ?
