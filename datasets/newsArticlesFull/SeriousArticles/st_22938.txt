The three annual Brimfield Antique Shows have grown to encompass more than 20 individual shows ( known as fields ) , each with hundreds of vendors lined up along a one mile stretch of Route 20 ( get a field by field breakdown at brimfieldshow . com ) . Many take the same spots season after season , and repeat visits make the experience less overwhelming . For a taste of the original , browse the old wooden trunks , braided rugs , and Depression glass at J J Promotions , run by the daughters of Brimfield founder Gordon Reid and held on the same field where Reid staged the first event back in 1959 .
