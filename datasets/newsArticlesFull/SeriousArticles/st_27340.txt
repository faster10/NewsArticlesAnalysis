Last year , before returning to Australia following several years working overseas on atrocity crimes , I walked 1100 kilometres across France , soaking up everything French culture had on offer . On my long walk , I contemplated the decade of atrocity related work I ' d been engaged in while living in Africa , Asia , and Europe . Unsurprisingly , I didn ' t discover the answer to ending the commission of atrocities , but I did make the ( perhaps superficial ) discovery that my love affair with France would be life long .
