I think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor . People come in , they give you a list of symptoms . You try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis . And sometimes we get it wrong , but most of the time we get it right . But it is an art and a science mixed into one . It ' s a very satisfying job , when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running . At the end of the day , you can feel really good because you can look back and be like , " This is what I did today . "
