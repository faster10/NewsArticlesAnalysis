I don ' t know if del Toro felt overwhelmed by the pressure of making a megabudget 3 D tentpole for the first time , but there isn ' t enough of his bewitching poetic touch in the film . In a sense , Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie . It ' s more like a mash up of Real Steel and the Transformers pictures . Which is a shame , because the idea is undeniably cool . But I ' d be surprised if a kid in Mexico or anywhere else walked out of Pacific Rim with a burning desire to direct a tribute to it when he or she grows up . Grade : B
