Briggs echoed the narrative of Sanders having an impeccable history on LGBT issues , describing him to the Blade as somebody who s been for gay rights long , long ago and as having by far the most exemplary record on gay rights of any candidate ever in American history . Unsurprisingly , this is a bit overstated . As my Outward colleague Mark Joseph Stern revealed in a post last year , Sanders ? while certainly better on queer issues than most ? can hardly claim to have been a star ally all along . Indeed , he supported civil unions over same sex marriage in 2006 , and his opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 was explained at the time as concern over states rights rather than gay people s right to legally recognized love . What matters , of course , is that the Bern got to where we need him now on most of the issues ? but presenting an overly rosy view of the facts and the record has a way of tarnishing that otherwise laudable evolution .
