Qubeka : Any filmmaker wants their film to be seen , any filmmaker wants their film to resonate . In that regard , I ' m happy for the exposure and because I believe in the film and because I actually think it ' s the best thing I ' ve done in 12 years I ' ve been a filmmaker and I ' ve taken the time to craft it . I ' m happy that the attention is there because the piece will stand for itself . It may not raise the questions that people expected to , but as a piece of cinema I think it ' s relatively satisfying .
