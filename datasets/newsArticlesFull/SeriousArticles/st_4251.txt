Fantasy watch : Running back Bishop Sankey is as good as dead as a fantasy option . He didn ' t get a carry and lost the one role he had , as the team ' s kick returner , after losing a fumble and booting the next chance , which he recovered . Dexter McCluster was the kick returner after that . Running back David Cobb is eligible to come off injured reserve this week or next . Indications are he ' s recovered from the calf injury that set him back . He should be active and Sankey inactive going forward .
