Florida severely restricted voter registration drives , although minority voters register through drives at twice the rate of white voters . The Sunshine State also cut early voting , the process through which more than half of the state ' s African Americans cast ballots in 2008 . Florida implemented its restrictive bill in violation of the VRA and only submitted the legislation for preclearance after it was sued in federal court . When DOJ questioned the discriminatory impact of these changes , Florida removed the most controversial parts of its law from the department ' s consideration and instead asked a federal court to excuse it from its obligations under the VRA .
