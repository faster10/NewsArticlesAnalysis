To be clear , there ' s still just enough camp gold to get the best lines bedazzled on a leotard . ( My favorite : ' ' Honey , in gay years , you ' re Judy during the Sid Luft obese period . ' ' ) Also , casting Rob Lowe as Liberace ' s drug pushing , alien faced plastic surgeon is a genius move that allows the actor to send up his pretty boy image . But Douglas ' performance is surprisingly restrained , especially given that he ' s playing a man who lived in fear every day that his double life would be exposed . The more secretive parts of Liberace ' s world , like his obsession with sex clubs and porn , come across as quirky rather than dark . And Damon , who captures Thorson ' s damaged child side well , makes him a little too sympathetic . ( After all , this is a guy who ' s now in jail for burglary . )
