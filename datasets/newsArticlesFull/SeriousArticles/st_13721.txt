Harry Kane is another player who has surprised me . Tottenham are lucky to have him . He has come from nowhere and is helping them to make up for mistakes they have made in the transfer market . His goals have given them a chance of the top four . Kane has become their talisman and he leaves everything on the pitch . Spurs fans sing ' he is one of us ' , and he looks like a fan playing football . My boss said to me a few months ago : ' Mention Harry Kane for England in your column . ' I laughed . I ' m not laughing any more .
