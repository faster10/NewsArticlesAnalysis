" I ' ll tell you she ' s not going to be 100 , I know that for a fact , " Rhee said of Giffords . " She has a scar on her head , she ' s going to have multiple scars on her . . . there are a lot of things that are permanently damaged that won ' t ever come back . Is she going to be the same as she was before ? I think she ' s going to have permanent changes in thoughts and memories and feelings and emotions , so we ' ll have to see how that pans out in the future . But I think she ' ll be doing very well .
