It had been a while since I ' d talked with Gail Martin , but I called her the other evening , and she told me that , like the rest of us , she is forever encountering her dad ' s voice unexpectedly in public places : " It ' s always reassuring , it ' s always nice . I was in a store one holiday season , and there was a Christmas tape playing . A choir of some sort was singing a Christmas carol , and that ended and then there was my dad : ' Oh , the weather outside is frightful . . . ' I just smiled a quiet smile . He ' s always there . "
