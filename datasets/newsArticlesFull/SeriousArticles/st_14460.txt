The AUVs work by pinging the ocean floor as they travel just above it , sending up signals that are displayed on computer screens as dots that change color as the subs ping over different surfaces . The softest surface , sand , transmits as blue dots hard stone and metal transmit as red dots that blend off into green . The Electra , as a metal object , would show up red . Once an AUV pinged a large metal object : It turned out to be a 55 gallon steel drum . Other than that , the ocean floor was as barren as the moon .
