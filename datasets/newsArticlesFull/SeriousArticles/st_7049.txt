" Oyelowo said : ' This institution doesn ' t reflect its president and it doesn ' t reflect this room . I am an Academy member and it doesn ' t reflect me , and it doesn ' t reflect this nation . ' Still , he offered his ' support ' for Isaacs . ' The Academy is an institution in which they all say radical and timely change cannot happen quickly , ' Oyelowo said , per THR . ' It better happen quickly . The law of this country can change in a matter of months . It better come on . The Oscars is on February 28 . Cheryl needs us to pray that by that date , change is going to come . We need to pray for Cheryl , we need to support Cheryl , we need to love Cheryl . We cannot afford to get bitter , we cannot afford to get negative . But we must make our voice heard . ' "
