ANALYSIS : PRESIDENT OBAMA SEEKS TO PUT HIS LEGACY ON 2016 BALLOT . President Obama used a political spotlight he may never command to the same degree again to bring the nation s focus to his legacy ? with a hope of reclaiming a spirit he long ago saw vanish . Coming at a moment of national angst and anger , with a loud campaign raging to replace him , the president used his final State of the Union address to remind the nation of his achievements , even if many of those are less than popular . He was calm in comparison to the overheated politics outside the House chamber , ABC s RICK KLEIN writes . One of his last big speeches as president , though , will go down not for its unifying tones but for the challenges he offered for Americans to join him in his vision all over again , for posterity s sake . http : abcn . ws 1N6mnZi
