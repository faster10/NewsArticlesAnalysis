Nadal was staying in the contest , but on the big points , Djokovic was able to bring something extra to the contest . In the second set , Djokovic broke again for a 3 2 lead , stretching out for and salvaging lost causes and beating his opponent with pace and clever angles . Serving to stay in the match , Nadal was forced to deuce as Djokovic had the Mallorcan scampering back and forth with drop shots and lobs . On match point , one last cross court back hand from Djokovic left Nadal flat footed on the baseline , sealing the match in an hour and 19 minutes .
