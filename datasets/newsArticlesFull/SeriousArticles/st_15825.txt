That sequence offered a reminder of the state of play these days . Ordinary teams ? like a Nuggets squad that entered Sunday 6 7 with a middle of the pack offense led by rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay , a bottom 10 defense still learning under new head coach Malone , and four frontcourt contributors ( Kenneth Faried , Wilson Chandler , Joffrey Lauvergne and Jusuf Nurkic ) shelved due to injury ? need to be perfect to have a chance of beating these Warriors . Stephen Curry and company , though , are good enough to get gassed , fumble around a bit . . . and still annihilate you .
