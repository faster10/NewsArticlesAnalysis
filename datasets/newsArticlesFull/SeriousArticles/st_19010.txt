Lewis ' playoff futility was on full display again against the Steelers , but he ' s not on the field . This is the fifth straight season and the sixth time in seven years the Bengals have reached the postseason . And every time , the story ends the same ? with not just a loss but a bad one . Saturday ' s meltdown might have stung the worst because of the lack of discipline and the stupefying mental mistakes . If you break down the Bengals roster , there are no real weaknesses . They ' re solid up front , have playmakers on offense and have a defense that finished second in the league in points allowed per game . So , what the heck ? When all other obvious reasons have been thrown out , it s fair to assume that something deeper is keeping Cincinnati locked in a cycle of failure . Maybe some professional help is needed .
