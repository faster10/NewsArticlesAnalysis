PS : I don ' t think he ' s getting more nervous . At his age , maybe he thinks that it should have become easier well , it ' s not going to become easier . It ' s incredibly tough to go on stage in front of four or five thousand people and sustain their interest by yourself . And one thing that really impresses me , again as a psychologist , is that I think he is really healing . I think that people really have the opportunity to just laugh like that and it ' s so good for you . I feel fantastic when I go to one of his shows and come out and I ' m just sick with laughter .
