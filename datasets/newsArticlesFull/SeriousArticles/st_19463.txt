Or officials using a UAV to increase the efficiency of search and rescue operations for missing persons . Or American made UAVs enabling the delivery of supplies such as medicine to remote , impoverished villages in the developing world , better enabling us to track and prevent diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola .
