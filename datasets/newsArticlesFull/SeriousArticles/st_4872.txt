John Dickerson : As we ' ve seen multiple times already this year , hosting a debate is very , very hard work . Dickerson , the anchor of CBS ' s " Face the Nation , " handled his duties with aplomb , gravity and , most important of all , a sense of humor . Dickerson asked the candidates to answer tough questions and defend past inconsistencies . When they didn ' t do so , he followed up to get more direct answers . And he did it all with a smile on his face . Well done . ( Side note : Kudos to CBS for including Kathie Obradovich , a longtime fixture of Iowa political reporting , on its reporter panel . )
