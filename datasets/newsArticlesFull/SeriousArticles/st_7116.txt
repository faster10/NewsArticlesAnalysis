Often in the Northern Hemisphere we put too much emphasis on a full back ' s defensive qualities . For me full back has always been a key attacking position , made for players who can ' make something happen ' . The southern hemisphere takes that view as well . You think of the carnage Christian Cullen used to cause at full back and how he wasn ' t so effective when he was moved to centre . More recently Australia ' s most potent attacking weapon is Israel Folau , New Zealand look to Israel Dagg .
