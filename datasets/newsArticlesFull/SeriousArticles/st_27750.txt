The kingdom has a lengthy history of justifying its own violence and human rights violations in the name of countering terror . We have documented the trials and convictions of many peaceful activists and a host of due process violations at the Specialized Criminal Court , set up in 2008 to try terrorism cases but often used to prosecute peaceful dissidents . In 2014 , Saudi Arabia passed an extremely broad counterterrorism law and regulations , including sweeping provisions that authorities can use to criminalize virtually any expression critical of the government . Now mass executions can be added to the list of egregious abuses .
