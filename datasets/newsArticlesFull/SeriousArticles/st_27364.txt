I have little sympathy for men and women who prey on the innocent hardworking members of the community . I am particularly critical of men who are guilty of criminal behavior , as this runs counter to what I see as one of the primary duties of men : to be guardians of the home and of the community , not parasites on that community . I am , however , uncertain that society gains very much by sentencing thousands of young black men to prison for nonviolent drug offenses . The sentences introduce them to a system from which it is difficult to extricate themselves and begins the downward path to joblessness , absentee fatherhood and more criminal behavior in short , creating more of the very behavior we are trying to discourage .
