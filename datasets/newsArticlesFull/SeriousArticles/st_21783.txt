In Tuesday night ' s Republican debate , front runner Ben Carson was borderline incoherent : He wants to make Islamic State " look like losers " by " destroying their caliphate . . . . Take all of that land from them . We could do that , I believe , fairly easily , I ' ve learned from talking to several generals , and then you move on from there .
