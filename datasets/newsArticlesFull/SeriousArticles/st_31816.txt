Problems with " Alpha Protocol " include inaccuracies in aiming ( the enemy can be square in your crosshairs , yet you somehow miss when you fire ) glitches when taking cover behind objects ( Michael ' s body gyrates when he gets too close to a corner ) a camera system that proves more frustrating than helpful enemies who just stand there and wait to be shot and graphics that look a few years out of date ( though some of the locations are well designed , including memorable levels in Saudi Arabia , Russia and Taiwan ) .
