I ve had him in my ? Top 5 for several weeks , so I m not sure I m the one you should be taking umbrage with , but I ll address it anyway . For whatever reason , it s been very hard for Big 12 receivers to get serious Heisman traction in the past . In 2007 , Texas Tech s Michael Crabtree had a staggering 134 catches for 1 , 962 yards and 22 touchdowns ( including the bowl game ) and did not even crack the Top 10 . Three years later , Oklahoma State s Justin Blackmon had 111 catches for 1 , 782 yards and 20 TDs . I put both on my ballots , but neither made it to New York . Only last season did Alabama s Amari Cooper break an 11 year finalist drought for receivers , and it took him catching a staggering 124 catches for 1 , 727 yards and 16 TDs .
