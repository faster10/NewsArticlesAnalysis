The worst problem is probably that requirements change while the software is being developed . This may mean that you have to redo work you ' ve already done , but the effects can be more far reaching . It ' s like building a house : If the owners suddenly decide they want a big floor to ceiling picture window on the second floor , it may require rerouting water pipes . That may require moving the ground floor bathroom , which in turn could affect the kitchen layout , because the bathtub and the kitchen sink share drain pipes . Part of project management ' s job is to say " no " to many change requests , but that ' s not always possible .
