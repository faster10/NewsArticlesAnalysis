Clemson will look to take Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry away by stacking the box , just as Michigan State did in the Cotton Bowl . Unlike the Spartans , however , the Tigers have cornerbacks in Mackensie Alexander and Jayron Kearse who won t let receivers Calvin Ridley , Richard Mullaney and ArDarius Stewart run free , as was the case in the Cotton Bowl . Crimson Tide senior quarterback Jake Coker threw for a career high 286 yards while completing 25 of 30 passes in the rout of Michigan State , the kind of performance , if replicated , that likely would lead to another celebration in Tuscaloosa . But he hasn t seen a defense quite like Clemson s , and that display of accuracy was atypical of his regular season .
