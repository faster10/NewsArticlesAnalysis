The best answer , of course , is that we already bailed out the banks and creditors with tax money . Why not bail out the actual people ? And the Occupiers are not focusing on home loans taken out by aggressive real estate speculators , but the personal debt that has already been well documented to be ripe for abuse and fraud by lending institutions and their agents . ( The easier answer is that if you don ' t like this idea , simply do not take part . If you find your debt occupied and relieved , you can surely find banks and credit agencies willing to accept your payments . )
