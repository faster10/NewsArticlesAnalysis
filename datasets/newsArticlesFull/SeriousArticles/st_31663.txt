It ' s a common running joke among second generation Asian Americans that our parents start us on college prep before we begin potty training .

I remember being rewarded for finishing homework early by getting extra " Mommy Homework , " which always involved problem sets and practice exams from a dog eared stack of Princeton Review test prep tomes .
