Mark Goffman : We knew from the beginning . We had told John Noble about it , and I actually gave him the bible for the season when we first brought him on . So it ' s been something he ' s been sort of building into his performance from episode 5 . And we really thought it was important to establish the Sin Eater as a character before we even heard of Crane ' s son . And then to try to put to bed the idea of his son in a couple of episodes later in the back half of the season . So it ' s kind of brought up , then dismissed and we move on with the story and the mythology . Hopefully we buried the ball pretty well in terms of the reveal .
