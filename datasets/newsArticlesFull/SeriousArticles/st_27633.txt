One Friday in Old Sana a , while filming the aftermath of the Saudi led coalition bombings , I found myself surrounded by a group of militia who were trying to take hold of my camera . I was detained for a few hours in the ruins , confused and unnerved . The interrogation I received from the Houthis was relentless . But the problems didn t stop here . For a week , I was harassed with regular phone calls and visits from National Security officials at my hotel . All this despite having a press visa issued in London .
