" Straight Outta Compton " wasn ' t nominated for multiple Oscars when nominees were announced Thursday morning ( Jan . 14 ) . For example , a 2012 USC study discovered that though Latinos represent 32 of " frequent moviegoers " , they are actually the most underrepresented demographic on screen with only 4 of speaking roles in films . This stems mostly from the fact that Straight Outta Compton didn ' t get a much expected nomination for Best Picture . What about Lupita Nyong ' o , who deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her unforgettable role in 12 Years a Slave ? That ' s gotta hurt , QT .
