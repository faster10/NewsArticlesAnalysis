Nothing inspires fear like the arbitrary , selective application of laws . Consider the Bolotnaya case , in which 27 people have been charged in connection with a protest that ended in violence mostly police violence last year . Because they face a variety of charges , only eight will be amnestied , and the rest will remain under arrest . But there is no discernible difference among the defendants in this case all the charges against them appear unproven and unprovable . This is the very definition of the arbitrary application of laws .
