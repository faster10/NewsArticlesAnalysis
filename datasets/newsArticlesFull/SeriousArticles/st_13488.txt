Last week , Bills coach Rex Ryan did little to persuade anyone the Patriots aren t in his head . History suggests that doesn t bode well for the Bills , who were irresponsibly undisciplined with 14 penalties for 140 yards in their Week 2 loss to the Pats . The Bills are on a mini surge with back to back wins against the Dolphins and Jets , but of Ryan s 10 losses ( in 14 games ) to the Patriots , he entered seven of those defeats with a victory in the previous week . He has been humbled by the Patriots time and again .
