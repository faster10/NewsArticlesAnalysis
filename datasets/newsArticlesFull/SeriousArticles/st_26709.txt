To me it s unique to hockey , coach Ken Hitchcock said . It s what makes the game special . I ve known John for a few years . I think you re so happy for him and his family . There s a level of sincerity in him and his family and his wife and his kids that s impressive . I thought he handled it with such class and dignity , he s a good lesson for a lot of people . The thing with Scotty is , he s got hockey sense , and three on three is hockey sense . . . . You don t need to be the quickest guy to be a good player three on three . . . . He knows how to play the game , he knows the right places to play , and that s why he didn t look out of place one bit there .
