If anything , this is a moment to pull back on the effort to get Raines elected . Based on what we know about Hall voting , he should pick up the votes he needs next year just by appearing on the ballot a final time . He doesn ' t need a campaign waged in his favor . He doesn ' t need browbeating of the 133 voters who did not vote for him . He just needs the next vote to roll around without current or potential voters having been turned off by a shrill white noise . Right now , the only thing that can stop Tim Raines from getting into the Hall of Fame is the people who really want Tim Raines in the Hall of Fame .
