Even after the signing of Elneny , the priority this summer is still in midfield . Mikel Arteta , Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky are all likely to leave and there is naturally concern also at the longer term availability of Jack Wilshere . A major signing in central midfield is likely , with Lars Bender , William Carvalho and Victor Wanyama among those still being regularly scouted . Wenger will also look carefully at the centre of his defence . Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are both now over 30 and , while there are big long term hopes for Calum Chambers and Gabriel , there is a danger that the squad will lack cover in the transition between these four players . Striker is a position that Wenger would still like to strengthen but finding solutions to improve on Olivier Giroud , Theo Walcott and Alexis Sanchez will be difficult . The club will also be active in trying to identify the next big emerging talents .
