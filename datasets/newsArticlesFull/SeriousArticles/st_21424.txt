When speaking at Liberty Trump referred to " Two " rather than " Second " Corinthians , which suggests he hasn ' t spent much time in church or listened to anyone quote the Bible . Indeed , it gives substance to comedian Andy McDonald ' s imagined version of the Bible according to Trump . For instance , the death of John the Baptist : " Herod ' s daughter asks daddy for the head of John the Baptist . But really it was her mother , the gold digger . Definitely get a pre nup on that one . So they bring John ' s head on a platter , my people tell me a very ornate and luxurious silver platter , no expense spared . Poor bastard though . "
