Warning women about heavy drinking places the burden of not being sexually assaulted squarely on the shoulders of victims , and when they are raped this twisted dynamic often leads them to blame themselves for their own mauling .

The bottom line is that the victims of rape should not be expected to have forestalled their attack , and are never to blame for it , even if they are a drunken " hot messes " at the afterparty .
