The Atlantic s Conor Friedersdorf describes the exchange as the major gaffe of the night : The wild card in this debate was its proximity to the Paris attacks . Many believed this would play to Clinton s strengths . But in the end I think that it hurt her because the effect was to have a long discussion about her Iraq War vote Her overall performance was fine , but what was she thinking using 9 11 to defend all the money that she s taken from Wall Street ? I expect it will be used to attack her in primaries and in the general if she gets there .
