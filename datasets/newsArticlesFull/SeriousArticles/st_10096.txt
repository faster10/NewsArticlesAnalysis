On Thursday , Suu Kyi fielded questions on the plight of the Rohingya , who have been forced into squalid camps and robbed of their right to vote in these elections . I think it is very important that we should not exaggerate the problems in this country , she said . There s a Burmese saying : You have to make big problems small and small problems disappear . It s not a question of exaggerating small problems into big ones and big ones to the extent that they are totally unmanageable . I m not saying this is a small problem . I would promise everyone who is living in this country proper protection in accordance with the law .
