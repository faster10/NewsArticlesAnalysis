Cameron has extended his offer of help to refugees and we applaud him for that . But the distinction he continues to draw , between refugees in the region and those in Europe , is a false one . There are 26 , 000 unaccompanied refugee children across Europe . Most British people , regardless of their views on the wider immigration debate , would see a moral duty to reach out a hand to them . And , if we supported our neighbours better , I suspect we would get a better hearing on our own renegotiation demands .
