An intricate plan to lure a massive horde of walkers away from the Alexandria settlement went horrible awry , instead delivering said walkers right to the walls . Why ? Oh , because a group of nihilistic killers known as the Wolves descended upon Alexandria while those best able to defend it were out dealing with those walkers , resulting in the deaths of almost every Alexandrian who isn ' t a main character . ( Rough season to be an extra on TWD . ) Then Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) was rewarded for trying to help Nicholas redeem himself by being blown off a dumpster into a pack of walkers ( though he ' ll probably survive ) while Michonne ( Danai Gurira ) dared to tell a man he ' d get deliver a letter to his wife back at Alexandria himself . ( Spoiler : He didn ' t survive and no one grabbed his letter . But , honestly , the Wolves probably killed his wife , anyway . )
