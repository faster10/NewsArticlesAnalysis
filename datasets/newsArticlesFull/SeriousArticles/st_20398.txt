Will Leitch , Sports on Earth : " The first time you experience a World Series , it ' s like the first time you walk through Times Square . Everything is amazing and disorienting . Baseball is a sport of routine and familiarity you spend months of a year , or years of a decade , or decades of a century , doing your own thing , going about your business of caring about your team every day with relatively low stakes . And then , suddenly , the entire baseball world is staring at you , and everything is neon . It can be overwhelming . You can ' t believe you ' re here . You can ' t stop looking up . You noticed this in Kansas City . Last year ' s Royals were an anomaly , a team that was middling during the regular season and barely sneaked into the American League Wild Card Game in which they were down 7 3 in the eighth inning . Then , out of nowhere , they were a thunderbolt : coming back against the A ' s to win in 12 innings , then sweeping the Angels and the Orioles in the AL Division Series and Championship Series , respectively . Before they even realized what was happening , the Royals were in the World Series for the first time in 30 years . Fans lost their minds . . . Royals fans were basking in the glow and wanted to savor every second of it . It doesn ' t feel that way this time . There is a seriousness of purpose here now . "
