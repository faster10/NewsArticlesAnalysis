Clinton ? is much funnier when she is being inherently truthful . Her best moment , outside of the toughness on the banks , was when Colbert asked her about Donald Trump and Ben Carson , and whether she could picture them in the Oval Office . She paused for a moment , thought it over and betrayed a small grin . I can picture them in some office . That s a good line , and it s one she came up with on the spot . It wasn t forced jocularity . It was just a wry little bit of truth . That s her comic gift , ? and that s what Colbert is skilled at prying out of people . For one night , they worked in almost perfect harmony . At least she didn t have to talk to any more Trump impersonators .
