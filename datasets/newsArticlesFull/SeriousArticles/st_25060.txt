Putin s larger strategy is also obvious . He is not reconstructing the old Soviet empire . That s too large a task . But he is rebuilding and reasserting Russia s ability to project power beyond its borders . Annexing Crimea restores to the motherland full control of the warm water Black Sea port that Russia has coveted since Peter the Great . Shoring up a rump Alawite state secures Russia s naval and air bases in the eastern Mediterranean . Add to that Russia s launching advanced cruise missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea to strike Syrian rebels 900 miles away and you have the most impressive display of Russian military reach since the Cold War .
