There are some rarities that will go up in value , I guess , you know the German version of Heroes , that s always been a very collectible single , and that will go up in value , certain things will . is new album will come out in clear vinyl , in America , and also via his website . That will go up in value , that will be very collectible , says Nigel House , founder and co owner of West London s historic Rough Trade retail store . The singles he did , or the album ? I think he did a coloured vinyl album for the exhibition at the V A ? I mean that s bound to go up in value , but his general back catalogue , no , I don t think it will go up in value .
