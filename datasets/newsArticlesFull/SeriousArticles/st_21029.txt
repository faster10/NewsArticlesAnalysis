" We support this effort to require DOT to return to its previous regulation , which does not artificially distort the base price of an airline ticket , and ensures that customers always know exactly how much they are paying in federal aviation taxes and fees before they decide to purchase , " said Steve Lott , vice president of communications for Airlines for America said in an e mail . " Federal taxes and fees now constitute 61 , or over 20 , of the cost of a typical 300 domestic round trip ticket , putting aviation at a higher tax rate than alcohol , beer , cigarettes and firearms .
