This entire argument buys into the Keynesian conceit that government spending creates jobs over the long term . But the resources necessary to create those jobs have to be extracted from the private economy either through taxes or borrowing . That means the private sector then has fewer resources to invest in job creation . Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use , it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates .
