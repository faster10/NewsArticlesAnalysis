Gostkowski won t be the only one on the receiving end of season ending criticism . The offensive line , a rotating question mark all season , allowed the Broncos to rent space in the pocket . Brady was sacked four times , and the Broncos registered 20 quarterback hits , a season high number by far . Brady threw a pair of interceptions , one that led to a second quarter Broncos TD , the second Manning to Owen Daniels score of the first half . It gave Denver a 14 6 lead , the same 8 point advantage they took into halftime ( matching field goals made it 17 9 ) .
