? Clinton overstated health care cost control . In hailing the ACA ' s benefits , Clinton claimed we now have driven costs down to the lowest they ' ve been in 50 years . " But as Rachana Pradhan points out , that ' s not true : health care costs are not lower than they were in 1966 . ( Nor in 1976 , 1986 , and so on health care spending essentially rises every year . ) And assuming Clinton misspoke and meant to say that cost growth is at its lowest point in 50 years , she ' s wrong on that too . Health spending grew 3 . 6 percent in 2013 . But it bounced back up to 5 . 3 percent in 2014 ? and it ' s expected to rise in the coming years .
