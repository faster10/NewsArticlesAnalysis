2 . The Giants are not comfortable at this point with the idea of promoting one of their coordinators to the big chair . They believe McAdoo and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo can be NFL head coaches ( Spagnuolo already was , once ) , but McAdoo is only 38 years old and in his second season as a coordinator . They would like to see him develop a bit more . And while the defensive problems are clearly personnel driven and Spagnuolo has done a good job in spite of the obvious roster flaws , it ' s tough to promote a defensive coordinator whose unit just finished at the bottom of the league in yards allowed . I don ' t think they have a clear idea who they would hire to replace Coughlin from the outside , and if you ' re not looking to fire your coach , that ' s one reason you can come up with to talk yourself off the ledge .
