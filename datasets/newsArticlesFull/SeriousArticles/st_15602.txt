I do think some of these promises go all the way back to Goldwater . The first line of the book is , The history of contemporary American conservatism is a story of disappointment and betrayal . Going right back to the beginning , one of the core promises of ? modern ? conservatism , that they could create a smaller government , was simply impossible . Nixon didn t do it in fact , he actually grew government . Reagan didn t do it , Bush didn t do it , Bush II didn t do it . It s not a conspiracy , it s because most Americans want a lot from government , including Tea Party folks who are at or over the age of 65 who will criticize all kinds of programs but also insist , Don t take away my Medicare or Social Security .
