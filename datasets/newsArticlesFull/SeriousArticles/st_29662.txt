Myanmar ' s ethnic parties may also limit an NLD win . The NLD has failed to conduct consistent or widespread outreach to Myanmar ' s diverse ethnic nationalities that have witnessed each iteration of national government ignore their cultures , interests , and concerns . Additionally , instead of allying with the parties popular in ethnic nationality areas , the NLD has chosen to run its own candidates , despite assurances to the contrary . This has raised tensions between the NLD and dozens of ethnic parties . Ethnic nationalities , particularly the Rakhine , have criticized Aung San Suu Kyi ' s lacking and inappropriately timed engagement with them , and have become suspicious of her Bamar background .
