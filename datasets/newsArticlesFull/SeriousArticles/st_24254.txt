A month ago I found this letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson when I was 16 years old and my mom had saved it for me and put it in a box in the attic . It was a five page letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson saying , " Dear Oscar , I ' m 16 years old and I hear a professional musician ' s life is a very difficult one but I know this is the only life I want to have . " And it was really enlightening for me to see the focus of a 16 year old . It reminded me of how much I love the music and always wanted to do what I ' m doing , so how lucky am I ?
