In November , GOP hopefuls Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee were introduced to speak at a conference in Iowa organized by pastor Kevin Swanson who would go on to tell attendees that gay people should be executed . No one should have been surprised . His is a long history of vile , anti gay hate . In the past he has said that Christians should attend same sex weddings and hold up signs telling the couples they " should be put to death . " And yet there Cruz and Huckabee were , courting the support of Swanson ' s bigoted brethren . Should they get a pass because they support tax cuts too ?
