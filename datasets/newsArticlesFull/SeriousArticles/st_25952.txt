Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe crucially , however , it can also be impacted by what he calls " onerous " EU regulation and legislation . As an example , he cites delays : " There can be delays absolutely outside the control of the airline , but the airline still has to not only compensate the passenger but also to meet a whole lot of costs of those delays for passengers . " The additional costs don ' t end there either : air traffic control costs are roughly double in Europe than they are in the United States .
