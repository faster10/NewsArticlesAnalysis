BEN CARSON BACKS OFF : Hours after telling reporters that he saw a video of American Muslims in New Jersey cheering on Sept . 11 , 2001 , when the World Trade Center ' s twin towers fell , Ben Carson ' s campaign apologized for the remarks , saying he " doesn ' t stand behind " them and that they were " a mistake , ABC s KATHERINE FAULDERS notes . When asked by ABC News if American Muslims were cheering on 9 11 as has been suggested by Donald Trump Carson said Yes . I saw the film of it , yeah , he said and cited " the newsreels " of 9 11 coverage at the time . However , Carson made a 180 a short time later . " He doesn ' t stand behind his comments to New Jersey and American Muslims , " said campaign spokesman Doug Watts said . " He was rather thinking of the protests going on in the Middle East and some of the demonstrations that we ' re going on in celebration of the towers going down . " He doesn ' t stand behind his references and apologizes for the mistaken references . It was a mistake on his part and he clearly wasn ' t really thinking about New Jersey , he was thinking about the Middle East . " http : abcn . ws 1YpX4Kp
