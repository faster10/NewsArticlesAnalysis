I say this as someone who has been a devoted sci fi reader since childhood . I was so blown away by the first " Star Wars " film when I saw it in 1977 , I went back two more times the same week to wallow in its space age fantasy . But here ' s the thing : George Lucas ' creation , basically a blown up Flash Gordon adventure with better special effects , has left all too many people thinking science fiction is some computer graphics laden space opera western filled with shootouts , territorial disputes , evil patriarchs and trusty mounts ( like the Millennium Falcon ) .
