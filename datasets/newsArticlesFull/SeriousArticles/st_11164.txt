" I hope WikiLeaks is more than just one man , and that despite the extradition and the enormous pressure , WikiLeaks will continue , " said Jeff Paterson , who is involved with the Bradley Manning Support Network , which raises money for Manning ' s defense . Paterson founded the group Courage to Resist , which according to a document on its website , has raised nearly 400 , 000 . The majority of that money pays for Manning ' s private legal counsel , Paterson said , and the rest pays for numerous protests the group has staged in support of the soldier . WikiLeaks contributed 15 , 100 in January .
