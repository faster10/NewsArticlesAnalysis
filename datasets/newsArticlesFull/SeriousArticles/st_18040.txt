There are multiple trends that are going to affect the next race . The candidates matter a lot . Then there are three big trend lines that matter ? how the economy is doing , the president s popularity and the ability of the Republicans to rebrand themselves . The president is quite popular , and compared to any Republican , he is much popular . That is important . Terrorism can affect his numbers though . Economy is doing good macro economic numbers are much better , people feel it . The third factor is going really bad for the Republicans ? their attempts to rebrand their party . Two years ago , my expectation was that they would use two years to reach out to Latinos , American women and other minority groups . . But in fact they spent the last two years trying to repudiate them . If you look at the Republican voters , 60 percent of them want the most conservative candidate than the most electable candidate .
