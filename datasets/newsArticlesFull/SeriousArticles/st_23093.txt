The ? New York Times writes ? that Hillary Clinton and her campaign are preparing for a primary fight that could stretch into late April or early May and require a sprawling field operation in states and territories from Pennsylvania to Guam . That s one to way look at it . Here s another way : If she wins Iowa , Clinton will be set up to separate herself from Bernie Sanders in South Carolina and the March 1 primaries ? after which her campaign can start to focus on the general election . But if she loses Iowa , then , yes , a highly competitive Democratic race will extend into April and May . And that s not all ? panicky Democrats will become even more nervous , Joe Biden s phone will ring , Michael Bloomberg s phone will ring , too . Make no mistake , Bernie Sanders isn t going away . But if you assume , one way or another , that Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination , Iowa will determine whether she gets it the easy way or the hard way . So on the Democratic side , no contest will be more impactful than the Iowa caucuses , which are now less than two weeks away .
