Pope Francis will visit three African countries Kenya , Uganda and Central African Republic . These countries were specifically chosen among other reasons because they present in varying degrees the many faces of African Christianity strong faith traditions , exponential growth in membership and in vocations to the priestly and religious life , a strong affinity to the traditional teaching on marriage , sexuality , authority , and sacramental life . Some other features of African Christianity which are all too evident in these countries are a dynamic translation of biblical and traditional teaching into African cultural grammar and maps of the universe and a rise in African Charismatic and Pentecostal healing ministries and popular religious movements with new Christian communities emerging every day in great numbers .
