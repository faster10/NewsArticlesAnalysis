Right now , this is a measure US software companies want . ? That s because we make most of the mass market software in the market . ? But that s likely to change , especially given the ease of entry into smart phone app markets . ? We re going to want protection against the introduction of malware into such software . ? The question of source code inspection is a tough one . ? If other countries can inspect US source code , they ll find it easier to spot security flaws , so the US government would like to keep other countries from doing that . ? But I doubt US security agencies are comfortable letting Vietnam write apps that end up on the phones of their employees without the ability to inspect the source . ? In short , this is a tough policy call that is likely to look quite different in five years than it does today .
