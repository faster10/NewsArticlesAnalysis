I have only to look at the news of the past several months to see how unchecked messages of hatred manifest themselves into acts of violence . The growing number of attacks against mosques in places such as Joplin , Missouri , and the killings in August at the Oak Creek , Wisconsin , Sikh temple are the extreme end of a growing domestic threat against religious minorities . Here in New York , hate crimes surrounding Muslim religious services and at a Holocaust memorial site have been committed . These acts of hatred are not individual tragedies but for all of us as Americans .
