The former secretary of state has little incentive to toss verbal bombs . When asked to describe the differences in the race , she typically says there ' s little that separates Democrats on policy compared to a jumbled Republican race . Clinton doesn ' t want to alienate the loyal following Sanders has built among young voters . But Sanders and O ' Malley appear more inclined to highlight their differences with Clinton , including the Keystone XL pipeline ( they opposed it , she avoided the issue and then opposed ) , the Trans Pacific Partnership ( they oppose it , she eventually got there ) and the federal minimum wage ( they want 15 an hour , she ' s for 12 an hour ) . Look for Clinton ' s recent comments in New Hampshire about " illegal immigrants " and her past support for a border fence to play a factor in the discussion .
