NEW DELHI : It was little over 5 . 30 am on Friday . Scores of reporters and onlookers could be seen virtually at every nook and corner of the Delhi airport from T3 to airport ' s technical area to terminal 1D , they were all waiting for underworld don Chhota Rajan ' s arrival . Half of them had been up all night . And with clippings of Bali cops parading Rajan like a local criminal fresh in their minds , some of them even fancied their chance of having a brief chat with the don upon his arrival .
