" The Artist " isn ' t actually a silent film per se , as it has a score and well , I won ' t spoil it for you , but Hazanavicius ' use of sound is ingenious . However , for all intents and purposes , it is silent . For the actors , there was very little difference , as they still speak their lines , we just don ' t hear them , but for the audience , the change is immeasurable . Instead of watching their faces almost exclusively , we find our eyes drifting across the screen and noticing things that perhaps we might not have noticed otherwise .
