The census , and many economists , use a wonky metric called the " Gini coefficient " to measure how income is spread across a particular society or geography . A rating of zero means a society is perfectly equal or that everyone has the same level of income . A rating of one means that literally all the income falls into the hands of one man or woman . East Carroll Parish had a rating of 0 . 67 in 2011 , which was the most recent data available when I traveled to the parish . Now , its rating is 0 . 50 , which isn ' t that much higher than the U . S . Gini coefficient , which is 0 . 47 , according to the census .
