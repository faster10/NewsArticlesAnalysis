Lessig , who lately has been working to organize a movement for a new constitutional convention , is disillusioned with both right and left and blasts away at them for essentially selling the republic out . But his charge is not that politicians in Washington are taking money on the side , la Spiro " Pass the Bags " Agnew . He doubts much of that goes on today . Rather , he is deeply troubled by what he calls " dependence corruption " the degree to which politicians have become dependent on money from lobbyists in order to pay for their campaigns , and the ways in which that dependence has increasingly distorted public policy in ways that do serious harm to the country , while also ( and just as perniciously ) undermining public trust .
