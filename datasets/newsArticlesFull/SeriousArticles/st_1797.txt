Coca and Caesar performed skits that satirized the everyday marital spats , inane advertising , strangers meeting and speaking in clich s , a parody of the Western Shane in which the hero was Strange . They staged a water logged spoof of the love scene in From Here to Eternity . The Hickenloopers husband and wife skits became a staple . ' The chemistry was perfect , that ' s all , ' Coca , who died in 2001 , once said . ' We never went out together we never see each other socially . But for years we worked together from 10 in the morning to 6 or 7 at night every day of the week . What made it work is that we found the same things funny . '
