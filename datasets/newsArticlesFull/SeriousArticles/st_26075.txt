It ' s so hard for me to even acknowledge America without talking about race and recent issues you know , the genocide of the Indians and the incredible flight from slavery to modern days . If you look at our society , if you look at the prisons , if you look at the poverty and which side of the line the majority of people are , we have to acknowledge how we divide ourselves up , that there ' s racism alive in this country . And it ' s not in the law . It ' s in our minds . And that ' s what we have to actively battle .
