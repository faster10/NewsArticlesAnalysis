My kids ( not to brag ) are both honors students but that ' s in part because we spend more like 1 , 000 yr on books , not 100 and we have spent way more than 1 , 000 on tutors and other educational experiences and we ' ve gone on trips that have broadened their horizons and they ' ve had the best health care ( my oldest daughter was premature ) and we drive the safest cars these are all the tiny ways that the rich are able to give their children every advantage in life over the kids who have just 100 yr to spend on books , etc . ?
