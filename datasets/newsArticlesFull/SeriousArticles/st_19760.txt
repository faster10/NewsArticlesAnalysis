The various Disney World VIP tour options start around 299 per person . But look at it this way : You could pay for theme park tickets for three days ( i . e . , 300 plus a person ) to go on only nine FastPass rides ( plus wait in interminable lines for whatever else you choose ) . Or for roughly the same amount of money , you could buy a ticket for just one day and , for instance , pay for the " Ultimate Day of Thrills VIP Tour " a group experience with a Disney VIP tour guide , lunch at a table service restaurant included plus automatic FastPass admission to 11 of the most exhilarating rides across three Disney World parks .
