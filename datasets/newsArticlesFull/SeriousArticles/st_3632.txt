Despite the album s rejection premise , none of the songs indicate a lowering of standards . The rejections say less about the quality of Sia s writing than they do about the songs fit for the artists Sia had in mind . The tropical party starter Cheap Thrills would have been perfect for Rihanna , but it s ground the Barbadian singer has covered many times before and wasn t isn t interested in revisiting for her new album , Anti . It s not hard , either , to imagine Adele blowing through Alive ? Adele actually co wrote it with Sia before leaving it off her album 25 ? yet her cool and collected belting , impeccable as it is , wouldn t be as moving as Sia s raspy howling . That s the thing about Sia : you can t out Sia her . It s often the singers whose vocal chops don t compare ( Britney Spears , Carly Rae Jepsen ) who avoid Sia karaoke and succeed at making her work their own .
