Dr Martin Luther King , Jr . once said , " Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability , but comes through continuous struggle . " It is strikingly clear that protestors at the University of Missouri focused their efforts with that in mind . The results speak for themselves . Future freedom fighters and soldiers battling for social justice could learn a lesson from those MU students , who spoke out , stopped eating and refused to play , while never invoking violence to make their point . . . a fitting salute to the unfinished business of " making justice for all " a reality .
