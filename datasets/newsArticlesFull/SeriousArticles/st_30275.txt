In 2014 , the RNC formally took control of the debate process , sanctioning up to 12 contests for the 2016 primary season , in response to candidate feedback and the party s 2012 autopsy , which argued that too many debates were distracting and weakened eventual nominee Mitt Romney . The party chose the debate hosts , banishing MSNBC and Bloomberg because of perceived bias , told other networks they wouldn t get debates if particular journalists anchored , and encouraged all of the networks to include conservative questioners . But the party allowed the television networks to maintain control over the format and qualifications for the debate ? both of which have become flash points in the 14 candidate GOP field .
