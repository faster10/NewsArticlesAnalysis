MJ : I love being at the games . I love calling the games . This was a dream of mine as a kid . I would be on the court pretending to be Earl Monroe , Magic Johnson , and at the same time pretending to be Marv Albert calling my moves , and at the same time pretending to call timeout and draw up plays for myself . It was a dream of mine . It ' s an incredible feeling for me to be living it out . I ve known Jeff Van Gundy and Mike Breen over 25 years , they re my family for my life . There s no agenda . When you watch us , what the people hear and see is what people would hear and see if they went out to dinner with us the night before . We aren t putting on an act . We genuinely love each other , and love calling games together . And that s the entire crew . We have a great time .
