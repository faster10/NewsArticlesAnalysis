All the outsider office holders and former office holders have suffered since first Trump , and then Carson surged . Cruz has suffered the least ( falling from 8 . 4 to 5 . 5 ) by aligning himself vocally with Trump , and Rand Paul has suffered the most ( falling from a high of 9 1 down to 2 . ) by emphatically attacking Trump , while Huckabee splits the difference ( falling from a high of 8 . 4 to 3 . 5 ) . This is a clear cut statistical demonstration that ( up to this point , at least ) Donald Trump as someone who s never held office , has redefined what it means to be an outsider , redefining the term as a context that Cruz , Paul and Huckabee have no choice but to accept . It doesn t seem strange at all to argue that in doing so , Trump opened the door for Carson s more recent rise , following the first debate .
