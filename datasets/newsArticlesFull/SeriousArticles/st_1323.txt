New Orleans Saints : One reason why the Saints are so unpredictable : They have the NFL ' s No . 1 ranked offense and No . 31 ranked defense in total yards . They have completed more passes of 20 plus yards than any team in the NFL , but they have given up the most passes of 40 plus yards ( 11 , with six TDs ) . Those big plays are killing them . New Orleans ' defense is on pace to give up the highest opponents ' passer rating in NFL history ( 112 . 0 ) and the highest yards per play average ( 6 . 47 ) since 1961 . The good news for the Saints is Washington ' s 29th ranked offense isn ' t very equipped to exploit their defense . However , I ' ll give the slight edge to the home team in an outdoor game . Redskins 27 , Saints 26 . Mike Triplett
