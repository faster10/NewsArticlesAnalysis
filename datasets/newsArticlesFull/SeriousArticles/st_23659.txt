Kubiak favors the stretch run zone blocking scheme that left the Patriots defense in tatters two months ago , but it would be natural to assume that was because Manning was sidelined and inexperienced Brock Osweiler was running things . It was not . What Belichick reminded his team was that what they saw Nov . 29 , when Denver rushed 32 times for 179 yards and three touchdowns , is what they will see again . . . and again . . . and again . . . if they can t stop C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman .
