Justice Samuel Alito went further , saying the whole broadcast debate may be moot in a few years . " Broadcast TV is living on borrowed time . It is not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight track tapes , " he told the network lawyers . " I ' m sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by Internet . But to the extent they are making money from people who are using rabbit ears ( antennas ) , that is disappearing . "
