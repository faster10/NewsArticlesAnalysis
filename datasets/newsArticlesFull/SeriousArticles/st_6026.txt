And you know what was happening while I was partnering up ? Spring was on the way ! And that meant I could finally break free of my Computrainer bike sessions and hit the road . I was lucky enough to connect with the Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago ( MTC3 ) for a series of novice rides they ' ve been hosting on local trails around Chicagoland . With two falls behind me ( hey , those clips take some getting used to ) , we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born . Riding outside with the wind whipping your face , chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and I ' m looking forward to many more rides outdoors .
