This may be the most demanding part of the job . Imagine not only having to be " on " every moment you were in public , knowing you were being watched ( and probably recorded ) , but to be nice to everyone you encountered . To be required to pretend that you ' re super stoked to meet every yahoo who walks up to you in the airport , that you care deeply about every absurd complaint you get from a constituent , that you ' re awed by every dumb idea a contributor has for revamping your campaign strategy .
