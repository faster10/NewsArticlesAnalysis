The upcoming Republican caucuses in Iowa reveal challenging dynamics within our democracy and a clear distortion relative to Iowa ' s overall voting population . Consistently with past caucuses , we can expect more men to vote than women and a disproportionate percentage of whites to vote relative to minorities , although the white population in Iowa is already close to 92 percent . Caucus voters , on average , have higher average incomes and a higher percentage of college degrees than Iowa ' s general population , which may surprise people who think that poorer , less educated voters are driving the election . And finally , born again and evangelical Christians vote in the Republican Iowa caucuses at double their percentage of Iowa ' s population , 57 to 28 percent , based on results from the last cycle . White , Wealthy , and Born Again may not make a good bumper sticker , but it reflects a particular audience that may feel it has been pushed to the side and now seeks to reclaim a dominant position .
