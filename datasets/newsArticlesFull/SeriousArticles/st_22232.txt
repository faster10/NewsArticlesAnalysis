Amid questions about background checks and security vetting , the administration for the first time this week disclosed new details about how refugees are investigated . The process is directed by the Homeland Security Department and involves the State Department and US intelligence and law enforcement agencies . Refugees submit to in person interviews overseas , where they provide biographical details about themselves , including their families , friendships , social or political activities , employment , phone numbers , email accounts and more . They also provide biometric information about themselves , including fingerprints . Syrians are subject to additional , classified controls , according to administration officials , who briefed reporters this week on condition that they not be identified by name to publicly discuss confidential details about the process . The Associated Press had been seeking details about the vetting process since September .
