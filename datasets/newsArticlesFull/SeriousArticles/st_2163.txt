But The Peanuts Movie ends , unexpectedly , with Charlie Brown victorious . He overcomes obstacles to reach the bus upon which his beloved Little Red Headed Girl is leaving for camp before it departs she tells him she s noticed all the kind things he s done this year she warmly explains , in front of the entire gang , that he has all the qualities she admires . The movie ends on this moment , of Charlie Brown succeeding and having his success recognized by everyone he knows , and even a mid credits sequence of Lucy pulling the football away and Charlie Brown auuughing his way to earth couldn t remove the bad taste from my mouth . Did this film , so careful to hew to the spirit of its source material , betray Schulz ( and us ) in its final moments ? Is a Charlie Brown story with a happy ending really a Charlie Brown story ?
