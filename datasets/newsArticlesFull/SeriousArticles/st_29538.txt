DeRegnaucourt : When my son was 6 years old , the school system that he was in in Georgia , it did not allow the teacher to take her planning days unless she could find a volunteer sub . She had to ask for parental volunteers . I told her at the beginning of the year , ' I work at night . I ' ll take every single one of your days . I can substitute for you . ' I really enjoyed working with the kids . Then I read an article in the paper , and it said that ( most ) boys get the same educations as their mothers . I had not gone to college . I wanted my son to be college educated . It was time for me to go back to school .
