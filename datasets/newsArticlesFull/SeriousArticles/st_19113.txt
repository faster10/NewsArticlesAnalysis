Jitan Ram Manjhi was a part of the JD ( U ) and made the Bihar chief minister less than a year earlier . Later , he was asked to quit the seat for former CM Nitish Kumar . Notably , Kumar had resigned from the post after his party fared poorly in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections . Manjhi was installed as the CM , but now Kumar wanted his post back . However , Manjhi s reluctance to quit led to his expulsion from the party . The Bharatiya Janata Party then announced its decision to back Manjhi in a vote of confidence . Albeit Manjhi could not muster enough support to retain power , yet his closeness to the BJP indicated a tough time ahead for the JD ( U ) .
