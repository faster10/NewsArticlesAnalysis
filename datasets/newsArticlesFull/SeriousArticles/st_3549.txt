Mark ( John Hawkes ) is a 36 year old virgin and impatient to do something about it . But he ' s also a good Catholic , which complicates matters . And then there ' s his domestic situation : he spends most of the day horizontal , in the iron lung , a cylinder that looks a bit like a torpedo tube , that helps him breathe . Since he was struck with polio as a child , Mark can ' t survive outside this apparatus for more than four hours at a time and even then requires a gurney to get about . He tries not to let it cramp his style , but this is not a lifestyle conducive to courtship and seduction .
