Like " La Danse , " the new film dedicates most of its running time to rehearsal and performance , interspersed with sometimes tense exchanges behind the scenes involving the creative personnel ( in this case , primarily director choreographer Philippe Decoufle ) and management ( managing director Andree Deissenberg ) . The " artistes " always want more time , and the shareholders are invariably fixated on the bottom line . Which is understandable at the Crazy Horse , where dancing cheek to cheek means something very different from what Irving Berlin had in mind . ( Or did he ? )
