Neither Julian Edelman nor Danny Amendola could unshackle themselves from Denver s quick , agile corners . The shallow cross all but disappeared , as did yards after the catch . Taking Edelman out of the equation was a major part of Wade Phillips plan , leaving Brady holding the bag or holding his head . Amendola clearly was hurt and was subpar . His toughness was on display when he recovered from several big hits , but even when he tried to dive for a first down after making a nice catch , he came up short . Same was true for Edelman when Brady threw him a critical fourth and 1 pass off motion designed to fool Denver s defense . Instead , corner Chris Harris peeled off his man as soon as Brady threw and leveled Edelman for no gain . That s basically how it was for the receivers : no gains .
