2 , DL Frank Clark : With Bruce Irvin out with a knee injury , the Seahawks will use Clark , and maybe to a lesser extent Cassius Marsh , to fill the void as a pass rusher in nickel situations . Clark was a pre season standout , but so far has been quite in the regular season with eight tackles , no sacks and one quarterback hurry . Coach Pete Carroll said this week , though , that he is happy with the way Clark has progressed and excited to see him get a bigger role against the 49ers . Clark likewise said he is looking forward to knowing he should have a bigger role and confident he will come through . Seattle dominated the 49ers up front the first game , getting a season high six sacks , so Clark should get some opportunities to make some plays .
