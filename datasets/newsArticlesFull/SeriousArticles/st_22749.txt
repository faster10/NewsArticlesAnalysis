But if the number of land trusts is growing ? from 242 in 2011 to 280 today ? it is hard to argue that they are yet a substantial part of the solution . No other organization has come anywhere close to the success enjoyed by the Champlain Housing Trust . In hot markets like Boston and Seattle , it is very difficult for fledgling nonprofits that lack municipal support or established funding mechanisms to obtain expensive land . The dozens of newly created community land trusts are more likely to emulate Boston s Dudley Neighbors Inc . , which focuses its activity in one neighborhood , or Seattle s Homestead , which after 22 years has 191 units of housing scattered across the city . And those may be the best case scenarios .
