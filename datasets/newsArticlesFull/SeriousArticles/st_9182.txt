When the people who make the show possible appeared onstage to collect the award for Favorite Network TV Comedy , it was Cuoco who spoke for the group . " Thank you so much , " she said as Galecki came up behind her and whispered something in her ear . " Johnny just told me to keep it clean . If you would have told us after nine seasons we would be on this stage again , I don ' t think any of us would have believed it . This is been an unbelievable ride and it ' s all because of you fans who have voted and watched our show . Thank you , thank you , thank you ! "
