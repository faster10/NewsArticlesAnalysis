Storm : I had to have a silver patch . It was a huge silver patch , so I was all . . . patched up from like here to here . My hands were bandaged . But the body is . . . incredible . You know , what it can do . I don ' t think people realize how exhausting it is when it ' s that pervasive feeling of exhaustion when you ' re recovering from burns . It ' s something that ' s still really surprising to me , because I still feel that way . You ' re just so incredibly tired , and then you ' re just . . . you are so sore and then even now . . . my chest is hot and my hands . . . you feel that heat , and you feel the pins and needles feeling , you know , and you feel sensitive . You almost still feel it . It ' s really strange .
