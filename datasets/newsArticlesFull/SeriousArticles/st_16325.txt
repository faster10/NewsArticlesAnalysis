And Newton is worth talking about , too ? not just for the way he plays on the field , which will be dissected and awed over all week . But also for how he carries himself . Which , if you haven ' t figured it out , is a lot like a guy who is hell bent on both enjoying the moment and also being true to his personal definition . In a way , he ' s this generation ' s Joe Namath off the field . Young football fans weren ' t exposed to the fur wearing Namath . Or the always on the town bachelor who was pitchforked by New York fans for having too many distractions . That ' s not to say Newton is that kind of persona . But he carries himself in a way that suggests he ' s going to enjoy playing football and living his life .
