Added Carroll : " We ve tried to find guys that have a sense about them that they can overcome whatever the odds are , and that they re going to hang through anything . And that is demonstrated in the passion that they bring to their pursuits too . It s exactly what we are looking for . We don t care what their number is in the draft class . We just want to find guys that love playing , and they ve got something , and they re not going to be denied . That s really where we ve tried to build a whole crew around that . "
