Referring to the North wanting the South ' s citizens to question the government , Lee said , " They are focusing on trying to pull us apart . For this reason , we need to achieve national unity before taking strong military countermeasures . If we show the North Koreans how steadfastly united we are , they will not dare challenge us . Their intentions will be thwarted . They always have their eyes open to take advantage of any opportunity if they detect any divisiveness in our minds and thoughts . "
