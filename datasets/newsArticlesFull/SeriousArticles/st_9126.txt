Not all New York infrastructure is caught in the same bind . New York ' s acclaimed water system , devised by city engineers in the 19th century to bring water from the Catskills to the growing urban population , remains a model of how service delivery could be done . Well into its second century , it is controlled by the city in a businesslike fashion , its capital program underpinned by the ability to float bonds to secure needed investment . The result is that projects that contribute to the resilience of the city ' s water infrastructure , such as the Third Water Tunnel now under construction , get done purposefully and with minimal political interference .
