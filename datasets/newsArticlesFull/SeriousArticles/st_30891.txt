The National Broadband Map , says the telecommunications administration , " includes more than 25 million searchable records showing where broadband internet service is available , the technology used to provide the service , the maximum advertised speeds of the service and the names of the service providers . Users can search by address to find the broadband providers and services available in the corresponding census block or road segment , view the data on a map or use other interactive tools to compare broadband across various geographies , such as states , counties or congressional districts .
