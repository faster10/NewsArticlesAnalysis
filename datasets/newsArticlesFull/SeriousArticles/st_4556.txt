There is plenty of room for debate over which Democrat has the strongest approach to climate change ? and over what s lacking in Clinton s plans . O Malley isn t the only Democrat who s been itching to engage in that debate on a national stage . ? As Sanders s campaign spokesman Michael Briggs pointed out last week , ? Clinton has steered clear of some of the most controversial issues in energy policy today : methane from natural gas , drilling on federal lands , and whether to approve future pipeline projects . What s taking so long ? Is there a pattern here ? he asked , noting Clinton s four year silence on how she viewed the Keystone XL pipeline , broken only in September when she finally came out against it . ? These are among the important questions for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire . Does Secretary ? Clinton ? oppose the Bakken crude oil pipeline that cuts through Iowa and three other states ? What s her position on the Northeast Direct pipeline in New Hampshire ?
