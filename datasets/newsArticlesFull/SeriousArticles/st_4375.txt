For instance , in many cases the Internet subscriber might have no knowledge of the infraction that the ISP detects . A houseguest might log onto one ' s home network simply to check e mail . Because his sharing software might be running in the background ( even when he ' s not downloading files himself ) he is in effect sharing his own movie files wherever he goes . Your ISP sniffs the packets , so you are nabbed . The same is true for those of us who run " open networks " so that neighbors and others nearby can get free Internet access when they need it . ( In the old days , that used to be considered polite . )
