I answered the question from the floor in a very different spirit . I said that we all know that the job that the man at the checkout counter was doing can now be done by a machine . But until he is replaced by a machine , I think he should be treated as a person , with all the rights of a person . And that includes a bit of human exchange , since that is clearly what makes his job tolerable for him , makes him feel that in his job , this job that could be done by a machine , he is still a human being .
