John Sutter : Hi Will , So the U . S . Supreme Court is hearing two cases on same sex marriage this week one on California ' s ( Proposition ) 8 , which bans same sex marriage and one on the federal Defense of Marriage Act . Regardless of how the justices rule on these issues , I ' m pretty sure 2012 or 2013 will be remembered as the " Year of the Gay . " Republicans , business leaders , the president everyone seems to be coming out in favor of LGBT rights . The culture shift ( in most parts of the country ) has been incredible . How did that happen so fast ? It used to be political suicide . . .
