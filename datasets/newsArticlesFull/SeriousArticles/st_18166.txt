Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation and as few of the English understand the German Language , and so cannot address them either from the Press or Pulpit , tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they once entertain Not being used to Liberty , they know not how to make a modest use of it I remember when they modestly declined intermeddling in our Elections , but now they come in droves , and carry all before them , except in one or two Counties In short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other colonies , as you very judiciously propose , they will soon so out number us , that all the advantages we have will not in My Opinion be able to preserve our language , and even our Government will become precarious .
