This shift has found expression primarily in how Cruz talks about the Islamic State . His new favorite bit of chest thumping is his boast that he will utterly destroy the terrorist group . We will carpet bomb them into oblivion , he says . I don t know if sand can glow in the dark , but we re going to find out . There are a couple of ways to interpret this , neither of which is ? particularly flattering . Sand glowing in the dark could be taken to mean that Cruz is suggesting the use of nuclear weapons , which would be the worst idea anyone has ever proposed . You could be charitable and say Cruz isn t so crazy that he d consider starting a nuclear war against a terrorist group , but I don t know what else to make of the glowing remark .
