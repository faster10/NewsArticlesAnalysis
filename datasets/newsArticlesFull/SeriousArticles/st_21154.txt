The first few minutes of The Hateful Eight ? ? ? ? unfolding through sweeping shots of mountains , forests , and barren lands , showered with hesitant snowfalls ? ? begin unlike any previous Tarantino film . After the panoramic shots , the camera gradually settles on , what initially looks like , an anthropomorphic part of a tree , but as it keeps framing the object in an unbroken shot , we find out that it ? ? ? s Jesus Christ crucified on Cross . The camera then tracks back a few steps , and at a considerable distance away , a stagecoach , driven by six horses , lumbers into the frame . The stagecoach soon exits the scene , but the camera stays focused on the Cross for a few more seconds . Tarantino is usually not known for quiet , meditative frames like these , but what are big directors without small reinventions ?
