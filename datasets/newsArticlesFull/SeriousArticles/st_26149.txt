" It has to go back to the gatekeepers . The people who have the green light vote , " he said , referring to those studio executives who decide which films get made . " We re not in the room ( with ) the executives when they have these green light meetings quarterly where they look at the scripts , they look who s in it and they decide what we re making and what we re not making . " ?
