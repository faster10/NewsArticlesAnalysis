In the episode ' s final moments , we also discovered that Morgan didn ' t kill the Wolf he knocked out at the end of 602 instead , the hour closed with him trying to reason with the Wolf by telling him the story of his redemption but some seed fell on stony ground , since the Wolf refused to listen , much as Morgan did in the beginning : " I know I ' m probably going to die , but if I don ' t , I am going to have to kill you , Morgan . I ' m going to have to kill every person here . . . Those are the rules , that ' s my code . I ' d say I ' m sorry , but you said it , right ? ' Don ' t ever be sorry . ' "
