Johnson gained a reputation as a keen party goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago . At the time , he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo ' s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women . ' He liked the attention of being a well known footballer and attracting women was not a problem , ' said one local , who did not wish to be named . ' He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home . '
