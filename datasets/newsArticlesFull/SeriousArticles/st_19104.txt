Allen and Dolores Avery had four children : Charles ( or Chuck ) , Steven , Earl , and Barbara , all of whom worked on , lived on , or lived near an Avery owned junkyard in Manitowoc County . And many of the Averys had been in trouble over the years . Before his 1985 conviction , Steven himself had robbed a bar and committed an act of animal cruelty ( specifically , he lit a cat on fire ) ? and some say these charges were glossed over in the series to make Steven a more sympathetic character . As Steven and his siblings grew up , the family members partners , spouses , and children also lived on the lot , allying themselves with , and also sometimes against , other Averys ? this includes people like Barbara s husband Scott Tadych , who testified against Steven , as well as Barbara s sons Bobby and Brendan Dassey .
