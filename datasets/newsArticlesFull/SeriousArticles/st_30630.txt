It is notoriously difficult for surveys to find a representative group of Iowa caucus goers , since turnout on caucus night typically winds up being much smaller than most polls would suggest . But this poll finds even those most dedicated to attending have similar preferences to the larger group of those who say it ' s merely likely they ' ll attend . Among those who say they definitely plan to attend the GOP caucus and are more interested in news about the caucus than any other news ( a group that makes up roughly 7 of all Iowa adults ) , the race looks about the same , with Trump holding a narrow edge over Carson , 31 to 24 ( within the margin of error for a sample of that size ) , with Cruz at 14 and Rubio at 10 .
