On the other end of the spectrum , the Boston Marathon bombing provides an example of a less sophisticated attempt at a Fedayeen style attack . On April 15 , 2013 , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated two bombs along the route of the Boston Marathon , killing three people . Three days later the Tsarnaevs allegedly shot and killed a police officer at the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and in the early morning of April 19 the Tsarnaevs had an intense firefight with police in which Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokhar was wounded and later taken into custody .
