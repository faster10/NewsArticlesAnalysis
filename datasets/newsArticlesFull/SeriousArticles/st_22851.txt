Diplomatic failure would pose difficult questions to the administration . Does it really wish to defeat ISIL at least in Syria , where it is a deeply resented imposed presence or not ? Does it really believe Assad enables and sustains ISIL in Syria or not ? Does it wish to invite for itself or for its successor the obscene possibility of having , in the absence of alternatives killed off by Moscow and Tehran , no choice but to make common cause with the barrel bomber in chief against ISIL or not ? Notwithstanding the president ' s belief that the Vietnam and Iraq wars represent the historical quintessence of American power projection abroad , would he be willing in the time left to him to consider Syria important enough to protect civilians and to prevent Russia and Iran from doing as they please ? If diplomacy fails , surely the alternative revolves around making Russia , Iran , and their client pay heavily for slaughtering Syrians and enabling ISIL . It also means having to go after ISIL in Syria with effective regional and American ground forces , as Assad ' s continued presence will preempt a united Syrian front .
