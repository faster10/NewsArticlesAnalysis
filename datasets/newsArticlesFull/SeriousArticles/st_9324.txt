Bernie Sanders may be an astonishing phenomenon , but what is even more astonishing is how America , including in particular its young , its liberals , its independents , and its progressives , has embraced a figure who was unknown outside the state of Vermont a mere eight months ago ? a figure who , nevertheless , virtually tied with the mighty Hillary Clinton at the Iowa caucuses last Monday ? Hillary s win by a pathetic 0 . 2 percentage point margin is no win and who may very well beat her in the New Hampshire primaries early this week .
