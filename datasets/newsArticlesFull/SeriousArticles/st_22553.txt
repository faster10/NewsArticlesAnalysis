Irvin didn ' t reach the majors until he was 30 , joining the Giants in 1949 , two years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier . Before that he starred with Newark in the Negro Leagues . When the Hall of Fame finally started electing Negro Leaguers in the early 1970s , Irvin was the fourth player chosen , after Satchel Paige , Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard . It probably helped that Irvin worked in the commissioner ' s office at the time and had reached the majors , unlike many of his contemporaries , let alone earlier stars from the 1920s and 1930s such as Oscar Charleston or Turkey Stearnes or Mule Suttles . It certainly points to the regard with which Irvin was held as a player , but there was also an image of him as a player , unlike those from an earlier generation .
