As a result , Russia ' s deployment of advanced surface to air S 400 missiles is of grave concern to Israel . With a radius of 250 miles and the ability to target up to 36 aircraft simultaneously , the S 400 is a potential game changer . One senior Israeli officer went so far as to describe it as a potential " nightmare . " In the event of a serious deterioration in the Israeli Russian relationship , the S 400 could greatly complicate the Israeli Air Force ' s ability to strike weapons shipments en route to Hezbollah through Syria . Israel therefore needs assurances from Russia that the S 400s will not impinge the freedom of movement Israeli jets possess over Syrian airspace .
