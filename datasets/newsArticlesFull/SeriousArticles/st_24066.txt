This searing portrait of West African warfare is a tough watch , largely because we see it unfold from the perspective of a ? child soldier . But that ' s what makes " Beasts of No Nation " powerful . Through bouts of violence emerge glimmers of hope , making the ? ecstasy worth the agony . " Beasts " took several gambles , too : It ' s Netflix ' s first original feature , and it puts first time 15 year old actor Abraham Attah at the film ' s vulnerable center . Both paid off , as did Idris Elba ' s commanding performance as a warlord whose strengths are ? swagger and ego . ? What writer director cinematographer Cary Fukunaga accomplishes in his brutal movie is , actually , anything but . You may ? leave " Beasts " feeling wrecked , but its intensity gives way to the utmost optimism .
