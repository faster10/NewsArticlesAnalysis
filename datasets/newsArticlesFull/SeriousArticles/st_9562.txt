Then the next thing that happened : I was in a helicopter crash . We crashed into a small plane with two young people who were killed instantly . I fell to the ground , and I said , " Why ? " I tried to find God , so I wrote a book , " Climbing the Mountain . " Then the worst accident in my life happened with a tingling across my cheek , and then it developed into a stroke , and I couldn ' t talk , and an actor who can ' t talk is a big problem . But then I wrote the book " My Stroke of Luck " that helped me and helped a lot of other people . That was gratifying .
