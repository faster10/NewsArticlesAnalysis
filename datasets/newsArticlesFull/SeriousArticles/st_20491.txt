Without question . Whatever happens with the Trump candidacy , whether he wins Iowa and New Hampshire and the nomination , or flames out , it has been proven that a Republican candidate can stand up to Fox and survive . His poll numbers , since he began going after Megyn Kelly , have not declined . It s like The Wizard of Oz . We have pulled the curtain back , and he is just a television executive , although a very canny one . There s no way he would ever remain that powerful because his industry is changing .
