Stone s involvement with spreading the lie that Michelle Obama said nasty things about white people is an excellent indicator of ? the perverse conservative psychology behind these attacks on Bill Clinton . One of those truisms of the modern conservative movement is that racism basically ended in 1963 , and therefore any modern accusations of racism amount to nothing more than liberals making stuff up in order to score political points . A corollary belief is that the only people who are victims of racial prejudice these days are white people , a belief that surfaces not just in the myth that there s a tape out there of Michelle Obama saying anti white things ( there isn t ) , but in high profile Supreme Court cases where fears of this mythical reverse racism were used to undermine efforts , successfully in one case , toward racial integration in education .
