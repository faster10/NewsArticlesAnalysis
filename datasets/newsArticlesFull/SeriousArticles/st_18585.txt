He ' s stopped for drunk driving . So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all . All that has to do with immigration law is whether or not they can ask the federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not , and then leave it up to you , " Roberts said to Verrilli . " It seems to me that the federal government just doesn ' t want to know who is here illegally or not . "
