Schulte , from Benton County , attended multiple events this weekend with Cruz , and was particularly impressed to see over a hundred voters packed into a local convenience store for a meet and greet with the senator on Sunday night in Van Horne , a town with a population of less than 700 . Standing behind the cash register , Cruz did a short version of his stump speech , answered a few questions from the crowd , and then mingled , taking selfies with voters where the snack food aisle was apparent in the background . ?
