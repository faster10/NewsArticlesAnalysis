There are also discussions over how to define a worker with a view to reducing welfare entitlements . The British are arguing that EU citizens coming to the UK to work should be self sufficient ? have enough means to support themselves without drawing on social security or benefits . The Germans proposed that a worker be defined as someone earning ? 7 , 000 , whether part time or full time , and that figure be the threshold for benefits entitlement . This is far too low for the British , who wanted the threshold set at almost double that .
