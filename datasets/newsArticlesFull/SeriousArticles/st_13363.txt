We ' re not alone . Organic food , or food grown without synthetic pesticides , fertilizers , antibiotics or hormones , now accounts for more than 31 billion in sales each year . More than 4 of all food sold is organic , and whole industries have sprung up around its production and sale . Most people who buy organic food do so for its purported health benefits . Often , people will claim that it ' s more natural production leads to better nutrition . Others cite pesticides and other substances in nonorganic food as being hazardous to your health . Those who believe this are willing to pay a premium ( and organic food usually comes with one ) for those benefits .
