Scenario A : Could someone sue to try to keep Cruz off the ballot ? Such challenges are unlikely to succeed . A plaintiff must have standing to sue and must show a specific injury rather than a generalized grievance . Voters can ' t just complain that someone , somewhere is violating a law they have to identify an actual harm . Most challenges to candidates ' eligibility end here . Federal courts , for example , threw out dozens of birther challenges to Barack Obama ' s eligibility in 2008 and 2012 because voters sued and failed to identify a concrete injury . So , the courts never had to rule that Obama was actually born in Hawaii .
