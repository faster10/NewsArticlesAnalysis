Will . i . am : Two years ago , I would go up to Seattle and consulted on Natal . That ' s what it was called before they coined it Kinect . Project Natal . So I ' d go up to Seattle and put in all the work , when I finally saw the video game , I ' m like , " Wow , that ' s what I was consulting on ? " And my group got the benefit off of all that flying back and forth . I ' d work with ( Ubisoft ) and say , " Oh , no , the dancing shouldn ' t be like this . We should make it so once I sit down the avatar shouldn ' t turn into a noodle . You got to fix it to like . " And they ' d work on that . And I ' m like , " OK , cool . Also , it should have some type of gesture where the beat slows down and then the choreographer dance guy instructor tells you what you ' re doing wrong . You should have it do that . It should be real . " And they ' d work on that .
