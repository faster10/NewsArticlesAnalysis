By beginning to educate children about sexual abuse we can hopefully open up such conversations to help arm our kids as they grown into adults . We can make it easier for the next assistant coach like Mike McQueary , who testified that he witnessed a child being raped by Sandusky , to immediately take action and call the police instead of second guessing himself and doing nothing to protect the child . We ' ve learned that adults need to be educated as much as children about how to recognize and expose pedophiles .
