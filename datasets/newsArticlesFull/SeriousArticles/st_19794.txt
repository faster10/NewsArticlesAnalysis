Corporate America , it should be noted , shoulders much of the blame for keeping balance at arm ' s length , with increasingly long days and ever tightening limits on vacations , paid leave and other " benefits . " We shouldn ' t have to leave our jobs to achieve balance , and the fact that some do , means that companies need to make real changes . That includes staffing workplaces reasonably , putting workers ' well being on par with profits , showing workers you don ' t expect them to be " on " all the time . Only then will real work life balance start to take shape .
