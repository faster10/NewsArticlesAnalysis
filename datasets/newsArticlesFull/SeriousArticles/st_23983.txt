On one level his England duties outside international windows will have to slip slightly down the list of priorities . Neville did not operate as a hands on scout for the national team , attending Premier League games every weekend with his England cap on like Hodgson and Ray Lewington . Rather , his knowledge of the talent pool was stocked via his role as an analyst with Sky , dissecting games every weekend . He may travel to Spain intent on watching as much Premier League football as he did back in Blighty but he will have opposition teams , and players , to scrutinise as he attempts to haul his new club from ninth back into the upper echelons of the Primera Liga . The good intentions will be there but the hours in the day may be lacking .
