Trump brought in a capacity crowd of nearly 8 , 000 at a rally in North Carolina Friday night and was interrupted 10 times in his 45 minute speech . But the interruptions weren ' t out of praise : the protesters were angry . They strategically stormed the Raleigh , N . C . , venue carrying signs that read " Stop the Hate , We Make America Great " and " Dump Trump , " while others chanted " Black Lives Matter . " Some say that Friday ' s rally in North Carolina may signal the beginning of a new campaign : a public backlash that has been largely visible only online is now manifesting in person . The protestors were activists who planned the protest against Trump on Facebook . In total , they planned 10 separate interruptions in five minute intervals , and strategically dispersed themselves all around the Dorton Arena at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds . Authorities removed about 25 protestors from the event , but no arrests were made : ? Christian Science Monitor
