As the EU referendum approaches , the world economy is not in its best shape . Turmoil on the stock markets has encouraged George Osborne to delay the sale of remaining Lloyds shares Japan has introduced negative interest rates to boost growth . In this context , pro EU campaigners will say the risks of Brexit are too great for Britain to leave . That argument is questionable and divides our nation , of course , but those who sign up to it forget something rather important . Britain leaving may or may not be bad for Britain , but nobody disputes that it would be bad for Europe . Hence the UK enjoys considerable bargaining power right now . David Cameron should use it far more actively .
