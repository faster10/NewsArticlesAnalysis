It ' s become easy to take Tom Cruise ' s skill for granted ( even his fans do ) , but in " Ghost Protocol " he has a pulsating presence , a dynamic mind body fusion . From the moment he gets broken out of a Russian prison cell , only to argue with Benji via video feed as chaotic violence swirls all around him , Cruise energizes the film with his no sweat bravura . He kicks a like an Ultimate Fighting bruiser , he races vehicles like a demon but more than any of that , he invests every line , every situation , with the cleanly intense , fired up concentration of an actor who means it .
