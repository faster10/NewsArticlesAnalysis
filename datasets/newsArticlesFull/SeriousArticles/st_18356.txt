TSA doesn ' t profit from any of the collected items , officials said . Travelers have the option to save their prohibited items by transferring the object to their checked luggage or placing it in their car . Passengers can mail the objects back to themselves if there is a post office nearby . But 90 percent of passengers , who are in a rush to catch a flight or don ' t want the hassle of leaving the security line , just give the items up , says Shekia Gay , a TSA security officer in Atlanta .
