" Any hitter would tell you that it ' s to their advantage when you ' re basically seeing three of the same people back to back days , " Royals hitting coach Dale Sveum told NJ Advance Media . " Pretty much the same velocity , the same breaking balls , they all throw their secondary for strikes and they use it . So I think it ' s always to any hitter ' s advantage . I know if I played and I faced Roger Clemens three days in a row , the third day it should be easier . It ' s not going to be that easy but it ' s going to be easier . " ? ?
