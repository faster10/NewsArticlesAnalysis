It now appears that three suicide bombers had planned to blow themselves up inside the stadium , causing carnage and then probably a fatal mass stampede on primetime French and German TV . This was the French team s biggest football match of 2015 , which is presumably why Isis scheduled its attacks for November 13 . For 14 years I have sat through major sports events expecting a terrorist attack , most of all during the London Olympics of 2012 . Big sports matches are the most watched TV programmes and , therefore , irresistible to terrorists .
