What to watch : ? This is the third consecutive year both No . 1 seeds reached the Super Bowl . Prior to 2013 , that had only happened three times since the NFL adopted the current seeding system and the 12 team playoff format in 1990 . . . . ? Carolina ' s opportunistic defense has been bleeding talent with DE Jared Allen , CBs Charles Tillman and Bene Benwikere all injured in recent weeks and now Davis and Harper in doubt . However the Panthers know they ' ll have Kuechly and all pro CB Josh Norman , two of the best pass defenders in the game . Both could victimize Manning , particularly Kuechly , given the 39 year old quarterback can ' t make the array of throws he did when he was younger , especially deep downfield and outside the numbers . . . . But much of the Super Bowl ' s focus will also be on the Panthers ' No . 1 scoring offense their 500 points were 145 more than Denver against the Broncos ' top ranked defense , which allowed the fewest yards this season , the fewest passing yards , the fewest rushing yards per attempt ( 3 . 3 ) and recorded the most sacks ( 52 ) .
