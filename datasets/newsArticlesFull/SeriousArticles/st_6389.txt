We are not big fans of the federal government . ( Example : The National Labor Relations Board recently tried to prevent Boeing from building a multibillion dollar plant in Charleston that would create thousands of jobs because the board ' s counsel said Boeing was punishing workers in Washington state for union activity the NLRB has since dropped the case . ) But I would be lying if I said the majority of South Carolina GOP voters are strongly anti government . Most here think there is a role for the government , but we disagree on just how big it should be .
