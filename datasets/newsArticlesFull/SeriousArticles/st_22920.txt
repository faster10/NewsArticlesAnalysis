If Mr Cameron is serious about wanting the UK to remain part of the EU , a good starting point would be for him to begin communicating with the British public about the enormous benefits to the environment that have derived from EU legislation , rather than proposing measures which will jeopardise those benefits . Those with influence must ensure that the final deal between Mr Cameron and the rest of the EU , which is expected to be done later this month , should not include deregulatory targets that would undermine the safety net of environmental and social protection standards . Industry should not be left with a free rein to pollute under the tenuous pretext of job creation . The real result would be heavy bills for the taxpayer to clean up environmental damage and an open door for more scandals such as that which resulted from the over cosy relationship between regulators and Volkswagen .
