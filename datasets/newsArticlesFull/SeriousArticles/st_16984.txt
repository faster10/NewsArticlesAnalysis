Mel Kiper states that the Tennessee Titans will pass on selecting an offensive lineman and instead pick Ohio State defensive end Joey Bosa with the first overall selection . It is surprising news that the first NFL mock draft doesn t have the Titans selecting Ole Miss offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil . Titans starting quarterback Marcus Mariota needs more protection on the offensive line , which seemed to forecast that the team would look to either Tunsil or Notre Dame offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley . Tunsil falls to the San Diego Chargers with the No . 3 pick in his projections .
