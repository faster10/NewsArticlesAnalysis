Joel Kotkin : There ' s going to be a very diverse minority population with large amounts of interracial marriage . What we ' ll see is that the Anglo Saxon population will no longer be the majority . I believe the mixed race population will grow the fastest because compared to the past , interracial relationships are increasingly tolerated and considered OK by a large percent of the younger generations . It ' s no longer strange to see a black and white couple at a restaurant together today . Yet someone visiting from the 1960s would be shocked .
