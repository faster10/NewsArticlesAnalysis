It ' s the classic dilemma : Should you buy the best fare you see today or wait because the price might go down ? Here ' s how to come up with an educated guess .

If the chart says that the average fare for your route is much higher than the fare you ' re seeing today , then you should probably book the ticket because it ' s cheap relative to historic prices .
