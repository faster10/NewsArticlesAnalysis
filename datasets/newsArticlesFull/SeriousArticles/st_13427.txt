When Dr King warned us about the shameful desire to maintain the status quo in the face of injustice , he was talking about the schools in Detroit . The status quo for Detroit children has been reduced to dreadful . The talk out of Lansing has turned to punishing teachers for staging sick outs . Lansing would be better served addressing the broken promises handed down to Detroit and Flint children . Our government should be answering the pleas of professional educators and concerned parents , rather than taking out their misguided angst on the people who have stepped up to help Detroit children .
