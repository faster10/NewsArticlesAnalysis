MARCO RUBIO GOES ALL IN ON GUNS FOLLOWING DEBATE . Florida Sen . Marco Rubio seems to be doubling down on gun control following the most recent Republican presidential debate . In New Hampshire on Friday , Rubio stopped by a gun store for a bit of retail politics . He later held a rally at Sturm , Ruger Co . , a firearms manufacturing company in Newport , where he was gifted a rifle . My wife and I , we ' re gun owners , he told the company s employees . This our first rifle in our home . It will be a nice addition . According to ABC s INES DE LA CUETARA , Rubio said they feared President Obama or his administration making it harder for " law abiding people like them " to buy guns , something he also mentioned during Thursday ' s debate . http : abcn . ws 1KlalLR
