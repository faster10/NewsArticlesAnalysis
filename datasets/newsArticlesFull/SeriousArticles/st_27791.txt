At this point in the show , the perception of Coster Waldau ' s own character formerly considered a villain is shifting to the point where fans are rooting for him . Since losing his hand , Jaime Lannister has also become more sympathetic , " because it ' s such an obstacle and forces such a change in him . " His speech to Brienne , about how he killed the Mad King to save the city , also changes the meaning of his moniker , the Kingslayer , which had been used as a pejorative . " I think he sees that as his finest moment , " Coster Waldau said . " He did break his vow to protect the king , but there was no way he could not break it . He had to . And he ' s had to live with that choice ever since . "
