The auditor said in a preliminary report that the DEQ should have required Flint to treat its water to keep lead from leaching from service lines into people ' s homes but did not purposely mislead federal officials about the lack of corrosion control . State officials interpreted federal rules to mean Flint could make the transition and then test the new water for lead over two six month intervals to determine potential corrosion treatment . In February , a DEQ water supervisor told the EPA that Flint had a corrosion control program in place . But in April , an EPA official confirmed through another DEQ official that the city was not practicing corrosion treatment , according to emails . The EPA apparently interpreted the word " program " to mean treatment , while the DEQ meant it as testing to determine if corrosion controls would be needed in the future , according to the auditor .
