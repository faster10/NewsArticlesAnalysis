Still , the debate provides Cruz with a prime opportunity to make his closing pitch to Iowans without having to worry about Trump offering a well timed rebuttal or belting out O Canada on stage . Meanwhile , if Cruz can successfully parry any attacks that do come his way , he could win converts among an electorate that loves a winner . Look for him to repeat his one on one debate challenge to Trump to suggest that the GOP front runner isn t as tough as he claims to be , and to argue that his rival s Fox News boycott is just an attempt to wind down the clock before the caucus . ( He ll also be able to tout his evangelical support without having to worry about Trump butting in to hype his own support from the same group . ) Will any of that work ? Maybe ? but it s just as likely that the night provides yet more evidence in support of the idea that you just can t convince a Trump supporter to stop supporting Trump .
