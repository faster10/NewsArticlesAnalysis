Iribe : You just tried Toy Box in which you got to interact with somebody else in that virtual room . There is an avatar that ( stands in for ) a real person and ( that person ) could be 100 miles away . They can be in their room with their Rift and Touch and you can be in your room , and yet you ll teleport into the same virtual space and see each other as though you were together . At that point you re starting to do a lot of social things : you re talking to them , you re playing Ping Pong or shooting objects in the same virtual world . You could be creating the same piece of art . There s going to be a lot of collaborative social experiences with Rift and Touch .
