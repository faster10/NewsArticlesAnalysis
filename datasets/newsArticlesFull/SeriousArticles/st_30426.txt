Advantage Florida familiarity : This angle might hasn ' t gotten a ton of traction because ( and cue up my most coach speak voice ) " the games are won on the field and not by the coaches on the sideline , " but Florida ' s sideline has a ton of insight into Nick Saban ' s team . Not only did McElwain serve as Alabama ' s offensive coordinator from 2008 11 , including the win over Florida in the 2009 SEC Championship Game , but then he was replaced by Doug Nussmeier , now McElwain ' s offensive coordinator at Florida . On the other side of the ball , Florida ' s defensive line is coached by Chris Rumph , who held the same position at Alabama from 2011 13 . Florida doesn ' t look like Alabama yet on the field , but we might be watching a program transitioning before our eyes play against its inspiration on Saturday .
