America should make no apologies . Jonathan Pollard deserves to rot in prison . When he joined the Navy , he took the same oath every member of the military must : " I , Jonathan Pollard , do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that I will obey the orders of the president of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me , according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice . So help me God . "
