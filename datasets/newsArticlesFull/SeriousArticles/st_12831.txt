The sixth game was pivotal . At 15 30 , Williams was clipped in the shoulder off the net cord in another doomed raid , then hit wide for two break points , saving the first after a 19 shot rally , the longest of the game to that point , getting to deuce with an ace . An extended grind through deuce followed ? Kerber drop shotting Williams for the second time in the set , and Williams double faulting again for a fifth break point . When the champion overcooked a forehand , Kerber led 4 2 and stood on the verge of a remarkable unexpected upset .
