I m in a different time zone at the moment , so I can t quite remember ? I think it was 8 p . m . where I am , so maybe about midnight in France . I just arrived where I m staying and I turned on the French radio and I heard about what was happening . So I just sort of started checking on my friends and family through social media , and everybody was saying I m OK . And just because this is what I do , I draw , I reacted graphically , just drawing something spontaneously with pen and paper and then sharing it as a raw reaction . With so much violence and tragedy ? we just want a bit of peace .
