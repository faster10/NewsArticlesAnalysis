Mike Mertz was driving home , an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in Glendale , Arizona . He told me he doesn ' t remember why he didn ' t come straight home from work that day . He thinks that maybe he went for a jog . A trim fifty nine years old , Mertz enjoyed a two or three mile run several days a week . Maybe he was looking for a cheaper gas station than the one on his usual route or was just trying to avoid taking his Saturn over a nasty set of new speed bumps . Whatever the reason , whatever route he wandered , it brought Mertz not to the usual entrance of his townhome complex , but the back driveway . The change in routine may have saved his life .
