Eisenhower called it a wholly enjoyable occasion and was surprised at the size of the gathering , Until I started over I had the picture , which Frank Carlson gave me last summer , of a small Congressional group of Congressmen and Senators who met on a morning each week . I had an idea of coming over to see 20 or 25 or maybe 50 people . I had no idea that our host has such a party as this . I do hope I may speak for all of you in thanking him for such a breakfast , the like of which I have not had in 10 years . As long as you feed me grits and sausage , everything will be alright .
