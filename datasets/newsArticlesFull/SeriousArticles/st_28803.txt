Deborah Hussey ( 1985 ) : Hussey was the common law stepdaughter of Bulger partner Flemmi . Flemmi testified that Bulger strangled the 26 year old woman , and another witness testified that he saw Bulger strangling her as her eyes rolled back into her head . Bulger ' s defense countered that Flemmi had molested Hussey when she was 17 ( at act that Flemmi maintained happened twice and was consensual ) , and that Flemmi was responsible for Hussey ' s death . " You murdered your stepdaughter , " defense attorney Hank Brennan charged in his questioning of Flemmi . " In the eyes of the law , yes , " Flemmi responded , " but physically no . "
