These atrocities are not difficult to carry out as they are directed against civilians or prisoners who cannot defend themselves . The destruction of a Russian plane by a bomb is in keeping with Isis tactics . The fact that the group has not formally claimed responsibility is not a sign that it did not make the attack . It has not yet claimed two suicide bombings in Turkey , the first at Suruc in July , which killed 32 young Turks bringing aid to Kobani , and a second in Ankara on 10 October that killed 102 people demonstrating for peace . The attacks may have had the more subtle intention of deepening hostility between the Turkish state and the Kurdish minority .
