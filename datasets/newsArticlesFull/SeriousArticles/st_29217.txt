The agency reminded the public that Cooper was no expert skydiver . " We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper , perhaps even a paratrooper , " said Special Agent Larry Carr in 2007 . " We concluded after a few years this was simply not true . No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch black night , in the rain , with a 200 mile an hour wind in his face , wearing loafers and a trench coat . It was simply too risky . He also missed that his reserve chute was only for training and had been sewn shut something a skilled skydiver would have checked . "
