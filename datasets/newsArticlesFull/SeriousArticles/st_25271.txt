Okay , you ' re not an idiot . You know enough not to badmouth your employer or co workers on your personal Twitter account . So you create a fake Twitter account . Genius , right ? ! Well , just ask Jofi Joseph , a former senior National Security Council staffer who did just that . Joseph created an anonymous Twitter account and leveled criticism at co workers and even his superiors . He was discovered and fired . Honestly , how can a guy who works with the NSC not realize that the NSC could figure out who he was ? !
