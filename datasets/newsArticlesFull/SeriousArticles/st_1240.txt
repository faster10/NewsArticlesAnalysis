Toby Perkins , Labour ' s shadow small business minister , said : ' The truth is that ministers have blocked Labour ' s plans to back small business by tackling late payment and to deal with unfair and uncompetitive treatment of suppliers . They ' ve opposed our plans to cut then freeze business rates , and at a time when net lending to small and medium sized businesses has fallen by 1 billion in the last quarter , they ' ve opposed our plans for a proper British Investment Bank supported by a regional network .
