A sane person might argue that the president and his family require special protection because they face threats the rest of us don ' t . But the NRA and many of its most fervent supporters don ' t see it that way . As far as they ' re concerned , all of us are just as threatened as the person in the Oval Office . The fact that you ' re an ordinary person and not the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth doesn ' t mean you haven ' t already been targeted by an al Qaeda death squad or a murderous drug gang , so you ' d better be prepared , not just with a gun but with an entire arsenal of military style weaponry .
