Okay Charlie , at this point I am going to assume that you haven t spoken to the Giants Organization about their potential coaching job . But LEAVING NOTRE DAME , your Alma Mater , without having achieved really anything of monolithic proportions like you ve promised us is absurd and unfair . So at this point , I will get on my knees and beg . Don t do it Coach . Don t do it ! Stay and do what you promised your team , your school , the fans , the legacy deserves to be taken to the Promised Land .
