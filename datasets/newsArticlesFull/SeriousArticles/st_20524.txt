" It ' s our job , and it ' s important to realize at the end of the day that it ' s football . There ' s plenty of things that people are going through , battling cancer and sickness and other things that are real adversity . This is adversity in your workplace . It ' s tough , but you have to keep everything in perspective . I have a big faith in the Lord , and I believe that everything happens for a reason . I really do . There ' s a higher plan that I ' m not really aware of right now , but I trust Him and I trust the plan that He has for me , and I ' ll continue to do my best . "
