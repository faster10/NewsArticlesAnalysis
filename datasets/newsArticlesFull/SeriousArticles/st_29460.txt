DiOrio : I think that because we had a much smaller military at the time , it was more of an allowance that people could have weapons or muskets to raise a militia to defend the country from outside invasion . But in today ' s world , we have a much larger military and the weapons that are available are much more dangerous than the weapons of that time . I would think that the founding fathers would not make as broad of an allowance of individual possession of firearms if they knew what the state of firearms was today .
