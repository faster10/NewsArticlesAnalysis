The Semillas al Viento ( Seeds to the Wind ) farm is located in Isidro Casanova , a poor area in Buenos Aires ' sprawling urban rust belt , where green spaces are few and far between . Five years ago , the football field sized area was overrun with garbage and frequented by criminals , but following a community effort to reclaim it , it now teems with trees , grass and flowers , as well as eggplants , tomatoes , lemons and herbs . There ' s even a small pond where kids and dogs happily splash around .
