Meanwhile , the Texans secondary is led by cornerback Johnathan Joseph ( 5 11 , 188 ) , who shows good closing speed and is among the league leaders in passes defensed with 22 . He s flanked by veteran Kareem Jackson ( 5 10 , 188 ) , a solid cover corner and very reliable tackler , while first round rookie corner Kevin Johnson ( 6 0 , 188 ) ? a competitive player with quick hips and a promising future ? mixes in as the Texans nickel guy . This is a good trio , but the Chiefs No . 1 receiver , Jeremy Maclin , still found room to operate in the first game , catching five passes for 52 yards ? a total that doesn t include a 39 yard gain that was not ruled a catch . The Chiefs left a few big plays to Maclin on the table in that game , especially when Joseph was covering him .
