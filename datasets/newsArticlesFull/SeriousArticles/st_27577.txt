Ultimately , there are more moderate and somewhat conservative voters in the GOP than very conservative voters , so Rubio should be able to consolidate support and create a solid majority . Ironically , his biggest threat may come not from the right but from New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie . The law and order , experienced executive ? if he leapfrogs Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov . John Kasich ? will be formidable and attack Rubio s relative lack of experience . That will be a much more interesting , even fight .
