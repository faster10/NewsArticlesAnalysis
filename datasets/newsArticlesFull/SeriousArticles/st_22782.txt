Marelize , South Africa In the mid ' 90s , Luciano Pavarotti came to South Africa and performed in the town of Stellenboch . It was a very exclusive open air concert . The tickets were very expensive and all the rich and famous in South Africa were there . Next to the stadium is a river that runs through the town . On the night , crowds of people gathered along the banks of the river . Like me , they could not afford the concert . From where we stood we could see the beautiful mountains , see the lights of the stadium and we could not see him , but we could hear his amazing voice . I looked at the people around me , they all had an expression of sheer wonder on their faces . He gave us all a wonderful gift that night . I will never forget it ! He made us fall in love with opera !
