Minnesota Vikings : The Packers haven t lost four consecutive games with Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback since 2008 , and there s a big part of me that thinks he ll find a way to help them turn things around on Sunday . But the Vikings present a bad matchup for the Packers , with their well disguised blitz packages , physical coverage concepts and a running back who has tormented the Packers almost as much as Rodgers has tormented the Vikings over the years . Because Adrian Peterson is playing well , and Rodgers doesn t have all of his weapons , the Vikings win a close one at home to go up two games in the division . Vikings 24 , Packers 20 .
