At Cambodia ' s request , the United States recently filed suit in U . S . District Court against Sotheby ' s in New York , demanding that the auction house forfeit a sandstone warrior that was " illicitly removed , " according to the complaint , from a remote jungle temple .

It has specifically targeted the highlight of its Southeast Asian collection : two kneeling figures that archaeologists declare are companions to the contested Sotheby ' s piece .
