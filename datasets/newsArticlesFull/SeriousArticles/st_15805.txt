Just over three years ago , in what became known as the Bloomberg speech , David Cameron unveiled his plan to renegotiate Britain s terms of membership of the European Union and then hold an in out referendum . The strategy was contingent on his winning the 2015 general election , but he passed that hurdle and commenced the renegotiation . Today we are going to get the draft result , almost certainly paving the way for a referendum in June . It will be the first referendum on Europe in the UK since 1975 and , with Cameron claiming this should settle the issue for a generation , for many voters it could conceivably be the only time they ever get to vote on the matter .
