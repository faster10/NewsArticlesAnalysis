Relying on a new president to replace Obama as the magic recipe for undoing the problem is delusional and is wishful thinking . True , the Republican candidates are chaptalizing Obama for the nuclear deal as a threat to US interests and national security , as they claim . However , they will not rush to overturn the deal or the new rapprochement with Iran , as it has become a reality . What they could do is pressure Tehran to curb its expansionist policies , but this will not happen at least for a year and things could change completely by then .
