Fortunately , it turns out an Asian American superhero of Golden Age vintage actually exists . Back in the early 1940s , one of the few Asian Americans working in comics was Chu F . Hing , who invented the Green Turtle a character he reportedly conceived of as Chinese American . However , with " yellow peril " fears rampant in the years after World War II , Chu was forbidden by his editors to reveal that the Turtle was Asian . In defiance , Chu never drew his Turtle out of costume , and the character quickly fell into obscurity .
