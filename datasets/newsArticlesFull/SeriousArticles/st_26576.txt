It became very serious and by the time I met him he was on a very self destructive path . At first , that was appealing to me , but later I realized I can ' t be with somebody like that because I don ' t want to watch him destroy himself . I didn ' t tell him , " You ' ve gotta clean up your act , " I just said I can ' t deal with this . I discovered you can ' t make anyone stop drinking or stop taking drugs , you have to just protect yourself and if they want to jump on the good train , they will . Fortunately it worked .
