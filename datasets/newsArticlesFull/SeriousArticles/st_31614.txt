The Cavaliers team that will take the floor Tuesday evening at the United Center is an imperfect one . Both of their starting guards , Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert , are out for the foreseeable future , at least through December . Kevin Love will play , but he ' s only seen a week of game action following April ' s shoulder surgery . Timofey Mozgov is still hampered by knee soreness , and Tristan Thompson only just joins the team after his contract holdout kept him out for most of training camp .
