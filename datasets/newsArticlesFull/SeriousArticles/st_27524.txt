The problem with race is that the simple conceptualization of racial problems in American is constantly being framed around the imagery of direct violence by our justice system . It is difficult for non minorities to conceptualize violence as the water we are forced to drink , the violence inherent in a system in which communities of color must constantly make choices between their health and their jobs . We do not see violence in the discussion over the simple fear that if you dare to buy healthy food for your children with government assistance , it will be viewed by the public as an unnecessary luxury . We do not see racism in the persistent failure to recognize black actors yet again by the academy , a movie industry which is viewed by Republicans and Democrats alike as a bastion of liberal ideology .
