Democrats face a similar challenge . They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post Obama age .

Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan ' s record and essentially promised to do more of the same , just in kinder and gentler fashion . Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008 ?
