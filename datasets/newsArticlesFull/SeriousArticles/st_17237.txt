Much the same at the start of this half and all of a sudden , after some careless passing by Silva , Everton drive down the other end of the pitch . Deulofeu sprints clear down the left and has an absolutely ridiculous chance to score inside the box . He opens up his foot and aims for the far corner , but in doing so alerts everyone in the stadium , on TV and even that guy on the moon in the John Lewis ad as to what he ' s going to do , and Caballero saves well . Massive , massive chance wasted .
