For starters , the Baltimore Ravens are obsessed with winning . Literally obsessed . It s a culture that was brought in soon after Owner Steve Bisciotti took over . When the Ravens lose , you can literally feel the disgust oozing out of every member of the organization . They don t like to lose and insinuating that they would even attempt to do it on purpose is almost insulting . For those wondering whether the Ravens would in fact be willing to do such a thing , Coach Harbaugh did his best to put those inquires to rest .
