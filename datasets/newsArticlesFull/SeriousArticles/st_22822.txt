When I moved to Cleveland in 1996 , we had another thing in common . His parents were still here and he avidly followed the news and sports from afar , often asking me about the state high school football and basketball playoffs . After he moved on from Minnesota to a successful stint with the Detroit Pistons , I went to interview his parents at their home in Cuyahoga Heights . There was so much love and pride in their eyes talking about their son the same sort of love and pride in Saunders ' eyes when he talked about the love of his life , his wife Debbie , and their four beautiful children .
