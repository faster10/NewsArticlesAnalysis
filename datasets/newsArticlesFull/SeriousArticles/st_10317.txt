But this is why India must set the narrative straight . We are not climate deniers we are worst impacted by climate change . We are taking action to reduce emissions . India ' s INDC is more ambitious than the US in terms of moving towards non fossil fuels . The US in 2030 , will have only 30 per cent non fossil in its energy mix , we have committed to 40 per cent . The US even today has more per capita consumption of coal and its switch to natural gas means that it is moving away from renewables . The fact is that natural gas is only marginally cleaner than dirty coal . It keeps the US locked into fossil fuels .
