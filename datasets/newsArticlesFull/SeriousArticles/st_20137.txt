Susan eventually stole the limo to get Julie to the hospital Renee and Gaby , who insisted on stopping at Gaby ' s store to get her a dry wedding dress first , were taking too long . Renee and Gaby then had to walk run to the wedding ( security didn ' t recognize Gaby , who was without her work ID ) . Julie gave birth to a healthy baby girl . Susan told the new owner of her house that Wisteria Lane was anything but boring , and she , Julie , Julie ' s daughter , and MJ ( Mason Vale Cotton ) took one last drive around the block . Susan didn ' t know it , but everyone who ' d died , including Mike and Mary Alice ( Brenda Strong ) , was there to watch her go . They were always there , hoping those on the lane would remember that even the most desperate life is wonderful . Of course , the final shot of the finale showed us the new owner of Susan ' s home , a woman named Jennifer , was hiding a secret of her own . Some things will never change .
