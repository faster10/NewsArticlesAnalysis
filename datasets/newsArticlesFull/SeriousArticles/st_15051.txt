Cruz tries very hard to act as though he dislikes McConnell , and there s little doubt that McConnell s own dislike of Cruz is genuine . Cruz has anchored his national political career on conservative rejection of McConnell and all he supposedly represents : spineless congressional leadership , the RINO establishment , funding the federal government in a timely manner , etc . So when McConnell was asked whether the Senate would pass a resolution confirming Cruz s eligibility for the nation s top office , as the chamber did on a bipartisan basis for Panama born Sen . John McCain in 2008 , credit McConnell for not laughing out loud . I just don t think the Senate ought to get into the middle of this , McConnell said Sunday . These guys will all slug it out in Iowa and New Hampshire . We ll have a nominee hopefully by sometime in the spring .
