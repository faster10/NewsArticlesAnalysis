Recently , the United Nations humanitarian agency , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , or OCHA , launched a plan to help displaced persons in Iraq , requesting 1 . 6 billion and noting that " early contributions are essential with the onset of winter . " But even if it raises funds , it is unlikely that OCHA or its humanitarian partners will be able to reach the people who most desperately need help in time to save them . The U . S . and Iraqi governments are supporting displaced people in relatively safe areas , but will they be able to reach the 40 families I met or others in hazardous conditions in time to save them from freezing or starving to death this winter ?
