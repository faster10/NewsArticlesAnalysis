Dave dug deep in search of the Cicero within . No joy there . But I chose to go about it in a calm and measured way , he said . So calm and measured that he has managed to negotiate almost everything the EU was already quite happy to concede . We ve got an emergency brake on benefits to migrants , he said . It s a very special emergency brake . It s an emergency brake that will last for X and only if Y and Z also happen . And what were X , Y and Z ? Dave couldn t say , because the other 27 countries hadn t yet agreed on the exact definitions of both emergency and brake . In mathematical terms , it s known as the Cameron conjecture .
