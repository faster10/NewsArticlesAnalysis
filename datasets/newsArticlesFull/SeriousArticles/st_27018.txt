The grayzone is critically endangered , rather on the brink of extinction . Its endangerment began with the blessed operations ofSeptember 11th , as these operations manifested two camps before the world for mankind to choose between , a camp of Islam ? without the body of Khil fah to represent it at the time ? and a camp of kufr non believers ? the crusader coalition . Or as Osama Bin Laden said , The world today is divided into two camps . Bush spoke the truth when he said , Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists . Meaning , either you are with the crusade or you are with Islam
