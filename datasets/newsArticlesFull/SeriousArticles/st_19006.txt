Though Rajan s core criminal gang had been eliminated , and all his key aides were either dead or had ditched him , he has a widespread network in the city and outside . Intelligence agencies for long had known that he was running his business interests in Mumbai through his wife and other close relatives and some associates . They estimate that he has a key role in construction activities in Chembur and nearby areas . It is not a defunct company . It still is a profitable operation , an officer said of the Rajan gang . He will gain in strength once he is back in India .
