The Rosetta radar experiment will reveal for the first time how a comet is put together . We need to know these things so that we can protect the Earth and humanity from comets , which have hit the Earth many times in the past . Rosetta is an engineering marvel , as are the MESSENGER and Dawn spacecraft returning important information from Mercury and the asteroid belt . All these missions enlighten humanity about our cosmic neighborhood . We take ownership , and by making it " our " solar system , we set the stage for humans to venture beyond the Earth Moon system . That is the path to a positive future for our species .
