To be sure , the first " Star Wars " was a breath of fresh air , a fun flick for sci fi geeks . But the series quickly ossified , a victim of its own success . Only two of the films " Star Wars " and " The Empire Strikes Back " show any originality . The rest tread water , give the hardcore fans the same old , same old . I mean , how many light sabre duels can you sit through before you ' re bored out of your skull ? How many outer space dogfights ? How many seemingly profound Yoda esque thoughts ?
