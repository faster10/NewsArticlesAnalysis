Faulkner was no stranger to Hollywood himself , signing a series of contracts in the ' 30s and ' 40s to write for various studios . He was credited with six screenplays , including the adaptations of Ernest Hemingway ' s " To Have and Have Not " and Raymond Chandler ' s " The Big Sleep . " His love hate relationship with the movies was parodied in the Coen brothers ' film " Barton Fink " through the character of W . P . Mayhew , a hard drinking Southerner hailed by the title character as " the finest novelist of our time . "
