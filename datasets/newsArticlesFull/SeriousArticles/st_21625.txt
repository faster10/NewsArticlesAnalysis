Manning deserves a lot of credit for making it this far with his diminished abilities . He may not get a ring , but he deserves credit . At his peak , he played like winning was all on his shoulders , an individual intent on single handedly winning a team sport . And maybe the weight of that led to his many postseason collapses . But since getting the starting job back from Brock Osweiler , Manning seems to have fully realized the limitations of his body at this stage in his career . He knows the Broncos will bench him if he hurts their chances of winning . And so while he didn t light it up against the Steelers in the divisional round or the Patriots in the AFC title game , he made plays when they were there and , most importantly , didn t lose the game for his defense .
