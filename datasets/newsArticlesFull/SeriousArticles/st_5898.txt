Buffalo Bills : Bills players say they want to win this game for LeSean McCoy , who might have a few reasons of his own for wanting to beat Chip Kelly . But as Thurman Thomas told McCoy this week , the Bills will need to keep their composure . Even though the Eagles just handed the Patriots a loss , they re still a vulnerable team with an average quarterback and a defense that has allowed more than 25 points per game . If the Bills don t hurt themselves , they should win . Bills 28 , Eagles 20 . Mike Rodak
