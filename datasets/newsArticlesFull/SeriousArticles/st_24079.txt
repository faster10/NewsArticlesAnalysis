Brooks : I had five aunts and one uncle on my mother ' s side just on my mother ' s side . Uncle Joe was the only boy . This is crazy , but let me explain . If you were to try to do the story of Uncle Joe the cab driver , and the various celebrities or passengers he picked up , you couldn ' t do it totally and correctly in an hour and a half . And that ' s just Uncle Joe , a cab driver . So how are you going to do Mel Brooks ? I made a movie in Yugoslavia ! Wouldn ' t that be an hour and a half if I just talked about " The Twelve Chairs " and how it came together ?
