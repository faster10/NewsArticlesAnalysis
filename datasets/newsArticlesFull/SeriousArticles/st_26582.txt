However , Hillary Clinton ' s campaign is smarter than some progressives now might think . There are a lot of Democrats out there who are already afraid to dream big . " Look where it got us last time , " they say , " with all those oversold promises of hope and change . " This , combined with " Bernie will never get any of his ideas through Congress , " is indeed a powerful message to practical voters . Hillary ' s basic argument is one of pragmatism , which is a very solid position for her to take ( considering her own and her husband ' s political history ) . When Republicans control Congress ( even just the House ) , it is nearly impossible to pass any truly revolutionary or even progressive changes . This sounds pessimistic , but lots of voters see it as being more realistic than hoping for the pie in the sky of Bernie Sanders ' s platform .
