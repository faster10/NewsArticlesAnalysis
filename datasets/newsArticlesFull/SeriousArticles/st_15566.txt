The second great idea was the chartered monopoly : the corporation . It gave just one firm one friend of the king the authority to do business in a certain industry . The British East India Trading Company , for example , had all rights to cotton in America . A farmer wasn ' t permitted to sell his cotton to neighbors , or to make it into anything . He had to sell it at fixed prices to the company , which shipped it to England and let some other chartered corporation make mittens and hats , which were then shipped back to America for sale .
