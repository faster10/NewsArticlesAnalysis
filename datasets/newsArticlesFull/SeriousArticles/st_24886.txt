Climate change is critical to me because I m a parent I feel a sense of responsibility to the future . I m not going to be around to see its worst effects , which are going to be hitting in the 2030s , 40s , 50s , but my kids will . Everybody is always talking about droughts and sea level rise , but when human civilization with more crowding and greater resource depletion is under that much stress , it translates into wars and huge displaced populations . The Syrian refugee crisis is just a first taste of what it s going to be like . I don t want my kids growing up in that kind of world . ? James Cameron , film director
