Turns out that women ' s studies scholars and feminist activists have examined Tel Aviv street names and discovered that the overwhelming majority of them are named for men . While preparing for work , I kept one eye on the television and listened , fascinated , as representatives of women ' s rights groups argued passionately for gender equality in Tel Aviv street naming . They made a compelling case and even the show ' s hosts , who are generally testier than their American counterparts , were convinced . I , too , was impressed , and not only by the discussion , but also by the very fact that it was taking place .
