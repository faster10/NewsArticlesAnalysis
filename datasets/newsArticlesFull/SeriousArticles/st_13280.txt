' She is four years old but she takes everything in and it hurt me a lot when she started asking why I wasn ' t playing , ' he said . ' At first I would say that it was because of my knee injury . But when we played Rayo Vallecano and I was at home watching the game and she asked me why I was not playing . I said : ' ' Daddy made a mistake and they have shown him a red card ' ' . And she said ' ' okay ! ' ' and that was it . There were still a couple more games to play but she never asked me about it again .
