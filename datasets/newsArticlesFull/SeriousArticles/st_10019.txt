Even so , this is going to be a massive company . Even if it comes in at the lower end of the estimated price range , it would almost certainly be the largest listed company in the world , easily overtaking Apple AAPL , 2 . 59 ? , which is currently valued at 537 billion , and Exxon Mobil XOM , 0 . 60 ? , which is valued at 310 billion . In terms of total size , it would dwarf the largest IPO to date , the sale of the Chinese internet giant Alibaba BABA , 3 . 29 ? , which was priced at 170 billion when it listed in September 2014 .
