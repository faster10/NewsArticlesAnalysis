" Girls are learning at the youngest ages that their value comes from how they look , and the definition of attractive is very narrowly defined as being sexy or sassy ( for the younger girls ) , " Orenstein says . " Sexuality is imposed upon them inappropriately , and they are encouraged to define their bodies not by how their bodies feel to themselves , but by how they look to others . This creates vulnerabilities for girls to the pitfalls we worry about distorted body image , eating disorders , depression and unhealthy sexual behavior . "
