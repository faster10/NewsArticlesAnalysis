The mistake being made by all these people is to conflate a tiny minority of political Islamists whose precise ideology has only really emerged in the last 30 years with the entire global and historical community of Muslims . It is true that Islam has never undergone a total Reformation , but it has experienced mini enlightenments . The most celebrated is the Islamic Golden Age ( 750 1258 ) , centered in Baghdad , in which the arts and sciences flourished in a manner that left Dark Ages Europe far behind . ( You can also find humanist poetry and art in Persia and even a small amount of erotica in Northern Africa . )
