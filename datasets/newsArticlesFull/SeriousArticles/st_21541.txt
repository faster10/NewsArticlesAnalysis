The Redskins sacked opposing quarterbacks 14 times in the last three games , but only dropped Rodgers once on Sunday , albeit for a safety . The Packers offensive line was hurting , particularly without left tackle David Bakhtiari , but the Redskins could not generate sufficient pressure throughout the game . The Packers allowed 13 sacks in the previous two games and Rodgers was sacked the second most in the league this season . Meanwhile , the Redskins offensive line , which has been sharp in pass protection this season , allowed Cousins to get sacked six times .
