When an aide used the phrase leading from behind to describe the U . S . role in toppling Muammar Gaddafi , Obama should have said that after Iraq any U . S . led invasion would be bad for everyone . When he first took flak for avoiding the root word Islam when discussing terrorists , he should have said that by widening the war George W . Bush made himself Osama Bin Laden s tool ? and that he was determined not to repeat the mistake . When they went after his claim that ISIS had been contained , he should have elaborated . ISIS has recently shrunk a bit , but ISIS is more than the land it controls and jihad is more than ISIS . It s why neither can be snuffed out on a battlefield . It was a perfect teaching moment , if he only remembered that in answering his critics he spoke not just to them but to all of us .
