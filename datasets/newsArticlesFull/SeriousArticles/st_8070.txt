One interesting aspect of New York in particular is that it is a leading capital for advertising , art , broadcasting , fashion , finance , food , journalism , music , publishing , theater , etc . This means that every year , young people from all over the world with very different backgrounds , interests and ambitions descend on the city . They are all looking to establish connections ( in the E . M . Forester sense as well as the networking sense ) , which provides the city with a unique chemistry . This , too , is a Manhattan reality that has persisted for generations .
