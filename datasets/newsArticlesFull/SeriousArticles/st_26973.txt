We were one of the lucky families our daughter survived , when so many others did not . Eleven of the 17 students in her classroom were killed , along with her professor . A classmate dialed 911 when they first heard the shooter , but dropped his cell phone when almost immediately , the killer burst into the classroom and began spraying bullets at everyone . Emily reached over and picked up the phone and kept the dispatcher on the phone during the entire ordeal by hiding the phone . Law enforcement repeatedly told me how brave Emily was to keep them on the line .
