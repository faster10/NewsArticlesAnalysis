After talks between Ms . Swaraj and Mr Aziz which lasted two hours , the two sides tasked Foreign Secretaries of the two countries with formulating a timetable for secretary level talks on all the 10 issues that form the resurrected dialogue process . In moving from the composite dialogue basket of eight issues to the comprehensive dialogue , the governments have decided to flesh out the subject of peaceful exchanges , with humanitarian issues , people to people exchanges and religious tourism now coming under separate headings . While Ms . Swaraj has had the toughest line in government on talks with Pakistan so far , she has also spearheaded the initiatives to repatriate Indians and Pakistanis stranded on the wrong side of the border , including in the high profile case of Geeta , who returned from Karachi in October .
