I cannot believe how many of the posters are throwing Tom Coughlin under the bus ! I have nothing but the UTMOST respect for the man and always have , even though he coaches a division rival . He is humble , filled with integrity in my eyes , doesn t jerk around the media , tells it like it is , and doesn t literally throw the players under the bus ! I would venture to say that he has forgotten more football knowledge , than those of you sitting behind your keyboards , every knew , while putting him down smh
