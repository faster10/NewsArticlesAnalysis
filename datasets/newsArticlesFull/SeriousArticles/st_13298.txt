Where , after all , do universal human rights begin ? In small places close to home so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world . Yet they are the world of the individual person the neighborhood he lives in , the school or college he attends the factory , farm or office where he works . Such are the places where every man , woman , and child seeks equal justice , equal opportunity , equal dignity without discrimination . Unless these rights have meaning there , they have little meaning anywhere . Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home , we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world .
