All of this is a distraction from the actual album , which , as the title and artwork suggests , is not a typical Rihanna album ( none of last year s three new singles feature on it ) . Calvin Harris isn t involved . Nor is Dr Luke . There are no Stargate bangers , either . As with Beyonc s 2013 self titled album , it feels like a very deliberate attempt at making a critic pleasing , award gobbling classic , perhaps at the expense of what makes Rihanna so good . In fact , Work aside , none of the songs really quicken the BPM , favouring instead textured atmospherics , and , in the album s second half , a stripped back minimalism that might scare casual fans .
