The first missionaries came here just over 150 years ago , and like all youngsters there s the joyful enthusiasm on the one hand , and really from that point of view , the Church in the U . S . and in the rest of Western society can learn a lot , then on the other hand , there are problems , and the Catholic Church in Central Africa is not without its growing pains .
