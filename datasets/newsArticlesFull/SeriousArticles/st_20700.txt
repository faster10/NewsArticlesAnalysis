The Webb family has been organizing hunts in the Sandhills region for generations , and it puts a lot of time and resources into quality bird management and dog training , with a full kennel on the property . Webb Farm is big on encouraging the next generation of hunters to get into the sport and hosts plenty of corporate clients so experience and passion for hunting are not prerequisites here .
