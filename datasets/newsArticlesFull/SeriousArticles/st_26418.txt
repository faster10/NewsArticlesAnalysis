As sexting incidents pop up around the country , prosecutors are trying to come to terms with how these cases should be handled . George Skumanick Jr . , a district attorney from Wyoming County , Pennsylvania , took a novel approach when 20 students from Tunkhannock High School were caught allegedly sexting . He gave them a choice : probation and re education classes or be charged with sexual abuse of a minor . " An adult would go to prison for this , " says Skumanick , adding , " If you take the photo , you ' ve committed a crime . If you send the photo , you ' ve committed a different crime , but essentially the same crime . "
