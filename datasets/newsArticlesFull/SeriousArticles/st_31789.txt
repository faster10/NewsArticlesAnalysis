When it comes to Trump , the central questions remain for me : Who stops him and when do they do it ? Cruz ? Rubio ? Some other candidate to be named later ? Or perhaps it s none of the above and , in fact , it will be the voters of Iowa . But if Trump wins Iowa , then he is set up perfectly to take New Hampshire and South Carolina . The dominoes then fall precipitously into place as March unfolds into April . He may not have the majority to take the nomination on the first ballot , but going into the national convention with a significant number of delegates and the rules in his favor ( changing the rules to block ? Ron Paul in 2012 is coming back to haunt the party ) sets him to control the convention floor and put pressure on the establishment to deal with him on his terms . And we ve already seen how that has played out . ?
