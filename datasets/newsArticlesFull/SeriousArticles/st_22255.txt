The U . S . Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Florida ' s system of letting judges , not juries , make sentencing decisions in death penalty cases is unconstitutional . Florida is the only state with such a system . " The 6th Amendment requires a jury , not a judge , to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death , " Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority . Florida has nearly 400 prisoners on death row , but most will not be affected by the ruling because their appeals have been exhausted , or the aggravating circumstances in their cases are indisputable .
