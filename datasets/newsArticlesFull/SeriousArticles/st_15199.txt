I ve always liked chocolate mint . But I ve never thought that the ice cream was minty enough . When I was coming up with the concept for Bernie s Yearning , I was trying to decide whether it would be vanilla chocolate chip or mint chocolate chip . I felt that more people liked chocolate chip than mint chocolate chip . But when I started talking about it to some people , they said , Vanilla is just so bland . It s not exciting . It s supposed to represent the rest of the people ? make it a little more interesting .
