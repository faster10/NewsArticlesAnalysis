When he came back , not only was he driven and just inspired by it , but you can tell he was racing smarter , with more patience , just being more deliberate , and I think he just ? between having a baby , the thing that happened to him at Daytona , the time with his wife , and other things , maybe Joe Gibbs , I don ' t know , family , friends , I think that time , he had a lot of time to think about a lot of things , and I don ' t know what he did , but he came out of it even better than he was before , and I think he showed it right away when he came back that there was a pretty good chance he was destined to win this championship .
