Hillary certainly will be a better option that any Republican contender , because as Dr Cornell West says , " I always vote for the Democrat because they ' re just a little kinder on the poor . " But where ' s Hillary ' s passion ? And , of course , she has buildings full of people trying to get her elected , and corporate ties galore . Bernie has a few young , very savvy and smart tech heads who have managed to fill stadiums of rabid Sanders fans whose logo is : " Feel the Bern ! " Bernie is trying to burn through the hypocrisy . Wow , again .
