Several bridges blow up during the course of the film . You don ' t see close ups of people trapped in cars plunging into the river . Nor do you see what actually happens to the people on a football field ravaged by an underground explosion , though a field microphone is snatched quickly off the corpse of a dead official . Otherwise , little blood , not much gore , just a lot of stuff blowing up and limbs being cracked . . . Real people died , hours ago , watching this stuff . The thought lurked in the back of my head for most of the movie . It pushed itself to the forefront as I walked onto the sidewalk .
