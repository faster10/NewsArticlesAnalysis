Folks are always trying to get rid of affordable housing , says Torpy , who says that the Champlain Housing Trust s operating budget is 10 million but that every year it generates almost 100 million in development capital that goes into managing properties , making loans , and developing new housing and commercial uses . We have to go out there and defend it every year . The federal funds get cut every year . Because of the size of our portfolio we are much more self sufficient . We have developed some of our own capital to take risk in the market to get properties . A lot of organizations can t compete like that .
