On one hand , it makes sense that Shelton wanted to pre empt any jokes coming his way at the CMAs by flaunting that he has a new girlfriend . Though actually , co hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood went pretty easy on him during the opening monologue . They made a joke about a break up that really rocked our world that turned out to be a plug for ABC s The Muppets with exes ? Kermit and Miss Piggy . Paisley then cracked , ? On a completely unrelated topic : Howdy , Blake , as the camera panned to Shelton . Paisley also got in a dig ? about Shelton singing a duet with Ashley Madison instead of his actual recent duet partner , Ashley Monroe . No one mentioned Lambert at all .
