The conservative case against Trump is straightforward . His opinions are famously idiosyncratic , and in the space of a few short years , he has gone from backing a single payer health system to railing against Obamacare . In an earlier political incarnation , he called for a massive wealth tax aimed at millionaires and billionaires . Now , he favors deep cuts in corporate taxes that would greatly enrich millionaires and billionaires . As recently as 2013 , Trump embraced the idea of an amnesty for unauthorized immigrants . Today , Trump s opposition to amnesty is the centerpiece of his presidential campaign . Can conservatives trust this man ? Even the most passionate Trump devotees can hardly fault National Review for concluding otherwise .
