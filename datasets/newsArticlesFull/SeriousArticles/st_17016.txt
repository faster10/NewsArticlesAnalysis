Less than a month after Russia started its military intervention in Syria , diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict , moribund since the failure of the Geneva II Conference in early 2014 , have been resumed . The United States , Russia , Saudi Arabia and Turkey ? the main regional and international actors in the Syrian crisis ? started a series of meetings in the Austrian capital of Vienna , in an attempt to prevent the Syrian conflict from developing into a regional and international showdown , following the Russian military intervention . In the latest meeting , held last Saturday , all the parties involved in the Syrian conflict , including Iran , came together and agreed on a road map to end the five year conflict . For some , this was an important development towards the emergence of a regional and international consensus on the broad lines for a political solution . For others , it was a big failure because it could not resolve the issue of President Bashar Al Assad .
