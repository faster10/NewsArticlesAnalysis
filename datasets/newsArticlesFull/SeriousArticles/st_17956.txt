This will be the fifth time they meet in the playoffs and fourth time in the AFC title game . After Brady won the first two , including the 2003 AFC Championship Game , Manning has won the last two , both in the conference championship game , when he was with the Colts in 2006 and Broncos in 2013 . It s been a long and strange last 12 months for Brady and Manning , the two faces of the league who each were involved in the first real controversy of their careers . Brady was suspended by Roger Goodell for the first four games of the season for his role in Deflategate until it was overturned by U . S . District Court Judge Richard Berman in lower Manhattan one week before the start of the regular season . Brady played mad at the world and responded with one of his best seasons , throwing 36 touchdowns and only seven interceptions . Manning was dreadful before he was sat down with the foot injury after he completed five passes and had four interceptions in a Nov . 15 loss to the Chiefs .
