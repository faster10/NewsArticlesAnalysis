Cain : I think one of the fundamental divides between progressivism and conservatism is conceit versus humility . Your anecdotes of kids raised by same sex parents or the kid at the Iowa House hearing are compelling . But they are still anecdotes . And as Justice Kennedy , Justice Alito , Justice Scalia , and Justice Sotomayor all recognized today . . . we have 5 years of data on gay marriage versus 2 , 000 on traditional marriage . This is all to point out that the position ( a position I hold ) that gay marriage won ' t have detrimental effects should come with some humility . We can ' t see the future .
