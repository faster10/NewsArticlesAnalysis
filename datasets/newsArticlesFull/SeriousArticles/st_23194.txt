Green transport The uneasy companion of large quantities of wind power is great variation in power production due to the intermittency of wind . Electric cars can help absorb the surplus power production when energy production is high because of strong winds and when energy consumption is low at night . More electric cars simply mean more wind energy . In addition , electric cars can reduce the rapidly growing CO2 emissions from the transport sector . DONG Energy is developing the infrastructure and technology that will allow for cleaner and more intelligent forms of transportation .
