Only two movies topped 100 million domestically among comedies this summer : " Neighbors , " with the sneaky , shambling Seth Rogen , and " 22 Jump Street . " The latter was an interesting twist on the sequel , a follow up that knew it was a follow up and took every opportunity to make that the source of the comedy . ( In going along for the ride , Jonah Hill , Channing Tatum and Ice Cube were excellent self parodies . ) But " Tammy " performed tepidly ( though some may disagree ) , " A Million Ways to Die in the West " found one more way to go and " Sex Tape " was erased . You know what they say : Dying is easy , comedy is hard .
