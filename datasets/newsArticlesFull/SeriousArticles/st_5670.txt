? ? 1 . Mike Shula , Panthers offensive coordinator : There s a Shula back in the Super Bowl ! And that hasn t happened in 31 years . This is what it s down to , Dolfans . The Fins never get to the Big Game anymore , so we re relegated to mention folks with Miami ties . Mike Shula was a Dolphins coaching assistant in 1991 92 and QBs coach in 2000 02 , and is , of course , the son of Dolphins legend Don Shula , who is going to the game . Kid Shula , now 50 , the same age as the Super Bowl , has been coaching 24 years and , beyond the notable bloodlines , has earned credit for substantially developing Newton . I was trying to not let so much time pass since the last time a Shula was in the Super Bowl , Mike said recently . But time was trotting along .
