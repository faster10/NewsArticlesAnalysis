Great documentaries most often latch on to the universality of their subject and connect on an emotional or intellectual level with their audience . They can be about an obscure , unattractive animal ( naked mole rats , anyone ? ) , a troubled child in a small town ( " Billy the Kid " ) or a wacky modern day philosopher king tour guide ( " The Cruise " ) , but they have a purpose , a point of view and a connection with the audience . " Beats , Rhymes Life , " while loaded with great material , lacks that connection .
