On Wednesday , TNT gave the greenlight to a new reality series starring none other than Dwayne Johnson . Tentatively titled " The Hero , " the show will set about finding a " true hero " by pushing ten contestants to the brink ( and beyond ! ) of their personal limits . The contenders will live together in a house and compete in various missions designed to " test their brains , their brawn and even their morality . " ( I ' m thinking . . . " Big Brother " plus " The Expendables " minus 30 years . )
