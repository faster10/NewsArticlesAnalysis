Cosby fired back against those seven specific accusers , filing a counter defamation lawsuit against them last December in the U . S . District Court in Massachusetts . Cosby s lawyers called the women s lawsuit an intentional bid to assassinate his character for money . He also said it brought him emotional distress and caused substantial injuries to his reputation . Cosby later filed another defamation lawsuit in the Superior Court of California against another accuser , Beverly Johnson , who made similar claims . Cosby s lawyers said in a statement that Johnson s accusations that he drugged her were entirely fabricated and nothing more than an opportunistic attempt to resuscitate her own career .
