But regardless you saw this sense of hope and how people with different skills coming together in a community , working together and creating a little bit of normality , whether it ' s electricians helping with the setup for the camps , or doctors who are not accredited in the country , are still helping UNHCR medics to be able to provide support to their own people . That ' s what you ' re going to see here . Not just people who are coming who need help , they ' re going to be great contributing members to our Canadian society .
