Poor ? Leonardo DiCaprio . From What s Eating Gilbert Grape to The Wolf Of Wall Street , DiCaprio has been so good for so long that the Academy has occasionally taken him for granted . He wasn t nominated for Titanic ( Kate Winslet was ) or The Departed ( Mark Wahlberg was ) or Django Unchained ( Christoph Waltz won ) , and even though he has been nominated five times , he s never won the Oscar . But now , at 41 , he s suddenly become the poster child for brilliant , dedicated actors who are due . And he might have the perfect performance to finally take the Oscar , thanks to its degree of difficulty . The guy ate raw bison liver to play 19th century fur trapper Hugh Glass in The Revenant . He might deserve an award for that alone .
