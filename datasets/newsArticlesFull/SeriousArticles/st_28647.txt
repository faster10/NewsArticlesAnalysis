Mars had abundant volcanoes and impacts early on , and Opportunity rover scientists finally found smoking gun evidence for the ancient liquid water . What that rover couldn ' t tell us was whether Mars had organic molecules . But organic molecules get delivered to planets all the time from impacts by small and large asteroids and comets ( like February ' s fireball impact above Chelyabinsk , Russia ) , providing the last key ingredient for habitability . That argument sealed the deal back in 2004 : Mars was habitable . Cool !
