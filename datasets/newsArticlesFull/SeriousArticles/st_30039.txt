It seems undecided what role voters will play in this election . Those who are openly against the AKP but who do not trust other parties , while blaming the AKP for manipulating election results , should make up their minds . Unfortunately , Turkey seems to be rolling towards uncertainty and the Nov . 1 election may be the only way out if it , resulting in a reconfiguration of political forces . The country needs an inclusive government that can bring an end to the increasing polarization and , especially , address the Kurdish issue calmly . Indecisive voters should reconsider their choices . Instead of taking a vacation over the long weekend and not being able vote , this would be a great opportunity for people to volunteer at election centers to support a fair election . It is time for us to see if Turkey is ending its path to an authoritarian and repressive society , and being reborn into a long sought democracy .
