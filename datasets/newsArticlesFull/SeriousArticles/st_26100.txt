Tampa Bay Buccaneers : The Bucs are coming off their most impressive showing this season in a rout of the Eagles . The Colts , meanwhile , are vulnerable against the pass , allowing 278 . 9 yards per game ( ranked 29th ) . Quarterback Jameis Winston can take another step forward if he avoids turnovers and puts up large numbers against a unit that has allowed at least 300 yards passing three times this season . Matt Hasselbeck is a solid replacement for Andrew Luck , but Tampa Bay ' s defense has allowed just three combined points in the second half in the past two games . Don ' t look for the Bucs ' momentum to stop here . Bucs 27 , Colts 21 . Andrew Astleford
