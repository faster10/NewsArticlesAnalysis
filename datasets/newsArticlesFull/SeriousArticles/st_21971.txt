Today Bush was in Florida again , not to celebrate Rubio but rather in an attempt to restart his own presidential campaign that has been undone in no small part by Rubio . While Bush never referred to Rubio by name in his speech Monday , lines like " the answer isn t sending someone from one side of the capital city to the other " and " the challenges we face as a nation are too great to roll the dice on another presidential experiment " seem aimed directly at the Florida senator , whom Bush ' s campaign is working to cast as the Republican version of Barack Obama .
