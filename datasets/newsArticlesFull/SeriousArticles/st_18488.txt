Filmed on Oct . 12 , 2014 at what appears to be a conference of reproductive health practitioners , the video shows Dr Amna Dermish , a Planned Parenthood abortion provider from Austin , describing the process of a second trimester abortion to a man posing as a procurer of fetal tissue specimens for stem cell research . He tries to bait her with talk of fetal tissue reimbursement fees and his desire for specific fetal organs , in which she shows no interest ? her clinic , like more than 99 percent of Planned Parenthood facilities , doesn t donate fetal tissue .
