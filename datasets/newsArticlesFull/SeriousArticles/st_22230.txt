A military attack against Iran after a deal is signed would put Israel on a collision course with the P5 1 , who were negotiating the contours of a deal with Iran , as well as with other members of the international community .

General Assembly or Security Council resolution condemning Israeli behavior , calling for operative measures against the Jewish state .
