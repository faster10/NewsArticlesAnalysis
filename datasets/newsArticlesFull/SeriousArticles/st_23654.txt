It was also a fun moment to see Newton ' s first reaction . Even though Newton is a big star himself , and will likely win his first MVP award in a little less than two weeks , it appeared that Newton thought it was pretty cool to be playing someone as well respected as Manning ( it would have been even better if the AFC game was last and Manning responded to the same question by saying , " Oh wow , playing ' Superman ' " ) . It is a great quarterback contrast in this season ' s Super Bowl , with the young rising star in Newton facing 39 year old Manning in what might be the five time NFL MVP ' s final game .
