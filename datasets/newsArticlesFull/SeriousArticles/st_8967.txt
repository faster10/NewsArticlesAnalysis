" When the shooters entered the room , firing shots , Amanda fell to the ground and hid underneath a table , keeping her eyes closed and lying still , " her family said in a statement released to ABC News . " After firing multiple rounds throughout the room , the shooter came to her and shot her . They stood over her and could have easily shot her in the head , but we are so grateful to God that they shot her in the leg and arm instead . Later , post surgery , she learned on TV that it was a co worker who led the attack . "
