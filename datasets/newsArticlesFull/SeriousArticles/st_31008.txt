Interesting you mentioned the quick passing game . That ' s something the Jets ' players and coaches brought up Thursday . Manning gets the ball out quicker than most quarterbacks in the NFL . That ' s one big reason why his sack rate is so low . Jets nose tackle Damon Harrison did say he notices ? that Manning tends to throw the ball low at times , which could lead to some batted deflected passes for the Jets . Vereen is a dangerous guy out of the backfield , so even though everybody is talking about Beckham this week , the Jets ' coaches are very wary of the challenges Vereen poses . He has 40 catches this season ( on 53 targets ) for 342 yards and three touchdowns . He ' s a legit threat in the passing game . ?
