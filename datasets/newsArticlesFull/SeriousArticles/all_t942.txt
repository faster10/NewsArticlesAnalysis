Gisele Bundchen Says Sao Paulo Fashion Week Will Be Her Last Runway Ever
Gisele Bundchen announced this week that she'll be hanging up her stilettos. According to Brazilian news source Estadao, she will do one final strut next month for Colcci at Sao Paulo Fashion Week before retiring from the runway for good. Bundchen's career has spanned more than 20 year and made her the highest-paid model in the world -- a title she's held since 2004. The Brazil native placed second in a modeling contest at 13, and moved to Sao Paulo at 14 to kickstart her modeling career. Within two years, she was walking down the runway at New York Fashion Week. Though Sao Paulo Fashion Week will officially be the last time she does the runway for a fashion show, 34-year-old Bundchen will still model and appear in ads for her numerous endorsement deals, including Chanel, David Yurman and, as of last year, Under Armour. She also owns her own footwear and lingerie brands and is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations. She's also married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and has two children (who she loved breastfeeding).
