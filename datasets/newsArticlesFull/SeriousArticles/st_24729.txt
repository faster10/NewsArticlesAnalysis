Taking whatever action necessary , including military , if Iran is caught cheating on the nuclear deal enforcing UNSC resolutions that forbid Iran from research and development of ballistic missiles imposing tough new sanctions ( as President Obama has just done , albeit more forcefully and immediately ) tracking Iran s subversive activities and making it clear that there will be serious consequences should it continue to support extremist groups and terrorists requiring Iran , through quiet diplomacy , to end its public acrimony against Israel and pressuring Iran to help mitigate the Sunni Shiite conflict , knowing full well that this is not a conflict that either side can win . The Arab nation who have been in deep economic crisis since the begining of the sanctions a decade ago , during the regime of their former president , Mahmoud Ahmadinajad simply because of their enormous enrichment on their nuclear programmes . Under this amended policy , both U . S . and non U . S . persons will be permitted on a case by case basis to export , re export , sell , lease , or transfer to Iran commercial passenger aircraft for civil use , as well as spare parts , components , and services related to such commercial passenger aircraft . The return of Iran to the global mainstream hurts the Saudis , especially when they are beset by rising internal discords , falling oil prices and unsuccessful armed interventions in Yemen and Syria .
