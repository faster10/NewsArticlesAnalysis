Coleman : It ' s a very complicated relationship . It ' s really intricate but Clara ' s so weaved through each of his lives . It ' s not a relationship you can compare to anything else , really . Ultimately they ' re best friends , kind of parent to one another , they absolutely annoy each other . It ' s a rich , really complicated relationship that I personally love . In theory , it shouldn ' t work he ' s an alien that ' s been alive for 2 , 000 years and she ' s a schoolteacher . Across all of that , they have a really strong friendship . Because it ' s so offbeat , it ' s really charming and unusual . Somehow , they belong together . That ' s what I really love about their relationship .
