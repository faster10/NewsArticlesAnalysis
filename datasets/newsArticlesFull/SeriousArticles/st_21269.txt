This was the second time Zawadi , a female black rhino , met someone from my family . My brother William fed her three years ago in Kent just before she left under a translocation project to Tanzania where she now lives in a sanctuary . Thanks to the passion and stubbornness of Tony Fitzjohn OBE and his amazing rangers , she and many others are living it up in the bush and their numbers are growing . She goes nuts for carrots and I loved being able to send William this photo . Hats off to Tusk Trust .
