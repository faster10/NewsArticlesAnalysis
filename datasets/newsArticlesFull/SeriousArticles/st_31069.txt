Earlier this month , I introduced the bipartisan Zero Tolerance for Terror Act to ensure that Congress can hold Iran accountable for violations of international law . The bill would do two things . First , it would affirm that non nuclear sanctions can be imposed at any time for non nuclear offenses , making clear that nothing in the nuclear deal prevents the United States from applying future sanctions on Iran related to terrorism , human rights , and ballistic missile technology . These new sanctions , like the ones announced last week , would be outside the scope of the nuclear deal and would not give the government of Iran any cause to back away from its commitments under that agreement .
