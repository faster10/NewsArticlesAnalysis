Now , I know this president doesn ' t like some parts of his job . He doesn ' t much like schmoozing members of Congress , despite his recent share a meal plan with assorted Capitol Hill types . He doesn ' t like the LBJ style strong arming , either . He doesn ' t much like the messy lawmaking process in which personal relationships can often mean the difference between getting what you want and getting nothing at all . And he doesn ' t ever like to be pushed . Ever . No drama Obama , remember ?
