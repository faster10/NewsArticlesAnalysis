The U . S . Israeli relationship reached a new low on Tuesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily reacting to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ' s assertion that Washington would not specify " red lines " regarding Iran ' s nuclear program and then the Israelis leaking word that Obama refused to meet with him during the upcoming U .
