? The rebuilt on the fly offensive line held up in pass protection ? barely ? even after rookie left tackle Ereck Flowers went down in the third quarter with yet another sprained ankle . Rookie Bobby Hart made his first NFL start , at right tackle , and stayed in for all 65 offensive snaps . Hart was not overrun by the talented Jets defensive front , a good sign , though Pro Football Focus had Hart for one sack allowed and three quarterback hurries allowed . Weston Richburg made it for every play coming off a high ankle sprain . Justin Pugh , after missing two games with a concussion , played 33 snaps at left guard and the last 32 snaps at left tackle subbing for Flowers , with Dallas Reynolds moving in at left guard . This unit cannot get out of its own way as a power blocking outfit , but often has been solid providing Eli Manning enough time to make plays in the passing game . Manning was under pressure on 50 percent of his drop backs against the Jets , according to PFF , tied for third most of any quarterback in the league in Week 13 .
