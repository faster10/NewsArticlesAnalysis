So much of this primary season has been about hype . Cable networks have promoted debates like they were prizefights . Ratings , and polls , have become the centerpieces of the discussion rather than guideposts to it . And everybody keeps wanting the candidates to fight with each other . ( Including the candidates . ) Tonight the trend reached its nadir ? television hype moving toward no actual product . This is what happens when you excise Trump ? or , more accurately , he excises himself ? from a presidential election he s leading : Seven candidates looking for someone to yell at and not quite knowing what to do without one , one front runner with no one to insult and possibly imagining apologies that weren t there and nine people on a channel that s not even showing the debate trying to get a word in edgewise about nothing that anyone particularly understands . Trump needs his opponents . The opponents need him . The networks need both . If it s not too late already .
