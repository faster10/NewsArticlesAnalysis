What the Chancellor will do , instead , is channel more money towards construction companies , apparently under the assumption that developers are simply unwilling to build houses , and need to be coaxed into doing so . This is total nonsense . Building houses is not rocket science , and neither construction costs nor land costs are especially high in the UK . Even when house prices stood at their peak , a hectare of land in the South East typically cost less than ? 7 , 500 . However , the moment planning permission was granted , the price instantaneously shot up to over ? 3 . 3 million . This means that 99 . 8 of the price of land is currently explained by a slip of paper which says planning permit . That slip of paper so expensive because we are hardly printing any of them , so the solution is to print more of them .
