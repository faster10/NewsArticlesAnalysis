But even if we assume that higher education really is too expensive , we face a second conceptual difficulty : Subsidies may not make college significantly cheaper . Although the relationship between the level of aid available to students and the level of tuition has been controversial , this study released in July by economists at the New York Fed is persuasive . The authors found fairly robust effects , with an increase of 60 to 70 cents in tuition for each dollar increase of subsidized student loans . The effect was stronger at private colleges than at public schools , and , among private colleges , was least pronounced at those accepting the smallest proportion of applicants . As these tend to be the schools with the largest endowments , the effect is not entirely surprising .
