Hosts are supposed to operate only a maximum of 90 days per year , but there is no real mechanism in place ? to enforce that requirement . ? The San Francisco Chronicle found that at least 250 properties in the city appeared to be business minded rentals that operated ? year round for travelers . ? Inside Airbnb , ? one of the few outside sources of data about the privately held company , found that about 57 percent of rentals in the city were entire ? apartments or homes , as opposed to spare rooms , and that 70 percent of the market had high availability , which would allow a fair number of places to function as long term rentals .
