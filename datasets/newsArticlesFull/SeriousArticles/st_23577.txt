It won t be easy . Our brand of democracy is hard . But I can promise that a year from now , when I no longer hold this office , I ll be right there with you as a citizen ? inspired by those voices of fairness and vision , of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far . Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino , not as gay or straight , immigrant or native born not as Democrats or Republicans , but as Americans first , bound by a common creed . Voices Dr King believed would have the final word ? voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love .
