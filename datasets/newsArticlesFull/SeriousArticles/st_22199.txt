Sylvester Stallone , three time Oscar nominee : ? That s not a phrase many film fans would ever expect to utter , but remarkably ( and , justifiably ) Stallone has completed a perfect career arc here , getting nominated for his moving work as an aging Rocky Balboa in Creed . There are so many sentimental but also compelling aspects to this story . Stallone was nominated for Best Actor when he first played the role that made him a star 40 years ago . He was also nominated for writing the screenplay for the classic boxing drama . Now , at age 69 , he could finally win for playing the same character albeit in a film about the son of his fictional rival conceived by the up and coming Coogler . Working against Sly is the fact that his hit film was blanked in every other category , which historically doesn t bode well for acting nominees . Still , I wouldn t ever count out this legendary action star who s on yet another career comeback .
