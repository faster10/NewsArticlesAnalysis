If we give up now , then we forsake a better future , said Obama . Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war , or allow another economic disaster , or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought , even died , to secure . As frustration grows , there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes , to scapegoat fellow citizens who don t look like us , or pray like us , or vote like we do , or share the same background .
