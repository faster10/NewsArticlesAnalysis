It is also important to note that when the Medal of Honor was authorized by Congress ( which is why it ' s often called the Congressional Medal of Honor , because the president presents it on behalf of Congress ) , it was only one of two medals a soldier could earn . The other was the Purple Heart , which goes to soldiers wounded or killed in combat . Since then , the Silver Star , the Distinguished Services Crosses , the Bronze Star and numerous other awards have been created . So a service member ' s heroism may well be recognized with a medal , just not the Medal of Honor .
