I trusted my Dad that turning into a skid would work . I trusted my carny mentor , Doc Swan , that closing my mouth around a burning torch would put it out . They were right . Maybe the United States borrowing more money than I could imagine in a billion years with a billion computers and a billion monkeys typing on them , will get us out of financial trouble . I really don ' t know . It ' s certainly true that many counterintuitive things are true , and when you have the guts to do something counterintuitive that works , it ' s really cool . It ' s a superpower under our yellow sun .
