The walk wasn ' t too bad . Super Bowl City came into view as soon as I passed beneath the Bay Bridge . It ' s hard to miss . The NFL and its corporate sponsors have plastered gi normous mega mammoth banners and imagery on many buildings above the plaza . ( Some of the San Francisco supervisors are in a snit about this , which just makes them look silly . The mock up drawings of Super Bowl City have been around for more than a year and the now irate supervisors evidently didn ' t read the fine print of the SB50 Host Committee contract , which they approved in 2013 and now are trying to reverse field . ) Once inside Super Bowl City , some of the stuff looks very cool . All of it looks very corporate draped . Hey , somebody has to pay for the free bells and whistles .
