Steinhauer : My first two books were more police procedurals , but I soon came to realize that I was more comfortable in the looser genre of spy fiction . One reason was simple practicality cops follow very specific procedures that as a writer you either adhere to or you don ' t . If you don ' t , you ' re being unrealistic , and if you do , there ' s a possibility you ' ll end up straight jacketed by these rules . So I gravitated toward the more free flowing world of espionage . Spies follow procedures , but they vary by agency and , by and large , we in the public don ' t know what they are , so the writer is given a lot more latitude .
