Hanukkah has always been this " potato pancake holiday " in my house . No matter what I serve , my family likes simple crispy potato latkes best . Yet in this vastly changing landscape of food , I have tried all different kinds : zucchini , beet , sweet potato , celery root , and apple horseradish . The favorite is still simple potato . Today we have tiny latkes served with goat ' s cheese , tomatoes , herbs , or topped with smoked salmon and dill at latke and vodka parties . Topped with salmon , they make great appetizers .
