Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull . How long : Three years Legacy : During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile , which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn . The voyage also established the need for an international date line as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off .
