What I loved about him was all the sex appeal that he wanted to introduce to the house . But my generation is all hip hop , a different culture . Even top models that inspire me didn ' t inspire him it is just a matter of generation . And I think what is important for me today is underlining the luxury of the house , maybe less jeans , less street wear , but keeping the DNA of Pierre Balmain and pushing the embroideries and the craftsmanship because this is something that I think is part of me , and part of the house at the same time .
