Putting aside the political impact , however , this was truly an embarrassing day ? not just for the GOP and Congress , but for the country as a whole . Consider , for example , that guns kill more than 30 , 000 Americans every year . Hundreds of communities have been shattered by shootings that happen practically on a daily basis in America . And yet the House of Representatives , which has held 21 hearings on Benghazi , hasn t held a single hearing on gun violence since the Republican Party took control of the body in 2010 . A clearer example of Congress s misplaced priorities is difficult to imagine .
