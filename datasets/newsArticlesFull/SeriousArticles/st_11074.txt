The heritage of optogenetics goes way back to 1979 , when Nobel Laureate Francis Crick , co discoverer of the structure of DNA with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin , suggested that neuroscientists should seek to learn how to take control of specific cells in the brain . Well , that certainly would seem to be an advance with great potential . Imagine being able to turn the neurons in an animal ' s brain on and off from the outside . Sounds like you ' d be turning the creature into a robot , sounds like science fiction . Right ?
