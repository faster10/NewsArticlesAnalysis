ABCA7 s role in the Alzheimer ' s doesn ' t come as a complete surprise it is involved in producing cholesterol and lipids , and some research suggests that Alzheimer ' s disease may involve aberrations in fat metabolism that are similar to those behind heart disease . The more prominent contribution that ABCA7 seems to play in Alzheimer ' s risk among African Americans , however , does suggest that such lipid based pathways may be more important in this population than among whites . ABCA7 also regulates transport of proteins , including those responsible for the production of amyloid , a hallmark of Alzheimer ' s when it builds up in sticky plaques in the brain .
