The last time Mirror had caught up with her ( December 26 ) , Priyanka had yet to watch her latest release on home ground , Sanjay Leela Bhansali ' s ' Bajirao Mastani ' , which has been making all the right noises . " I finally watched it two days ago . I am so glad Sanjay sir narrated the story the way he did . He portrayed Kashi ( her character in the film ) as a self respecting woman whom history had chosen to forget . People in the US who have never seen a Hindi film have watched ' Bajirao Mastani ' " , she exulted . " Some have also seen ' Barfi ! ' It ' s like introducing Hindi cinema to the West . It feels like a wonderful , cultural exchange program and I ' m proud to be a big part of it . "
