But there ' s no getting away from the man who will attract nearly all the attention this weekend . As for that dinner with Palmer , McIlroy was still buzzing . ' It was fantastic , it really was , ' he said . ' We spoke for two and a half hours and he was telling stories of the old days and some of the things he ' s done from a commercial standpoint . He was very close to his father just like I am and he shared a few stories about that . It was just great to be in his presence and enjoy his company . '
