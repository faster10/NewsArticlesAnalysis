Across Iowa , people have been gathering in churches , living rooms , their local Pizza Ranch . They come to voice their fears and hopes to neighbors and strangers and members of the press . For Iowa , the caucus is more than a night , it is a season when the corn fed heartland is the hot blooded heart of American politics . And for months Iowans have been our pulse . I love all of it , said James Payton at a recent rally for Donald Trump . I love going to the events , I love the ads , I love the whole experience and everything about it . I m disappointed it s ending , everyone s going to leave , and then it s going to be over . We re another fly over state that nobody cares about .
