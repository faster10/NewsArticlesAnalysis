JL : I think he s trying to respond to his critics , more than anything else , and he has three different critics . One are the 50 analysts , intelligence analysts of the U . S . about a month ago , they complained that his administration was spinning the intelligence to demonstrate that the U . S . was winning the war against ISIS , and they said : We re not winning at all . So , I think , he s trying to satisfy them . Two , the Iraqis have been asking the Russians to come and help them bomb ISIS , saying that America isn ' t doing enough , and three Saudi Arabia , Turkey and others , have complained that the reason that Russia has gone into Syria is because there s a power vacuum that the U . S . has left , because it s not doing enough and that Obama is the big problem . So , I think , by inserting these extra troops , he s trying to satisfy his critics . At the same , they are small enough , that he s not going to get the U . S . sucked into a third Middle Eastern war .
