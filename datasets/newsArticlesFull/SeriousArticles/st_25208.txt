The fact is that the cloning paper published on Wednesday is zombie science . Therapeutic cloning was dead and buried years ago , but it just seems to keep on going , and so do people ' s hopes . There is definitely something weird here , something that brings out religious terminology like " the Holy Grail of medicine " around therapeutic cloning . That ' s because therapeutic cloning is a fantasy , one that belongs to the modern religion , the religion of technocracy . That ' s the only way I can explain how scientists who ought to know better seem to get drunk on their power over nature and keep pursuing this absurd dream .
