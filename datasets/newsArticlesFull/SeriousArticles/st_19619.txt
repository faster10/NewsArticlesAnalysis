Despite the ineptitude of Spectre , a version of that story might even work ? but whatever happens to the 007 franchise next , some fresh ideas should be brought to the table . Less than a decade ago , Casino Royale offered a sleek , stripped down reboot of the franchise that successfully shed 20 films worth of baggage . Just three films later , Spectre is flabby with the weight of the past . Maybe it ' s time for another bold creative mind ? be it actor or writer or filmmaker ? to push 007 back toward the future .
