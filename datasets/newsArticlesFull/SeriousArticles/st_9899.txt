Pakistan is considered one of the top ten countries that are vulnerable to climate change . This has been apparent from the increase in climate induced natural disasters it has faced this decade . Greater intensity of precipitation and glacial melt due to increasing temperatures has already resulted in extensive floods , almost annually , from 2010 onwards . The floods that occurred in 2010 and 2011 resulted in economic loss of more than US 15 billion . This is because not only is climate change adversely impacting economic , social and environmental aspects , an absolute lack of governance and mismanaged development is exacerbating the negative impacts .
