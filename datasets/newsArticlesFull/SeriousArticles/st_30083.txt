The trouble is that intuitions can be ? and often are ? wrong , which is why we demand evidence and reasoned argument to support them and why we become suspicious when these are not forthcoming . For the time being , concern about machine intuition is moot : it doesn t really matter that AlphaGo cannot explain the basis for its intuitive moves in go . But that won t last if Dr Demis Hassabis , the co founder of DeepMind , has his way . While games are the perfect platform for developing and testing AI algorithms quickly and efficiently , he wrote in a blog post last week , ultimately we want to apply these techniques to important real world problems . Because the methods we have used are general purpose , our hope is they could be extended to help us address some of society s toughest and most pressing problems , from climate modelling to complex disease analysis .
