I do remember . One of the things Barbara didn t mention is that they agreed to wait another six months , in the whole preparation . I d felt like I didn t have time to regenerate . It was very , very quick to start shooting another movie . But a lot of it had to do with taking the time to get my head into a place where I felt there was something else I could do with the franchise . I felt like I d spent all my ideas in the last movie and I needed time to remind myself how many different directions the characters could go . And I think it s fair to say that this movie has been both more difficult than the last movie , and more fun . And it is partly because the last movie was very dark . It was partly the locations and partly what Bond was going through as a character . He has been released from that , in this picture . A lot from his past comes back to haunt him , but he is a much more proactive character in this story .
