Murphy : To see the absolutely crazy streak that he had , completely take over that Nationals series , at a pivotal point of the season for us was the highlight . I would say probably for me , the bullet he hit off of Drew Storen in Game 3 of the Nationals series . He had already gotten Max Scherzer in the opener . And then in Game 3 , you re like , There s no way he s going to do it . And then he gets that hanging breaking ball and he does it again . I was like , Adjectives fall well short of what he s meant to us .
