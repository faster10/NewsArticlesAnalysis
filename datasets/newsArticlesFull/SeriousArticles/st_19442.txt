My own mom is a seriously talented , dynamic woman , but cooking is not one of her favorite things . Even so , she spent almost every night of my childhood cooking up homemade meatloaf , slow cookers full of oxtail soup , chicken casseroles and other Midwestern specialties just like her own mother had done , just like she thought she had to . Sadly , and to my mom ' s palpable frustration , I don ' t remember any of these meals . Instead , I remember my mom screening documentary films , jumping on the trampoline , going on power walks in the park with her friends . These are the things she loved . These are the things that shaped who I am .
