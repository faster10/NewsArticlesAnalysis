Carson ' s candidacy fits a triple bill . He gets even more attention for the GOP . He ' s African American with that great personal story and this seemingly gives lie to the notion that the GOP is strictly a no nothing party chock full of unreconstructed bigots . The notion of Carson as a presidential candidate touches a deep , dark and throbbing pulse among legions of ultraconservatives who think that Obama and many Democrats are communists , that gays are immoral , and that the healthcare reform law is " slavery , " as Carson infamously quipped , meaning a tyrannical intrusion by big government into Americans ' lives . Mainstream GOP leaders can ' t utter this idiocy . They must always give the appearance that they are above the dirty , muddy , hate slinging fray , so they leave it to a well paid stalking horse like Carson to do their dirty work for them .
