DHKP C has been active for more than 30 years and espouses a Marxist Leninist philosophy reminiscent of the Cold War . It grew out of another far left group , Devrimci Sol ( Revolutionary Left ) , formed when Turkey was in political turmoil , with clashes between militant left and right wing groups undermining a weak political system . Devrimci Sol claimed responsibility for gun attacks that killed two Americans , including a U . S . military employee , and an attack that wounded a U . S . military officer in early 1991 in protest of the Gulf War .
