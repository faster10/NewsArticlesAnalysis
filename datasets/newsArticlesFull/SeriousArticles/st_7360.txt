Dear has been cooperating with authorities . But sources tell CBS News that Dear has been behaving erratically during questioning . That hardly comes as a surprise considering that those who knew him say he was someone who barely spoke to others , and when he did often uttered words that didn t make much sense . He had been in trouble with the law before and was arrested for domestic violence , animal cruelty , and being a peeping tom . His ex wife in South Carolina once called the police , claiming Dear had assaulted her and locked her out of her house . I know everyone has a lot of questions , Pamela Ross , who divorced Dear in 2000 , told the Charleston Post and Courier . We all do . . . . We re living it just as everyone else is .
