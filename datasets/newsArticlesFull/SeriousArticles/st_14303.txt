Mr Myo Khin lives with his family in a small , ramshackle clapboard house , deep within the labyrinthine lanes of Yankin . This is the Rangoon the tourists never see : startlingly poor and congested , alleys too narrow for anything wider than a bicycle rickshaw , children playing under the stilts of their homes among the neighbourhood cats and chickens . Mr Myo Khin has done no paid work since throwing himself into political work 27 years ago : instead his heroic wife Daw Khin Khin Win became the breadwinner in between bearing five children , and supported him through his spells in six different jails around the country .
