That makes what is happening in the Labour party pivotal to the outcome . This has also been a clarifying week for Labour ? and not in a good way . The hostility between Jeremy Corbyn and his MPs has been greatly escalated . They were horrified by his equivocations about whether the police should be able to shoot terrorists even as they went about killing . They didn t know whether to laugh or cry when he made the fatuous suggestion that it would have been better to take Mohammed Emwazi , the serial killer known as Jihadi John , into custody . The next time a murderous jihadi is located in Raqqa , perhaps the Labour leader will volunteer to parachute there and perform a citizen s arrest . He has hardened his opposition to taking military action against Isis on the grounds that it would make the situation far worse . The tartest retort to that came from Hilary Benn , the shadow foreign secretary , when he said : To those who say that taking action in Syria will make things worse , I say things are pretty bad for those in Syria and our citizens too . The Labour leader has even publicly fallen out with his closest ally in the shadow cabinet , John McDonnell , about whether Labour MPs should be given a free vote on air strikes .
