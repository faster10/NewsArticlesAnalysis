I m not going to say it s going to come down to us , but we like to put it on our shoulders for the simple fact that we re playing against a good quarterback that might throw the ball 40 50 times a game , Goldson said . With that being said , we know we re going to have to stick with wide receivers for a long time , especially if he gets out the pocket or he extends plays . So as long as we re on the same page with our front seven , man , doing a good job of keeping him contained , I think we like our chances .
