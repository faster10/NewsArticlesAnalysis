For many , that era of Bond ? ? headlined by Connery ? can never be topped or duplicated .

The mythological SPECTRE , which provides the latest 007 film with its title , was first introduced to audiences in the Connery films as a sort of ersatz terrorist organization ( whose name stands for Special ? Executive for ? Counter intelligence , ? Terrorism , ? Revenge and ? Extortion ) . And although the Bond films were careful to delineate between SPECTRE and its fictional Soviet counterpoint ( called SMERSH ) , there is little doubt that the organization played on 60s era fears of international criminal conspiracies .
