" I really do not think about this unless Adam wants to talk about possibly getting married in the future . Two years ago we got engaged and even started making some wedding plans . During that time we fought and fought and fought over the smallest , most insignificant things . Once we called off the engagement and stopped making wedding plans , the petty fights stopped . Do flowers , an expensive dress and a fancy reception hall really indicate how much two people love each other ? For some people the answer may be yes , but for Adam and I , mutual respect , honesty , loyalty , support and humor are how we express our love . It ' s worked for a long time now , and I see it working forever . " Meehgan M . , Kansas City , Missouri
