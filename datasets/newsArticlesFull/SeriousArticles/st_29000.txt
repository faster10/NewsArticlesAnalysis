My wife Anne and I , along with 10 year old grandkids Gabriel Barnett and Maya Gergen , were there for a superb , two hour tour by a young man , Clay Dumas , once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the President . ( He also happens to be white . ) Like most staff members over the years , Clay spoke with near reverence about his President as he pointed out many photos of Obama on the walls . What seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new : Photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their President alongside and of equal standing with whites .
