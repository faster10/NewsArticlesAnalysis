Bond films today have kept the sadism and sex but jettisoned the third element of Fleming s recipe , the snobbery , thus impairing the balance of the dish . Daniel Craig , as Bond , looks like a security guard , not a man who moves easily at the highest levels of society . This spoils part of the point that Johnson identified , which is that Bond , for all his bad behaviour , is a member of the Establishment , a fact that adds to his aura of power . I am sure this is why David Cameron enjoys Fleming s books so much , collecting valuable first editions .
