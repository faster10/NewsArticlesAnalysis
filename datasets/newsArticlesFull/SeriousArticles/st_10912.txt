Mirren ' s pursed , patient , discreet Alma is the real hero of this story . She is not just her husband ' s sounding board but also his best ( uncredited ) co writer , his ( uncredited ) editor and even his ( uncredited ) co director . There is probably some sliver of truth to this , but " Hitchcock " plays so fast and loose with the facts it ' s highly unreliable . And in championing the overlooked Alma , it not only denigrates Hitchcock ' s reputation but it also slights his many other collaborators , too , including the work of author Robert Bloch , editor George Tomasini and composer Bernard Herrmann .
