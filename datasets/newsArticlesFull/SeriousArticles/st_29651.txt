One way is to focus on obesity prevention , which starts in the home , school and community . Numerous studies suggest that the behaviors we learn early in life influence our behavior as adults . ( I know that my parents always told me to eat a vegetable with lunch and dinner . To this day , if I am running late for work and just have time to grab a hot dog , I feel a scowling avatar of my mother pop up on my left shoulder ) . We can potentially delay or even prevent adult diseases by fostering better health habits in our children .
