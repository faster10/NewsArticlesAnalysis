Virtually is the key word , Sanders said . It s always this gotcha stuff . I can t walk down a hallway in the nation s capital without people begging me to beat up on Hillary Clinton , attack Hillary Clinton , tell me why she s the worst person in the world , he said . I resisted , I resisted , and I resisted . I think unlike our Republican friends there , who think that politics is about attacking each other in incredibly stupid and destructive ways , I think what we are trying to do is have a sensible debate on the important issues facing America .
