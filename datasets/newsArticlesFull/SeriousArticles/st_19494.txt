What about taxes ? Japan ' s 39 . 5 corporate income tax rate topped the 39 . 2 of the United States until it was dropped to 38 . 01 earlier this year . So it ' s not exactly a tax haven or low tax jurisdiction . Nevertheless , Japan ' s computer chip and electronic display makers are major suppliers of components to the iPhone and iPad as well as to the whole range of competing phones , tablets and computers . Furthermore , Apple and many global electronics companies are already paying less taxes by dint of elaborate accounting schemes that funnel revenue to tax havens like Singapore , the Cayman Islands , Bermuda and Liechtenstein .
