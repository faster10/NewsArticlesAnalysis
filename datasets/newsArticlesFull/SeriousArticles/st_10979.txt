" If you go on eBay or Amazon , you can see , these are all the people who are selling the product , these are all different prices , " says Christo Wilson , one of those researchers . " But Uber is different . They have this algorithm , and they say it changes prices based on supply and demand , but it ' s a black box . You have to trust that it ' s working correctly , because you can ' t verify . You don ' t know how many customers there are , you don ' t know how many other drivers there are . "
