SF : This is not only Europe s open door policy . Yes , it has played into the hands of jihadists , but the main problem and I am speaking here as a French and an Israeli citizen is that of you don t have any basic security measures in centers that are heavily populated . If you are taking a train in Paris , Gare du Nord , your luggage will not be checked . If you enter the Parisian Charles de Gaulle airport , your luggage will not be checked at the entrance . . . This is a basic security measure that was adopted by the state of Israel that was adopted by the US right after 9 11 . Despite Charlie Hebdo , despite the Hyper Marcher event , these measures were not adopted
