The suspect special teams unit came up with a nice stop when Josh Bellamy dropped Cordarrelle Patterson at the 16 yard line on the kickoff and the Vikings looked like they were an awful long way from challenging for a victory . That distance only grew when outside linebacker Pernell McPhee , who spent most of the game on the left side , lined up on the right side over Vikings left tackle Matt Kalil . With a powerful two handed shove , McPhee got Kalil off balance and cut inside to sack quarterback Teddy Bridgewater before he could set up to throw in the pocket following a play fake .
