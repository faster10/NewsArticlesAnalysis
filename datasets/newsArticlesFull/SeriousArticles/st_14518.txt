My first job in the camps was washing Nazi uniforms . I knew nothing of the task . Still , I grabbed a brush and an SS soldier ' s shirt and scrubbed hard and fast . After working my way about halfway through the pile , it happened . I scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar . The face of the pacing soldier at my station flushed red . I do not remember his words , but I remember his baton . He beat me until I bled . He needed to make an example out of me for the other prisoners . When he was finished with my flogging , he balled up the torn shirt and threw it in my face before huffing off .
