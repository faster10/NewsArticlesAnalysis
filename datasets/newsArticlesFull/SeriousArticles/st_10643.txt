On a basketball court at Clinton middle school , in the east of the state , as Elton John , the Stones and Adele blared , Billie Selser , who was waiting for Trump , said : I watched him on TV , on The Apprentice . I m interested to see what he has to say . She and her husband Bruce had never voted in a caucus before ? and struggled to recall ever having voted in a presidential election . They liked John F Kennedy , they agreed . And Clinton ? Bill Clinton wasn t bad at all , Bruce said . Then , asking about Trump , he said : Is he Democrat , or more Republican ?
