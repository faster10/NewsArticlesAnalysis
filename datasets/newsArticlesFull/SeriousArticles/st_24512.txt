Reports alleging an " intelligence failure " in Paris may too easily dismiss the difficulty in providing early warning of small attacks . Strategic intelligence received indications of Pearl Harbor , 9 11 and the Mumbai attacks but not with sufficient evidence and analytic clarity to issue effective warning . Smaller attacks like Paris , or Bali in 2002 , Madrid in 2004 , London in 2005 , or Boston in 2013 are harder to detect in advance . The public hears of intelligence failures , but less often learns of the silent success in preventing attacks .
