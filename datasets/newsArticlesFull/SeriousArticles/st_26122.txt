To interview Carson you must come armed with facts . But Quick s grasp of the material was no better than his , so it was all she said he said . She said he couldn t balance the budget with a 10 percent tax rate . He said the rate would be closer to 15 percent . She said it still won t work . He said he d get rid of all the deductions and loopholes . She said he d have to cut spending 40 percent . He said , That s not true . She said , That is true . I looked up the numbers . He said , When we put all the facts down you ll be able to see that it is true . She said , Dr Carson , thank you .
