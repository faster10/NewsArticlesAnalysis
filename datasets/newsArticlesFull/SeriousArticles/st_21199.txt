On Cleveland ' s second possession of the third quarter , Irving drove from the left wing . Caldwell Pope easily avoided a Love screen attempt , but Irving still got a step on him . As Irving left his feet , Detroit center Andre Drummond challenged . Drummond ' s man , Tristan Thompson , was checked by Jackson . That meant Jackson ' s man , Smith , was open in the right corner . Irving executed the perfect basketball play and passed on target to Smith , who drilled the 3 pointer for a 71 58 advantage .
