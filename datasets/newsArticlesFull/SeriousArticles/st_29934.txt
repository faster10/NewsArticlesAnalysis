Creating more ball movement and increasing assists was a Brooks talking point over the last two seasons , although assist numbers stayed rather stagnant , averaging out at about 21 a game . This season , under new coach Billy Donovan , OKC ranks 11th in the league in assists per game at 22 . 1 . Westbrook , who will make his first career All Star start next month at Toronto , is having his best season distributing , averaging 9 . 7 assists a game . That ties him for second in the league with Chris Paul and John Wall . ?
