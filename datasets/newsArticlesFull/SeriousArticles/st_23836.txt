Friedell : Not great so far . Any coach the Bulls brought in was going to have a huge shadow hovering over him because of the way things ended with Thibs and the success he had during his five year tenure . Aside from the offensive woes , the issue for Hoiberg is that his new players still don ' t seem sure where to be on the floor . They are not picking up what he wants them to be doing yet . The Bulls are also having the same issues that they did a year ago in that some nights it seems they want to play hard and some nights they don ' t . They still have plenty of time to figure things out growing pains are part of any new regime but the early returns have been underwhelming .
