" You know my friends , there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled by the iron feet of oppression . . . If we are wrong , the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong . If we are wrong , the Constitution of the United States is wrong . And if we are wrong , God Almighty is wrong . If we are wrong , Jesus of Nazareth was merely a utopian dreamer that never came down to Earth . If we are wrong , justice is a lie , love has no meaning . And we are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water , and righteousness like a mighty stream . " Address to the first Montgomery Improvement Association ( MIA ) Mass Meeting , at Holt Street Baptist Church , 1955
