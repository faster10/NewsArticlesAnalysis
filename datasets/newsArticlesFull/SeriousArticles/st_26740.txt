Some time ago , I had one middle aged patient with diabetes , whom I ' ll call Mark , requiring high doses of insulin to control his blood sugar . He faithfully saw me every three months , where I made careful insulin adjustments so his sugars wouldn ' t go too high or low . But all of a sudden , he stopped coming . I didn ' t hear from him until a year later , when I received a call from the emergency department telling me Mark was found in a coma because of a critically high sugar level . Thankfully , he survived his hospital stay , and when he came for a visit afterward he explained how he had lost his job , and thus , his health insurance . He couldn ' t afford to see me or buy his medication .
