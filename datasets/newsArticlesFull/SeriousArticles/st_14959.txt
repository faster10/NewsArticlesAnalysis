It ' s rare to find a team picking No . 4 overall that can genuinely say , " We ' re in win now mode . " But the Cowboys get a healthy Tony Romo back , so that ' s a fair statement . If Greg Hardy isn ' t back , Buckner is a great fit . You get a 6 foot 7 , 290 pound defensive end who can put a tackle on skates right into his own quarterback . The No . 1 thing you love about Buckner : major motor . He plays hard . He could have been taken relatively early last year , but came back and put an exclamation point on it .
