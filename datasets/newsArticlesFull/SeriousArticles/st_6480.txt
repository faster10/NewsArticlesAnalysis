Listening to Republicans chastise Obama and his administration over its Middle East strategy , one gets the impression that we are still in the early 1990s , in the aftermath of the Cold War . It is as if the US had never invaded Iraq , had never been defeated there and forced to withdraw in a hurry , exhausted and humiliated . They seem unaware of the chaos and destruction their absurd wars had unleashed on the whole region and the great damage they had caused to the United States itself . One of modern history ' s greatest ironies is that no one has done more to dissipate the neoconservative dream of American world supremacy and bury the New American Century Project than the former Republican neocon administration itself .
