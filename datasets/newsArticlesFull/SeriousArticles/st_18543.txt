While Gridiron Heroes wasn ' t started to give families financial support , Eddie devotes a lot of time to this issue . He helps families organize their own fundraising efforts , and Gridiron Heroes often pitches in when there ' s a specific need . The group has helped buy wheelchairs and wheelchair accessible vehicles , and it has also helped remodel homes , installing wheelchair ramps and wheelchair accessible bathrooms . Every month , Eddie also sends each family a 100 Walmart gift card to help buy necessary supplies .
