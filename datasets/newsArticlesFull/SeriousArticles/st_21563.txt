Fury wasn t terribly dominant , although he did have his moments towards the end of the fight . Klitschko s trainer , Johnathon Banks , tried to put a fire under his fighter after the 10th round by stating that a knockout was needed , but Klitschko simply wouldn t oblige as the fight ended and Fury had his hand raised with scores of 116 11 , 115 112 and 115 112 . Fury s victory cracks the heavyweight division wide open and opens the door to a possible intriguing showdown with current WBC titleholder Deontay Wilder .
