I came closest with Bush , who ' d held multiple positions on abortion before and since Roe vs . Wade in 1973 : " Mr Vice President , you now say that you support abortion only in cases of rape , incest or threat to a mother ' s life , and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratified would outlaw most abortions . But if abortions were to become illegal again , do you think that the women who defy the law and have them anyway and the doctors who perform them should go to jail ? "
