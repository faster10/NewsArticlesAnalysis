This is an inconvenient fact that doesn t precisely suit anyone s political agenda , and as a result almost no one believes it . It simply doesn t feel true , because we are all locked into a narrative that things are always and invariably getting worse . I had to haul out FBI statistics to convince my older brother of this last Thanksgiving , and I had to do it again this year . I m pretty sure he still thinks I m making it all up . I spent part of ? Wednesday ? evening flinging numbers at some guy on Twitter who found this inconceivable , and suggested that the stats had been cooked in some widespread government cover up . He and my brother are not alone . As a Pew Research study published in October reports , 56 percent of Americans polled in 2013 said they believed gun violence had increased over the last 20 years , while another 26 percent said it had remained about the same . Only 12 percent perceived , correctly , that gun crimes had declined .
