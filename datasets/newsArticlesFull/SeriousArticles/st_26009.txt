Unfortunately , once people get it into their heads that someone or something poses a big risk to them and their families , it s hard to do anything about it . The public is famously unresponsive to the simple math and cost benefit balancing of the sort supplied by Nowrasteh .

Obama has taken the high road ? and there is much to admire in his position . But unless he can find a way to calm public fears , the refugees are in trouble .
