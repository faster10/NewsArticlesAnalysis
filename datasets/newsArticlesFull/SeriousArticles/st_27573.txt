PESCA : Djokovic had one of the great tennis seasons of all time in 2015 , and now he ' s won his 11th Grand Slam . And that ties Bjorn Borg and Ron ( ph ) Laver , the man in whose arena he played . I ' m not going to say it was over before it started , but he did break Murray ' s serve immediately and won 6 1 in the first set and won in straight sets , and now his record against Murray is 23 9 . And Murray ' s the second best player ( laughter ) on the tour pretty clearly , especially with Nadal ' s health not so great , so Djokovic is the man .
