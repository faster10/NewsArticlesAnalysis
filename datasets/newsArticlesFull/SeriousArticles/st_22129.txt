TODAY : A NEW WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN ? The health world is awaiting the Steering Committee vote on who will head up the powerful Ways and Means committee , now that former Chairman Paul Ryan is now the speaker . It ' s Rep . Kevin Brady versus Rep . Pat Tiberi , and the race could turn on who Ryan himself supports , since he has five votes on the committee . Brady , of course , has seniority working in his favor . There ' s also a sense Ryan owes him one , since he was passed over for the spot when Ryan took it . But there are also a lot of chairmen from Texas already ? and Tiberi ' s supporters are quick to point out that Brady only entered the W M race last time after it was already clear Ryan would win . We ' ll have more as it comes today .
