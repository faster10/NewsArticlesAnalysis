They do have an aura about them because they are the world ' s best team . It ' s the same with any sports team who are at the top of their game . We just have to go in with confidence and belief in our own abilities , which is something we all have . Over the past few games they have shown they ' re human and they do make mistakes . I guess what sets them apart is that even when they ' re on the back foot , they still manage to grind out the results . Hopefully we can push them over the edge .
