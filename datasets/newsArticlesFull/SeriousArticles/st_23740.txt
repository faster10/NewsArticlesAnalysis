That ' s right , after three seasons , we will finally see a person of color on the show ! Downton has never been known for its diversity , but viewers know social change is on the horizon . It was only a matter of time before it creeps into those hallowed halls . While Diddy ' s casting may have been nothing more than a Funny or Die joke , season 4 will in fact include the show ' s first recurring black character . Gary Carr has been cast as a charismatic jazz singer and will hopefully give us a glimpse into the characters ' feelings about the changing face of race in the 1920s . With Cousin Rose ' s penchant for jazz clubs revealed in the finale , it ' s a safe bet the two will cross paths this season .
