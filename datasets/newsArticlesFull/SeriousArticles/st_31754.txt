The speech itself consisted of typically jazzed up Bachmann verbiage . She employed charts to illustrate misleading arguments . ( In October of 2001 , she said , our national unemployment rate was at 5 . 3 percent . In 2008 , it was at 6 . 6 percent . But just eight months after President Obama promised lower unemployment , that rate spiked to a staggering 10 . 1 percent . Sounds good no further information to add there ! ) The address is mostly remembered , though , for how Bachmann didn t look directly into the television camera , which Saturday Night Live went on to mock the next week .
