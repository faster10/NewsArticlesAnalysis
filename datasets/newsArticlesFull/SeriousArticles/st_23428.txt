China ? the world s largest emitter ? actively sought to undermine negotiations in past climate conferences , but under the leadership of President Xi Jinping the country appears to have turned over a new leaf .

The country generates more than a quarter of the world s carbon dioxide emissions , and many countries would be reluctant to commit to cutting their own emissions with the world s largest emitter on the sidelines .
