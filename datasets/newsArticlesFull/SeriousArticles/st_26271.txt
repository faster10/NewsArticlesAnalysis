It s odd to put the record shattering Manning in a game manager role , but given the litany of injuries that have caused the 39 year old quarterback severe limitations in throwing the football the past two seasons , that s exactly what the future Hall of Famer must do today . He shouldn t force the ball downfield or into places he s no longer capable of delivering it . Once Manning starts forcing the ball , he ll risk being intercepted . So he has to make whatever throws he can , and resist the temptation to go for more and rely on his defense and running game to be enough to get the job done .
