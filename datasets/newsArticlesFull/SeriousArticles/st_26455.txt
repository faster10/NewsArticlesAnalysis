There are far too many examples of the irony at play here , so I ' ll just list a few . In November , Sen . Cruz announced he would be introducing legislation banning Syrian refugees from finding shelter in the United States . Also in November , Cruz decided it ' s cool if some Syrian refugees come here , but only if they ' re Christian . This week , Cruz called for a national harassment of refugees already in the United States to determine whether or not they have ties to radical Islamic terrorists . And let ' s not forget ? the ? experiment Cruz proposed last month in which he wanted to carpet bomb the Middle East in order to see if sand glows in the dark .
