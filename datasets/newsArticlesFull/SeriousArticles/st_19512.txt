3 . ) Capitol Glam . The disturbing world of excess at the Capitol is clearly more theme park ready than District 12 . In the Capitol section of the park , there should be makeovers aplenty , so everyone can get in touch with their inner Effie Trinket . If the designers can figure out a way to replicate the " Girl on Fire " dress for photos , all the better . For a more chilling take on the Capitol , have some kind of dark maze people must maneuver through while the voice of Philip Seymour Hoffman yells at you to come out . Haunted houses would have nothing on those kind of fears !
