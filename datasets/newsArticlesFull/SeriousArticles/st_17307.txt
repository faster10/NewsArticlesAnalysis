Brosnan : ( Director ) Mick Garris is the one you have to tip your hat to . He ' s extremely prepared and passionate and knows the King world so well . King trusts Nick implicitly . Garris and I didn ' t talk too much about it . It was fairly self evident what had to be done with the story . At first I thought it was overly written with stage directions and it kind of irked me where it was telling me how to act here . As the piece wore on , the weeks went by , I realized more and more of the stage direction .
