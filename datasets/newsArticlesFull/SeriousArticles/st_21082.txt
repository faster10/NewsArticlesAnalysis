SM : ? I really don ' t believe Saudi Arabia would ever try to go to military confrontation , because they already tried during the war in 1980 1988 , the most powerful Arab army , Iraq , invaded Iran . Saudi Arabia , other Arab countries , they supported Saddam after 8 years , now Saddam is gone , they failed and Iran is one of the most powerful countries in the region , and Iran is very much stable . They tried already , and they know their capacity . They even haven ' t been able to manage Yemen and Bahrain , after military campaign in Bahrain which is smaller than one of the Iranian cities . Therefore , I don ' t believe they would ever go for military confrontation with Iran .
