I have been reporting from Afghanistan since 1996 and the one thing I ' ve noticed over the years is that every Afghan asks foremost for security . Then next on the list is development to help them earn a decent living and raise their families . They also want a decent government . They know this will take years of patience and effort . They know it will be a hard slog . After all , they have been at war for 30 years now , during which the traditional , honor bound society they had for decades has all but vanished .
