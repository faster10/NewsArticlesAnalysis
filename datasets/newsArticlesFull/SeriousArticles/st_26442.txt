America has had trouble on this score with Japan , Malaysia , and Singapore ? all parties to the TPP deal . Our trade deficit has been enormous since the late 1990s , and over the last few years has bounced around between 375 billion and a whopping 460 billion . ( That ' s 2 to 3 percent of GDP for those keeping score at home . ) Japan , Malaysia , and Singapore certainly aren ' t solely responsible for this , since China ? who isn ' t a member of the TPP , but whom the deal is clearly aimed at pressuring ? has been manipulating its currency , too . But research suggests currency manipulation could explain at least half the trade deficit , and maybe all of it .
