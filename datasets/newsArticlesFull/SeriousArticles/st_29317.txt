In case of the gold monetisation scheme , while banks want the facility to pledge more gold and less cash with Reserve Bank of India against their reserves requirements so that they can use the excess cash to lend at attractive interest rates , the central bank hasn t granted any such concession to them . Soumya Kanti Ghosh , chief economic advisor with SBI , said banks may not find themselves adequately incentivised to promote the scheme in a vigourous manner in the absence of any relaxation in the cash reserve ratio norms , considering that they have to include other costs while calculating their returns .
