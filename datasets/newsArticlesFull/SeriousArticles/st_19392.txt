Republican front runner Donald Trump announced yesterday that he was pulling out of Thursday night s debate on Fox News , citing a refusal to share the stage with network anchor Megyn Kelly . Trump has subjected Kelly to any number of insults , gendered and otherwise : bimbo , blood coming out of her wherever , and the more garden variety accusations of stupidity or incompetence . And yet , as is the nature of trolls everywhere , it s Trump that claims the grievance against Kelly , protesting that her questioning of him ? a tactic we in the media biz call journalism ? is biased , disingenuous , and or mean spirited .
