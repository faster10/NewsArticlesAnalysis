Why now ? In the last 10 years , Chicago has paid an astounding sum , more than 500 million , to settle police misconduct cases , including 5 million to the mother of Laquan McDonald before a lawsuit was even filed . These settlements include , but are not by any means exclusive to , the reign of terror under a white police detective and commander , Jon Burge , and his midnight crew who tortured dozens , possibly hundreds , of African American suspects in the 1970s and 1980s . Chicago ' s Independent Police Review Authority has investigated more than 400 police shootings ( fatal and nonfatal ) since 2007 and found only one to be unjustified . The Better Government Association reported in July that Chicago police fatally shot 70 people , mostly black males , between 2010 and 2014 , ranking Chicago at the top among the largest U . S . cities ( not adjusted for population ) , although police involved shootings have declined sharply under now ousted Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy . ( Ironically , the Justice Department launched its pattern and practice investigation of the Newark , N . J . , Police Department just a week before McCarthy departed the top job there to head the Chicago Police Department . )
