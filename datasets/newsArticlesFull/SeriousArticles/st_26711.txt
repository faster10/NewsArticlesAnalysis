Andrey Kuznetsov : He demonstrates why so much of the bracketology that goes on after the draw is released can go right out the window once the first ball is hit . Ranked No . 74 , Kuznetsov drew a qualifier in the first round , won his second match and , thanks to the upset of Rafael Nadal , found himself facing No . 87 Dudi Sela , 30 , in the third round . Kuznetsov won that match too . Now , he faces the second lowest seed in the fourth round , Gael Monfils . But give Kuznetsov some credit the key to his run was a quality second round upset of No . 30 seed Jeremy Chardy .
