PS : Billy doesn ' t have a style , because to have a style it would mean that there have to be other people with a similar way of working . He goes on stage and it ' s like he ' s got these comedy angels whispering in his ear . He makes this extraordinary connection with the audience , and of course he ' s very astute and funny about politics . He sees the funny side of all kinds of things human nature , human behavior , world events , politicians . He ' ll talk about that with such passion . It ' s what many of us think but don ' t want to say . Billy will see something on television or notice something on the street or he ' ll just think something and it ' ll go into his computer of a brain and it ' ll stumble out when he ' s on stage . See Billy Connolly perform on a recent tour of Ireland
