" I think the most important part for the GSA to think about is make sure we open ourselves up , avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country , but then also make sure we have a clear business case , " he said . " If we have someone who is working in Nebraska but reporting to Boston , there has to be a clear explanation for what value they ' re providing , and you ' ve got to give me the business case . You ' ve got to explain to me why that ' s a cost effective move for the American people , and that ' s a new standard that we ' re asking everyone at GSA to adhere to . "
