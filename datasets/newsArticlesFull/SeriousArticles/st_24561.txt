' Arsene has used him and he ' s played quite a lot of games if you compare it to the games he played for Man United . With us he ' s always done what I think is a very , very good job for the team . There aren ' t many times when he ' s played for England where I ' ve been disappointed in him or in his work rate or desire . But of course it would be great if he gets himself as one of the first names on the Arsenal team sheet and play for them every week , that would be a bonus certainly for him and it won ' t do us any harm .
