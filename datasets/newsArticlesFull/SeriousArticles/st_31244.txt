Mendes gambles big on a last act that cuts out all the gadgets and gizmos , brings everything down to bare bones and ties the action to Bond ' s own history . He pulls it off , in part because this apparently immortal series desperately needed someone to take a risk , and because Mendes ' class really comes through in the performances . Judi Dench is probably incapable of being bad , but M is a real character this time , with emotions , as well as convictions , and she hits every note just so . Ben Whishaw is a breath of fresh air as a youthful Q , and Craig himself remains the first 007 who might conceivably take down Sean Connery in hand to hand combat .
