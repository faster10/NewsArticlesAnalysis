Added to all this wimpiness is the utter collapse of the Republican National Committee ' s control over the debate process . It wasn ' t supposed to be this way . After the 2012 election cycle , the RNC was going to get tough and lay down the debate law for all Republican candidates . There were too many debates last time around , so there would be fewer this time . There were too many liberals asking questions , so the debate host networks would be hand picked by the RNC . They were supposed to have rigged the process so that only conservative moderators would be allowed to appear . Obviously , something went horribly wrong with this plan . The purity tests for the moderators seem to have been seriously flawed , or something . Whatever went wrong , Reince Priebus and the RNC look pretty downright wimpy now , and unable to even stand up to their own presidential contenders .
