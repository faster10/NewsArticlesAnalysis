Kraus : Definitely . I can ' t imagine what it would have been like if it had been one of us years apart from the other . Because I think you can ' t appreciate how tired you are , or how much willpower you have to harness on some days to focus , until you ' ve done it . It really is like nothing else . And I think that we have a lot of compassion for each other . We understand what it is when the other has been up all night with their children , if someone has the flu or something . I think it ' s impossible if you haven ' t had kids yet to really get that .
