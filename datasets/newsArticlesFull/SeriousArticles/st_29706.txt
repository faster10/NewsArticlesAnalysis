The year since has seen unprecedented progress on climate change . The world s biggest polluters have made new commitments to cut emissions , and for the first time these commitments are coming from developing countries too . We have begun to address this problem together , as one people . Attention to the issue is sky high , with the pope asking Catholics to join our marches this weekend , Google and YouTube sending people to sign our movement s climate petition , mayors around the world committing to clean energy in their cities , and so much more . The first marches to happen this weekend are the largest in their country s histories , twice the size of last year s mobilisation .
