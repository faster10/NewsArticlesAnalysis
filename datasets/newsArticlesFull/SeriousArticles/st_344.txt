Formula 1 isn ' t Johnnie Walker ' s only sporting sponsorship . It also sponsors golf a sport that Tiger Woods aside is rarely associated with youth and dynamism . But while its perception in Europe is one of " a walk in the country ruined " , in the Asia Pacific market it has the associated glamour and spirit of Formula 1 . The Johnnie Walker classic has run in Asia for 17 years now and Johnnie Walker also sponsors the Championship at Gleneagles in Scotland ( Gleneagles is also a Diageo property ) .
