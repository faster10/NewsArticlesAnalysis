It ' s Bawlmer , hon ! You gotta try a crabcake . Marylanders love few things more than debating the merits of various restaurants ' renditions of their city ' s signature blend of lump crab meat , mayo , egg , seasonings ( usually Old Bay ) and just enough crumbs ( either bread or saltines ) to keep the whole mess together . Though the original Obrycki ' s , which had been slinging up crabby delights in Baltimore ' s Fell ' s Point since 1944 , has closed , the BWI locale sticks pretty close to the formula that made the restaurant a Charm City classic . ( You can also grab Obrycki ' s at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport . )
