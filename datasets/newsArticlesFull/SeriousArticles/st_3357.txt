Lots of Scandivian input here . Stargate are from Norway ( as are one of Coldplay s favourite bands a ha ? their bassist Guy Berryman made a record with a ha s Magne Furuholmen ) and Swedish singer Tove Lo sings along with Chris Martin here . It would have probably have worked as a Gotye Kimbra style breakup duet , but hey . This is a real meet in the middle moment ? Stargate provide some electronic heartbeats and noodling over some traditional Coldplay mid tempo work . It has a lovely Cure style darkness towards the end .
