The big question is , as the primaries start , does the unofficial backing of the president matter to voters ? Clinton has already accrued many of the benefits of being the candidate of the Democratic establishment , from endorsements to fundraising to Biden opting against running . That Obama likely prefers Clinton to Sanders is not surprising ( the president is part of the establishment ) and won ' t become a huge news story that changes the coverage of the primary , since the president is not endorsing Clinton or campaigning in Iowa and other states for her .
