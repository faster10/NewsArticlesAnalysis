French President Nicolas Sarkozy : " A man of culture and a writer of great talent , Vaclav Havel was the incarnation of tireless commitment to democracy and freedom . His ascension to the presidency after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 capped a life entirely dedicated to the fight against totalitarianism and for the defense of values that inspired his action tolerance , the promotion of human rights and the struggle against oppression . With the death of Vaclav Havel , the Czech Republic loses one of its great patriots , France loses a friend , Europe loses one of its sages . "
