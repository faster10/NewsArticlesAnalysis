Tom Brady is worth 8 , 100 and 7 , 400 on FanDuel and DraktKings respectively . Peyton Manning on the other hand would take up a measly 6 , 700 and 5 , 500 in cap room . The difference between each player comes down to overall arm strength . Brady is strong enough to get the football to his playmakers at any point during a game . There is a certain dynamic to him and the short yard passing game . His receivers and group of tight ends can catch a short pass in space and break them into long gains . The short yardage plays also elevates the running backs who will probably end up nonexistent in the running game .
