Mark Zaid , a national security attorney , said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising . " For one thing , an Article 32 ( hearing ) serves as an opportunity for the defense to obtain pre trial discovery , and particularly information they do not know . Additionally , the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed , " said Zaid .
