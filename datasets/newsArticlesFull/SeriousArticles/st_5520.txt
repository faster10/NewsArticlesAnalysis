I remember a time when administrators were called deans , provosts , treasurers and registrars now it seems everybody is a vice president . With these titles have come higher salaries , bonuses , company cars , low interest mortgages and severance payments for voluntary departures . Boards of trustees approve these lavish practices even as they fight unionization , eliminate full time faculty positions , refuse even cost of living raises for the majority of workers , increase tuition and ask students and their parents to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans .
