Over the years , " The Closer " had become a light comedy crime show with heavy handed humor performed not just by Sedgwick but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to " Major Crimes , " especially G . W . Bailey , whose slow burns have become endless fuming , and , only by contrast to a lesser extent , Tony Denison , Michael Paul Chan , Raymond Cruz , and Phillip P . Keene . ( I ' ve always found it interesting that Denison and Chan are veterans of two , need I say superior , Michael Mann TV shows , Crime Story and Robbery Homicide Division indeed , many of Chan ' s gestures and body language when he enters a crime scene strongly echo his moves in RHD , and I ' d bet that ' s where he picked up those good habits , from Mann ' s heavily researched series . )
