What we do is we bring the arts , in any way we can , into hospitals . Some of these children have been bedridden for years , so they obviously can ' t go out and play . So we sing . We read to the children . We finger paint that ' s a really fun one and it ' s amazing what you see . You get a real direct , immediate result . These children , they ' re just these beautiful little souls . Some of these kids can ' t speak , so they really just have their eyes and their souls to communicate . And when you finger paint with a kid or you dance and you see their little eyes light up , it ' s pretty incredible . And when you start visiting them on a regular basis , you see their growth . It ' s really quite special .
