Shortly before " Anti " dropped , Rihanna released the track " Work , " featuring Drake , the only radio friendly number of the bunch . To a scrambled tropical dancehall beat , Rihanna mumbles : ? " You see me I be work , work , work , " repeating the word ? " work " over and over until the word loses meaning in her mouth , collapsing into wayward syllables and nonsense . She seems to get bored amidst her anthem exalting work , and opts for a shortcut . The song effectively captures Rihanna ' s modus operandi : a slacker and a boss , and whatever else she wants . ?
