It ' s still an open question how this will impact French politics , if at all . Will France ' s Catholic revival produce a revanchist , identity politics driven Christian right ? Will it just provide fuel for France ' s main right wing parties , which care nothing for the issues dear to Catholics ? Will it provide a template for a new engagement in politics ? Or will this revival of social conservatism , combined with outrage at high taxes , debts , and deficits , produce a kind of French version of the Tea Party ?
