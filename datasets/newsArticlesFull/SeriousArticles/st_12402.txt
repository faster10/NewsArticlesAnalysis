Better not to take the science seriously . To extract energy from a whole star and store it somehow within a planet seems quite impossible . No solid material or supporting magnetic field can capture a plasma at tens of millions of degrees in such a small volume , let alone refocus it with the directional of a cannon . Also , traveling at light speed is impossible for bodies with mass . Only light or another massless entity can do this . Sounds don ' t propagate in outer space , where there is no sustaining medium like our atmosphere , so wars in space would be eerily silent .
