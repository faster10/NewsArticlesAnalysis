Add to that the cultural generational divide when it came to the arts in America . Robert Frost and T . S . Eliot were not dinner conversation at my house . My parents didn ' t even know of the Rolling Stones . They wanted me to continue the story of the " American dream " that they had begun . Fortunately or unfortunately I was a whiz at math , and when the time came to decide on a career path , I succumbed to their loving insistence . But I always harbored a creative spirit throughout my childhood , completely taken by Legos , paint by number sets , latch hook rug kits anything that gave me expression .
