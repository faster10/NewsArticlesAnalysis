Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing , which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured . Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev , 26 , during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar , who is now on trial . Tsarnaev ' s lawyers don ' t dispute that he did it . The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older , self radicalized brother to commit acts of terror .
