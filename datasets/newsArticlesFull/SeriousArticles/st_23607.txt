It s better to go the hard route . Cam threw for 422 yards in his first game , the most ever by a rookie quarterback in a debut game . He made it look easy . But there are a lot of great players in the NFL . The losses began piling up for Cam and the Panthers over his first couple of years . His 100 megawatt grin gave way to a mopey scowl . He slumped on the sidelines beneath his ever present Gatorade towel . But now he and the team have come out the other end , and he s dancing and grinning more than ever . He learned what we all learn . Life is hard , and so is success . It comes along a lot more like slow cooked collard greens than instant grits , as Cam the philosopher puts it . No matter how special you think you are , someone or something is going to suggest that you re not . It s on you to prove the doubters wrong .
