The Tigers ' great became the first player above the JAWS standard at his position to age off the ballot since longtime Cubs third baseman Ron Santo in 1998 , but he did receive his highest voting percentage in his 15 years on the ballot . Less qualified candidates such as Orlando Cepeda , Nellie Fox , Bill Mazeroski and Hal Newhouser were elected by the Veterans Committee after posting big gains in their final year of BBWAA eligibility . Trammell may yet go that route , though an Expansion Era Committee rule requires that he go through a one year waiting period , which means that he will miss that committee ' s 2017 ballot and will have to sit out the 2018 and ' 19 veterans committee ballots that consider players from the so called Golden Era and Pre Integration eras , respectively . Thus , while former Tigers teammates Jack Morris ( who aged off the ballot in 2014 ) and Lou Whitaker ( who went one and done in ' 01 ) may be considered next year , Trammell will have to wait until 2020 .
