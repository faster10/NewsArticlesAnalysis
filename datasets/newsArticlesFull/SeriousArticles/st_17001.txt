Are the gunmen in cases like these out to make a name for themselves ? If so , they are ordained to fail there was a time when multiple , random murders were enough to give the perpetrators such notoriety that their names became catchphrases . Charlie Starkweather , whose name means nothing to most people today , had more than one movie made about him after his killing spree on the American Plains in the 1950s . There was a time when we could ascribe , to people who murdered without mercy , a dark desire for the worst kind of fame .
