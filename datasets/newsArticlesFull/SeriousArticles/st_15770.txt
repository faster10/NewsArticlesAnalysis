It s tough not to wonder if Kelly actually buys her own nonsense . She does , after all , live in New York City , where people of every race and ethnicity you can imagine fill the streets . Does she flip out and call the cops every time she thinks she sees a Muslim ? Yes , officer , I see two people that look like Muslims drinking coffee at Starbucks . Yes , I get that there s nothing suspicious about drinking coffee , but you know , those San Bernardino shooters seemed normal , too , and look what happened there !
