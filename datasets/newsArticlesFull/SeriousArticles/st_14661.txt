But the guilt keeps coming because this is ground I never wanted them to stand on . I wanted them to have a daddy who comes home and wrestles with them or takes them out for doughnuts to give their mommy a break . I wanted them to walk home from school to find their mom in the house and snacks on the counter . I wanted to read to the class on Friday afternoons and volunteer to host Girl Scout meetings . I didn ' t want to have my face buried in my iPhone while pretending to watch " My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic " with my daughter . I didn ' t want be a stranger to the other moms at school , and I didn ' t want to throw chicken nuggets at them when I just didn ' t have it in me to make dinner .
