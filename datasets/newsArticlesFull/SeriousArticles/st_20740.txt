Unfortunately , it is an analogy that can be applied to the Ferguson Police Department . The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored , and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside . If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department , they need to leave , and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization .
