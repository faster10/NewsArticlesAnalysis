Street officers are always interested in better ways to handle unpredictable situations , and police departments everywhere cannot provide enough quality hands on training for front line cops . Excellent training in firearms restraint is a vital tool that has helped drive down NYPD shootings over time . In 1972 , New York ' s finest were involved in almost 1 , 000 incidents in which firearms were discharged in 2010 , that number was just 92 . Good thing , too , because no matter the training or innate restraint of the police , there really is no safe way to deal with shootings in a crowded city . Ultimately , the outcome is always uncertain .
