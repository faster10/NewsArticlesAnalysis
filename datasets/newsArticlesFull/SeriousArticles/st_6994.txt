The so called Paul Ryan budget ? a definitive statement of Republican policy objectives ? is essentially the Gingrich 1995 agenda reborn . It proposes to privatize and cut Medicare , block grant and cut Medicaid , block grant and cut the anti hunger programs , make deep cuts in discretionary programs , and increase tax cuts for the wealthy . In 2011 , Republicans were willing to use the threat of a default even at the risk of a world wide financial meltdown to extort deep , long term cuts in domestic discretionary spending , although they failed to achieve the radical changes in entitlements they sought .
