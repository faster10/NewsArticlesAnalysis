Forget principles and morality . Forget , or try to forget , the quarter million deaths for which Bashar al Assad is responsible , directly or indirectly , since choosing to respond with violence to a peaceful uprising of the Syrian people . Set aside the fact that Assad ' s forces have caused 10 15 times more civilian deaths thus far than the Islamic State , whose horrific execution videos have overshadowed the Syrian dictator ' s invisible massacres . But even if you can purge all of this from your thoughts , a policy for Syria that posits Assad as an " alternative " to the Islamic State is simply not viable .
