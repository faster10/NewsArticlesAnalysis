The accuracy of the drone strikes has improved even as the pace of the program has increased over the past two years . In 2008 , the first year the drones program picked up speed in Pakistan , an average of only 43 percent of the fatalities from the strikes were reported to be militants or suspected militants . In 2009 , that figure shot up to 62 percent , and so far in 2010 it stands at 87 percent , suggesting that the nonmilitant death rate from drone strikes has dropped to around 10 percent this year , according to our database .
