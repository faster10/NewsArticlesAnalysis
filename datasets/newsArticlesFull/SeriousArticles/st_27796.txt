" If it wasn ' t ISIL , it doesn ' t mean they don ' t want to do this . They would do this and more . So , the first thing we have to realize if they had nothing to do with this bombing , they still want to kill us all . I mean , they want to kill every Christian they find . They want to purify their faith by killing every Muslim that disagrees with them , destroy Israel and attack us here at home . So , I don ' t know if they have the capability to get a bomb on board an airplane in Egypt . If they do , that ' s a great move forward for ISIL . So all I can say is they need to be degraded and destroyed , and our plan to do so is not working . " interviewed on CNN
