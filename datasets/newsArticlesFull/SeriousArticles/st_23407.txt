" Over the year we ' ve actually experienced where the third guy actually has a little bit more trouble because we ' re experiencing 95 to 97 every day , " pitching coach Dan Warthen said last week . " So the hitters are little more on time . So 95 becomes an average fastball , which it generally isn ' t . It ' s really kind of nice to be able to sandwich a Bartolo ( Colon ) or a ( Jon ) Niese in between the two powers then come back with another power guy . That ' s what I noticed more than anything else . It ' s the third guy actually gives up a frew more hits . They square him up , they have a little bit better swings . " ? ?
