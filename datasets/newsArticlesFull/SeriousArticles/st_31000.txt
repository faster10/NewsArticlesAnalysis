The problem with a woman being attacked in such a way on a national stage is that it tends to have a ripple effect , causing her also to experience a range of other sexist repercussions . For example , while commenting on the issue , Doug Gross , an Iowa Republican strategist unaffiliated with any particular campaign said : It s the only Republican debate in our state and he s not even going to show up because he s afraid of a woman reporter ? What kind of a wimp is this ? Trump s chief rival , Texas senator Ted Cruz seemed to jump on the same bandwagon , albeit more subtly , offering to debate Trump one on one ? If Donald is afraid of Megyn Kelly . The mocking of Trump for being afraid of Kelly undermines her professional status by suggesting that a female reporter is a less formidable interviewer than her male peers .
