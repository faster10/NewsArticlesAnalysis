RuPaul : I was so p ed off that people had leaked it last year . I thought , how awful that they wouldn ' t consider everyone else ' s enjoyment , but you have to understand that the human ego will do whatever it takes to get attention because it needs to know that it exists . So , people leaked that Raja was the winner last year , without thinking about other people ' s enjoyment . I was so mad , so one morning , I woke up and between the time of getting out of bed and still kind of in a dream , it occurred to me that if we shot three endings ? Then no one would know . Of course , we had to do it in front of a live audience because the show has grown so much and there ' s so much excitement . Why not turn it into a super huge event ? And you know , the taping was like the Academy Awards for drag . It was !
