Mr Sanders s campaign raised 20 million in January and has reported having 28 million on hand . That s plenty to fund him through Super ? Tuesday . But while the senator from Vermont may be leading in New Hampshire , ? he is not expected to do as well in the primary that follows , in South Carolina .
