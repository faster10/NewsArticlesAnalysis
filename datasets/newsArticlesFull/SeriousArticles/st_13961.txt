Carolina head coach Ron Rivera won a Super Bowl ring when he played with the Chicago Bears in 1985 , one of the greatest Super Bowl teams of all time . Now , he is playing against another head coach who played in Super Bowls in Gary Kubiak . Rivera plans to bring his Super Bowl ring with him when he travels to California for Super Bowl 50 , but he said that he won t wear it while coaching the game . He does show the ring to his players , letting them see what hard work can earn . I ve tried to make the point that it represents everything that you ve gone through and the people that have played , Rivera said . It s not necessarily about the ring . It s the people it stands for .
