The primary concern of Indian negotiators would be to ensure that there is nothing in the agreement that harms Indian interests . India is looking at rapid economic growth in the next few years , because of which its greenhouse gas emissions will grow . India is already the world s fourth biggest emitter , though the gap between it and the top three is a big one . Although no country has demanded that India reduce its greenhouse gases , there have been repeated suggestions that , just as the developed countries are required to act , so too must brakes of some sort be applied on the emissions by India . Indian negotiators will obviously be working to ensure that no proposal that hampers India s ability to decide its economic growth roadmap is included in the agreement .
