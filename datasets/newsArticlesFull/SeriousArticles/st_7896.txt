Finally , there must be a corresponding responsibility on the part of citizens to avoid drugs and alcohol and obey the law . There must also be a continued demand by the rest of us that our fellow citizens engage in moral and ethical behavior . We must insist that concepts like nobility , duty and honor are not sacrificed on the altar of relativism . Nothing distresses me more than the e mails I receive attempting to explain away the antisocial and criminal behavior of some of our neighbors as the result of poverty and or racism . ( Left unanswered , of course , is why they who have also been targets of racism and economic hardship are not engaged in criminal behavior . )
