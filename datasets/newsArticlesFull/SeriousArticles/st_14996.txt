Fourthly , the Coalition has threatened to abolish the Refugee Review Tribunal ( RRT ) , the independent body that reviews decisions made by government officials about whether or not people are refugees . This is because the RRT has found that many governmental decisions are flawed . But rather than probing the quality of government decision making , the Coalition has decided to get rid of the reviewer . This undermines a central tenet of a functioning administrative law system . Life or death decisions cannot be reviewed . Further , the Coalition ' s weekend announcement that it will strip legal aid from asylum seekers increases this risk of poor initial decision making and heightens the chance of refoulement or the expulsion of people with the right to be recognized as refugees .
