Arguably the hottest topic in the U . S . for the last few weeks has been how to deal with the Syrian refugee crisis . Worldvision states that there are 4 . 3 million Syrian refugees . It s difficult to imagine that number of people seeking to settle somewhere . American opinion covers a wide range . Some feel our current refugee vetting process is sufficient and nothing needs to change . There are some who , like Governor Abbott , object to current law that says states can t refuse refugees and are seeking to change that . And some agree with Donald Trump that we should block the entry of all Muslims to the country until we learn more about the refugees and current terrorism activity . Mitch McConnell has stated that he believes the Syrian refugee crisis will be included in the omnibus bill Congress has to approve this week in order to avoid a shutdown . Passion is high on all sides and is bound to remain so for the foreseeable future .
