It was also nice to get a question on the Puerto Rico crisis , a grave concern for our Puerto Rican brothers and sisters here on the mainland and on the island . While this question was only addressed by Jeb Bush , his answer seemed to support some Congressional solution , despite his non support for default on the debt that is saddling Puerto Rico . Still , he supported self determination , and displayed displeasure with the situation . As the former governor of Florida , with a sizable and growing Puerto Rican population , Bush seemed empathetic and informed in his discussion on the issue .
