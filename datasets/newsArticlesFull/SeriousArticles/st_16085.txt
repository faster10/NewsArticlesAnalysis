1 . Sam Mills : If you based this solely on statistics , Mills would be well down the list . But Mills , an original Panther , embodied everything Jerry Richardson wanted the organization to represent when he founded it in 1995 . There ' s a reason Mills , a 5 foot 9 middle linebacker , is the only Carolina player with a statue outside Bank of America Stadium . He represented class on the field and off . His interception of a shovel pass and return for a touchdown against the Jets in 1995 sparked the team ' s first win . In ' 96 , at 37 , Mills led the second year franchise to a 12 4 record and the NFC Championship Game . He also made the Pro Bowl that year . He played three seasons for Carolina before transitioning into personnel and coaching positions with the franchise . He died in 2005 . The " Keep Pounding " speech he gave during Carolina ' s 2003 run to the Super Bowl , while he was battling cancer , remains the franchise ' s mantra . You can argue Newton is the most talented player in team history , and in time he ' ll likely top this list . That might even happen after Super Bowl 50 . But when you understand all Mills meant to this organization when it began , and what he still means today , you ' ll understand why he is No . 1 here and now .
