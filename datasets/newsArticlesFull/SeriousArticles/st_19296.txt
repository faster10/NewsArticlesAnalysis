It s a white industry . Just as the NBA is a black industry . I m not even saying it s a bad thing . It just is . And the black people they do hire tend to be the same person . That person tends to be female and that person tends to be Ivy League . And there s nothing wrong with that . As a matter of fact , that s what I want for my daughters . But something tells me that the life my privileged daughters are leading right now might not make them the best candidates to run the black division of anything . And the person who runs the black division of a studio should probably have worked with black people at some point in their life . Clint Culpepper a white studio chief who specializes in black movies does a good job at Screen Gems because he s the kind of guy who would actually go see Best Man Holiday . But how many black men have you met working in Hollywood ? They don t really hire black men . A black man with bass in his voice and maybe a little hint of facial hair ? Not going to happen . It is what it is . I m a guy who s accepted it all .
