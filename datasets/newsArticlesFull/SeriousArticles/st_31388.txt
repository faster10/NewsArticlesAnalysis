There is no proper sanitation , and people have taken to relieving themselves in the open air . Heavy rains have caused flooding . These unsanitary conditions , experts believe , will lead to the spread of disease . As much as half of the vulnerable population is likely to need medical care . Wadha and her son Majdi , with his wife , are hopeful that the family ' s 3 week old baby will be among those who live through the winter . The family hasn ' t named the baby girl yet , in case she doesn ' t survive .
