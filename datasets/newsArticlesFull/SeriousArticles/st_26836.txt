Other nominations that I m grateful for : Casual . Hulu s poignant low fi comedy improved as it went along to become a true gem . Nominated for Best Comedy , the series isn t the equal to other streaming sensations like Master of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ( both of which failed to get a nod in this category ) , but I m glad it got recognized . And besides , Aziz Ansari was nominated for Best Actor in a comedy for his work in Master of None . And while I m bummed that Ellie Kemper and the entire Kimmy crew was completely ignored by the Globes , I m elated that the wildly talented Rachel Bloom was nominated for Best Actress in a comedy , Crazy Ex Girlfriend . ? I m not surprised that Fargo scored a handful of nominations for its second season , but I m impressed all the same that Patrick Wilson was honored for his powerful , deep performance of old school heroism challenged by modern madness . Finally , I m glad the Globes got behind the sexy and rough period drama Outlander in a major way , giving Caitriona Balfe , so nuanced and raw , and Tobias Menzies , in a mesmerizing , unsettling performance of human evil , the recognition that their bold , exposing work deserves . Gimme your martini , Ricky ! A toast to all .
