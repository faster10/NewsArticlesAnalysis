" Frozen " is more than holding its own against the behemoth blockbuster . Disney ' s animated musical pulled in 26 . 3 million on Wednesday and Thursday ( 15 . 2 million , then 11 . 1 million ) , a substantially bigger start than Tangled , which grossed 19 . 9 million in its first two days in 2010 . That film wound up earning 48 . 8 million over the following Friday to Sunday period ( 2 . 45 times its Wednesday Thursday gross ) , and if we apply the same metric to Frozen , it ' s set to gross 64 million over the traditional weekend frame for a stunning 90 million five day start .
