While there ' s little doubt that Paul wants " every able bodied person back in the work force , " there is ample reason to believe he and others have it upside down and backward . Jobless insurance isn ' t a cause of unemployment . That ' s caused by an economy that , on its own , would take more than seven years , by one estimate , to return to pre 2008 levels . What ' s more , Paul ' s clumsy attempt to retake the moral high ground reflects another puzzle that no Republican or Democrat has thus far faced : How can we continue to promote the values of freedom , hard work and self reliance when even a full time job isn ' t enough to get by ?
