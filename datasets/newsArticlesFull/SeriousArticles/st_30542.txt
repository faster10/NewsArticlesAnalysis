As of the end of October at least 2400 civilians had been killed , a large majority including three fourths of children , by United Nations count from misdirected Saudi airstrikes . Other estimates were closer to 3000 . Reported journalist Bryan Schatz : " The Saudi coalition has repeatedly targeted schools , hospitals , and religious buildings . Civilian infrastructure , including a camp for displaced people , water supplies , and power stations , have been destroyed . Civilian hospitals overloaded with patients injured by airstrikes yet painfully under supplied because of coalition blockades are nearing collapse . "
