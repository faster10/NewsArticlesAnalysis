But the Vermont Senator will likely need a resounding victory in New Hampshire if he wants to remain a serious challenger to Clinton . His loss in Iowa is likely the first of many ? We re gonna win some states , we re gonna lose some states , Sanders conceded on the flight ? and a near tie in early states is not enough for him to win the nomination . New Hampshire will be hotly contested battleground . The state has helped boost the Clintons in the past , giving Bill Clinton a much needed launchpad in 1992 to take the Democratic nomination . In 2008 , Clinton dropped her guard in the state after an Iowa loss and won just days after losing in Iowa to Barack Obama .
