An important aspect of the improvement of Moustakas and Hosmer is that it s difficult to get the platoon advantage against the Royals . One reason Madison Bumgarner was able to mow through the Royals a year ago was that those two struggled against lefties . And now , with switch hitters Ben Zobrist and Kendrys Morales in the No . 2 and No . 5 spots in the batting order , Ned Yost goes R S R L S L R L R . Only No . 9 hitter Alex Rios and leadoff hitter Alcides Escobar are same side hitters who hit back to back .
