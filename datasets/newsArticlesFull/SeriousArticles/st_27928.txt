Bill Clinton is regularly mentioned on the debate stage and across the campaign trail , and tonight was no exception . Tonight , Senator Bernie Sanders was asked by Andrea Mitchell if he regrets having said that Bill Clinton s past sexual indiscretions were deplorable . Sanders was not amused by the question . That question , annoys me , said Sanders . I cannot walk down the street , Secretary Clinton knows that , without being told how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton . Sanders chalked up his previous comments to the goading he faces to attack Hillary Clinton , something he says he s trying to avoid . But tonight , Sanders doubled down on his previous comments that the former president s comments were disgusting at an Iowa town hall . Yes , his behavior was deplorable . Have I said a word ? No , I have not , he said . I ' m going to debate Secretary Clinton , Governor O ' Malley on the issues facing the American people , not Bill Clinton ' s personal behavior .
