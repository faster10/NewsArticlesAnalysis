? I regret that Caroline Lucas has distanced herself from Stop the War at a time when she is more than ever needed . I understand that she disapproved of the blog Reaping the Whirlwiind , which , written by an independent commentator , was removed from the StWC site , when it was obviously causing opposition ( Letters , 9 December ) . I ? have read the blog and I sent a strongly worded protest to Stop the War for pulling it . It seemed to me perfctly fair comment . Does nobody remember Auden s famous lines : Those to whom evil is done Do evil in return .
