Jupiter ' s icy moon Europa may be the best place in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life , according to NASA . The moon is about the size of Earth ' s moon , and there is evidence it has an ocean beneath its frozen crust that may hold twice as much water as Earth . NASA ' s 2016 budget includes a request for 30 million to plan a mission to investigate Europa . The image above was taken by the Galileo spacecraft on November 25 , 1999 . It ' s a 12 frame mosaic and is considered the the best image yet of the side of Europa that faces Jupiter .
