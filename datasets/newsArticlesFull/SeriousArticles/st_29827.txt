James is the special sort of player who terrifies opposing coaches and makes them alter what they normally do . He ' s also the special sort of player who changes how his own coaches have to approach their jobs , if only because of the scrutiny and high expectations . Beyond that , though , it is becoming clearer and clearer that a lot of behind the scenes games come with coaching James . Maybe Blatt was simply the wrong man for that job maybe the deck was stacked against him from the beginning . We ' ll see how Lue does .
