Yet , the real revelation of the day was Clinton herself . If I had spent 11 hours being lectured by a bunch of clownish interrogators , I d probably be climbing the walls by the end . Not Clinton . She didn t get angry or lose her temper . She maintained her composure and stamina and ran circles around the GOP members , both in the depth of her knowledge but also with her nimbleness in deflecting the committee s attacks . It would have been hard for her not to look good by comparison , but that shouldn t take away from how impressive she was in her testimony .
