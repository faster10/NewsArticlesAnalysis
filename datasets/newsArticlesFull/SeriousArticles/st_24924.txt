This was a Gruber speech . It was designed to sound acceptable to the American people , even if it was largely a lie . For those not familiar with Jonathan Gruber , a now infamous co architect of Obamacare who described how Obamacare was written " in a tortured way to make sure " the Congressional Budget Office did not " score the mandate as taxes , " even though the administration knew it was a tax . He described how the administration won support for the tax on " Cadillac " health plans " by mislabeling it , calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people , when we know it ' s a tax on people who hold these insurance plans . " With Obamacare , Gruber concluded , " the lack of transparency " was " a huge political advantage " and " the stupidity of the American voter " was " really , really critical for the thing to pass .
