As for Trump and Cruz This morning ' s brand new Des Moines Register Bloomberg poll , considered the gold standard of Iowa polling , almost mirrors the latest NBC News WSJ Marist Iowa poll released on Sunday . The DMR survey has Cruz at 25 , Trump 22 , Rubio 12 , and Carson at 11 all other Republicans get less than 5 . NBC ' s Hallie Jackson notices in the poll that 83 of GOP voters said the so called " birther " issue regarding Ted Cruz doesn ' t bother them . But NBC ' s Vaughn Hillyard points out that 42 find Cruz ' s stance on phasing out the ethanol subsidy to be unattractive , versus 37 who say it ' s attractive . So it ' s entirely possible that the ethanol story not the birther charges is the more damaging to Cruz . The Des Moines Register says the Democratic numbers are coming out tomorrow morning .
