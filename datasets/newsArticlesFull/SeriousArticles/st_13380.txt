In Cech , the Czech Republic can lay claim to the world ' s best goalkeeper . Tall and commanding yet alert and agile , his glaring mistake at last summer ' s European Championships , which resulted in Turkey ' s progressing at the Czechs ' expense , was a rare blip in his short trophy laden career . Rennes spotted him playing for Sparta Prague while he was still a teenager in 2002 and two years later moneybags Chelsea spent 10M on him a fee that now looks like a bargain . After helping Chelsea to back to back Premier League titles , Cech fractured his skull in 2006 , but he has returned headgear and all just as good . Only 26 , his best years are ahead of him .
