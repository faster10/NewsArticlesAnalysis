First , prices are starting to edge up already . Eurostat has already revised up the October inflation rate to 0 . 1 ? not much , but something . High Frequency Economics forecasts that , come January , it could be up to 1 , or at least close to it . Why ? Because the big drop in oil prices and other commodities will start to drop out of the year on year indices by then , and that will inevitably push it higher . It may be a technicality , but pretty fast the inflation rate will make it look as if the extra blast of QE is having an impact , and that will be good for confidence .
