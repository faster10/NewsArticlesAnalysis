The most relevant issue was Libya policy , but Republicans barely touched on it . As with most foreign policy issues , their main interest was to leave an impression of Democratic malfeasance . To take the matter further they d have to say what they d do instead and they can t . Republicans always clamor for military action but never take responsibility for it . The Constitution they profess to love gives Congress sole power to declare war . When we went after Qaddafi they controlled Congress , but took a pass . Full of patriotic gore , they aren t brave enough to debate a war , let alone fight one . U . S . military interventions made the Middle East the transnational charnel house it is today . Clinton and the Republicans backed them all . A Benghazi hearing would be a fit place to ask how it all worked out but it s hard to get a debate going when the two sides see eye to eye .
