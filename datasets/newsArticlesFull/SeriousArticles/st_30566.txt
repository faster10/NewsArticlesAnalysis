JL : Well , that s a very good question : everybody was scratching their heads about this . I think , in part , because it would be very difficult to get Syrians to the peace talks . It was quite clear that the U . S . was going to ask for Assad to go . Assad s not going to go to peace talks where that s going to be the conversation but also , the opposition , there s a thousand five hundred , according to CIA , opposition militias . Of course , there are about 20 30 that are big , important militias , but they re not going to go and talk to Assad . So , if you waited to get all of the opposition and Assad together to go , you could wait till hell freezes over . I think that the Great Powers decided that we re going to meet anyway and , after all , the Syrians , both sides , in Syria , are so weak today and so poor , that they depend almost entirely on the outside powers to give them arms , to give them weapons and support . So , if the outside powers could come to some agreement , it would make a dramatic difference on the amount of people being killed inside Syria .
