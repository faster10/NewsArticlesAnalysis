Turkey s annual demand for gas is projected to rise by roughly a third in the next decade to 2 . 3 trillion cubic feet , according to a study published last year by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies . Besides Russia , Azerbaijan appears the logical source for that extra gas , and work has already started on a pipeline to expand imports from there . Edward Chow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that this supply option also holds the potential to diversify Turkey s gas sources further , taking in some from northern Iraq and Iran .
