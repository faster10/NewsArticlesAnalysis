Then Strang played a recording in which Colburn read off a plate number and the dispatcher on the line told him it belonged to a missing person , Teresa Halbach . 99 Toyota ? he asked in the recording . Strang then asked Colburn if he was looking at the plates at the time of the call ? how else would he have the plate number , or if he did , what was he calling to check on ? ( Redditors continue to debate what else this could mean . ) Colburn s call to dispatch was recorded on Nov . 3 , 2005 , two days before the car was reported found in the Avery lot . Meaning that if Colburn wasn t telling the truth , the timeline the police said the case adhered to was also untrue , also leaving time for the tampering they say wasn t going on .
