McMahill also confirmed that Jerad Miller had written on his Facebook page that he had been ejected from the Bundy Ranch , the Nevada site where armed ranchers as well some with anti government militia ties held off federal officials at gunpoint in April . However , McMahill was not able to confirm Miller ' s actual presence at the ranch . ( Cliven Bundy ' s son Ammon said that " state militia members " told him the Millers had been at the ranch , but were asked by a militia member to leave because of " their radical beliefs . " )
