I think there s different tools at different times with different players . Some guys may think I m being really hard on them , but I don t think I m being hard on them at all , he said . I just think , ultimately , we re all trying to get to the same place . You ve got to have different leadership styles with different players . I think there s always a sense of urgency . Every day , you re trying to create some urgency so you can realize the importance of what we re trying to do for ourselves , for our team . Because everyone puts a lot of work into this . There s a lot of people that sacrifice a lot to get to this point . This is not a one week event . This is a year round thing you commit your life to , to play in moments like this . This is when you need to be at your best .
