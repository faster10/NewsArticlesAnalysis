This is true . We can never know with 100 ? percent ? certainty if these allegations are simply part of the same right wing lying machine that accuses the Clintons of witchcraft , murder and kitty killing , or if the right lucked out and found the one damn thing that Clinton did do . But feminists do not and have never said that sexual assault ? accusers need to be held to a lower standard of proof than people who accuse of other crimes , just the same standard of proof . And while Harding is right that multiple accusers , in most cases , sets up a pattern , it s equally true that there s another pattern at work here , of multiple right wingers making lurid and false accusations against the Clintons . Under the circumstances , there s simply no way to know which pattern ? these accusations fit into .
