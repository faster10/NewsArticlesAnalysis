6 . ' The Man Who Killed Don Quixote ' ( Terry Gilliam , unfinished ) Terry Gilliam ' s attempt to bring Cervantes ' s hero to the big screen began unraveling from the first day of filming . Lead actor Jean Rochefort immediately fell ill , and if that wasn ' t calamitous enough , a flash flood washed away the entire set in northern Spain . Rochefort eventually ended up in the hospital and since co star Johnny Depp had other commitments and couldn ' t wait for Rochefort to recover , Gilliam was forced to abandon the film . The whole shoot is chronicled in 2002 documentary " Lost in La Mancha . " The ambitious director recently told movie magazine , Empire , that the project is up and running again and that shooting will begin next spring . No word yet though on who will play the man of La Mancha .
