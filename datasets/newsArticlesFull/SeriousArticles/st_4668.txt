With both offenses stuck on no touchdowns inside of the two minute warning of the fourth quarter , Jackson caught a punt and tried to make something happen . He ran forward to the 24 yard line , then ran all the way back to about the 2 . And then he got hit and fumbled it away to the Cowboys . McFadden scored a few moments later , the first touchdown of the game , to give the Cowboys a 16 9 lead . But by scoring , instead of just getting the first down , Washington had time to put together a drive .
