When we saw that we would be playing Switzerland in the first round , we were supporting them in the final against France . Because we knew if Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka won the trophy , they would probably stop . Which is what happened : I played Adrien Bossel the world No 334 in the fifth rubber . Against Canada in the quarter final , we had a little bit of chance but injuries are part of the sport . Milos Raonic wasn t fit and Vasek Pospisil was tired after Wimbledon . So we won again and then we beat Argentina in the semis . We played every tie at home so this year is our year ! And I hope it will be the same in the final .
