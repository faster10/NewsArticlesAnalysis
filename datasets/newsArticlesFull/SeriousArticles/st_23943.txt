I saw a quote from Michael Caine where he alluded to black actors waiting their turn to get their nomination and that it can take years before they get one . It takes a lot longer to get a nomination when you aren ' t given the type of roles that help you shine in a way that would lead to recognition . It ' s hard to have a standout performance without a well written part . It takes a lot longer when you have to compete among the majority of black actors and actresses in Hollywood for a minute number of pivotal roles . It takes a lot longer when no one believes your stories are worth telling . If we can remove that barrier and allow the diverse stories and roles to flood the industry , the problem will resolve itself . I also think the industry will find they make more money as the viewers they are alienating migrate to the theaters .
