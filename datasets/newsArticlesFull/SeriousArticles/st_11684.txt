The gas potential is huge and largely unrealized . Libya already sends gas to Italy by pipeline , but it is a much less significant producer than its neighbor Algeria . It would like to find more gas and take a larger slice of the European market . Shell and BP are amongst those already involved in expensive projects to make this happen . New exploration contracts could be issued : French and British companies could benefit . Italy ' s Eni is already a predominant player , and has returned to the country more quickly than its competitors .
