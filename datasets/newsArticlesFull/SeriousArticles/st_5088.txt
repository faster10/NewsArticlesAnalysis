It s important for the veteran guys always to set a good example of leadership , because we have some experience , Brady said . Our coach talks a lot about that being an advantage only if we use it as experience . So I think that we re challenged in a lot of different ways . Every team at this point that s still playing at this point is a great football team . They have a lot of things that every team does well . Nobody s first in the league in every category statistically , so you re just trying to build upon the strengths of your team and understand where your weaknesses are . And the veteran guys obviously it s good to have the experience , but it s also good to be able to communicate to the younger players what to expect , where we re heading , how we re going to get to the place we want to get to .
