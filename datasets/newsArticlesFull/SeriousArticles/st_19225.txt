In his wedding toast , " I talked about the idea of celebrity , and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the ' 60s , having no rights , and the fact that people can slander your name . I said that in the toast . And I had to say this in a position where I , from the art world , am marrying Kim . And how we ' re going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life . She didn ' t choose to be a celebrity . But she is . So I ' m going to fight to make sure she has a better life . "
