First of all , this is Politics 101 , especially for Republicans when all else fails , run against the news media . It started with Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew ( if not earlier ) and has continued straight through to Newt Gingrich four years ago and Ted Cruz in this election . That said , I ' ve read the CNBC debate questions ( so can you they ' re compiled here ) and while a few of them aren ' t what I would have asked , only one or two of them remotely resemble " gotcha questions . " Unless your idea of a " gotcha question " is a fair , hard hitting query about the seeming contradictions in one ' s policy positions or past statements . ( For actual embarrassing " gotcha questions " about trivia like lapel flag pins , check out the 2008 Democratic primary debate in Philadelphia . )
