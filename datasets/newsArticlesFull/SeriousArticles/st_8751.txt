It ' s not as if he ' s deadly accurate on short passes and just can ' t throw a 16 yard out anymore . Manning has lost a great deal of his touch and labors into and out of his throwing motion . He overthrows his receivers seemingly as frequently as he one hops passes in their direction . The amount of torque he needs to generate with his body to get zip on his passes forces him to commit to his throws earlier , making it far easier for defenders to hijack previously clear throwing lanes . His lack of arm strength is at the heart of some of Manning ' s issues , but somebody like Chad Pennington was able to succeed without an NFL caliber arm toward the end of his career while simultaneously posting solid interception rates .
