9 . " The Consequences of Love ' ( Paolo Sorrentino , 2004 ) " One of the best Italian films of the last 10 years . It ' s an interesting take on the mafia film and an alternative love story . It is about an accountant living in a hotel in Switzerland , leading an uneventful , measured life . All the violence happens off to one side and its absence is almost menacing . You don ' t realize there is anything shady about him for a long time and a love affair develops with the hotel receptionist . I think Sorrentino is a very original new voice . "
