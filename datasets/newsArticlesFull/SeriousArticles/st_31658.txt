MDEQ is the same state agency that approved a decision by the emergency manager formerly running Flint , Michigan to switch that city s water supply to the Flint River , resulting in widespread lead poisoning of its residents , including approximately 9 , 000 children under six years old . The managers were appointed by Governor Rick Snyder under a controversial 2011 law allowing the state to supplant local governments in more than a dozen financially struggling cities . The law was repealed by Michigan voters in 2012 only to be reinstated by the Republican dominated state legislature a year later .
