St . Louis Rams : Even if the Rams have a boost from installing Case Keenum as their starting quarterback , it ' s hard to overlook that an already shaky offensive line is being patched together after a slew of injuries . The Ravens don ' t have many playmakers and the Rams ' defense should be able to keep it close . Baltimore has just one win at home , but all of their home games have been within one possession , which means this will be close . We ' ll give the nod to the home team with the better , more consistent kicker . Ravens 19 , Rams 17 . Nick Wagoner
