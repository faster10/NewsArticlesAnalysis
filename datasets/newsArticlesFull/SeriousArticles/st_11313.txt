Alexander : I do believe that it can . The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful , because after all if we can ' t be precise with language , how can we share ideas ? Also the felicity of art . . . the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions . You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem , but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it , those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems .
