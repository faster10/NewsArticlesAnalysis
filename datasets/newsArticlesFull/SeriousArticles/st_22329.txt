Caleb Maupin : I am not . I feel like there is a real fear among the powers that be , not of what Bernie Sanders is , but what he could become . Let s remember that Abraham Lincoln took office on a platform of not abolishing slavery and ended up leading a massive civil war to destroy slavery and really change the country . Let s remember that Franklin D . Roosevelt when he first ran for office in 1932 , he also had a very different platform than what ended up taking place . And I feel like the fact that people not only support Bernie Sanders , but have felt the need to go out into the streets and have marches , demonstrations supporting him is very significant . There have been many presidential candidates throughout the past few decades , but rarely do we see people having these kinds of days of action , filling the streets and marching to show support for their candidate . So , something is clearly happening here . And when presidents and political figures in the US are associated with a mass movement in the streets this has potential to be something very interesting .
