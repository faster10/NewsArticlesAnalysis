Carroll ' s quest to get the Seattle Seahawks back to the Super Bowl for the third straight year fell short Sunday afternoon , and that will sting for a while , just as last year ' s loss to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl was difficult for this team to get over . Carroll will try to figure out why the team got off to such a slow start against the Carolina Panthers . He might question his decision to go for it on fourth and 5 in the second quarter rather than kick the field goal . Perhaps he ' ll revisit the sequence at the end of the first half that resulted in a missed 55 yard field goal by Steven Hauschka .
