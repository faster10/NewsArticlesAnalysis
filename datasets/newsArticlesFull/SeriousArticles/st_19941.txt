Until recently , Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four year state school . That ' s a year of time and money lost . Given that nearly 60 of students in the United States attend two or more colleges , the nontransfer of credits has huge costs , not only to individuals , but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time . If higher education doesn ' t trust its own credits , why should anyone else ? And Louisiana students aren ' t alone transfer students across the country lose credits , which lengthens their time to get a degree .
