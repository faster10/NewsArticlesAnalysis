According to Simon Critchley , a philosophy professor at the New School for Social Research and the author of a book on the artist , Bowie , the answer is a bit more complicated . When it comes to literal politics ? government and state institutions and the conventional party system ? no , Bowie might not have been all that political . But Bowie s dystopian song lyrics weren t shy about refracting Western consumerism back at Western fans . And somewhere between Bowie s gender bending persona and his actual art , he forced fans and critics to think differently about human sexuality ? and , maybe , with all of his obsession with freaks and outsiders , even consider different ways of connecting with one another . In a phone interview , Critchley explains how all of this was enough to change politics , without ever having to talk politics at all .
