One survey of two universities estimated that female students had a one in five chance of being sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years . By failing to protect their students and not properly disciplining assailants , universities are in violation of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments . Title IX , so often associated with athletic funding , also requires universities receiving federal funding to provide equal access to education for all students , regardless of gender . University administrators are falling short if they allow a culture of sexual violence to flourish .
