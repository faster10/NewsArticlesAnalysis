I was on the SDP national committee and candidate for Lewisham East , leaving me with memories of hope and despair , but also providing useful experience in writing about politics . I understand the bond MPs feel to constituency , having pounded every street , knocked on every door , every business and school . The sound of Chariots of Fire , our campaign tune , jolts me back to that illusion that surely you own this patch after so much hard work . Out with canvassers now , I see how few meaningful conversations are had for each doorstep day : contacts don t mean votes ? such monumental effort for so little return . Failure is abject , but political victory doesn t bring much glory : odd how voters revere democracy , but revile its practitioners .
