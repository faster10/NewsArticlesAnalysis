That year , Michigan Governor George Romney , who was seen as a rising star and future GOP Presidential nominee , was in the fight of his political life , trying to win re election in a state where Goldwater was widely feared . Romney stated that while he " accepted " the nomination , he would not " endorse " Goldwater . Romney was indignant at the Michigan Republican Party for producing a flyer with Goldwater and Romney together . Romney supporters mailed out about 200 , 000 mock ballots showing voters how to mark their ballots for Democratic President Lyndon B . Johnson for President and Romney for Governor . Romney was able to convince enough voters to split their tickets . While Johnson won the state with a resounding 66 . 70 of the vote , Romney was comfortably elected with 55 . 9 of the vote
