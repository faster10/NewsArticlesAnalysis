Bush can also be far more aggressive in going after Hillary Clinton . Yesterday , for example , he slammed her for suggesting in an MSNBC interview that the Veterans Affairs scandal is not been as bad as it has been made out to be . ? Bush tweeted , Hillary denying the VA has a problem is an insult to our vets . We need to make fixing the VA a priority and I plan to do just that . As he criticizes House Republicans for their ham handed Benghazi hearing , he can explain the real scandal ? Clinton let jihadists spread around the Middle East , never seeing it coming or not wanting to look . There are few conservatives who don t enjoy some Clinton bashing . Bush s challenge here would be to stand out as an anti Clinton combatant . New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , Sen . Marco Rubio ( R Fla . ) and especially Carly Fiorina have demonstrated how capable they are in savaging the Clinton record .
