Gore ' s songs usually start out in a simple style " Enjoy the Silence , " for instance , originally was a stripped down affair with Gore singing over an organ sound . " It was meant to be pastoral , and Alan ( Wilder ) at the time had the idea to put a beat to it , " Gore recalled , laughing . " I was like , ' What ? ! That ' s going against everything it ' s saying ! ' But we tried it , and then I put the guitar riff on it , and then something magical happened , and it became the first or second most popular track we ever recorded . I guarantee you it wouldn ' t have been , if we had kept the harmonium version . "
