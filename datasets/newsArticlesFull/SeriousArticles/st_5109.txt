Cyrus isn ' t the only one who ' s out for blood . Liv ' s newest acolyte , Quinn ( Lowes ) , is still practically shaking from the adrenaline boost of her first torture session under Huck ' s tutelage . Lowes admits Quinn " got a little bit of a taste for violence in the finale , " but says , " It ' s not so much that she wants to go out with a machine gun and start killing people . I don ' t think she ' s psychotic , and that ' s not how I ' m playing her . The deal is , she has had a lot of really terrible things happen to her in her life and , for the first time in a while , she was in control of the situation and she was excelling at something and she was causing pain on somebody else . It ' s that sense of control that gives her a high , that forces her to be addicted to that feeling . "
