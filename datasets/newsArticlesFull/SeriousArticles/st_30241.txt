" No matter what nationality we are or religion we choose , we are still people . I am a human being , a person that faces each day trying to make myself better and enrich the lives of people who know me , " said Dennis , who ' s lived the past year and a half in Rotterdam , Netherlands , where she works as a manufacturing project manager . " Whether I live or die should not be decided on the whim of a person that wishes to brand all Americans as evil people . I am not defined by my nationality , but I believe in the goodness that resides in the people of every country . "
