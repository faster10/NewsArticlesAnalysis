Take a moment to see if any purported seller has complaints against them on the BBB s website . You can also check to see if the seller is a registered member of the National Association of Ticket Brokers ( NATB ) . Remember , there s a big difference between a legitimate ticket seller and a ticket scalper . According to the FTC , reputable sellers offer guarantees that the tickets they sell are authentic and clearly outline their refund policies . They also will tell you the location of the seats , when the tickets will be available for pick up , or when they will ship .
