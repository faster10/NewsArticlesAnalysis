Although the News of the World portrayed itself as a beacon of morality in a sleazy world , it appears it was not averse to picking through people ' s bins in the search for a tale . On one of the whiteboards seized from his home in August 2006 , the paper ' s private detective , Glenn Mulcaire , wrote the word : " Binology . " The word " binology " rooting through people ' s rubbish to find interesting documents also appeared on an invoice submitted to the News of the World by a private detective in 2001 , when it was edited by Brooks . She told the trial : " There was a particular private detective who worked for various newspapers who would go through bins , lawyers ' bins and high profile people : Benji the Binman . And he would sell that information to newspapers . " She said she might have had some anxiety about using binology .
