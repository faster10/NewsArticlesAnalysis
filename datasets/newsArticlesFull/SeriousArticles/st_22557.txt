Here ' s what she told us : " Apple ' s never sued jailbreakers , but they claim it violates the DMCA , and thus there ' s a legal cloud . If they were right , they could stop people from jailbreaking the phones , i . e . get an injunction . Now , they can ' t . Even if it violates contract law , they ' d have to sue , and all they could get would be a tiny bit of money . It greatly decreases any incentive they might have or develop to sue . And it takes injunction off the table . Which means that the law will not , in the next three years , prevent people from jailbreaking their phones . "
