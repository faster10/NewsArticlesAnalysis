Later on television , I saw media Rabbi Shmuley Boteach , who used to claim to be the personal spiritual guide of Michael Jackson , until that presumably became less sellable . I also once had the displeasure of debating him on the subject of evolution , which he essentially rejects , offering admonition to those who , with very good reason , may question a God who could willingly allow the slaughter of children . I would argue that times like these are very good times to question your faith in deities .
