Today when Americans honor the Rev . Dr Martin Luther King , they celebrate his public bravery , principles of human dignity and commitment to justice . They also follow his model of stepping into the public to engage in reasoned debate . Such engagement also reminds Americans of their right to privacy in their own homes and lives , where they can be free to form their beliefs , test and refine ideas with loved ones before sharing them with the public . Martin Luther King ' s loss of privacy was appalling on many levels . We can ' t unknow those private details , but we can defend private life and the public freedom of speech , and we can follow his lead in demanding justice over the status quo .
