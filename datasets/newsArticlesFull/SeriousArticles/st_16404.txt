OK , let s get this disclaimer out of the way first : Jim Caldwell is a terrible coach and based on facial expressions and movement , might not actually be alive . I am still convinced he s some sort of animatronic drone that will simply shut down when game situations move beyond his basic 8 bit programming . This is probably why he actually had two defenders wide on the sidelines playing some sort of run contingency and didn t have massive Lions wideout Calvin Johnson playing center field in the end zone . This led to it being a 6 on 5 in the end zone with no one to front Richard Rodgers . Coaching Incompetence 101 cost the Lions dearly on this last play .
