Rihanna s Anti album campaign has been a case study in how not to release music . Having missed her usual November release date in both 2013 and 2014 , the assumption was she d follow 2012 s Unapologetic at some point in 2015 . Rumoured release dates in the summer and then in November came and went , while world tours were announced and annoying , sponsorship heavy teaser campaigns spluttered towards an end that seemed unlikely to ever come . Then suddenly on Wednesday a new single , Work , appeared , which has now been followed by the album , albeit in a typically shambolic way ( apparently it was uploaded by accident to the streaming platform Tidal , in which Rihanna has a stake , but someone bought it and leaked it before it was taken down . It was later reposted officially , before Rihanna then decided to give it away for free .
