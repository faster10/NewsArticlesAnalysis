' We played two different games : the first half and the second . Until the first goal was a very normal game and after that we concede an easy goal and played very bad until the first half finished . ' In the second half I think we played well , we scored one goal and had two or three more chances to draw . ' After that we repeat the same mistake as last year , which was to have one player sent off . ' It is very difficult to play against Barcelona with 10 . We finished with the penalty and Joe saved very well .
