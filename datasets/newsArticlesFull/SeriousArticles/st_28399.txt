For the past several days , I had been in refugee camps along the border between Syria and Lebanon . Over the past 12 years , I have covered wars , natural disasters and other tragedies as a medical reporter , which meant the very worst stories filtered down to me . I remember a child who lost both her legs after stepping on a land mine in Iraq . I remember a family standing in a decimated home in Sri Lanka , having lost all it owned . In Port au Prince , Haiti , I saw young children searching for their parents in large garbage dumpsters , hoping to catch a final glimpse of them . Pakistan was full of stories of families swept away by the floods that soaked one fifth of the nation . Some of the very worst stories are happening again .
