The latest , a fractious four set schooling by the Serb 12 months ago , might have broken Murray s will for good . Perhaps he was the victim of some strange southern hemisphere hex , one that mirrored Bjorn Borg s failure to win a US Open despite reaching four finals in six years ? It is not in his nature , though , to be fatalistic . My No 1 goal is to win here , just because of the number of times I have been close , he says of the tournament that starts next week . I have made four finals , one other semi final , but I haven t managed to get over the final hurdle . I hope , if I keep giving myself the opportunities , that I ll be able to . It would mean a lot .
