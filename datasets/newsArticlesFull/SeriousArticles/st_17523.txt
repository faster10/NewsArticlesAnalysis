In immigration policy , there are no quick fixes that allow us to tie together the moral , the workable and the democratic . The migrant crisis is a long standing one and whatever policies are conjured up will not solve it this year or next . Indeed , the key problem lies not at the level of policy at all , but at the level of attitude and perception . That is why we need to think more in the long term . Liberal immigration policies can be enforced only by winning public support , not in spite of public opposition . Winning such support is not a chimera , there is no iron law that the public must be irrevocably hostile to immigration . Large sections of the public have become hostile because they have come to associate immigration with unacceptable change .
