According to Ali al Ahmed , a dissident Saudi exile who now runs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington , there have been thousands of Saudi fighters and suicide attackers among the al Qaida and ISIS forces in Iraq , Syria , Yemen and elsewhere . Those thousands of people were the products of whom ? al Ahmed asks . Of Iran ? No . They are the products of the Saudi system , which tacitly encourages or tolerates Sunni militants , he says , as long as they do not carry out attacks within the kingdom . Al Ahmed has written extensively about the virulent anti Semitism and anti Christian rhetoric found in the textbooks provided to every Saudi educated child .
