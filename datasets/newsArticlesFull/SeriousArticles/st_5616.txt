Can the Cowboys win the division ? The logical answer is no , if only because of the talent level and the schedule . Darren McFadden and Robert Turbin are struggling at running back and Matt Cassel isn ' t the answer at quarterback , looking woefully undermanned ( again ) on Monday . The Packers in Lambeau Field are next , followed by the Jets at home , the Bills on the road and a rematch with Washington at home in Week 17 . If you ' re optimistic about the teams in the NFC East , eight wins is going to win it . But the reality is seven wins will probably take it it ' s hard to imagine Dallas winning three of four to close out .
