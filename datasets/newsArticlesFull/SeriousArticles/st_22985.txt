Asked whether he had any concern about being too bold in 2016 , Ryan said , I don t have that fear , I never have . Ryan continued : We should run in 2016 on who we are , what we believe , what we will do if elected so that if we are given the honor of winning the election by the people of this country , then we have an obligation to do that . And we will have an honest election . When quizzed whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would agree with that view , Ryan smiled and said , he will . "
