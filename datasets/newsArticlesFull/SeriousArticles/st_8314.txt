There are eight missions in the single player campaign , with plenty of weapons and vehicles from which to choose . Combat in the game seemed more strategic than the straightforward , hard charging style we ' ve come to know from previous " Halo " titles . For example , using the armor ' s jump pack accessory allows players to leap up to hidden spots and pick off enemies . And other armor abilities allow Master Chief to create a floating turret , which I found great for thinning out a battlefield before wading in .
