Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel s early experience of both anti Semitism and apathy in Nazi Germany set the tone for the rest of his life . He was an expert in the study of the biblical prophets , and used their examples as inspiration to speak out clearly against injustice and inequality . Heschel met Dr Martin Luther King Jr . in 1963 during a Chicago conference on race and religion . The two struck up a friendship , and on March 21 , 1965 , Heschel joined forces with Dr King for the historic march from Selma . He said later that he felt as if his legs were praying . "
