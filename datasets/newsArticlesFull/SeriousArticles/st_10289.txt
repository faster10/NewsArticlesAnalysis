As we turned to leave the park , I looked back at the river , still ebbing rapidly . I knew that the tides would turn and the storm arrive in full fury . And I thought of the most vulnerable structure in Manhattan , the sea wall at the southern tip of the island . This wall , which protects the city ' s subways from flooding , is nine feet high , usually a firm bulwark . But it faces three forces that bring waters higher . The tides are the first , and the second is the water pushed coastward by storms . The third is climate change .
