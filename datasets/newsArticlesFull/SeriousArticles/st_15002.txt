Willimon : Francis is an extreme example because he says , I don ' t have ideals in the traditional sense . I think he sees an intransigent belief system as a form of cowardice because it dictates your behavior for you . You don ' t have to make hard choices , you don ' t have to come up with solutions , you don ' t have to compromise , you don ' t have to think outside the box . That ' s like a sanctioned form of impotence that has the appearance of strength , but not if you scratch the surface .
