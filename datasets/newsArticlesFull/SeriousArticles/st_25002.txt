When all else fails and you just can ' t get the fare you want , think about off season travel . In a guidebook , look up your destination ' s high ( or peak ) season , low season , and in between ( or " shoulder " ) season . Then travel at a time when your destination is less crowded and travel costs are correspondingly lower . But don ' t get rained on : before you opt for a cheaper season , you ' ll want to know about the average weather , so search your guidebook ( or a site like weather . com ) for monthly trends .
