AT : Entrepreneurship is a journey , it ' s not a destination . There are going to be so many challenges , you are going to get knocked down so many times , but you ' ve got to get up , dust yourself off and get back to it . The persistence , the passion , and staying on course is very crucial . You ' ll be tempted to cut corners , you ' ll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker , but it never lasts . People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow we ' re not . We ' re the leaders of today , but it ' s our responsibility to take the seat at the table .
