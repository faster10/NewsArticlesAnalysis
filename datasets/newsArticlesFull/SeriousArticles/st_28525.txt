" The problem is there are people in this country . . . who want this president to have an asterisk next to his name in the history books . . . . They can ' t stand the idea that he ' s president and a piece of it is racism . " Matthews continued , " It is the sense that the white race must rule . That ' s what racism is . And they can ' t stand the idea that a man who is not white is president . That is real . That sense of racial superiority and rule is in the hearts of some people in this country , not all conservatives , not even all right wingers . . . . And a big part of it is bought into by people like John Boehner . "
