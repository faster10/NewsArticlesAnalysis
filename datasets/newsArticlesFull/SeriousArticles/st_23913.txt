I ve written many times that one cannot listen to President Barack Obama s words when he discusses the Islamic State and protecting America from terrorism . You have to look at the results of his actions , the consequences of his policies . These results include the establishment of a murderous Islamic caliphate across the Middle East , providing a safe space for jihadis to plan and train for attacks against our homeland and elsewhere . The entire Afghanistan war was fought to deny such a place to terrorists , after the horrors of 9 11 . George Bush s call to fight them over there so you don t have to fight them over here , still rings true .
