Despite the abundance of key departures , expect Urban Meyer to still have Ohio State competing for a Big Ten title and a playoff berth . Meyer has recruited almost as well as Saban has , bringing in the eighth ( 2015 ) , fifth ( 14 ) , first ( 13 ) and third ( 12 ) recruiting classes , according to Scout . com . Those last two classes are still not draft eligible , forcing playmakers like quarterback J . T . Barrett and linebacker Raekwon McMillan to stay in Columbus . With no QB drama this off season , Barrett can enter Week 1 poised to lead the Buckeyes offense and take snaps from returning All Big Ten honoree Pat Elflein , who is set to slide from guard to center . Defensive end Tyquan Lewis will be back after topping Bosa in sacks this season ( eight to Bosa s five , though that was undoubtedly due to the attention Bosa drew from opposing offensive lines ) .
