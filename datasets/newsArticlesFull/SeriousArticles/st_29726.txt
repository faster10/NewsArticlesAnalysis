But embracing ? the one involving Ted ? Cruz in which Ben Carson played a supporting role ? seems to have helped Trump regain his post Iowa stride . Trump ' s narrative , which popped up late yesterday and hit the big time today : he isn ' t a loser after all . He ' s just a winner who ' s ? been cheated . . . by Ted Cruz . And so ? he ' ll " probably sue " to have the Iowa ? election results overturned , ? the second time he ' s ? floated the idea of suing Cruz in as many months ( the first was , of course , over Cruz ' s Canadian history . )
