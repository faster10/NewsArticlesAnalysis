The most recent draft of the letter , meanwhile , now reads less like a list of demands and more like a polite request for logistical information . Gone are the early requests that the networks promise to do away with lightning rounds and yes or no questions , while providing candidates with the chance to give opening and closing statements and campaigns with final say over on screen biographical graphics . Also gone : The much mocked request that networks promise to keep the temperature in the debate hall below 67 degrees . The only thing resembling an actual demand that remains in the current letter is a question asking if the networks will commit to provide an equal number of questions to each candidate . Even that is a drastically toned down version of the original request , which called for moderators to commit to provide equal time an equal number of questions of equal quality ( substance as opposed to gotcha or frivolous ) to each candidate .
