EB : ? Well , one of the things that kind of muddles the scheme a little bit is that in the United States , we tend to think of ourselves as having a pretty simple right left spectrum . And Donald ' s way on the right and Bernie ' s way on the left . And that ' s not exactly how they ' re lined up . What Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump both have is this narrative of American decline . Donald Trump , you can see it in his campaign slogan Make America Great Again . With the idea being that America has fallen from a period of former greatness . And Bernie similarly says we need to recover our democracy , we take our government back from big money , we need to get jobs back to the failing middle class . And so I think that what voters are identifying is that both of them see especially a white , working class decline . And that has become a major focus of each of their campaigns . ?
