At about 7 a . m . one day last November , Claudia sent me a Facebook message about her best friend , Jane . ( All names have been altered . ) Jane was pregnant with twins , one of whom had been diagnosed with both Down syndrome and a heart defect .

Claudia wrote , " They told me it ' s super easy to find adoptive parents because lots of people want kids with special needs . Right now , their plan is to leave the baby at the hospital , and failing that the fire station . "
