The nosedive in relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after a well orchestrated bonhomie between the two countries has indeed been a cause of worry for Pakistan , stakeholders in peace and security in our region and the world community , particularly US and its NATO allies . This disruption was attributable to a host of factors including revelation about the demise of Mullah Umar , the ensuing struggle within the ranks of Taliban for leadership of the movement , attacks by Taliban in Kabul in August for which Ghani blamed Pakistan , pressure built by the proponents of the war economy and the war lords , unprecedented institutional corruption within Afghanistan , burgeoning crimes , geo political realities nurtured by Indo Pakistan animosity , strong anti Pakistan lobby within Afghanistan , shrinking writ of the Afghan government and strong nexus between RAW and Afghan NDS .
