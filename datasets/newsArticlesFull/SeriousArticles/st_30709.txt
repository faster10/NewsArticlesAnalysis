Those willing to make excuses for Gingrich ' s cheating on his second wife , Marianne , with his current wife , Callista ( he also cheated on wife No . 1 with Marianne , who later became wife No . 2 ) are quick to say that the Christian faith requires forgiveness . And that is absolutely right . But when has Gingrich apologized to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for his routine missives declaring both of them morally corrupt ? When has Gingrich ever said publicly that while he was ripping others to shreds , he was doing the same to his marriage vows to forsake all others ?
