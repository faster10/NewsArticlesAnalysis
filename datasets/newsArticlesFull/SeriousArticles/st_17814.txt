One exciting concept is pre exposure prophylaxis or PrEP , giving preventive doses of anti HIV drugs to individuals who are at an increased risk of HIV infection . This still experimental strategy is based on the concept that if HIV replication can be inhibited immediately following exposure to the virus , permanent infection might be thwarted . Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world . Ongoing research to develop microbicidal gels or creams to be applied before sex offer the hope of people being able to protect themselves from HIV infection in situations where saying no to sex or insisting on condom use is not an option .
