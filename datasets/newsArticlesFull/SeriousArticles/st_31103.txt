" There were some opportunities , again decent but not championship caliber teams , to go race full time . But I was so happy with the team that I was with and really felt at home there , with the partners and the team , you know , like Toyota and Aarons , the whole staff at MWR , the culture , and I didn ' t want to give that up . I ' d been around long enough to know how difficult that is to find and it wasn ' t something I was going to give up lightly , even if it meant racing part time again another year . "
