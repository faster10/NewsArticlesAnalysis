That said , I actually agree that journalist debate moderators generally aren ' t great , and that they tend to ask questions that aren ' t what the typical American schlub on his living room couch would ask . You know who does ask really good questions about those kinds of issues ( like college tuition or health care ) ? Actual citizens . Indeed , there was more of this in 2008 and 2012 , including a mostly citizen question debate run by YouTube that I recall as the best candidate event in a while . So if the GOP candidates really want to mix things up , this would be my solution give more power to the people .
