For those who warn China that , being in his mid 70s , Dalai Lama ' s earthly years may be numbered and his eventual passing away may turn Tibetan diaspora and some Tibetans in China into violence and terror , the word of caution is that , now that the whole world is caught in deteriorating financial and economic crisis , any attempt to use violence and terror to further damage global stability and security will be condemned as a public enemy and dealt with as such . It is ludicrous to fancy that any threat of violence or terror will bent the will of China .
