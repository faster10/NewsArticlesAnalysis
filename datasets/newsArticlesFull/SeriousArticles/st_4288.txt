One of the challenges to the health care program is a new lawsuit by individuals living in states that don ' t have state run exchanges . The suit is based on the fact that the ACA legislation said individuals eligible for subsidies will be identified by state run exchanges . The plaintiffs argue that in states in which the federal exchange is operational rather than a state exchange , subsidies should therefore not be available . If successful , this suit would have hugely detrimental effects on the program . In South Carolina , Ohio , and Missouri there are bills that would create disincentives for people to use the law .
