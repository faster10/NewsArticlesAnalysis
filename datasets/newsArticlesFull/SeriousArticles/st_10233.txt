Hospitalized patients with pneumonia like MERS receive vigorous respiratory interventions such as intubation , assisted ventilation , drugs that dilate airways and chest percussion . These interventions may bring virus into the environment in aerosols and on the surfaces of medical equipment , resulting in infection of hospital personnel and other patients . Since the MERS coronavirus has been shown to be stable for up to 48 hours , it may be difficult to determine the source of infection as people and equipment circulate in the health care environment .
