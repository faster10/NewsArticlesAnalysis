All of this begs the question : Should penalties be reviewable ? Obviously , this is a slippery slope that could ? extend the length of games even further . After all , a review of any play probably turns up a holding call , at the very least . But perhaps officials could review plays in certain situations . For example when a game ? and Detroit ' s last prayer for a playoff spot ? hangs in the balance . And maybe only some penalties could be overturned ? obvious ones , like whether somebody grabbed another guy ' s facemask or not .
