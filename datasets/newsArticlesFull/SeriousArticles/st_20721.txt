I suspect that the only reforms with any real traction will be those that claim to restrict migrants rights to social security . On the child benefit that is remitted to families abroad , David Cameron has struck a reasonable deal which should be sellable to middle Britain : the payments in respect of children in Warsaw or Bratislava will not be stopped , but adjusted to take account of the lower costs of raising them there . But it is on in work tax credits that he has dug in hardest , and here the progress is less satisfactory .
