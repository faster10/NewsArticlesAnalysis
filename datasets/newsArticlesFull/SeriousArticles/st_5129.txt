Back in the first days of the occupation , Finicum told reporters , I m not going to end up in prison . I would rather die than be caged . And I ve lived a good life . Despite his stated readiness to be taken out with his boots on , rather than be hauled off to jail , Finicum , who became the primary spokesman for the band of scofflaws , said he hoped for a peaceful resolution to the standoff . That did not happen and now Finicum has become an instant martyr to the militia movement , to anti government extremists and to the conspiracy mongers in the darker reaches of the right wing blogosphere . But challenging police by defying their authority and brandishing a gun is not heroic ? it is stupid . And that applies whether you are on the streets of Chicago or the high plains of the West .
