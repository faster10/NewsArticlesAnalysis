There are no bathrooms , restaurants or drinking water once you enter the site , but there are facilities just before the entrance . So hold onto your entrance ticket so you can exit and re enter . Pack sunscreen , a sun hat and water . Weather in the Andes can also change in an instant , so you should also pack a rain jacket . Sturdy shoes are a must . If you are in reasonable shape , sign up to climb Huayna Picchu , the famous peak within the ruins that appears in most photos . They only allow 400 a day to climb , so sign up the day before and go early for best views .
