One file mentioned about whether there would be any objection if they were invited to India to be a part of the celebration of Netaji ' s 70th birthday . A letter by MC Vakil to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi even suggested that they ought to be asked to participate in the Republic Day celebrations that year . Was he aware of this invitation ? Peter couldn ' t correctly recall that incident . " I ' m not sure if I had heard of the invitation proposal . My mother had visited Nehru earlier of course . " Reacting specifically to one of the files , Peter said , " The files from 1976 of the MHA show a proposal of the Embassy of India in Tokyo how the remains of Netaji should be returned to India . How can India as a country of so high religious distinction show so little respect to the temple authorities of the Renkoji Temple ? A great leader of Indian independence deserves more respect . "
