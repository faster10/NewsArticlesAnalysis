Atlanta does not get as much snow as Minneapolis , my current home , and where we have stared down a polar vortex , and are now blanketed with about 2 feet of snow . Atlanta is certainly not as cold as Minneapolis , where unusually , school was canceled two days this week , and five days this school year , and we now look at ice planet Hoth ( where Luke Skywalker and friends were based at the opening of " The Empire Strikes Back " ) as an improvement . But Atlanta still experiences winter . Atlanta still has access to forecasts from the National Weather Service . This storm was not a surprise .
