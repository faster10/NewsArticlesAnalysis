Why the age gap matters in Iowa : In general , people below the age of thirty are less likely to turn out to vote in elections . They have especially low voter turnout in the Iowa caucus . With the exception of 2008 , in the last five presidential elections , only 3 4 percent of eligible caucus goers under the age of 29 voted in the Iowa caucus , making up between 9 17 percent of the overall caucus goers . But sometimes younger voters do show up to vote , as was evident in 2008 when 13 percent of eligible caucus goers under 29 turned out to vote . CIRCLE
