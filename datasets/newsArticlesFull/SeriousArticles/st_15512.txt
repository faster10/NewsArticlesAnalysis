Thankfully , Prince George was born just in time for the queen to begin her official holiday last week at the royal family ' s Scottish retreat , Balmoral Castle . The queen and members of the royal family will spend the next two months at her 50 , 000 acre estate in the Scottish highlands . The castle was originally built by Queen Victoria and by all accounts of both historians and those who work on the estate , it holds a very special place in the queen ' s heart . That ' s likely because it offers her a level of privacy that she cannot find anywhere else .
