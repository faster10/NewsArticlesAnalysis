Let s strip away the spin for a minute : Marco Rubio is breathtakingly conservative . He s a climate denier who desperately wants to give billionaires a massive tax break the country can t afford . The Florida Republican believes Medicare and Social Security have weakened Americans he thinks the war in Iraq , even in hindsight , was a fine idea he still opposes marriage equality he doesn t think the federal minimum wage should exist and Rubio s so hostile towards reproductive rights that he believes the government has the authority to force impregnated rape victims to take that pregnancy to term , even against her wishes . The guy voted against a bipartisan Violence Against Women Act , even when he knew it would pass easily anyway .
