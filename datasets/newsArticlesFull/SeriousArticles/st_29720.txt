The school has retired the numbers of five basketball players ? 21 ( Hobby Cobb ) , 44 ( Fred Hetzel ) , 10 ( Dick Snyder ) 33 ( John Gerdy ) and 11 ( Derek Rucker ) ? and , like with Curry , has resisted retiring Mike Maloy s No . 15 despite his status as a three time All American and the program s leading rebounder . Maloy , a New York City native who left for a career in the ABA , died in 2009 , and in 2012 the school established a scholarship in his name . Unlike Curry , Maloy s No . 15 is in circulation and is worn this season by sophomore forward Oskar Michelsen .
