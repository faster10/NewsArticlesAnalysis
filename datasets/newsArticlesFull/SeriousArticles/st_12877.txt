When I first came to New York , I was in my early 20s , discovering a city I had fantasised over since my teens . I saw it with multicoloured glasses , to say the least . Also , I rarely got up before noon and hit the sack again around four or five in the morning , Bowie told New York magazine in 1991 . These days , my buzz can be obtained by just walking , preferably early in the morning , as I am a seriously early riser . I leave only if work demands it . I am not a secretive guy , but I am quite private . I live as a citizen pure and simple . I don t go for the disguise thing ? I ve never found it necessary , at least not since my real hair colour grew in years ago . I suppose wearing jeans is the nearest I get to confounding expectations .
