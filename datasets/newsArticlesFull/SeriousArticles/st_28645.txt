Cruz was introduced in Ottumwa by Bob Vander Platts , president and CEO of The Family Leader and a kingmaker in evangelical Iowa politics . ( He supported Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum the last two cycles , two devout men who also happened to win the last two caucuses . ) Vander Platts had spent the day being hammered by Trump because his endorsement had gone to Cruz , and the former gubernatorial candidate spent his introduction pointing out not only Trump s failings ? hammering him for , in order , boasting about never asking God s forgiveness , belittling John McCain s time in prison , and making fun of a New York Times reporter with a disability ? but boosting Cruz as the true Christian conservative candidate in the race . Vander Platts showered Cruz with affection , calling him a once in a generation conservative , though it was clear Vander Platts was still smarting from Trump s barbs , sneaking in the sanctity of human life is not up for the art of the deal in the middle of some more Cruz praise .
