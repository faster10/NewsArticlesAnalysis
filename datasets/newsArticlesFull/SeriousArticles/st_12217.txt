This means Syria will be effectively partitioned for some interim period . Assad or his successor would continue to govern the regime s currently held territory , enjoying Russian and Iranian protections , but also being constrained by Russia and Iran from expanding that territory . The Kurds and the Sunni Arab insurgents would enjoy similar authority ? ? ? protection and externally provided oversight in their areas . The external powers would be mandated by the UN Security Council to exercise the authority needed to monitor and maintain the ceasefire . Syria would remain , nominally at least , a single sovereign entity and the external parties would encourage their Syrian prot g s to coalesce around some new , probably highly decentralized state structure .
