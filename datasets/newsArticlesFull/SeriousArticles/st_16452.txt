A release date for the collection ? isn t set just yet , but Murphy confirms the plans for a new album and tour in plain terms : we re not just playing coachella . we re playing all over . we re not just having some reunion tour . we re releasing a record ( sometime this year ? still working on it , actually ) , so this isn t a victory lap or anything , which wouldn t be of much interest to us . this is just the bus full of substitute teachers back from their coffee break with new music and the same weird gear .
