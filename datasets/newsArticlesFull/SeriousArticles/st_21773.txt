" Our main concern is how we get better , " James said . " It ' s more than wins and losses , like I told you guys before . You guys get so caught up in the wins and losses and I tell you everyday it ' s not about the wins and losses , it ' s how we play . It ' s how we prepare ourselves everyday . You guys asked me early on why I was so frustrated . You guys asked me you guys won seven in a row , why you don ' t feel happy . I tell you guys and for something like this to happen , now you guys understand what I was meaning . "
