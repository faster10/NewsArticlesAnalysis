Still , beyond any particular decision , rotation , or matchup is this overriding sense that the Clippers will still find a way to ruin things for themselves . I ' ll say again , they ' re a great team that is constantly in position to knock off the best teams in the league . They ' re just not good enough to find a way to get past their ability to sabotage themselves . Maybe no team could ' ve withstood the Warriors ' onslaught Thursday night , but as certain as the Warriors ' victory seemed even when the lead ballooned , so too did the Clippers ' collapse seem inevitable .
