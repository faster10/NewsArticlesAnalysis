McLaughlin : We ' re a lot less precious about getting to work . We ' re not getting that perfect cup of tea , and waiting until the morning light is just so , and finding just the right inspiration . It ' s butt in the chair , when you get the kids settled , and you just go . The upside of that for our writing creatively is that you ' re in a constant state of thinking about the novel . Your brain is constantly firing on problem solving . Are the characters working ? All those hard questions that you have to put the material through are ever present now .
