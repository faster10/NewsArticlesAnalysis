I think that many of these young people have a sense of entitlement , like most young people in the United States . I didn ' t think it was a good idea for Dreamer activists to disrupt congressional hearings on immigration reform , or occupy the offices of reform advocates like Rep . Luis Gutierrez , D Illinois . And I think much of what drives Dreamer activists within the United States is a look at me narcissism fed by social media and a culture where young people are told they can become the next American Idol .
