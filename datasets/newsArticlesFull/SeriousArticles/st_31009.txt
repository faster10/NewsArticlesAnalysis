Well , the Jets won ' t have regular season game film to assess Bryce Petty , their current rookie quarterback . But they will have seen him plenty in practices . So they won ' t really know if he ' s ready to thrive in an NFL game . They ' ll have to project his readiness , to a large ? degree . Don ' t be surprised if the Jets re sign ? Ryan Fitzpatrick as their starter ? for 2016 . So who is the backup future quarterback in that scenario ? Perhaps Petty is the 2016 understudy , though it ' s not like he ' s a sure thing franchise quarterback prospect . As far as drafting a quarterback , that ' s tricky . Remember , the Jets might not draft high enough next spring to pick a franchise type quarterback . There ' s no reason to force a quarterback pick in the middle of the first round , just because you want a young quarterback . Bottom line : It ' s way to early to determine if Petty will or won ' t be a productive NFL player . Even the coaches who watch him every day in practice would likely tell you that . ?
