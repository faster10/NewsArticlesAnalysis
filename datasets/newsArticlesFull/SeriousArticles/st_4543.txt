Freeman and Melchiondo released a slew of home recorded tapes in the Eighties before they tasted unlikely MTV success in 1992 with " Push th ' Little Daisies , " from their major label debut " Pure Guava . " After that novelty single , Ween went on to release albums that reflected their intense love of music , from metal to MOR and all points in between . On 1996 ' s " Golden Country Greats , " they brought in Nashville session players for an album of country originals , while saxophonist David Sanborn guested on " Your Party , " from Ween ' s most recent album , 2007 ' s " La Cucaracha .
