In a sense , Perry s activism is a throwback to the 90s musical climate , when musicians leveraged their popularity to boost awareness of social issues or injustices , and were almost expected to have a cause to support . High profile benefit compilations such as Born To Choose ? which benefitted NARAL ( the National Abortion Rights Action League ) and WHAM ! ( Women s Health Action and Mobilization ) ? and the Red Hot associated No Alternative raised money while educating music fans . Another double album , Home Alive : Art of Self Defense , was released to benefit the organization Home Alive . The Seattle based collective formed after the murder of the Gits Mia Zapata , and provided self defense classes while speaking out and condemning violence . Festivals such as Lollapalooza and Lilith Fair , meanwhile , both had social consciousness baked into their framework .
