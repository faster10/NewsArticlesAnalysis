It was the spring , and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had just released their new album that month , and I had " Zero " in heavy rotation on my iPod . Things were so calm and nonchalant that I even contemplated shooting a music video for the song on the streets of Tehran . The idea was to get some local girls to push regular gestures like waving and walking to the point of dance , to see how far we could push dance out into a public sphere , where it would clearly be frowned upon , if not worse . Pretty cool concept , right ?
