" The Washington Post accused me of seeking political advantage by embellishing the story of how my parents arrived in the United States , " he wrote . " That is an outrageous allegation that is not only incorrect , but an insult to the sacrifices my parents made to provide a better life for their children . . . I am the son of immigrants and exiles , raised by people who know all too well that you can lose your country . By people who know firsthand that America is a very special place . . . Ultimately what The Post writes is not that important to me . I am the son of exiles . I inherited two generations of unfulfilled dreams . This is a story that needs no embellishing . "
