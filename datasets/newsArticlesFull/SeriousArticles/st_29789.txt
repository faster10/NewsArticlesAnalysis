He s not the same guy , Smith said . He s a father now . He s a guy in his fifth year . He s playing different . He had to learn the game , just like all of us had to learn the game . When you start to mature you start to see the game in a different light , through a different pair of lenses and that s what happens and that s a good thing . If he wasn t maturing , they wouldn t be where they are right now . He s their franchise quarterback . Luke Kuechly is their franchise linebacker and if they continue to put guys around them and continue to make plays , they re going to be in the hunt year after year .
