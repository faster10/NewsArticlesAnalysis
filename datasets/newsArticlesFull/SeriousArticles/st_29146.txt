Monmouth s New Hampshire poll shows a wild swing in the Granite State , with Sanders leading by 7 points in September , then losing by 3 in November , and now apparently leading by 14 . ? In Iowa , polling averages , which tend to be more reliable than individual polls , still show Clinton leading by 5 percentage points . Before Tuesday , just two surveys since February had shown Sanders ahead in the state . One was another Quinnipiac poll from September showing him up 1 point and the other claimed Sanders was beating Clinton by 10 percentage points ? a clear outlier .
