Lucas came to resent such patronising accounts of his work , and preferred the acclaim of interpreters like the pop mythographer Joseph Campbell , who thought that Star Wars gratified the human need for spiritual adventure and identified its characters as Jungian archetypes : Lucas s namesake Luke is the young hero on a journey towards maturity , Obi Wan is the elderly mentor who arms him for the fray , and Darth Vader represents modern atheism , a black void whose appearance implies , in Campbell s words , that the world is run by economics and politics , which have nothing to do with the spiritual life . Flattered by such puffery , Lucas offered to redeem a secular century . It came to me , he said , that there really was no modern use of mythology , which suggests that he had missed out on Eliot s The Waste Land , Joyce s Ulysses and Stravinsky s Oedipus Rex he declared that his purpose in Star Wars was to set standards and to fill an aching emptiness by telling us about our values , as the sacred narratives of religion used to do .
