Himself an exile since the age of one , now living between Berlin and Greece , Ai Weiwei is Chinese only in paperwork and language . " I ' m self contained , I ' m outside , it ' s not a desirable situation , but I ' ve almost no choice , " he says . " I don ' t see myself as a refugee because I ' ve got my passport and can travel freely , and I ' m better than refugees that have lost their lives , but in the way many of my friends are still in jail , many of their families don ' t know where they are and cannot have lawyers and proper records . In one sense of course , we are all refugees . I am not Chinese but I am a human artist , a human right ' s defender and that ' s a beautiful thing to defend and a condition we cannot afford to lose , " he says .
