Corruption remains endemic throughout the state . Morsy never tackled it . Torture continues within the police force . the Morsy government failed to address it . The Interior Ministry in general remains unreformed . Sexual harassment and violence was never taken seriously enough in the past , and dealing with it is even more of a priority now , despite the valiant work of groups such as Operation Anti Harassment Assault and HarassMap . Will the new government , being assembled at present , begin to tackle those issues ? Will whoever wins the presidential elections , due to be scheduled soon , tackle those issues ?
