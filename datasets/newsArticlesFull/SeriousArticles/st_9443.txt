Nothing helps a defensive team more than running the football and no one runs the football like Adrian Peterson . He still has the ability to carry the ball an unlimited number of times in the game . And has that ability to pound away , pound away and then hit the long run . He s definitely someone you have to pay a lot of attention to , like we are . The fact that the Vikings are at home ( and plenty of tickets are still available ) could play heavily into the outcome . With the home crowd , it s nice to have them behind our back and yelling .
