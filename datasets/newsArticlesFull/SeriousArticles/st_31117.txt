The thing I love about this emerging philosophy of government , this idea of a government that embraces the power of innovation for and by the people , is that at its core is the belief that government and the people are one . We as citizens are the true owners of government . Any of us , if we choose , should be able to stand up , serve our country and make a difference . If we can continue to move government more and more in that direction , that will be a wonderful legacy to leave our children .
