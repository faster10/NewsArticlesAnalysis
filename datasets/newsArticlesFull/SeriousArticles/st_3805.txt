Start of the Week : LeSean McCoy at Eagles : This one has narrative street written all over it . After McCoy became the Eagles all time leading rusher last season , coach Chip Kelly traded him to Buffalo for ILB Kiko Alonso . McCoy went on to suggest Kelly is a racist , and the 27 year old running back doesn t have a fondness of his former coach . In a Wednesday conference call with the Philadelphia media , McCoy went off on a tirade , putting Kelly on blast . McCoy is an emotional player , and you can bet your bottom dollar he s going be revved up for Sunday . All the off field stuff aside , this is already a phenomenal on paper matchup for McCoy . The Eagles are 20th in Football Outsiders run defense DVOA and have allowed the most fantasy points to running backs the past three weeks and third most Weeks 8 13 . Since the Bills Week 8 bye , McCoy is averaging 22 . 2 touches and 122 . 8 total yards per game with three total touchdowns . Karlos Williams ( shoulder ) remains sidelined , and McCoy should again see upwards of 20 touches . Coach Rex Ryan is a big fan of revenge games , and you can bet he s going to do everything to let McCoy have a monster day .
