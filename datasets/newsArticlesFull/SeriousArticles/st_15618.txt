It had been a bad spring . The sirens screamed every few days , in Mississippi , Alabama and beyond . In Tuscaloosa , just days before the big storm , Mary Kate Jemison Cochrane and her daughter , Emily , walked through the family house in Glendale , looking for a place the 91 year old Mrs Cochrane could shelter when the weather turned . They settled on a hall closet , removed two Electrolux vacuum cleaners , silent since antiquity , and put in a chair . When sirens did sound on April 27 , Mrs Cochrane stepped inside and shut the door .
