The Mexican authorities said Friday night that Guzman had been caught partly because he had been planning a movie about his life and had contacted actors and producers , which had helped the authorities to track him down . Penn ' s story says that Guzman , inundated with Hollywood offers while in prison , had indeed elected to make his own movie . Del Castillo , whom he contacted through his lawyer after she posted supportive messages on Twitter , was the only person he trusted to shepherd the project , according to the story . Penn heard about the connection with del Castillo through a mutual acquaintance and asked if he might do an interview .
