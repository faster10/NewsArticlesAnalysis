Spotlighted . So about that " Spotlight " snub . This was a year when some of the best male performances came in the form of Boston Globe journalists : Mark Ruffalo as investigative reporter Mike Rezendes , Liev Schreieber as top dog Marty Baron , John Slattery as the gruff Ben Bradlee Jr . and Michael Keaton as grizzled investigation chief Walter Robinson . The only question was who would be bumped to lead and who would stay in supporting . ( Keaton , for instance , was thought to be a supporting actor until the New York Film Critics made him a lead . ) But the idea that none of them would be nominated in any individual category and by their peers , no less ? Yet that ' s what went down Wednesday morning , as exactly zero of the male actors garnered individual nods . ( Rachel McAdams got the lone individual nomination , for supporting actress ) .
