Also outside of 3 seasons the 49ers have been the dormat of the NFL for the last 20 years . I m no 49er hater I was at the game last week . But cmon man the 49ers look like one of the worst teams in the NFL with regard to coaching ownership management and personnel . He didn t make that up and most sane logical niners fans would agree that the niners are devoid of talent in many areas . Talent can be more than physical it can be coaching drafting projects or just analyzing your own team needs and addressing them .
