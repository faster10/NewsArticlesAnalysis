In shooting the scene in which Jesse refuses to shoot Walt , Paul wound up ( semi ) fulfilling a desire he ' d possessed for years . " I always had the vision of Jesse pointing a gun to Walt ' s head , I really did , " he explains . " I ' m like , ' It ' s got to end like this , ' and deep down , I wanted Jesse to kill Walt . But the closer we got to the end , I realized I didn ' t want that . Jesse can ' t kill anybody else even though he ended up killing Todd . But that was really self defense and he just had to get out of there . But it ' s good that Jesse was put through that torture for the past four or five months , put in a hole , because Jesse ' s not an innocent person . He did some very bad things . It ' s good that Jesse was put through that so he did some time , but I believe that he deserved to get away from all of it and just leave . You don ' t really know where he goes . . . " Paul has a few ideas , though , about what happened to Jesse . " In my mind , he gets out of Dodge , " he says . " He ' s like , ' Oh my god . ' I think he probably goes and says bye to Brock , if he can , or at least just sees him from a distance and then he leaves . Maybe Alaska , maybe New Zealand . Becomes a bush pilot . It ' s all part of the story . "
