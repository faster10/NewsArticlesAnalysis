The battlefield in Syria is getting substantially more international , with American troops now joining the Iranian and Hezbollah forces , Russian volunteers already on the ground , not to mention al Qaida and ISIS s substantial contingents of foreign fighters .

It s looking increasingly likely that Syria will not emerge from the current conflict as a unified state , or at least not one within its current internationally recognized borders . ?
