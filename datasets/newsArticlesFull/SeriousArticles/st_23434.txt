What ' s outlined in the interview is a strategy that can be summarized as follows : Don ' t be afraid to get dirty , emphasize Clinton ' s policy flips , leverage Sanders ' s small donor advantage . There are some other points , which we ' ll get to , but that ' s the big picture . Team Sanders would like Heilemann ( and Bloomberg readers ) to come away thinking they ' ve got a good shot at the ring . ( The most picked up line from the interview is an awfully presumptuous ? however joking ? assertion that Clinton would " make a great vice president . " )
