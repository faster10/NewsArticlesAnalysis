I ve been a prosecutor for nearly 30 years , Alvarez said in announcing the charges . I have personally investigated and prosecuted numerous cases of police misconduct and public corruption , I ve been involved in hundreds of murder investigations and trials , and I ve seen some of the most violent and graphic evidence and crime scene photos that you can only imagine . To watch a 17 year old young man die in such a violent manner is simply disturbing and I have absolutely no doubt that this video will tear at the hearts of all Chicagoans .
