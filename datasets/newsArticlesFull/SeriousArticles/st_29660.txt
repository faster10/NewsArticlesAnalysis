Concerns regarding the NLD ' s highly centralized structure and opaque decision making have been growing . The most striking example is the NLD ' s candidate list many expected well known prodemocracy activists and groups , including the popular 88 Generation Students , to make the list . However , the NLD cut all but one prospective candidate seeking to run under its banner , causing outrage and consternation . Following this blunder , several regional NLD officers publicly expressed dissatisfaction , went on strike , or resigned in protest . This will have a reverberating effect after the election , particularly if the NLD has to form a coalition and cannot count on these erstwhile allies .
