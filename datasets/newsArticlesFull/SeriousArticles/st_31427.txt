At the same time , not everyone loves Assad . But I had to learn how to listen for that . Their way of expressing this was never to criticize the president directly that is a line no one dares cross . Instead , people would simply stress their love of Syria . Others might talk about supporting the government , but that " was not because we love the regime " as one man put it , but because " we don ' t want the collapse of the state . " They saw what happened in Iraq after Saddam , and in Libya after Qaddafi . They watched as state infrastructure schools , hospitals , police , water , electricity crumbled with the fall of central government , and they don ' t want to the same to happen to them .
