It s a different way of doing things , right ? Esiason said . So the old traditional way , us quarterbacks first of all couldn t do what he does . We don t run with our head down and run over linemen and run over linebackers and safeties . So I would imagine if I were one of those players running one of those guys over , I would get up and be doing all that stuff too ! Because what people don t understand is the intensity that goes along with the game so here we have a young kid who s living the dream who is on the mantel of the great personality , the great looking kid , the great athlete , and he s having fun , man . I have no problem with any of it . None of it . Because I get it cause if I could do it , I would do it . But I couldn t do it .
