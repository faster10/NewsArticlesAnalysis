It is one thing to run for the presidency , run out of money and stage a comeback , as Sen . John McCain ( R Ariz . ) did in 2008 it is quite another to have consistently drawn mediocre approval ratings and given lackluster to terrible debate performances . The problem for the Bush campaign is the worst sort ? the candidate himself . He has high name ID , so it is not a matter of introducing himself to the voters . Rather , he must convince voters they were wrong in their initial assessment , never an easy task .
