The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on Friday demanded that religious places belonging to Muslims and Christians should be brought under the State Endowment Commissioner s purview to keep an eye on their sources of income . For Hindus there is an Endowment Commissioner . But there is no such body or public authority for Muslims and Christians . As there is no regulating authority there is no impediment to the their spread . As increase in Christian and Muslim population would soon be a demographic challenge , there is a need to keep an eye on their financial sources , said Prant Sanghchalak ( eastern Odisha ) of RSS Samir Kumar Mohanty , while briefing reporters about the resolutions passed by Akhila Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal , the highest executive body of RSS last week in Ranchi .
