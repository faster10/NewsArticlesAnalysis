Anyone even remotely schooled in teen comedy will recognize that " Superbad " is an old , old story , albeit one that seems unreasonably determined to lower the taste bar . Each generation throws up a coming of age comedy to call its own , whether it ' s " American Graffiti " or " American Pie , " and there are equal parts of both here . Fogell could be the son ( or the grandson ) of Charles Martin Smith ' s Terry the Toad from the Lucas film . ( There ' s also a blast of the Bar Kays ' " Soul Finger " on the predominantly funk soundtrack . )
