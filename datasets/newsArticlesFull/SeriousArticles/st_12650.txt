Estefan : Yes . I ' m very supportive of my daughter . You always have to have a back story even if you have one line . So my back story with Santana ' s mom was she didn ' t get to go to college so she really wants Santana to do that . Up until now Santana has had a good relationship with her grandmother , but when she confronted her the response was very hard . She was probably the same way with Maribel . Santana ' s dad they mentioned was a doctor , so I think she helped put him through school , but decided for motherhood . She loved to sing and was a singer and put her life on hold because she thought being a mom was very important so she wants Santana to make it through . She ' s supportive of her daughter . She just wants her to be happy bottom line . I know the feeling because my daughter is getting ready to do her last year of high school and she ' s gonna do a summer program . It ' s the first time we ' re all going to be separated . I ' m there ! It was a very hard thing for me to imagine .
