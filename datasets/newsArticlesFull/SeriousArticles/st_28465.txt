Hollandsworth described Tiede as " the nicest guy in town . He ran the campaign for the Boy Scout fundraiser . He raised money for the new wing of the Sunday school building . He bought the trophy shop when it went out of business so the kids could keep getting the trophies . He was a kind of Robin Hood . He was this man who cared about people . And most of all he cared about them at their deaths , giving them this dignified funeral , and leading them into the next life . People loved what he did for them .
