Yes , this is one loaded up list . But there ' s no one I could not suggest for nomination here . The suggestions of Slattery , Patinkin , Esposito , Dinklage , and Paul are all no brainers . ( In the case of Esposito ' s Gus Fring , it ' s literally a half brainer . ) But look at the rest of my picks . Joel Kinnaman frequently carried The Killing through its weaker episodes this season on his skinny frame . Dax Shepard made a leap in his acting when presented with some juicy subplots on " Parenthood . " ( Except for that romance with Cello Girl , that is . ) And John Ortiz was I agree with a remark producer writer David Milch made to me " " the soul of ' Luck . ' " My left field selection here , or so it might seem to you , is " Terra Nova ' s " Stephen Lang , but I would argue that his pumped up , out size performance was the best thing about that over inflated , ultimately disappointing series .
