" Because of the state propaganda machine in Russia , the whole society is in mobilization mode , " said Anna Vassilieva , a professor of Russian affairs at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey . " It will be up to state propaganda to continue the line that Russia is under siege and that compromising or stepping back would be a sign of weakness . They will say that the only way for Russia to protect its stature and the respect Russians crave is to step up the defense of national interests . In the context of Russia ' s relations with the West , this feeds right into it . "
