Majida Rashid , ? The Washington Post : The media paint a very selective picture of us . . . . As a Muslim woman and an American citizen , I m supposedly living in a free country , but how can I be free when my country is afraid of me ? At the airport , I am always taken aside for questioning and a special body search . I feel humiliated and embarrassed , especially when I am traveling with white colleagues who pass through security without any extra scrutiny . I feel violated and insignificant , like a piece of furniture that needs to be inspected from all sides before shipping .
