But if you re not willing to pursue some kind of gun registration or gun control , then you re left with the psychology of the shooter . And what San Bernardino just demonstrated , in the grisliest way , is that we re even less capable of tracking psychology than we are of tracking guns . So if you want to blame radical Islam , go right ahead . And tell us how you d monitor the flow of radical Islam from Syria to California . And if you can t answer that question , then ask yourself whether you love liberty so much that you re willing to defend the right of everyone , including aspiring jihadists , to stockpile and bear unregistered arms .
