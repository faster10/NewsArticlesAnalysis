When it comes to the workout , I went to bed at 5 a . m . this morning . We ve played 23 innings of baseball in 24 hours , manager Terry Collins said . I got a third baseman ( David Wright ) who s got ? we have to worry about his back . The days off help him . I have a center fielder ( Yoenis Cespedes ) who has a bad shoulder . I ve got a right fielder ( Curtis Granderson ) who has a bad thumb . My second baseman ( Daniel Murphy ) lives and dies with his lower body . So , look , they play hard . So to have them out here today just to run around for 10 minutes , to me doesn t make a lot of sense .
