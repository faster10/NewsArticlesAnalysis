SB 1070 would require police to demand " papers " from all people that the police stop and suspect are not legally authorized to be in the US . Because , there is no clear bright line identifier for who is legally authorized to be in the US , people who may be perceived to be " foreign " by police will be the subject of arrest , investigation or harassment simply because of who they are what they look like , as opposed to because of any verifiable evidence of criminal activity . This will obviously have a disproportionately discriminatory impact on communities of color and immigrant communities , and that discriminatory impact violates ICERD .
