My take away is that celebrity would bring the pangolin a form of protection . As long as it remains an obscure and little known creature , it ' s easier for pangolin bosses to keep packing up these animals by the tons and shipping them to market . And it ' s also easier for restaurants to sell pangolin and consumers to justify buying it . Pangolins are remarkable animals : Their tongues are longer than their bodies they hang from trees by their tails they ' re pretty much invincible to predators in the wild .
