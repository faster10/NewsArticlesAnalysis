Carney : It ' s become kind of theatrical and probably less helpful than either the White House or White House press corps wishes it would be . It ' s kind of ironic because now I am a contributor on a TV channel , but the reason that is , by and large , is because of TV . Mike McCurry , my predecessor , one of Bill Clinton ' s press secretaries , has apologized to every one of his successors for being the press secretary who agreed to televise the entirety of press briefings . Prior to that they were only televised for the first 10 minutes and then the cameras were turned off . It was inevitable anyway . But if you look at transcripts of a regular daily briefing in which the cameras are on , and compare it substantively and tonally to an off camera briefing on Air Force One " the gaggles that I would do and press secretaries would do with traveling press on the plane . The White House ones " it ' s a lot of different . The ones not on camera tend to be more sober , more based in information and less gotcha oriented .
