Hopefully , my Bond is not as sexist and misogynistic as earlier incarnations , Craig told Esquire recently . The world has changed . Agent 007 has fallen in love with the Bond girl only twice since the franchise began . In On Her Majesty s Secret Service ( 1969 ) , he even marries Contessa Tracy di Vicenzo ( Diana Rigg ) , who dies at the end . But nothing really seemed to change in his attitude to life . It wasn t until 2006 that we saw Bond fall truly , deeply , madly in love with a woman , in Casino Royale ( one of the finest Bond films ) . He even resigned from MI6 to live happily ever after with Vesper Lynd ( Eva Green ) . Sadly , even that ended tragically . Keeping modern times in mind , James Bond was given a dimension far greater than his old playboy image . He was shown to be an emotional man .
