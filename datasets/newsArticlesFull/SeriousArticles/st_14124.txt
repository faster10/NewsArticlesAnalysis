THE GOP RESPONSE : Obama didn t make the vague clarion calls for tax reform that he has in the past , or plug long shot tax hikes like targeting oil and gas or offshoring companies . So perhaps it s not much of a surprise that prominent GOP lawmakers with a serious stake in tax policy ? Ryan , House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady , Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch , Rep . Peter Roskam , etc . ? all made either no mention of taxes in their response to Obama , or only the most tacit of acknowledgements . ( Same sort of story for prominent business groups like the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers . )
