It s a moonshot , all right . But it may be their last available option to salvage a race that they never had control of in the first place . The party s best bet is still one that s out of their hands : that masses of people who intend to vote for Trump get into a voting booth , look at the ballot , and think , Jesus Christ , am I really about to vote for Donald Trump to be president ? ( Of course those votes could be canceled out by the bloc of voters who go into the booth intending to vote for a serious candidate like Bush and then think , LOL , whatever , I m voting Trump because it will be hilarious . )
