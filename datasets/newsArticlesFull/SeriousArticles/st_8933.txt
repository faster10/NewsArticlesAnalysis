It ' s unlikely that Clinton intended to gain politically from these remarks and they were carefully qualified . She added that " there is no indication that Putin is as irrational " as the German dictator was . But they could indicate that if she wins the 2016 election , America might gain a slightly more forceful president in foreign affairs , someone more willing to engage directly in Europe than Obama has . You may recall that in the 2008 primaries she was the Democrats ' hawk candidate so much so that Ann Coulter preferred her to John McCain ( Coulter called her " our girl " ) .
