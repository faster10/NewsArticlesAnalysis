Maybe you want to see the young Latvian prove he ' s more foundation than fad . Maybe you want to see the bubble burst when the 20 year old starts to stumble , as all rookies do , in the best league in the world . Maybe you want to see how long Carmelo Anthony ? who , after a slow start post knee surgery , is averaging just under 24 points , seven rebounds and three assists per game while shooting 45 percent from the field , 38 percent from 3 point range and 83 percent from the foul line over the past eight contests ? continues to be cool with Knicks fans chanting someone else ' s name .
