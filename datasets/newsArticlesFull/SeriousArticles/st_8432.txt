This self important National Review manifesto can t even decide how to feel about the practice of insulting and belittling people . On one hand , as Charen writes , they believe it s a sign of a pitifully insecure person . What then to make of the fact that much of the anti Trump argument is rooted in cheap shots at the man , from ? the you re a girl insult regarding his behavior around Putin to Mark Helprin s ? swipe at Trump for having hair like the tinsel on discarded Christmas trees . I guess everyone at the National Review is a pitifully insecure person , so why is it only a crime when said insulter is Donald Trump ?
