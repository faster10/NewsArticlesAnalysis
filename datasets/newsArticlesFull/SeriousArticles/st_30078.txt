Kerry and his Russian counterpart have stipulated in near daily conversations that their ongoing disagreement about where a Syrian political transition must end ? with the United States insisting Assad must go , and Russia demanding the opposite ? should not prevent the process from starting . At least a dozen countries , including Assad backer Iran as well as U . S . allies in Europe and the region , will attend the talks in Vienna .
