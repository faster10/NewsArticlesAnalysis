The record of modern experiments in Islamic statecraft is tragically mixed . On the good side , Bangladesh , Indonesia , Mali , Senegal , Turkey and now Egypt are all some form of democracy . Even Iran has permitted a degree of popular representation . When the liberal minded cleric Mohammad Khatami ran for the Iranian presidency in 1997 , he was hindered by a media blackout and opposition from Iran ' s clerical leadership . Yet he won 70 on an 80 turnout and was permitted to serve two terms . ( Admittedly , Khatami ' s achievements in advancing civil liberties were few , and he was hampered by clerical intervention in parliamentary elections . )
