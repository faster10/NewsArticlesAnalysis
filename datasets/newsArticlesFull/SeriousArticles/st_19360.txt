Mets manager opens door to scrutiny : Mets manager Terry Collins ultimately relented to the pressure from his ace and the crowd and let Matt Harvey stay in , and Harvey sprinted out of the dugout for the ninth inning to loud cheers . But Harvey ' s pitches lacked the same life , the first two batters reached base , the Royals pulled within a run , and Collins had to head out to retrieve Harvey anyway . Harvey punched his glove , and Collins called on Jeurys Familia , the Mets ' closer , with the tying run on second base .
