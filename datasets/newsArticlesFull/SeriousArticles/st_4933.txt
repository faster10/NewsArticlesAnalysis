With a Super Bowl , Palmer might even get some Hall of Fame buzz . He ' s 18th all time with 40 , 036 yards . He ' s 16th all time with 259 touchdowns . Those numbers won ' t be enough for him to be viewed as an all time great , but pair them with a Super Bowl and people would look twice at his candidacy . Kurt Warner didn ' t play that long . He had more than 10 starts in a season just six times . But he ' s a Hall of Fame finalist because he won . Ben Roethlisberger and Eli Manning have had their legacies boosted tremendously by a pair of Super Bowl titles each . It ' s probably too late for Palmer to win two rings , or for him to go to three Super Bowls like Warner did , but it ' s undeniable that just getting into the Super Bowl ring club as a quarterback makes everything about your career look a lot better . Did you know Jim Plunkett had a 67 . 5 career rating with 164 touchdowns and 198 interceptions ? Of course you didn ' t . But you definitely knew that he won two Super Bowl rings .
