Just after 10 p . m . on November 13 , the man , Abdelhamid Abaaoud , parked his rented getaway car in the eastern suburb of Montreuil , leaving behind the Kalashnikov he is believed to have used to shoot diners in central Paris a half hour before . Apparently unconcerned as security cameras recorded his movements , he boarded the No . 9 subway line and returned to the part of the city that was still under siege . Before the night was over , investigators say , he had walked past the shattered cafes and bloodied concert hall that had been among his targets .
