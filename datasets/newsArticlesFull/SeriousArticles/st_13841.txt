No one should have been surprised by Trump ' s spasm of hatred . On Monday afternoon , a Monmouth poll came out showing him slipping to second place in Iowa . Trump ' s narcissism , one can imagine , prompted him to wrench back the limelight , as he has done in the past when falling off the media radar screen . His favorite technique is appealing to anger , fear and bigotry . So we get the Muslim ban . But we should not be surprised for another reason . This past summer , as soon as he went after Hispanic immigrants as criminals ? ? and many in the party were mute or defensive ? ? we knew he ' d play the bigotry card whenever convenient . If he was willing to go after Hispanics , then POWs and women , surely he would have no problem directing his venom toward Muslims .
