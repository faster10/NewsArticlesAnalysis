In the ? romantic comedy ? Roger Ebert called " Ghost ? for grownups " , Rickman played Jamie , a cellist who dies but returns in ghostly form to his girlfriend Nina ( Juliet Stevenson ) . Unlike the overwrought Ghost , the British film from Anthony Minghella treats the subject matter with good humour as well as sensitivity and pathos , as Jamie slowly gets on Nina ' s nerves and makes her realise that perhaps what she needs to do is give up the ghost . Rickman proved to American audiences , who only knew him as Gruber , ? that ? he was more than just a villain in this film , bringing charm ? to the role and helping make the film an arthouse hit . ?
