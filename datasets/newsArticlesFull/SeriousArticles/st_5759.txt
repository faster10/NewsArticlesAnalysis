What should worry Clemson : Alabama ' s red zone defense . Everything about the Tide defense is a concern , but Alabama is particularly stingy in the red zone . The Tide lead the nation in fewest red zone drives allowed ( 25 ) despite playing one more game than all but 16 teams . Alabama is tied for second nationally in fewest red zone touchdowns allowed with 11 . Remember , Clemson got away with poor red zone efficiency in the semifinal , producing only 13 points on four trips to Oklahoma ' s red zone in the first half . Clemson is just 65th nationally in red zone touchdown percentage ( 60 . 7 percent of drives ) . And while the Tigers have 24 touchdowns on plays of 25 yards or longer , Alabama allowed only nine touchdowns on plays longer than 25 yards , two of which were punt returns .
