The year 2012 is not 1981 , when the Left came to power behind Fran ois Mitterrand for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic . The Cold War is over the Reds are more " pale pink " than ever the rules of monetary union are much stricter than they ever were . The margin for maneuver in a sovereign state in Europe is extremely limited by law as much as by economic circumstances . Hollande is a Social Democrat he does not have the means to be a revolutionary . As for Europe , Hollande in power in France would merely be an accelerating factor in the slow evolution of the EU away from a strict austerity policy , which the Germans themselves have started to question .
