From Vandy s email Thursday night : The timing is poetic : it will mark my 10th Anniversary , almost to the day . I came in just as the Barack Obama phenomenon exploded in 2006 and plan to depart just after his successor is picked and his presidency concludes : I can leave now knowing a template for growth has been set , a first class leadership team assembled and prepared for this transition , and POLITICO is powerful and durable enough to outlast us all . The true measure of business success is building a company that can prosper when the founders go . We stocked the place with talent during the past three years , in anticipation of this moment . http : politi . co 1nSo0p7
