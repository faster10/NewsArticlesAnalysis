Rubio ad highlights Dad The Rubio campaign has released its first early primary state TV ad . Part of a 20 million buy , the ad tells the story of Rubio s father working as a bartender to provide opportunities for his children . My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years , so that I could stand behind this podium in front of this room and this nation , Rubio says in the ad . That journey from behind that bar to behind this podium , that s the essence of the American Dream . The ad runs starting Thursday in Iowa and next week in New Hampshire . It follows a national spot on ISIS that started running Monday .
