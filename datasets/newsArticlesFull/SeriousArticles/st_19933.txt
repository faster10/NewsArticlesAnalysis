The truth is , this is a huge mess , an environmental and personal disaster with no easy answers . Will the " sand islands " sop up the oil ? Maybe , but at what cost elsewhere ? How long before the seafood and wildlife nurseries recover ? Who knows ? Seventeen years after Exxon Valdez , Alaska ' s herring still aren ' t back , and that spill was a fraction of the size . What will be the impact on the lives and lifestyle of the Gulf fishers , and those whose livelihoods depend on them ? Guess , and guess again . Will the flood of oil erode the marshes and wetlands so far that the next hurricane makes landfall in Indianapolis ?
