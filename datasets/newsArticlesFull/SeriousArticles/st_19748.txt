All three opposition parties exhausted their campaign money in the June 7 election campaign . Their resources were grossly inadequate to finance a new campaign . On the other hand , the AKP was able to spend enormously with access to state and municipality funds . Worse , fearing another deadly suicide attack , physical campaigning was very limited by the opposition parties , especially the HDP . However , it is not reasonable to explain the shift of more than four million votes back to the AKP with extremely unfair election conditions or pressure on the media only . The AKP ran a very effective campaign as the party recognized the dire legal and political consequences if they were to loose again . Contrary to June 7 , it fielded seasoned candidates and targeted its audiences smartly .
