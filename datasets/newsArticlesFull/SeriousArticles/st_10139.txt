Listening to the two men address separate rallies within a few hours of each other was like watching a perfectly timed double act : while one was sophisticated , cool , and above the fray , the other was overplaying the rustic , but galvanising the crowds one was playing to the aspirational , the other to the pre aspirational . Faced not just with the Grand Alliance s cohesive campaign but with allies annoyed with posters that omitted to mention their names , and the BJP state unit unhappy with what one local leader described as overcrowding by Delhi , Mr Modi changed his strategy post Dussehra , to retrieve ground : he communalised the elections by suggesting that five per cent of the OBC quota would be sliced off for the Muslims in the hope that the Extremely Backward Classes would return to the NDA . Will that work ?
