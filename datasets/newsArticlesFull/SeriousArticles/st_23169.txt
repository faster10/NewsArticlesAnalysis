In 1971 , Kuhn and Hall of Fame president Paul Kerr named him to chair the Hall of Fame s Special Committee on the Negro League , the beginning of the institution s belated efforts to recognize the cream of the crop whom the color line kept out of the majors ( it took a showdown between Kuhn and Kerr for the honorees to be granted equal status , with plaques in the same spot as those elected for their time in the majors ) . Irvin and the committee elected Satchel Paige in 1971 , then Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard in 1972 . The next year , he himself was elected , with Bell ( 1974 ) , Judy Johnson ( 1975 ) , Oscar Charleston ( 1976 ) , Pop Lloyd ( 1976 ) and Martin Dihigo ( 1977 ) following before the committee voted to disband in 1977 , with the Veterans Committee taking over its duties in considering Negro League players .
