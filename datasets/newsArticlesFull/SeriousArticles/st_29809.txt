If you are running for president , you haven t actually earned any authority within the party . Being a presidential candidate doesn t make you almost party leader any more than it makes you almost president . And , talking about debate rules is not a good opportunity to make some other point about your candidacy or your character . RNC Chairman Reince Priebus should stiff arm the campaigns and tell them that the RNC is handling it and will fix the problem ? and that if the candidates don t like it , they don t need to show up . The campaigns can express their displeasure and their ideas with the RNC privately , but trust me when I say I am sure the RNC has gotten the message . They know they will have their nominee by the spring , and everyone at the RNC wants to have a good relationship with whoever that ends up being . The campaigns should let Chairman Priebus and his team do their job and get back to explaining why they should win .
