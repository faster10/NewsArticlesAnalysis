On Sunday , Brooklyn also had to make up for what Nets coach Lionel Hollins described as a " dastardly " first quarter , in which they were outscored 30 16 . He doesn ' t have to go out there and do it all of the time . " When he needs to he can and when he doesn ' t need to he takes a backseat to those guys " . Less than a minute later , after a bucket by Draymond Green and two by Curry , they were up 79 76 . Other than Shane Larkin and Markel Brown ( seven points ) , the Nets bench was nonexistent compared to Golden State ' s . But they had no answer down the stretch for the NBA ' s best player in a 112 109 defeat .
