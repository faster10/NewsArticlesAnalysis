But let s be charitable and say that Cruz merely wants to use conventional weapons to carpet bomb ISIS until they cease to exist . That s also a bad and dumb idea . First of all , ISIS is not holed up in the desert sands ? they re comingled with huge civilian populations in major cities in Iraq and Syria . They do this precisely because the prospect of massive civilian casualties takes carpet bombing off the table as an option . Cruz knows this , but he also knows that carpet bomb sounds super tough and macho , so he ends up saying things that make no sense . I want to carpet bomb ISIS , he told NPR this week . Now when you say carpet bomb cities , look , no ? no reasonable military endeavor targets civilians .
