The other reason I can ' t see the movie is my friend Sgt . Gordon Wofford . Gordon was serving with 9th Infantry Regiment ( Manchu ) , 25th Infantry Division when he was struck by a sniper ' s bullet on May 28 , 1970 . The bullet took out his lower jaw and all of his teeth . The company medic , Spec . Ronald Krebsbach , was killed by the next bullet while yanking Gordon to safety . Gordon spent 19 months at Walter Reed relearning skills toddlers know : How to chew . How to talk . How not to slobber all over himself .
