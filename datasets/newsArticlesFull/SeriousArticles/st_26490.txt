Jacksonville Jaguars : The Jaguars came out of Sunday ' s loss to Tennessee with two possibly significant injuries : linebacker Paul Posluszny had a cast on his right hand and wide receiver Rashad Greene missed the second half with a shoulder injury . The Jaguars can weather the loss of Greene because Allen Hurns is expected to return , but losing Posluszny for any length of time would be a blow to a defense that is already down one linebacker ( Dan Skuta ) and is having to rely on undrafted rookie Thurston Armbrister .
