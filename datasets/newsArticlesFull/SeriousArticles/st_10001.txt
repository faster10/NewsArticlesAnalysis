Bayern Munich 1 1 Chelsea ( aet : Chelsea 4 3 on pens ) , Munich , May 19 , 2012 the venue gives a clue as to why this counted as an upset . Bayern ' s glittering Allianz Arena was the stage , and it was set for Jupp Heynckes ' team to bring the trophy home , two years after the heartbreak of losing to Inter Milan . Add the fact that Chelsea were in turmoil after sacking Andre Villas Boas two months earlier and finishing sixth in the Barclays Premier League , a distant 25 points behind champions Manchester City , and a Bayern win looked assured . It was all going to plan when Thomas Muller ' s downward header reared up off the turf and beat Petr Cech seven minutes from time . But this was to be Didier Drogba ' s finest hour in a Chelsea shirt . Just as Bavaria was bracing itself for an all night party , Drogba powered an 88th minute header past Manuel Neuer to force extra time that duly gave way to a penalty shoot out . Incredibly , Bastian Schweinsteiger missed Bayern ' s fifth to leave the way clear for Drogba to nervelessly convert the decisive kick .
