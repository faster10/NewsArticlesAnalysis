Or think of that " Top Gun " performance by President George W . Bush in 2003 as he landed on an aircraft carrier , stepped out in a flight jacket , and spoke to a prime time audience about Iraq with that " Mission Accomplished " banner just behind him . Even in my wildest dreams in the White House , I never dreamed of using an aircraft carrier as a prop . Not long after , Bush , too , won re election . ( It was not lost on the son that dad ' s approach hadn ' t won over voters for re election . )
