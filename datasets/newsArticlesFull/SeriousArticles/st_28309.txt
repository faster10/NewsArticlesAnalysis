My initial reaction to the new report was along the lines of : so ? We have overwhelming evidence born of both research and real world observation that plant predominant diets are associated with longevity and vitality and lesser rates of all chronic disease , including cancer . Since this same shift in our dietary patterns would be better for us and the planet , did we really need another reason ? Are we now waiting for tomorrow ' s news that eating deli meats causes eyeballs to burst into flames ? In other words : even before the new report from IARC , we knew what we should be eating we just keep finding reasons not to swallow it . That ' s what needs to change .
