The nonradar traffic picture is calculated by a computer , based on these position reports . In an airplane as sophisticated as a 777 , the on board computer can generate these reports automatically without verbal communication from the pilots . It is possible that on a portion of Malaysia 370 ' s route , this procedure may have been utilized . If the airplane deviated from its assigned route because of an emergency , no problem would be indicated until the next reporting point because of the lack of ATC radar coverage . The crew would have to communicate the problem to the ground based facility .
