Why they ll lose : The Panthers defense has looked a little more vulnerable lately . The Giants heated up against them in a hurry and almost pulled off a huge comeback win in Week 15 . The Seahawks outscored Carolina 24 0 in the second half on Sunday . The secondary has some holes , especially with cornerback Charles Tillman out the rest of the year , and the Cardinals can exploit that . There isn ' t really a blueprint on how to beat the Panthers , considering they lost just once all year . These are two fantastic teams , without many weaknesses between them , and one of them has to lose . It won ' t be because of some fatal flaw on either side .
