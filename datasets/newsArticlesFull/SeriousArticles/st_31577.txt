Unfortunately , it ' s not . The first problem is that Romney ascribes motives to the insurance companies that make no sense . If you would just leave the insurance company if it did a bad job , then there is no incentive for it to keep you healthy . Healthy people are cheap for insurance companies , and sick people are not . If you go from being healthy to being sick , it ' s in an insurance company ' s best interest that you leave . That ' s an economic fact , not a moral judgment . It ' s only if you can ' t leave , if you have to remain on their books no matter what , that the company has an incentive to keep you healthy .
