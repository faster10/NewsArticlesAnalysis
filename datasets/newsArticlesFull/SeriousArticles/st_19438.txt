One welcome trend that is challenging this is the rise of crowdfunding , which opens up financing opportunities to all sorts of underdogs . This includes filmmakers , young businesspeople who have heart but little track record , and projects that are too small for big banks to care about . For example , Crowdfunder is used to raise money social enterprises like Urban Harvest . There are some great niche crowdfunding platforms too , such as the US based Beacon Reader which caters for journalists .
