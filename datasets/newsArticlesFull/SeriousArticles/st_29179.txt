At its very core , racism has always been experienced as an attack on dignity . Whether it was referring to a black man as " boy " or to black women by their first names , exiled to the back of the bus or to a separate water fountain , racism was a daily indignity for many early 20th century blacks . Segregation itself was an attack on dignity . The idea that the very presence of blacks would sully white schools , lunch counters or hotels struck at the dignity of blacks as human beings and fellow Americans .
