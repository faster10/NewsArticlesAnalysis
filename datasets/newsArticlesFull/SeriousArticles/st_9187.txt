" I remember growing up on ' I Love Lucy ' reruns and I was always a big Carol Burnett fan , " said Behrs . " Women in comedy have been something I ' ve followed my whole life . I don ' t think it ' s like , ' Look , we ' re letting women be funny . ' Women have always been funny , it ' s just more recognizable , and there ' s just so much at once . It ' s not just one TV show , there ' s this influx of it and I ' m definitely glad to be a part of that . I ' m proud to be in the company of all these funny women . "
