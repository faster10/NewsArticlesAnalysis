The Conjuring ' s debut marks a career high for Wan , who broke onto the scene in 2004 with his 55 . 2 million hit Saw , a film so buzzy it steered horror films into the torture direction for years after its release . In 2011 , Wan scored a spookier hit with Insidious , which , like The Conjuring , starred Patrick Wilson . Insidious earned 54 million against a 1 . 5 million budget and now has a sequel hitting theaters on September 13 . The Conjuring will easily outgross both of those films , though it ' s all but guaranteed that Wan ' s next effort , Fast Furious 7 , will be his biggest hit yet .
