That same year , I discussed the idea with Rep . James Sensenbrenner , who was then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called " The Border Protection , Anti Terrorism , and Immigration Control Act of 2005 . " Among other things , the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony . Yet even Sensenbrenner , not exactly a softhearted liberal , wouldn ' t touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants . When fellow Republicans tried to insert such language into his bill , he was careful to keep it out .
