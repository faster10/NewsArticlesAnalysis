Wilson has been one of the best fantasy quarterbacks the past three weeks . The Seahawks gunslinger has passed for 879 yards and 11 passing touchdowns , thrown zero interceptions and scored his first rushing score this past week against Minnesota . I expect Wilson to keep those fantasy numbers flowing . Wilson is finally playing WilsonBall , and now he has another fantastic matchup against a Ravens defense that has been among the worst at slowing down opposing quarterbacks . Baltimore has given up the eighth most fantasy points to QBs this season .
