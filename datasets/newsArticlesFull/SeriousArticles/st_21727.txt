" His demeanor when he told me that he was going to retire after this season . . . he was at such a calmness about it , " said Scott . " He seemed so at peace , and I ' m glad to see that in him . He ' s been a fierce competitor for so many years , and he ' s been so stoic when he ' s on that court , you know , so business like . It ' s good to see him smiling and enjoying the process of this going through his final season . And also the process of helping these young guys as well . He has gotten to be a lot lighter on the basketball court a lot more conversational with guys . . . opponents , as well as his teammates . He smiles a lot more , and I think a lot of that is because he is definitely at peace with his decision . "
