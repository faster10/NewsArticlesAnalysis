When I represented Rhode Island in Congress , I fought for the rights of people with mental illness , and was proud to sponsor along with my father , Sen . Ted Kennedy the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to provide access to mental health treatment for tens of millions of Americans who previously were denied care . Signed into law by President Bush in 2008 , this landmark legislation requires health insurers that offer coverage for mental illness and substance use disorders to provide those benefits in a no more restrictive way than all other medical and surgical procedures covered by the plan . This was a proud moment for me , but those with mental illnesses are still waiting for some pieces of this law to be implemented .
