The August spill was a result of a leak from an old pipeline that had corroded . It took the oil company three months to clamp the leak , but the company said it wasn ' t reported for a full month after it began . Once the leak was reported , the company said it was denied access to the site by the community . Leaders of the village deny that , and the finger pointing between the two sides is nothing new there is no love lost here . Who is telling the truth ? Who knows ? Either way , the creeks are blackened . This is life in the Niger Delta .
