Thornsbury allegedly seized upon an argument between the husband and some of his relatives to cause the arrest of the husband a month after the argument . A family dispute in 2012 led to one of the husband ' s relatives pulling a gun outside a convenience store , according to the indictment . The husband called police , and even though investigating officers saw a store videotape of the incident and they concluded the relative was the aggressor , Thornsbury allegedly persuaded another officer to arrest the husband weeks later on charges of assault and battery . Charges were later dismissed .
