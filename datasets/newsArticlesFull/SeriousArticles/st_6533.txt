All of that is bad . It s really bad , almost inexplicably bad . When right wingers , or their hard headed liberal pals like Bill Maher , get worked up about the dangers of Islam and the creeping threat of Sharia law , they often start talking about Muslim ruled countries where women are not allowed to drive . Well , there is exactly one country that fits that description , and it s not Iran or Pakistan or Indonesia or any of the other majority Muslim nations in the world . Not to sugarcoat Iran s internal problems or its erratic international behavior , but compared to Saudi Arabia it s pretty much the East Village in 1983 . Women drive and hold public office and work outside the home if you held a gun to my head and told me my daughter had to grow up in one of those two places , it wouldn t even be a close call .
