SOURCES : DEAL REACHED ON A C STANDARD : Industry and efficiency advocates reached an agreement yesterday on a new energy efficiency rule for residential central air conditioners and heat pumps , an industry source tells ME . Another source also said a deal was struck and that a sizeable 2 . 8 quadrilion Btu is expected to be saved over the 30 year life of the new standard ( for reference , the U . S . consumed about 97 quads in 2011 ) . The previous version was finalized in 2011 and the Energy Department is required to complete a new standard for the equipment by June 2017 or state that one isn t economically justified given current technology . But in an effort to keep the rule on schedule , DOE organized a negotiated rulemaking process last year between industry and advocates . While the agreement is a big deal , other approvals are needed and DOE still has to turn the details into a proposed rule .
