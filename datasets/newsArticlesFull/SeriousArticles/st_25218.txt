My approach to grocery shopping was to try to stay full . That meant carbohydrates . In retrospect , it was a poor choice . I ended up with a diet largely based around pasta , lentils , chickpeas and cereal . While it wasn ' t a ton of food , I could mix and match for various meals and find myself not quite full but enough to get by . Breakfast and snacks were Toasted Oats . Lunch and dinner varied between chickpea , jalapeno and tomato soup , lentil casserole and pasta with tomato sauce and garlic . Fresh fruit , vegetables and yogurt were too expensive .
