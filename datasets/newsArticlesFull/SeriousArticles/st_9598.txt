Shrewd play call by coordinator Adam Gase . Patient decision and composed throw by quarterback Jay Cutler . Easy TD grab by Zach Miller , one of about a dozen unheralded role players who has been making major contributions to the Bears resurgence . The play itself , Cutler acknowledged , had been in the works for awhile , a call that brought receiver Alshon Jeffery cutting from the right through the middle of the end zone . Miller , on a delayed release , used his speed and , as Cutler said , got lost in the bunch as he darted uncovered into open space . Still , Cutler slipped in the pocket and had to avoid pressure from Jayrone Elliott to get the throw off . He did . The Bears scored . And a slow offensive start was no longer relevant . What was equally significant about the drive capping play is that it helped the Bears convert a defensive takeaway into seven points and came after receiver Marc Mariani made two key chain moving catches on third down . ?
