Therefore , it ' s no surprise that my fondness for the holiday isn ' t a consequence of the tongue and cheek prognostication that occurs each year in Punxsutawney , Pennsylvania . No , my affection for the holiday is purely a consequence of the 1993 move , which bares the same name . Each year , my kids knew when it was Groundhog Day . . . again , because their slightly strange father would be popping popcorn and loading the DVD player with the same well worn copy of the movie Groundhog Day . Certainly , the entire family enjoyed the movie ' s delightful and comedic storyline of the self centered and unhappy weatherman Phil Connors reliving the same day Groundhog Day over and over again .
