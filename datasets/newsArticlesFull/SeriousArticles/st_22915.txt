The Head of State is a woman and several other women have played an important part in the transitional government , nevertheless , women are still very much disadvantaged in Central African society . Polygamy is legal , for example . It is not uncommon for a widow , following the death of her husband to find herself ( and her children ) pushed out of the family home with neither rights nor resources making them very vulnerable . Then , due to the widespread superstition , there are the sad cases of older women accused of witchcraft , many of whom have been tortured and put to death in the most inhumane ways imaginable for their crime The only way in which change can come about is through education , for this reason one of the first and most important challenges for the newly elected authorities will be to build more and more schools in order to provide basic instruction for all , boys and girls , independent of their social condition .
