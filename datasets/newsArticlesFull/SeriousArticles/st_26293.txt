I changed my mind minutes later , however , when during a timeout break I overheard a replay official in the press box say that Crabtree did in fact seem to make the catch . It ' s possible that Del Rio was not wanting to risk a possible wasted timeout early in the game . But in the first half , timeouts are less precious . And there ' s something to be said for supporting your player when he ' s sure the call was wrong . In any event , life moved on . We ' ll never know what would have happened if Crabtree ' s catch had been ruled complete ( it would have been a first down ) and the series would have continued .
