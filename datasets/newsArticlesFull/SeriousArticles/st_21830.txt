The Republicans ' suicide strategy is a relatively new addition to American politics . Newt Gingrich pioneered the first government shutdown in 1995 . It was so disastrous that no one tried it again for 16 years . In the meantime , Republicans pursued a more traditional method known as the democratic process . They campaigned for election and took control of the White House , Senate and House of Representatives . From 2001 to 2006 , the dominant Republicans passed plenty of conservative legislation . ( They did not , however , reduce spending or balance the budget . )
