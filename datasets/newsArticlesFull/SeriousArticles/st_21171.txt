Rahman was supposed to not even have a ghost of a chance against the unbeaten Lewis , who was known for his immaculate technique and temperament , and had taken the heavyweight title in brilliant fashion from no less a person than Evander Holyfield . Lewis seemed to have believed this too for he turned up for the fight a few levels below peak fitness and was pushed around for four rounds before being knocked out in the fifth . He later made a triumphant return , but the fight would haunt him for years .
