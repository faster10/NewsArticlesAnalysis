Cruz has been taunting Trump over his refusal to participate in the official debate , referring to him as gentle Donald and a fragile soul who is frightened by mean questions moderator Megyn Kelly may lob . The Texas senator , who is trailing Trump here in a state where Cruz led a month ago , on Tuesday challenged Trump to a one on one debate , and on Wednesday specified that he had procured space at Western Iowa Tech , a community college in Sioux City , Iowa . He called the event for 8 p . m . and made the request official in a letter he sent to Trump .
