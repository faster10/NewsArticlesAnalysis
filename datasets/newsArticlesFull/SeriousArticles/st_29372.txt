Dave Gettleman : The general manager made the call to draft defensive tackles Star Lotulelei and Kawann Short in the first two rounds in 2013 . Gettleman was questioned for not going after more immediate needs with the second round pick . Three seasons later , Short appears headed for the Pro Bowl . Gettleman believes in building from the inside out . It ' s the formula he learned with the New York Giants in helping them win two Super Bowls . He doesn ' t panic and trade the house when a player is injured . He ' s also not afraid to make a move like he did in acquiring end Jared Allen from Chicago after Johnson ' s injury . Gettleman also has been smart in spending in the secondary without breaking the bank . The offseason addition of safety Kurt Coleman and cornerback Charles Tillman at bargain prices is paying big dividends .
