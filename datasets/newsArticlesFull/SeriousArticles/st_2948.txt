Belichick ' s going to coach until he ' s 90 . Maybe I hit the fountain of youth . . . maybe we play in 10 more championships against each other . But just in case we don ' t , I took some time to tell them both man to man looked them in the eye , shook their hands and I ' m glad that I did it , because it was important to me that they knew that .
