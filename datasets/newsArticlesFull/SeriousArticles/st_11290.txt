PM : That is quite interesting , because Sudan is a society where women are expected to behave conservatively and refuse photographs . So , when I ' d take their pictures , they would often refuse if they don ' t know me . But if I ' m taking pictures of children , then the women would say , " OK , you can take photographs of us too . " My colleagues and the IDPs didn ' t have a problem because they knew me actually , they were quite happy and honored and flattered that a foreigner would be so interested in their clothing .
