Panthers : Cornerback Norman has a small statue of Batman in his locker . He really does consider himself the Dark Knight when he puts on his uniform . His armor includes a pair of red contact lenses that he has worn since high school . Norman plays at his best when he goes to what he calls his " dark side . " The best example of that came in a Thanksgiving Day game at Dallas . Star wide receiver Dez Bryant had one catch for six yards when defended by Norman . " I went Dark Knight on him , " Norman said afterward . Norman also loves speed . His Batmobile , as he likes to call it , is a black Dodge SRT Challenger Hellcat with red seats . It sounds a bit like a stock car when it leaves the parking lot .
