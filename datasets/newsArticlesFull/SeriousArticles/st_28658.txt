The popular sentiment is that Osweiler may be a far better fit for Kubiak s offensive system than Manning ever could have been . And so it will be interesting this week to see just how different the offense looks with Osweiler able to operate from under center more and the Broncos likely aiming to jumpstart their running game . Osweiler s mobility is a plus , which opens the door for Kubiak to turn him loose with various play action looks and bootlegs . Osweiler won t be as thorough in reading defenses as Manning has always been . But the Broncos will certainly tailor their play calling accordingly .
