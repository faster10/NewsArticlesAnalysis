In a race between a Democrat who , because of the demands of party politics , is sensitive to minority groups and a Republican who rejects social liberalism and a role for the state at all , Bloomberg offers a third way : A centrist or even conservative spin on Democratic policies without the racial politics of the Democratic Party . And while Bloomberg wouldn t win a three way race , he could draw enough of those suburban white Democrats to give the popular vote to a Republican opponent . Which is what the polling shows . Against Sanders and Trump , Bloomberg draws 12 percent support and makes the race a coin toss . Against Clinton and Trump , he draws 13 percent and gives the popular vote to Trump .
