It was Wittman who replaced Saunders as an interim head coach , but only after Saunders persuaded him to pounce on the opportunity ? Wittman s loyalty to Saunders was almost too strong to take one of the sport s 30 coveted jobs . As Carlisle announced yesterday , National Basketball Association coaches this season will wear a Flip pin on their lapel to all games in order to honor Saunders memory . Coach Wittman rarely shows that side ( to me , at least ) , and that is 100 percent his prerogative , but Flip did and it spoke volumes about his character . He was loved and respected by many in basketball circles and by players around the league but he was also respected by fans and by anyone who had ever had the pleasure of meeting the great Flip .
