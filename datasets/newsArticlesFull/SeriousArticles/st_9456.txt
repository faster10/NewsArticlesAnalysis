2 ) Dreams can bring direction to our detours . We ' ve all had things in life that haven ' t worked out as we planned a breakup , a breakdown , a loss , a setback everyone deals with " detours " in their path . A detour is many things unexpected , a nuisance , difficult , hard to grapple with , frustrating but it can be beautiful . When the road looks like a dead end , our dreams can create new pathways for us to travel along . Dreams help us find the beauty in " not knowing " by bringing images and sensations into our awareness that we might not be able to grasp onto ourselves , when trying to navigate our detoured route . Dreams have the power turn our " detours " in life into everyday blessings .
