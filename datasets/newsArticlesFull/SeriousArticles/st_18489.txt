CMP wants this video to ride the wave of outrage sparked by the tapes it released this summer , which have led to a Congressional hearing , raids on clinics in Texas , and a new policy from Planned Parenthood to refuse reimbursement for all fetal tissue donation , even though the practice is perfectly legal . The tape of Dermish at the conference is intercut with familiar sting footage of Dr Deborah Nucatola , Planned Parenthood s senior director of medical services , whose comments on videos released this summer were said by CMP to reveal illegal fetal tissue sale and violations of the partial birth abortion ban . As has been exhaustively proven , Nucatola s statements were perfectly in line with legal abortion practices . To most laypeople ? and certainly , to most pro lifers ? her casual manner seems inappropriate for a dialogue about fetal body parts , but for medical professionals accustomed to discussing clinical procedures with clinical language , it s not suspect at all . And CMP s claim that Nucatola admits to performing partial birth abortions is patently false : The fetuses she s talking about haven t reached viability , so they re not being birthed at all .
