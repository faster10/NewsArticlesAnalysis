The Vikings ' second year quarterback appears to have one in rookie receiver Stefon Diggs , and he ' s lucky for that . In four short weeks , the fifth round pick out of Maryland has looked more like a go to receiver for Bridgewater than anyone else the Vikings have tried to pair with him . Charles Johnson hasn ' t continued in that role after a promising finish to last season ( though he made a huge 35 yard catch Sunday ) and Wallace has been underwhelming through six games in Minnesota so far . Through four games , Diggs has 25 catches for 419 yards and a pair of touchdowns .
