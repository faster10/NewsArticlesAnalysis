Crais : Sure . The books are about Elvis and Joe . The books are about their friendship and who they are as men and human beings . I think that ' s why the readership has grown the way it has and why readers keep coming back to them . There ' s a value to their friendship that I think people admire and envy and want in their own lives . I know I do , so I kind of attribute it to other people , too . I would love to have either Elvis or Joe , preferably both , as my friends . They ' re certainly interesting guys , and we can live vicariously through them for their adventures , but there ' s something beautiful about these two guys and about having someone so trustworthy and dependable in your life . It ' s very comforting , I think .
