This is real guesswork , but the director for National Intelligence , James Clapper , said in February that the group had " somewhere in the range between 20 , 000 and 32 , 000 fighters " in Iraq and Syria .

The New York Times , citing intelligence officials , reported in September that up to 30 , 000 foreign fighters have gone to join ISIS . It did not give a figure for home grown ISIS members .
