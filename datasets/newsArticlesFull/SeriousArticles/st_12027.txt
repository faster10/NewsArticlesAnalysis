Unlike the Woodman , Baumbach doesn ' t show his face on screen , but his films are no less personal for that : " The Squid and the Whale " was a sometimes wincingly autobiographical account of two boys torn between their divorcing parents , and he ' s not one to deflect an insight with a wisecrack . The cracks just cut deeper . I ' ve rarely experienced an audience recoil from a character as passionately as they did to Nicole Kidman ' s toxically self absorbed writer in " Margot at the Wedding " ( maybe her best performance , incidentally ) . These are comedies in the sense that the characters are painfully ridiculous and all too recognizably real but Baumbach sure doesn ' t make it easy for himself , or us .
