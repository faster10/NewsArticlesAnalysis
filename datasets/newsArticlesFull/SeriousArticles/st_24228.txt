Oreovicz : No . Artificially creating a series of all or nothing eliminations rather than crowning a champion over the natural course of a full season has highlighted the worst aspects of this Chase format , no matter how much publicity it has generated . The drivers don ' t like it , and it has resulted in bad blood spilling over onto the track at a level we have not seen until now . The fans don ' t like it . I ' m not really sure who does , outside of people who work in buildings that say " NASCAR " on the side in Daytona Beach and Charlotte . But there ' s no going back now .
