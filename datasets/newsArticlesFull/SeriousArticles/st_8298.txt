The parody wrapped inside a parody . You can ' t help but think of Morgan ' s episode " Jose Chung ' s ' From Outer Space ' " and the Vince Gilligan penned " Bad Blood " ? when watching this episode ? for both the mockery of the Mulder Scully dynamic and the content of the X Files themselves as well as the bizzaro fantasy sex scene with Scully that Guy , the lizard man , dreams up . " I know you ' re going to say , ' But Mulder that only happens in werewolf myths , ' " Mulder says , answering for skeptic Scully as he posits a ? series of far out theories about the were monster , one of which includes the idea of a " GMO experiment run amuck by some military , agro , big pharma corporation . " Scully replies the only way we would reply , as if she ' s sitting at home with us on the couch : " Yeah , this is how I like my Mulder . " This tone continues through the apprehension of the real murderer , a blood lusting Nanjiani , who starts to tell the agents why he is the way he is . " I have a whole speech prepared ! " he says , crestfallen as a disinterested Scully cuts him off , absolutely sticking it to the ? trope that is the perpetrator ' s origin story confession . ?
