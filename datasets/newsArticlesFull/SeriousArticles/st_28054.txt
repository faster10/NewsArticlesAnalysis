National Grandparents Day was started in 1978 , not as an excuse to sell greeting cards but because community organizers wanted to encourage young people to value and care for senior citizens . In fact , the idea wasn ' t just to send loving thoughts on one day out of each year to your own grandparents but to " adopt a grandparent " year round , very much in the spirit of caring for everyone in our communities , not just our own kin . National Grandparents Day is a reminder of the values of compassion , kindness and generosity that we sadly violate in the way we treat elder care and home care workers in America today .
