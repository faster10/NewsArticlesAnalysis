4 . ' L ' Avventura ' ( Michelangelo Antonioni , 1960 ) " Starring Monica Vitti , this is one of the first really experimental films in modern Italian cinema . It was one of the first thrillers in which you never find out what happened . A woman disappears on a Mediterranean island and is never found , which becomes a metaphor for what Antonioni thought was missing in middle class Italian society . It ' s a compelling drama . You feel a bit cheated at the end , but you can forgive a slap in the face if it ' s done with enough elegance . "
