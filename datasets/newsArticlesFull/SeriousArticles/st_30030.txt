Will everyone in PIA lose their jobs ? Certainly not but some trimming of fat is a necessity . The employee per plane ratio ? standing at a staggering 780 employees per plane , compared to Emirates 220 per plane ? is outright unsustainable . If the PIA unions believe that the people of Pakistan will sit back and continue with this mockery , then they are wrong . Indeed , I sympathise completely with the plight of the workers union no one wants to lose their livelihoods and essentially they should not , but unwise decisions by former governments have left no choice than to make some unfortunate but in eliminable decisions . Certainly , it should be made certain that those non core departments that are broken off or eliminated , such as catering or ground services , do not encourage unnecessary layoffs and do not ignore the rights of employees , including pensions and access to heath insurance . PIA needs strong reforms like these . The unions cannot be allowed to take the management hostage but , at the same time , the management cannot ignore the rights of the employees .
