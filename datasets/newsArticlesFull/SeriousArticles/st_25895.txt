Within this time , you experience any number of attacks . The attack frequency builds to a peak , then recedes . One day you feel a mild twinge , a few days later another , worsening until headaches happen about eight times a day , every day . My early attacks , though terrifying , were 15 minute wonders , each ending abruptly as if some invisible hand had flipped a switch from ' Torture ' to ' Pain free Bliss ' . But by 2007 they were lasting 30 minutes and taking longer to subside . Last summer it was up to an hour .
