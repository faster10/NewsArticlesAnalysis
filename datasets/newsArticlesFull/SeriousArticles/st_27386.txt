Cahill : All the matches that they ' ve played where Novak has had success , he has been prepared to stretch Federer wide to his stronger forehand side to make it a physical match . He can ' t just concentrate on banging away at Federer ' s weaker backhand the entire time . Make Roger go wide with the forehand and then find the open court . When Novak is tight in the score line , when he ' s down a break point , he can concentrate on Roger ' s backhand , but he needs to risk a little early to make him think he ' s not afraid to attack that side of the court .
