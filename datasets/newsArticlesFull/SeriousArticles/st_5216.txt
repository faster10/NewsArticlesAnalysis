Aside from Sens . Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden , an ally of Sanders on national security , there are few endorsements left that haven t gone toward Hillary Clinton with the first caucus in the books , Sanders only major nods ? have come from former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and Reps . Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva , the co chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus . Clinton , by comparison , has endorsements from 38 out of the 44 sitting Democratic senators .
