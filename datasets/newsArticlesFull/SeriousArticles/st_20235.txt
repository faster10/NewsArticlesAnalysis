One thing that would help Clemens with some voters on the fence would be if he came clean . The fact he s still denying use of performance enhancing drugs has likely put a drag on his totals . It should help that Bonds is back in the public eye as the hitting coach of the Marlins , and while being a hitting coach never helped Mark McGwire , who is off the ballot now , Bonds was a far superior player to McGwire , and Clemens was certainly in a league of his own with 354 wins and seven Cy Young Awards .
