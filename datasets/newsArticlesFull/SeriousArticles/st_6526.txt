Take one example : New Jersey hosted the Super Bowl in February 2014 , but you won ' t find " Super Bowl tickets " listed as an exempt item in ? its tax expenditure report . That ' s because the state taxed the tickets but then sent the NFL a ? 7 . 5 million tax rebate . ( Actually , the state sent 7 . 5 million to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority , which then sent 7 . 5 million to the NFL . ) Those poor fans attending the biggest sporting event of the year never saw any benefit from the rebate . The cash went directly to the league .
