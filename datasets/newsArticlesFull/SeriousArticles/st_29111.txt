TRI STATE PRIDE : In an interview with Time , CHRIS CHRISTIE ripped TED CRUZ s attack on New York values . " You want to be president of the United States , you have to unite this country . And for him to somehow be implying that certain values are more appropriate , more American , depending upon what region of the country you re from , is to me just asinine . " He also added , TED CRUZ has no problem with New York values when he s collecting fundraising from New York hedge funds . http : ti . me 1neNywH
