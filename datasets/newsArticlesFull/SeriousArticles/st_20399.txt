David Schoenfield , ESPN . com : " The 2014 Kansas City Royals weren t a great team . They were a good team that played great in October and shocked the sport with a playoff run that went all the way to Game 7 of the World Series , falling 90 feet short from tying that game . Maybe those 90 feet added a little inspiration to help push the Royals through the long grind of this season , or simply provided that extra edge to head to spring training with a little more belief in themselves and a little more hunger to get back here and prove wrong the critics who said they looked like a mere . 500 team . Or maybe those 90 feet didn t really mean anything except 90 feet between tying Game 7 of the World Series and losing the World Series . Whatever pop psychology angle you wish to use or ignore , this you can agree with : The 2015 Royals are a better team than the 2014 Royals . That improvement came on the offensive end . The Royals allowed 17 more runs than they did in 2014 but scored 73 more . Their offensive approach and style remain the same the Royals led the American League both years in fewest strikeouts and fewest walks drawn with nearly identical totals but they increased their team batting average from . 263 to . 269 and , most importantly , hit 46 more home runs . They accumulated 213 more total bases . They added power , but they re still the Royals : Put the ball in play don t strike out . "
