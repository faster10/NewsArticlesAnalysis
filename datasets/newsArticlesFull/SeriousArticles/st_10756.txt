Why To Watch : Chip Kelly ' s offense has been largely tampered down since taking the NFL by storm , and his prot g in Miami , coordinator Bill Lazor , has plenty of problems of his own . Besides a two game explosion against lowly AFC South competition , the Dolphins have been horrible with the ball in their hands by and large ( receiver Jarvis Landry aside ) and the stunted growth of quarterback Ryan Tannehill is as troubling a sign as any . Completing 80 percent of your passes that don ' t really travel anywhere , but failing to score points and turning the ball over in the process ain ' t going to get it done . This should be the perfect opportunity for the Eagles to get over . 500 for the first time this season and stay with the Giants in what should be a scintillating race for the NFC East crown ( yawn ) .
