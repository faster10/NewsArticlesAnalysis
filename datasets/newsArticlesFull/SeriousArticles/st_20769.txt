I found out most of the people who were found in those mass graves were immigrants who were headed North from as far away as Central America . They were trying to get to the U . S . , and somewhere along the way , cartel bandits or " bajadores " would kidnap them , rob them , force them to call their families or employers or whoever and try to extort additional money out of them . When there was no more money to be had , they would just be murdered and buried in mass graves . The business was literally stealing people . The nature of this victim was very moving to me .
