In 2008 , in its original application to the State Department seeking pipeline approval , the company TransCanada said the Keystone XL pipeline would involve " a peak workforce of approximately 3 , 500 to 4 , 200 construction personnel . " But by 2011 , when the pipeline project had become controversial , TransCanada told a House subcommittee the project would create 20 , 000 jobs . TransCanada and the American Petroleum Institute have also alleged that an additional 119 , 000 jobs would be directly or indirectly created by the pipeline . Yet an independent academic study found the project would indeed create " no more than 2 , 500 4 , 650 temporary direct construction jobs for two years " and that , in fact , spills and the cost of damage from the pipeline could kill more jobs than it creates in the long term .
