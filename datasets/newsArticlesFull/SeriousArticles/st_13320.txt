I have listened and watched the events of the last few days with great disappointment as the church and the so called African American church , in particular , has been painted rather negatively with a broad , wide ranging brush . I personally wish the distinctions of the church by ethnicity would one day become an antiquated idea . But this will require more people moving from a segregated worship experience . Until then , the church is becoming increasingly bruised by those who seek to move it from its core principles and make it an instrument of division rather than a catalyst for unity !
