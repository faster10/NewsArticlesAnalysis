It ' s not a racial issue , not at its heart , and the solution Lysistrata proposes is about love , not war . " No ( Love ) , No Peace " is what they shout in " Chi Raq , " a demand that applies in Athens or America . Lee ' s not just indicting white America , he ' s calling out a culture that glorifies guns and cares more about power than about protecting its children . The strongest speech in " Chi Raq " and there are many , many speeches is delivered from the pulpit by Chicago native John Cusack , who rips into a country where school shootings are rationalized away and gang violence goes unchecked because nobody wants to snitch . It cuts both ways , he says , the anger and the fear , and it ' ll keep going until enough good people say stop .
