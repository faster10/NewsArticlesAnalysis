Reacting to the Mets elimination , general manager Sandy Alderson told Neil Best in Newsday : " We ' re going home disappointed . To me , it wasn ' t a successful season if it wasn ' t as successful as we all would have liked . We didn ' t play really well . We can talk about the glovework . We can talk about baserunning . And we can talk about defense . None of those things that we do particularly well . But the bottom line is we didn ' t hit . And we had two ninth inning leads and one eighth inning lead . "
