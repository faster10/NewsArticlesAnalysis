Right , and exactly how it is different is something we don t quite understand yet . That s where the humility is necessary . I ve thought about Donald Trump in the context of a sociological concept called herrenvolk democracy . Herrenvolk was a word coined by a sociologist in 1967 that basically means social democracy for the favored race as a way not of expanding liberty to the entire citizenry but drawing a line between the accepted in group and the hated out group . There is a tradition of fascist tending political movements being quite forthright about the favored group . That s what s freaking out the people in the National Review set . National Review freaked out a while back because Trump had been so aggressive about using eminent domain and talking about how he didn t hold property rights so sacred . This is a fundamental conservative idea . He breaks away from conservative policy . It s a lot like what George Wallace was doing in Alabama . Conservatives were distrustful of him because he was perfectly fine about starting social programs as long as they didn t help black people . Or it s a lot like what you said ? the neo fascist right in Europe , which , of course , holds no intention of unwinding the welfare state in the way an American conservative would traditionally dream of .
