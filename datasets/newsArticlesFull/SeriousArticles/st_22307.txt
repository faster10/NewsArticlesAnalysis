United were brilliant at Leicester until an inexplicable decision from Mark Clattenburg gave Leicester a penalty and United crumbled . But people read way too much into that game they even said it showed Leicester will be fine in the Premier League this season . As I write this they are bottom and haven ' t won a game since they beat United . The problems United suffered that day are easily rectified , but critics were too quick to forget how spectacular the football was that took them into a 3 1 lead .
