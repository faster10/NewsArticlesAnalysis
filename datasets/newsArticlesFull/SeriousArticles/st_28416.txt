8 . ' Cabiria ' ( Giovanni Pastrone , 1914 ) " The Italian ' The Birth of a Nation ' or ' Metropolis ' a great silent film that defined Italian silent cinema . It ' s quite a wild ancient history epic about a woman called Cabiria sold into slavery in Carthage . An extraordinary experiment it was one of the first times in Italy that cinema , having been a fairground entertainment , was starting to be considered as potentially high art . A brilliantly exotic , erotic take on ancient history and wonderfully over the top . "
