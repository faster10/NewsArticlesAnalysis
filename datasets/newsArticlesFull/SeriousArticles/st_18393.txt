I was fortunate to know Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman . That brilliant economist like Ludwig von Mises , Friedrich Hayek and so many other economists discredited not only the theory but also the practice of socialism . Long ago I thought planned and statist economies were old hat , and the world was moving toward a vibrant free market for material and even spiritual uplifting . Now I have this feeling of d j vu that President Bernie Sanders would complete Obama ' s destruction of what was the greatest engine of human progress .
