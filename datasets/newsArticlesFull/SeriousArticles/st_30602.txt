In the early months of 1972 , before Ziggy Stardust came out , he and his new band were starting to appear on stage wearing the clinging space suits they had cribbed from Stanley Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange , which had opened in cinemas in January . On 8 February , they played the BBC s Old Grey Whistle Test , the albums centred programme that had been launched late the previous year . Bowie stirred the pot further by turning up to an interview with Michael Watts from the Melody Maker in a camp playsuit and announcing that he was bisexual . Everything was primed so that when Ziggy Stardust appeared in June 1972 , the market would be ready .
