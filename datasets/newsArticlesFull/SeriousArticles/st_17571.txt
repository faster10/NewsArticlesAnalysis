The ripples created by this news threatened to raise the level of tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan . Questions were raised in Afghan media about the sincerity of Pakistan in facilitating the negotiation process .

After the leakage of the news of his death , his successor was selected in broad day light in Kuchlak near Quetta . Now the presence of top Taliban leadership in Pakistan was confirmed by the most recent news of Quetta shoot out . Obviously Ashraf Ghani once again took a lot of political risk by attending the conference , despite serious reservations among numerous Afghan political circles . One has to see as to whether the Pakistani security establishment has finally realized the gravity of the situation and is prepared to rethink the policy of supporting the Taliban or not ?
