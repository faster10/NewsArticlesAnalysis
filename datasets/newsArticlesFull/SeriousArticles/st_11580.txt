" From the earliest days of Google , whenever Larry and I sought inspiration for vision and leadership , we needed to look no farther than Cupertino . Steve , your passion for excellence is felt by anyone who has ever touched an Apple product ( including the MacBook I am writing this on right now ) . And I have witnessed it in person the few times we have met . On behalf of all of us at Google and more broadly in technology , you will be missed very much . My condolences to family , friends , and colleagues at Apple . "
