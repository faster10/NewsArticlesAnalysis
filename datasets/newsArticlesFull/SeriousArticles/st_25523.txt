That day , a white car with darkly tinted windows followed him out of the studio before dawn . He ' s been working there by candlelight to avoid detection . Frightened by the car , he drove to the center of Damascus , to a square he knew to be home to government buildings and the president ' s palace . The car followed and crashed into him at the square , he said , forcing him stop . Three men emerged and yanked off the doors of Ferzat ' s car . They pulled him from it , beat him with crowd control batons and then yanked plastic handcuffs around his wrists .
