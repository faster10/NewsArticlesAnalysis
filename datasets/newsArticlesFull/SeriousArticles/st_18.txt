After a vaccine is licensed , a number of systems are in place in the United States to monitor vaccine safety . These include the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , a passive reporting system that can detect early warning signals about possible new vaccine adverse effects , and the CDC ' s Vaccine Safety Datalink project , which provides a database for planned immunization safety studies of possible adverse effects arising from review of those reporting system reports and medical literature .
