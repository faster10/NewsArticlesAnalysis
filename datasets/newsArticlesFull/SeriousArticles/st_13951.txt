The Saudi led coalition has made significant gains against the rebels since March , but that has been coupled with tremendous civilian suffering . Around 2 . 3 million people have been displaced , and food , water and fuel are running short , human rights groups say . An estimated 2 , 500 civilians have been killed in the conflict , roughly two thirds allegedly due to strikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies . The distribution of humanitarian and commercial goods has been hampered by the fighting as well as blocked ports and slow inspections of cargo ships , aid groups allege . In an Oct . 19 letter to members of the U . N . Security Council , the groups also noted that the Saudi airstrikes often hit schools and hospitals .
