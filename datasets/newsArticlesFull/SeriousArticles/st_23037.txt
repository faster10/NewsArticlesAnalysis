Klitschko s record dropped to 64 4 with his first defeat since April 2004 . I saw my face in the mirror and it didn t look so nice . But that s boxing , Klitschko said . Fury , 27 , taunted and baited the 39 year old Klitschko at various stages , prompting jeers from fans at the 55 , 000 seat soccer stadium . The other major belt , the World Boxing Council title , is held by American Deontay Wilder . That title was vacated in 2013 by Klitschko s older brother Vitali , the current mayor of Kiev .
