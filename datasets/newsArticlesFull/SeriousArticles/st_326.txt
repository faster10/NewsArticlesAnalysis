That would seem to set up the director s new film , the epic revenge tale The Revenant , for another ? empty handed year ? especially since the film was not favored against fellow drama contenders Spotlight and Mad Max : Fury Road . ? So what did the HFPA do ? It gave The Revenant its top prize of best motion picture drama , and threw in a director prize to ? I ? arritu for good measure . Some of it is just the mercurial choices of the HFPA , but if there is a pattern , what would it be ? That it likes his bigger dramas more than his smaller ones ? Or feels like it really missed the boat on Birdman ?
