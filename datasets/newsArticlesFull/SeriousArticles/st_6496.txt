The show went off the air exactly 10 years ago , in February 2004 , delivering series high ratings for the emotional finale . Four years later , Sex and the City hit movie theaters and raked in 152 million at the domestic box office , with critical reviews split right down the middle . Sex and the City 2 opened with significantly less ballyhoo in 2010 and made 95 million at home , with the Rotten Tomatoes score at just 15 . If it seemed as though the series was on its last legs , that would largely be the accurate assumption but it depends who you ' re asking . EW ' s Owen Gleiberman sees a future . The series still lives online , boasting 14 million devotees on Facebook and plenty of meme life among the Tumblr generation . The clamor for another movie might not be as loud as it once was , but rest assured , it ' s still there . Just like The Carrie Diaries .
