Promoted from the lead role with Real s reserves , who are in Spain s third tier , Zidane also has the benefit of a stint as Carlo Ancelotti s assistant in the Decima winning year ( the club s 10th European title ) . The expectation is that he will trust his instincts more than elaborate tactical schemes of the sort favoured by Benitez . There is simply too much player agent power in the Madrid changing room for any overbearing or tactically conservative coach to survive long , as Zidane seemed to acknowledge in the preamble . I am going to try to add a personal touch and be an attacking touch , he said .
