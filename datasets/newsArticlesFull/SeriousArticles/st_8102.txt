I would be happy to have an atheist president . Indeed , I often think an atheist president , a leader untethered from the tyranny of organized religion would be very good for our nation . On the other hand , I am a Christian , and I find the promiscuous tossing about of God ' s name for no purpose beyond getting votes repugnant . Donald Trump is ramping up his Christian status while dismissing most of what Jesus taught . " Two Corinthians , 3 : 17 , that ' s the whole ballgame " is a not even funny mockery made for political gain . Ironically , there ' s truth n that artless quip . To Trump the presidential race itself , as a game , and Jesus as a Most Valuable player .
