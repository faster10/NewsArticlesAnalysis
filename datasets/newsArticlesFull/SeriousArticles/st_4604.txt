Don ' t diet : Instead , get honest about your habits and embark on implementing healthy , lasting changes in your nutrition . I feel quite strongly that a nutrition program built entirely around plant based foods and completely devoid of animal products is optimal . Conventional wisdom would say that an athlete cannot perform on plants alone . But I am living proof that this is false , and I have ample research to support this position . Personally , I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life , a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long term wellness . ( In the last two years , I have not gotten sick or even suffered a cold . )
