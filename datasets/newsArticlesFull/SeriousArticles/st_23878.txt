But it does create an oddly circular culture : Kids develop social media audiences in order to become " stars , " which really just means having enough social media followers to sell out to a brand for sponsorship . Perhaps more amazingly , none of them seem to mind . When I asked kids what they thought about " selling out " for my PBS documentary on social media , none of them could even tell me what " selling out " meant . They thought it had something to do with there not being any tickets left for a concert .
