Does this mean it s inevitable that the GOP this year will nominate someone who s never held elective office ? Well , probably not ? party insiders continue to insist that s not going to happen ( though they re probably crossing their fingers as they do so ) . Trump et al have unique weaknesses . Plus , they don t necessarily attract the same voters . Trump s supporters tend to be blue collar Republicans lower in the income and education scale . Carson s are evangelical Christians and skew toward higher pay grades . It s not clear whether Trumpians would become Carsonites , or vice versa , if their guy dropped out .
