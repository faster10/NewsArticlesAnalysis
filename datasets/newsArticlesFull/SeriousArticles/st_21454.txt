Pickler : I ' d definitely say that my life is on this record . When my husband ( country musician Kyle Jacobs ) and I sat down and wrote " Mother ' s Day , " there were no intentions of it to ever be heard or go into the studio to record it . I don ' t really think about that when I sit down and write about what I ' m going through . I didn ' t write that song for anybody else but me I guess . Sometimes it ' s OK to do things for yourself every now and then . A couple of our songwriting friends heard it and they really encouraged me to think about trying to get it on the record . It ' s one of those things that just kind of happened and there was no plan for it except for me to find closure .
