But as TorrentFreak notes , the list also holds a few surprises : Though one Jennifer Lawrence film made the list , another , much bigger one " The Hunger Games : Catching Fire " didn ' t . ( Maybe we can blame this on Catching Fire ' s November release date . ) High grossers like " Man of Steel " and " Gravity " are absent as well , though " Gangster Squad , " with its modest worldwide gross of 105 , 200 , 903 , somehow eked out the number 7 spot . Still not as weird as last year , when " Project X " somehow reigned as the list ' s top movie .
