If we continue to accelerate progress as we have over the last five years , we will break ? ? once and for all ? ? the trajectory of this disease . We must fast track prevention , treatment , care and support to the millions of people who still need it . If we focus on locations and populations with the greatest need , we can avert 21 million AIDS related deaths , 28 million new HIV infections and 5 . 9 million new infections among children . Last week , in the run up to World AIDS Day , UNAIDS launched a report that details the progress made but that also makes a strong case to front load investments in tackling HIV and AIDS if we are really to condemn this disease to the archives .
