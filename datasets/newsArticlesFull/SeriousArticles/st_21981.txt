Watching Golden State Tuesday night , I was reminded of the call when Secretariat easily won the Belmont Stakes to take the triple crown , almost lapping the field : He is moving like a tremendous machine ! Secretariat by twelve , Secretariat by fourteen lengths on the turn ! Sham is dropping back But Secretariat is all alone ! He s out there almost a sixteenth of a mile away from the rest of the horses ! Secretariat is in a position that seems impossible to catch . He s into the stretch . Secretariat leads this field by 18 lengths They re in the stretch . Secretariat has opened a 22 length lead ! He is going to be the Triple Crown winner ! Here comes Secretariat to the wire . An unbelievable , an amazing performance !
