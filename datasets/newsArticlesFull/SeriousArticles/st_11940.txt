The Wilpons invested some half a billion dollars with Madoff and , despite steady ( fraudulent ) returns over the years , they lost hundreds of millions of dollars . This led to a crazy spree of loans and cutbacks , all of which has caused the Wilpons to run the Mets ? as if it were some small market outfit ? as opposed to a club ? in the nation s largest media market . A club which ? owns its own cable company , no less . Cutting the payroll hurt the Mets , resulting in six straight seasons with fewer than 80 wins since the Madoff scandal broke . That , combined with some notable collapses and a handful of bad P . R . moments made the Wilpons ? a favorite target of the winning is everything New York tabloids and Mets fans alike . Not unreasonably , it should be noted .
