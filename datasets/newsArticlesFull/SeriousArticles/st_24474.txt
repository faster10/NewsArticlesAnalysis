1 Tiger Woods plays through pain 2008 Woods had struggled throughout the tournament at Torrey Pines with a fractured left leg but was still in contention heading into the final round . The American , who was visibly in pain , managed to summon enough strength to force a play off with Rocco Mediate after he sunk a 12 foot put on the 72nd green . Woods ' mental tenacity then shone through as he maintained his concentration levels to defeat Mediate with a birdie on the 18th hole in the subsequent play off to claim his 14th major championship .
