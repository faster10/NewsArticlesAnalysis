As they have in their last four victories , the Warriors had to battle to the finish against the scrappy Bulls . They led by no more than six points over the first three quarters , and took a mere four point lead into the fourth . They threatened to break the game open a couple of times . With the score tied at 89 all , Curry hit a 3 pointer with 5 : 26 to go and followed up a Chicago timeout with a layup with 3 : 48 remaining to give Golden State a 94 89 to go . That set the stage for Barnes ' heroics at the finish .
