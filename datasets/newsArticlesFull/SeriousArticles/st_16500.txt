In other words , we need to return to regular order . Now , I know that sounds like process . But it s actually a matter of principle . We are the body closest to the people . Every two years , we face the voters ? and sometimes face the music . But we do not echo the people . We represent them . We are supposed to study up and do the homework that they cannot do . So when we do not follow regular order ? when we rush to pass bills a lot of us do not understand ? we are not doing our job . Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people .
