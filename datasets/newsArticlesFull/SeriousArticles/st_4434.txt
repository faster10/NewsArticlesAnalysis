In 2006 , the Ohio Legislature quickly introduced a bill to restrict private possession of exotics after an Ashtabula County woman was mauled by a 500 pound black bear that escaped a pen kept by a nearby neighbor . The bill failed , and just four years later in 2010 , an emergency executive order was put in place after a 24 year old man was mauled to death by a black bear kept in a Columbia Township compound . The order temporarily banned private ownership of big cats , bears , alligators , crocodiles and certain snakes . In April 2011 , the order expired upon the promise by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the governor that a new rule making process would swiftly be established in order to implement regulations regarding possession of exotics . This still has not happened .
