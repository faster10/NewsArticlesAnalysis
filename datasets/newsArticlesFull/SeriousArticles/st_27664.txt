Jay ' s partnership with Barneys called " A New York Holiday " was designed in collaboration with luxury fashion houses . The products range from a 70 T shirt , the cheapest item in the line , to a 33 , 900 watch . Reportedly , the deal may bring in millions , but a quarter of the profits will go to his Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation , which helps underprivileged young people get a college education . And for that reason alone , I say Jay should stay at the table with Barneys and use his leverage to force a change in the retailer ' s discriminatory security practices . It wouldn ' t be the first time " dirty money " was flipped and used for a better purpose .
