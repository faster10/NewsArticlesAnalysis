On Monday , Mike Davis the editor of a site devoted to horror writer H . P . Lovecraft and Lovecraft ' s " Cthulhu Mythos " published a long conversation with Jon Padgett , who oversees a website devoted to the reclusive horror writer Thomas Ligotti . In the piece , the pair compare phrases from Cohle ' s " Detective " speeches with Ligotti ' s work and conclude that Pizzolatto plagiarized from Ligotti , lifting or paraphrasing from a Ligotti work called " The Conspiracy Against the Human Race .
