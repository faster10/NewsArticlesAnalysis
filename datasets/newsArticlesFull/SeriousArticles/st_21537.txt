In Iraq , Baghdad is waging what could be considered a cold war against the Kurds by cutting the annual budget of the Kurdistan Regional Government . In addition , Baghdad has prevented the flow of U . S . weapons designated for the KRG leaving the Kurds to defend the 1 , 050 kilometer frontline against the Islamic State with Soviet era weapons . Baghdad s policy towards the KRG is in violation of the Iraqi constitution and a clear indication of how Iraq continues to subjugate the Kurds . Baghdad s policy towards its Sunni population was similarly cruel the Sunni isolation plus Baghdad s inability to defend its own sovereignty from the Islamic State resulted in the abandonment of the Iraqi military and the fractured unity of Iraq as a country . Iraqi Kurdistan , with its limited resources , is essentially left to fight the Islamic State alone while taking in over 2 million IDPs and refugees . Iraqi Kurdistan has attempted to stabilize the region and fund its defense through its sale of crude . Baghdad s repeated use of legal injunctions to interfere in the process only further substantiates the Kurdish claim of subjugation .
