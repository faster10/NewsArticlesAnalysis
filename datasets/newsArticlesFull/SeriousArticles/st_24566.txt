LH : I wasn ' t controlling his race , I was controlling my own race but , great race , I ' m really happy . Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very , very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres . So , today the real goal was to manage the tyres . And , as I said , my goal was to look after my car . I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race . So , I just managed it and got to really enjoy it , to be honest . A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop , which I really enjoyed . Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole , full practice sessions , on my side of the garage at least . And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race . So really happy , and yeah , kinda excited .
