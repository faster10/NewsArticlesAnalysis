The Royals rotation , meanwhile , had hard throwers ( sixth best average fastball velocity in MLB , thanks in no small part to pitchers like Yordano Venura and Danny Duffy ) , but lacked the same swing and miss stuff that the Mets displayed . The high octane stuff of pitchers like Ventura , Johnny Cueto , and Edinson Volquez lends itself to the possibility of dominance , but the high walk rate ( 2 . 9 per 9 innings , 25th in MLB ) attests to a lack of precision that in turn led to a lack of consistency .
