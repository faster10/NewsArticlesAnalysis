It is possible that North Korea is threatening America because it thinks that there is little cost in doing so , that the United States is less likely to strike back than ever before . It may well be acting out a scene from one of those old Hollywood movies that Kim Jong Un ' s father , the batty Kim Jong Il , used to love . In those Westerns , there was often a moment when some wannabe gunslinger , a crazy kid , challenges an old cowboy with a much bigger reputation . He does so to lift himself up . But he also doesn ' t think the old guy has it in him to pull the trigger anymore .
