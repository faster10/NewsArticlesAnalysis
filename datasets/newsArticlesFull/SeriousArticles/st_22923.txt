? Paul Mason is to be congratulated on a riveting account of the existential threat to the EU posed by the migrant crisis ( Report , 2 February ) . There is a subtext to Mason s account , namely a call for EU wide migration controls . But this would be a giant step towards an ever closer political union . Every migrant accepted by a member state and eventually granted citizenship will have the option to move to the UK . It s time to choose how to regulate migration . Do so through EU wide policies or opt out of the free movement of labour accord , which means leaving the EU . It s either an ever closer union or a lot looser one .
