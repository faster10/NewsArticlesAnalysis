The Riverbend Concert Series runs each Sunday of the summer through mid August , while the Bigfork Festival of the Arts welcomes food , jewelry , and crafts vendors to the town on August 6 and 7 . There ' s also Wild Horse Island , a Tom Sawyer like preserve of pastures and pioneer homesteads reach it via charter boat ( 406 837 5617 , wildhorseislandboattrips . com , trips from 80 per hour for up to seven adults ) .
