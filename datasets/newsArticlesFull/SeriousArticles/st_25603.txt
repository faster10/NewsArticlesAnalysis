After the decision to postpone the foreign secretary level dialogue scheduled for January 15 , in the wake of the attack on the Pathankot airbase , India and Pakistan are struggling to agree upon a date for the same . MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup again said Thursday there was no mutually acceptable date yet for the same even as he said both NSA Ajit Doval and foreign secretary S Jaishankar remained in touch with their Pakistan counterparts . On a more positive note , Jaishankar said earlier this week that while India will continue to name and shame perpetrators of terrorism , it will also remain engaged with Pakistan to ensure that it delivers on its promise to act against terror .
