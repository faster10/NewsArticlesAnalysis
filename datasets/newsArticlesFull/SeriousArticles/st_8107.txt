Vanessa : I hope that they see that it ' s not all peaches and cream . Even when we shot the cover they had shown me the cover of Ellen Degeneres ' book with her mom , and it was warm , loving and toasty , and they are embracing each other . And I said , " That ' s not us ! " In the back of the book , you see me crowning her , because she is the real queen in our family . And so there is a sense of humor , which is part of our dynamic , and that ' s how we get through lots of things in our life .
