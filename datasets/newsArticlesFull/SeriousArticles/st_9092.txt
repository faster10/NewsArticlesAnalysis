The impact of these strikes on ISIS oil refineries are going to be immense and grave . If they are hitting the facilities and the oil convoys on the smuggling roads they will significantly disrupt supply and regular production . If the bombardments continue it will impact the energy supply and deny ISIS much needed fuel for their mobility and the servicing of the communities under their rule now around 8 million people between Iraq and Syria . It makes sense to target the refineries rather than the oil fields , as the crude can ' t be used to drive the tankers . The crude can be sold but the refined oil is much more valuable .
