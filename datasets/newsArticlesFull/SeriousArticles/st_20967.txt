Until very recently , Trump was a registered Democrat . He is very liberal on social issues as are most New Yorkers . He ' s donated heavily to Democratic candidates . Paradoxically , he is habitually misogynistic , he ' s anti immigrant , anti Mexican and anti Muslim . He ' s anti free trade and in favor of raising taxes on high earners . His talk of pressuring Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians is wholly out of sync with GOP policies as are his views about Syria and Iraq . He ' s never held any kind of elective office whatsoever and has zero experience working with legislators , the military or diplomats . His domestic policy proposals and spirit bear no resemblance to that of Abraham Lincoln , Teddy Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan .
