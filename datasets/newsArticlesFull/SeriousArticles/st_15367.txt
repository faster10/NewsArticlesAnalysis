Bell : Yes and it was very challenging as an actress to create someone I would wear so often . A movie is a little bit different . Veronica is pretty similar to who I am I ' m not as frustrated as she is , I don ' t think . I don ' t have as many zingers as she does . I certainly throw them out there , they just don ' t land as often as when she says them . It did feel uncomfortable the first few episodes I played Jeannie because I was in a television situation again and I wasn ' t Veronica . I don ' t think at the time I identified it as " I ' m not Veronica , " it just felt new and unexplored . Now I ' m very comfortable with it simply because of the length of time I ' ve played her . No job I ' ve ever had has been as big of a deal to my real life as Kristen ( as " Veronica Mars " ) .
