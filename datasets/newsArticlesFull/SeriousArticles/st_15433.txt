As the publisher of SaharaReporters , I witnessed the crystallization of a citizen journalist movement . Many citizens wrote and posted reports of the mass protests . They didn ' t wait around for their stories to be told in distorting sound bites by the foreign media or twisted by a mostly compromised local media . These citizen reporters sent photos , videos and texts . They tweeted , texted and analyzed every minute of the struggle from all over the country and the world , bringing the integrity of their witness to bear . SaharaReporters kept up its side of the bargain we published the " field " reports in a timely manner .
