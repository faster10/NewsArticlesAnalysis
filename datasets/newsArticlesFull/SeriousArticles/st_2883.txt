It is surprising that Fujimoto still feels so warmly about Kim and his regime , given that it sent Fujimoto ' s North Korean wife , once a famous singer , and their two children to a coal mine for six years of hard labor after he had fled in 2001 . He met his wife and daughter , now apparently rehabilitated and living in Pyongyang , during his visit in 2012 . But he was told that their healthy , 22 year old son named Jong Un , which Fujimoto said was entirely a coincidence had died of a heart attack a few weeks before his visit .
