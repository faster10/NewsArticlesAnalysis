The family managed to flee the village and spent two days on a cramped bus to reach Lebanon . They had to cross many checkpoints along the route . Some were run by government troops , others by rebel militias or FSA . At each checkpoint the bus would stop and men with guns would force some of the passengers to get off the bus , and then the bus would go on without them . Fatima didn ' t remember anyone speaking during the long trip . It was as if everyone was holding their breath , but at night she could hear people crying in the dark .
