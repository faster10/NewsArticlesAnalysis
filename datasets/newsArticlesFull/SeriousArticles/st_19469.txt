The Panthers had the fumble of Patrick Peterson that Teddy Williams recovered , which led to the Panthers third touchdown of the game , and a 24 7 lead . Graham Gano also had a nice game , hitting two of two on his field goal attempts and all five of his extra points . Their punting game only came out three times , and while they had the fumble recovery , punter Brad Nortman was underwhelming as he only averaged 39 yards per punt with none inside the 20 . Despite that , the Panthers punt coverage team was spectacular and Peterson only had two yards of returns . ?
