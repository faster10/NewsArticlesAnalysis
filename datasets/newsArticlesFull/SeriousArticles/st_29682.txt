" Dressing girls like grown women for Halloween communicates that they have the sexuality of adults , in the bodies of children , " says Teresa Downing Matibag , an assistant professor of sociology at Iowa State University . " While little girls themselves likely have very little awareness of adult or even adolescent sexuality , or what sex is really about , the adults who are seeing them on the streets do . We are also communicating to adults that little girls are sexually appealing , and this message has tragic implications for their vulnerability to sexual abuse . "
