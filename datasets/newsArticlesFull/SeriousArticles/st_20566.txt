Ronnie Montrose gave me my first break as a songwriter , as a front man , as a recording artist and as a touring artist , and for that I will always be grateful . The first Montrose album was the first album I ever recorded and it still stands as one of the best recordings I have ever been a part of . I wrote songs with him , but it was his trip . He ' s the guy that got me to sing with him . I had no experience whatsoever I just wrote the first four songs in my life , which were " Bad Motor Scooter , " " Make It Last , " " One Thing on My Mind , " and " I Don ' t Want It , " played them for Ronnie upon first meeting , shook my hand , and said , " Let ' s start a band . " I went from zero to a hundred .
