There wasn ' t a lot of talking in our family as we walked up to the Green . My Uncle Frank , a true Chicago , new deal , Stevenson should have gotten it , intellectual guy who was a college administrator AND an old line liberal Democrat who also had a Purple Heart from WW II did most of the talking . ( This is back before the idea that liberals could be war heroes too had been erased from our collective national consciousness . ) Uncle Frank was pretty excited . So was my Mom . My Dad , who was often mistaken for a CIA agent when my parents went to anti war rallies was quiet preferring to wait for some facts .
