Clark had begun building his empire in the late 1950s with a weekly Saturday night program of live , lip synched performances , " The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beech Nut Show . " It didn ' t last long , but Clark , as noted , was unstoppable . He had another spinoff series , " Where the Action Is , " in the 1960s and soon became as unavoidable as the weather by hosting " The 10 , 000 Pyramid " ( which grew in other versions to 25 , 000 and 100 , 000 ) and co hosting with one time Philadelphia colleague Ed McMahon , " TV ' s Bloopers and Practical Jokes .
