As a debt of gratitude to my dad ( who finished his Mount Everest trek in good health ) , I created my new company , Lyfebulb , an organization that aims to connect and help people with chronic disease and inspire them to lead better lives . The ultimate goal is curing people of diabetes , kidney disease and other chronic illnesses , but while scientists in academia and industry fight that battle , I wanted to create a place both online and offline , for people to enjoy the small pleasures in life , share their stories , learn about new treatments and medications , and find resources .
