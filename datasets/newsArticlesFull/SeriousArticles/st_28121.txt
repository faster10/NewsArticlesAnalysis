On January 13 , Peter Tauber , general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) ? the party of Angela Merkel ? told a newspaper , The Rheinische Post , There must be zero tolerance for those who come to Germany and commit crimes or fail to integrate . In his statement , Tauber implied that foreigners ( or immigrants ) coming to Germany would commit crimes . Interestingly , Tauber did not bother to mention what the tolerance level of the government was for those Germans who were habitual in committing crimes against foreigners visiting Germany . Tauber needs a reality check .
