I think what we get caught up in , in our league too much is trying to compare greats to greats instead of just accepting and acknowledging and saying , Wow , these are just great players , ' James said . I think in the NFL when you talk about great quarterbacks , they don t really compare great quarterbacks . They say , Oh , Joe Montana is great . You know , Tom Brady is great . Aaron Rodgers is great . Steve Young is great . ( Terry ) Bradshaw , all those great quarterbacks they never compare them as much , but when it comes to our sport we re so eager to say , Who is better , Oscar or ( Michael ) Jordan ? or , Jordan or LeBron or Kobe ( Bryant ) or these guys ? instead of just accepting greatness .
