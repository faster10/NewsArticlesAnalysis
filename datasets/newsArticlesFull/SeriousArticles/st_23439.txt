Sheriff David Shoar said in a statement ' Since 2010 , many of you have become aware of the tragic death of Michelle O ' Connell . The more this case became controversial , the more we embraced the idea of having two experienced death investigators who are ' objective , ' ' expertly trained , ' with years of experience and who have not been subjected to the vagaries of social media , examine and review this case . On many occasions I have thought about asking for this but chose not to once I realized the utter unfairness it would be to Deputy Banks . Along that same line , I often wish some of us could walk for a bit in his shoes . We are confident that the new Special Prosecutor will reach the same conclusion that one law enforcement agency , two State Attorney ' s including one who was assigned as a Special Prosecutor by the Governor , and three medical examiners that the tragic death of Michelle O ' Connell was the result of a self inflicted gunshot wound . We certainly hope that the O ' Connell family finds peace and acceptance in the findings of this new Special Prosecutor , something we have never been able to provide .
