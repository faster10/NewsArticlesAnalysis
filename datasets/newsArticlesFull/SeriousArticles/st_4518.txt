" The community is very upset about the shooting and so what we ' re asking is that while the investigation takes place that those officers are held in custody during the investigation just like anybody else would have to go through " , said Brandon Curtiss , with Pacific Patriots Network . Bundy was arrested Tuesday in a confrontation with law enforcement that left one of the occupiers dead . He gets out and has his hands up at first , then appears to reach toward his jacket pocket at least twice . He did have a loaded 9 mm semi automatic handgun in that pocket . The four remaining have said they want to be allowed to go without arrest , and Ammon Bundy has called on the remaining occupiers to leave .
