Territory is critical for ISIS to operate the state its leaders envision , making it more like an insurgent group than a purely terrorist organization . It needs to govern local populations , establish an extreme version of sharia in areas that it controls , and finance itself through the local economy . ISIS has its own governance structure with committees that cover the media , administrative issues , military operations , Islamic law , and other matters . It raises money from such activities as smuggling oil , selling stolen goods , kidnapping , and seizing bank accounts ? all of which require territory .
