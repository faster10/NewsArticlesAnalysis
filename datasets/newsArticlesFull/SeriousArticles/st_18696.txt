I went to dig a little deeper and again , all of this is on the website . I took a look at their Board of Governors , and their role is to direct the Academy ' s strategic vision , preserve the organization ' s financial health , and assure the fulfillment of its mission . Each governor serves a 3 year term and they can only serve a maximum of 3 consecutive three year terms for a total of 9 years . Now we know that Ms . Cheryl Boone Isaacs is the current and first African American and the third woman to serve in this capacity . Now in taking a look at her executive board there is a total of 8 officers . Ms . Boone is the ONLY person of color on the executive board . In looking at the governors , there are 51 of them , ONLY one person of color serves in the governors and that is the current president of the Academy , Ms . Cheryl Boone Isaacs . Looking at the governing administration of the Academy , Dawn Hudson serves as the CEO and on her team , NO PERSON OF COLOR 2 . The first notion behind its lack of diversity .
