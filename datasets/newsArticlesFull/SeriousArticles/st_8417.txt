In 1800 , John Adams was the first president to live in the White House , moving in before it was finished . Adams was a staunch opponent of slavery , and kept no slaves . Future presidents , however , didn ' t follow his lead . Thomas Jefferson , who succeeded Adams , wrote that slavery was an " assemblage of horrors " and yet he brought his slaves with him . Early presidents were expected to pay their household expenses themselves , and many who came from the so called " slave states " simply brought their slaves with them .
