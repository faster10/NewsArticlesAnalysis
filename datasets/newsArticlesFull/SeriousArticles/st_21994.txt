What were they thinking : The Packers were without Bakhtiari ( ankle ) for a third straight game , and they tried their third different option there , JC Tretter , after Don Barclay and Josh Sitton didn t work out . Why wouldn t McCarthy give Tretter help early on when the Packers were backed up on a third and 13 play from their own 5 yard line ( after a Tretter false start ) ? Instead , running back Eddie Lacy went to the other side to help right tackle Bryan Bulaga , and Tretter allowed Preston Smith to sack Rodgers for a safety .
