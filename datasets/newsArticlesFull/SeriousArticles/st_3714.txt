Wars sometimes end by exhaustion rather than agreement , and that may be the best that can be expected for Syria . Local ceasefires and armed truces would be put in place , like the 600 or more that periodically interrupted the 15 year civil war in Lebanon . The difficulty here is that cult like movements such as Isis and al Nusra exist to fight for and live up to their Islamic faith by fighting what they see as demonic enemies . They are not like the Lebanese warlords who used to occasionally find it in their mutual interests to stop trying to kill each other .
