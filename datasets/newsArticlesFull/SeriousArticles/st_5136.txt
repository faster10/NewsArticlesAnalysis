Obama Co . are smugly oblivious to the emerging threat around them . A huge fire breaks breaks out again . . . every engine house is called to respond . As the fire spreads rapidly toward Station 1 the Chief rouses himself from his TV and orders his firefighters to lend a few hoses , but try not to hurt the equipment . The blaze is shortly out of control . . . but Station 1 is unable to effectively respond and the firehouse itself is now in harm ' s way . . . Neither Rice nor Rhodes nor Jarrett have any real world firefighting training to douse such a large blaze , or for that matter , even a campfire . When it comes to the Middle East they wouldn ' t even have the foggiest notion how to use a kitchen fire extinguisher .
