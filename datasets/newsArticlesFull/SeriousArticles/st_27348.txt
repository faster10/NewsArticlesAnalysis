The fact that the Paris attacks have something to do with Islamic beliefs cannot be wished away either by claims that Islam is simply a religion of peace , or by political correctness , or because we live in an increasingly secularized modern era that often doesn ' t take deeply held religious beliefs sufficiently seriously . ( Nor , of course , does it mean that Muslims who reject fanatical beliefs bear any kind of responsibility for what happened in Paris , as Rupert Murdoch suggested in a much criticized tweet , or have a particular obligation to do something to fight extremism . )
