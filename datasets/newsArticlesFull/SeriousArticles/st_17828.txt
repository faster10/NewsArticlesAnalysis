First , we can refer to history to demonstrate that traditional Islam has respected human rights and religious freedom . Jerusalem under almost continuous Islamic rule for nearly fourteen centuries has been a place where Christians and Jews have lived side by side with Muslims , their holy sites and religious freedom preserved . Medieval Spain also created a high level of civilization as a multi cultural society under Islamic rule for several centuries . The Ottoman Empire , which ruled a vast area for nearly six centuries , encouraged ethnic and religious minorities to participate in and contribute to society . It was the Ottoman Sultan who gave sanctuary to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain . India was governed for centuries by Muslims , even while the majority of its people practiced Hinduism . We can also show that Muslim religious leaders stood up against political authorities that wished to deprive people , including minorities , of their rights .
