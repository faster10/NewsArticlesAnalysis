Jan Oberg : Maybe not too much , but this is the wrong moment given the situation between NATO and Russia . The West needs Russia in Syria and elsewhere . Secondly this is provocative . . . I see it as a sign of weakness . There is no particular reason why Montenegro at this point should get this invitation if an alliance of so many countries , with so many weapons seem to be very proud of getting a small more or less corrupt country into NATO without a referendum there , it is really a weak alliance if they feel that they can do some chest beating because of this . . . Secondly , how will Serbia react ? How will the neighbors react ?
