Antoine Leiris was also at Bataclan and said : Friday night , you took an exceptional life . The love of my life , the mother of my son . But , you will not have my hatred . He went on to say , You ' re asking for it , but responding with hatred and anger is falling victim to the same ignorance that has made you what you are . You want me to be scared , to view my countrymen with mistrust , to sacrifice my liberty for my security ? you lost . We are just two now , my son and me . But we are stronger than all the armies in the world .
