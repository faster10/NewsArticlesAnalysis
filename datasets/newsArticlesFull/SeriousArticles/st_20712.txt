" I have felt very fortunate to play 18 years like I have , and I know how hard I ' ve worked to play this long , " Manning said Wednesday . " When I look across at the New England Patriots and see Tom Brady is their quarterback , I just know how hard he ' s worked , as well . To play as well as he has over the course of his career , with the success that he has had and the team ' s success , I have a lot of respect for him . He ' s earned that respect . He and ( Patriots head coach ) Bill Belichick have earned all the respect and all of the accolades that they get . "
