Macgillvray is right . Today ' s war about online freedom of speech is being fought both with and about the Twitter " pen . " Let ' s hope that he Lord McAlpine case encourages powerful voices on Twitter to self censor tweets that might libel others . But that doesn ' t mean I ' m in favor of censoring Twitter . So , for example , let ' s also hope that Macgillivray and his team resists calls by the US Israel lobby to ban political groups like Hamas from Twitter . Yes , this is a balancing act . And the future of free expression in our digital age rests on getting it right .
