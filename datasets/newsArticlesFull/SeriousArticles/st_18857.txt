Certain realities exist . China has the capacity , unlike South Africa , to run far reaching and ambitious initiatives , such as setting up Confucius Institutes and media agencies abroad to promote China s culture and global perspective .

Countries , like France , have honoured particular countries through cultural seasons since 1985 as an integral element of France s policy . Still it remains particularly pertinent for China to develop such targeted programmes , as the largest trading partner on the continent .
