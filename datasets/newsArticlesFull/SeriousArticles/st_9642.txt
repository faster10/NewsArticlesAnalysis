Another technological wonder that first appeared in Spock ' s hands was known as the tricorder . This mobile scanning device could be used to take readings while on an away mission to an alien planet . This data might include atmospheric conditions , radiation levels , or even the chemical composition of an object . The version Nimoy used on set was bulky and had to be worn with a shoulder strap . However , tricorders would soon become one of the most versatile and sought after pieces of Treknology . Today , our smartphones can deliver many features of the Tricorder , while more specialized scientific and medical instruments are able to duplicate some of the more advanced scanning capabilities .
