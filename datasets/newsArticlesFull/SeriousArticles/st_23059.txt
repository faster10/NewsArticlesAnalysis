1 . Bernie Sanders : The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails . If Bernie Sanders was a capitalist he would call his dismissal of the Clinton email scandal in the first Democratic debate a market mover . Setting a civil tone was a noble and a nice thing to do and there may have been some underlying political rationale ? rooted in his desire to draw the contrast between his unkempt authenticity and her managed to death plasticity . But as a strategy ? Oy . Several people in Sanders orbit have told me that it came out nicer ? and more exculpatory ? than he intended ? though how he could have done that is unclear . The dynamic of the race has since shifted in Clinton s favor , perhaps inalterably .
