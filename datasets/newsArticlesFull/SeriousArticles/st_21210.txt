Oregon may not bring to mind images of volcanoes , but the state has an explosive past . Crater Lake Lodge is positioned right at the end of a caldera ( or huge crater ) formed by the collapse of an ancient volcano . The upheaval produced lava walls stretching 2 , 000 feet high and the nation ' s deepest lake , an exquisitely clear , jewel toned blue . You can learn about the park ' s geology on boat tours that run from late June to mid September . At the lodge , ask for a lakeside guest room for the best views .
