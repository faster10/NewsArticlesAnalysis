Some of those schools , such as George Mason University in Virginia , still require the tests for prospective students who do not meet a particular GPA requirement in high school . But Alana Klein , spokesperson for the College Board , which owns the SAT , said this is not a trend . While the news media have focused on recent moves to make the test optional , schools have been doing this for decades , and SAT test volumes are up 2 percent from last year , she said . The poor performance of some low income and minority students has to do with their lack of access to quality education , which is a national problem , but does not relate to the test itself , Klein said . The SAT is a fair test for all students , she said , and any test question that shows bias is removed .
