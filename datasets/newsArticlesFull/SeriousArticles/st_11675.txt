It s a very interesting thing because when you look at Colin Powell , or Al Gore , or other men ? who , when they left office went out and made significant amounts giving speeches to various organizations , but for some reason , when it s Hillary Clinton it s controversial , Democratic national committee member from New Hampshire Kathy Sullivan told Boston Herald Radio . What is wrong with a woman who devoted her life to public service who leaves public service and , because of her background , was a very well sought after person to give speeches to a variety of organizations . So good for her .
