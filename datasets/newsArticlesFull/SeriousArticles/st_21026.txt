Manson is big again . Last year we had the series Aquarius . Now we have Manson s Lost Girls , the story of the women he taught to steal and kill . They are : Susan Atkins ( Eden Brolin ) , Squeaky Fromme ( Grace Victoria Cox ) , Linda Kasabian ( Mackenzie Mauzy ) , Patricia Krenwinkel ( Isabel Shill ) and Leslie Van Houten ( Greer Grammer ) . The story kicks off with Linda s arrival at the Spahn Ranch hippie commune . Taken with Manson , she is soon drawn into a life of crime , notably theft , in what they called creepy crawls . Linda reluctantly becomes an accomplice in Manson s Helter Skelter murder spree that claimed the life of actress Sharon Tate . She ultimately breaks away and turns herself in as a witness for the prosecution and helps to convict Manson .
