The fact is that it ' s the rare instance in which a female celebrity larger than a size 4 is put on the cover of a magazine , especially a fashion magazine . When she is , it ' s often because the magazine is running a " special issue " or because she ' s expecting . Or both . In 2003 , for example , Vogue put a pregnant Brooke Shields on the cover for its Shape issue . But pregnancy isn ' t a shape not exactly . It is , however , to hear these magazines tell it or , rather , to see them depict it pretty damn glamorous .
