Minnesota Vikings at Atlanta Falcons : Both the Vikings and the Falcons ? two victims of early season hype machines ? have come down to earth a bit . The Vikings have a tough road ahead , with games against Seattle , Arizona , Chicago , New York and Green Bay left on the slate . I don t want to count out any team with a 7 3 record , but that s asking a lot from a very young team . The Falcons , not exactly my pick for Super Bowl 50 champions , shouldn t lose this one at home if they are , indeed , a tougher team than they were under Mike Smith .
