Outside of the fact that both best selling productions share the same producers at their respective helms , the shows also feature actors who have become household names from their television work : Audra McDonald ( " Private Practice " ) and David Alan Grier ( " In Living Color " ) have both been nominated for Tony Awards for their roles in the fabled musical about hard living in 1920s South Carolina . Broadway royalty Angela Lansbury ( " Murder She Wrote " ) , Candice Bergen ( " Murphy Brown " ) , John Larroquette ( " Night Court " ) and Eric McCormack ( " Will Grace " ) are hitting high marks with the political thriller about the double dealing and dirt digging surrounding a presidential election . James Earl Jones also stars in the play , directed by Michael Wilson .
