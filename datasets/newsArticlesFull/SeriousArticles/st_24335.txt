Funny thing is , for all the gripes about San Francisco and South Bay traffic , I have heard no one talk about SB50 weekend ' s biggest potential transportation meltdown which could be in Oakland on Saturday , one day before kickoff at Levi ' s . That afternoon , the Oakland Coliseum complex will simultaneously be hosting a large outdoor music event and a Warriors home game . At best , we ' ll have transit tension . At worst , it could be a total nervous breakdown . At 1 p . m . , the O . co Coliseum will open its gates for the " Super City 50 Urban EDM Festival . " The initials stand for Electronic Dance Music , with famous international deejays and lighting effects . ? The EDM Festival is expected to stretch well into the evening and draw tens of thousands , many of them showing up later in the day because the headliners come on late with the best light shows . Meanwhile , at 6 p . m . , just a few hundred feet across the O . co walkway , the Warriors will tip off against the Oklahoma City Thunder .
