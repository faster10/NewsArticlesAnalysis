I slipped it on at a party later that evening and was surprised by the results . None of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about Nixon and many were quite hostile . To them , he was the archetypal Republican in Name Only a liberal in conservative clothing . While most Americans probably remember him only for Watergate or Vietnam and many liberals still revile him as a war bating , divisive anti communist from a conservative perspective his politics were disappointingly moderate .
