Such antics might seem positively antiquarian , but the story moves at a good lick and Spielberg ' s touch is lighter than we ' ve seen in his live action movies for years . A shoot out and chase in an old steamship is expertly handled , but the sequence moves up a gear when Tintin and the permanently inebriated Haddock are stranded in a rowboat , then another when they commandeer a sea plane that ' s running out of fuel and the best is yet to come : a gravity defying race through the Casbah which bends physics with the glee you can only find in 3 D animation .
