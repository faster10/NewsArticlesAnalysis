Carson has also done something else that ' s marked him as a black conservative non politician politician cut from a different cloth . He has actually not run from race . He ' s talked about not it just to pander to GOP ultra conservatives and borderline unreconstructed bigots , but to blacks too . He ' s spouted his standard platitude about how liberal , Democratic policies have supposedly failed blacks and especially the black poor at stops in Harlem and in interviews on black talk shows . This will win him no new black converts to the GOP . But it has shown that he ' s capable of delivering his retrograde anti government message to someone other than to the fawning packs of GOP ultraconservatives .
