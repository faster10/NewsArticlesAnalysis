HOW CHRIS CHRISTIE GOT PRESIDENT OBAMA S NUMBER . In the wake of Hurricane Sandy , President Obama gave Chris Christie his personal phone number written on a small piece of paper , the New Jersey governor told a town hall Monday night ABC s JORDYN PHELPS notes . He said listen , if anybody in the federal government is saying no to you for anything , call me , Christie said . Christie first used the number the to ask for extra gasoline as New Jersey residents without power struggled to heat their homes . So I call the president I say we need gasoline , and he said okay , how much ? Christie recalls . I said , Excuse me , Mr President did you ask how much gasoline do we need , looking at the people around the table like , help me out here , man . It felt like I was on Who Wants to be A Millionaire , and I was trying to phone a friend . After Obama quickly granted Christie s request with the direct help of Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , Christie had to call the president a second time ? this time at 12 : 30 at night ? after FEMA initially refused to release the gasoline without first collecting payment from the gas owners . The president took Christie s late night call and the hiccup with FEMA was quickly resolved .
