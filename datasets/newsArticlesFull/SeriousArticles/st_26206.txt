3 ) ? Atlanta s team ball beats Westbrook Durant Thunder for a day . It s not as simple and clean as that headline makes it sound , but this game had that feel . The Hawks looked like Spurs northeast on Monday night , with ball movement that had them shooting 57 percent in the first quarter and opening up a double digit lead . Then as happened all game one of the Thunder stars would spark a run ? sometimes Kevin Durant , Russell Westbrook other times ? and the game would be tight again . It went back and forth like that all night . It was Westbrook who had the fourth quarter push ( 17 of his 34 in the final frame ) to make things interesting , but Jeff Teague finishing in traffic late ( he ended the night with 25 ) and Kent Bazemore making the defensive play of the night was enough . Big win for the Hawks .
