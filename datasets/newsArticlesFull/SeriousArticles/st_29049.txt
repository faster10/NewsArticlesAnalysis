For future immigrants , the creation of a new visa category , the W visa , would provide opportunities for low skilled workers to move from one employer to another without losing the authorization to work . This category would ensure that pay levels are set between minimum wage and medium wage for the particular job , and also would require that labor recruiters be registered and regulated . Additionally , holders of " W " visas would be able to seek Legal Permanent Residency for themselves and their immediate family members .
