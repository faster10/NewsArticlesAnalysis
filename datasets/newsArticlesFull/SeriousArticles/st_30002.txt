Davis accounted for 57 percent of his rushing yards in the final four games of the season . His two 85 yard performances against Arizona and Colorado were appetizers compared to the 100 yard games he put up against Oregon and UCLA . Never more important was the USC run game this season than in the UCLA game , when the Trojans rushed for 235 yards against a defense allowing 184 rushing yards per game coming into the matchup . Helton made it a point to have Davis run and wear down the UCLA defensive front at the end of the game ( accounting for 100 of his 133 rushing yards in the final 13 minutes ) , and it worked . With Davis emergence , this might be a different title game .
