Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng wrote in an article published in the State run People s Daily on Friday that Chinese companies are being encouraged to invest heavily in steel , construction materials , cement and glass . China has developed enormous overcapacity in these areas , as domestic demand has dropped drastically on account of the slowdown in the real estate sector , and exports have slid because of a tepid international market . Mr Gao also stressed that e commerce , new energy and finance and push for a more active role in Africa s aviation and tourism sectors ? areas of growing Chinese strengths ? will be priority sectors in the future . China s Alibaba group , led by Jack Ma has already become a world leader in the e commerce segment .
