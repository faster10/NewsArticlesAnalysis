The Saudi goal is simple : Prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self determination . And the excuse of " resisting Iran ' s influence , " meanwhile , appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster .

True , the Ansarullah movement now benefits from Iranian support . But it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region .
