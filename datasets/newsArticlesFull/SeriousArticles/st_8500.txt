The Coyote role one Robert Monday falls to Hollywood ' s current go to crazy , Michael Shannon ( " Take Shelter , " " Boardwalk Empire " ) , who sucks up all the juiciest dialogue as a guy with impulse control issues . He ' s after an envelope that Wilee is delivering downtown it really doesn ' t matter why and he ' s not going to take no for an answer . Frankly , I ' d have liked to have spent more time with this unhinged brother to the " Bad Lieutenant . " I mean , who didn ' t wish the Coyote got his bird just once ?
