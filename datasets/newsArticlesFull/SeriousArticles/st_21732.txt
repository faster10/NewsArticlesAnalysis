Love was the main beneficiary , whether catching the ball in his preferred area in the left mid post or simply spotting up in space on the wing after James and Irving collapsed the defense . He chipped in on the offensive glass , too , wresting a rebound from the arms of Manu Ginobili and finding Tristan Thompson for a second quarter dunk . Love ended up with 21 points and 11 rebounds , finishing just his third stretch as a Cavalier with three straight 20 point efforts , and looking like a guy worth dealing two No . 1 picks for ( even if one was Anthony Bennett ) . The Cavs are now 13 ? 2 when he hits that mark .
