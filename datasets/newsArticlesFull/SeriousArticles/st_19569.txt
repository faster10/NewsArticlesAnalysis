Democrats were not papering over the failure in Virginia , but they were encouraged to see where the blue vote held . The race for the 29th Senate District , centered on Manassas in the Washington exurbs , was one of the year s most expensive . Democrat Jeremy McPike won it by eight points , thanks to votes from fast growing , racially diverse Prince William County . Democrats failed to defeat Sen . Richard H . Black ( R Loudoun County ) , a perennial target , but they cut his margin from 14 points in 2011 to five points Tuesday . The race for an open seat in the Richmond suburbs was even closer , with the Republicans triumphing by 2 . 7 ? points in a seat they d last won by 13 points .
