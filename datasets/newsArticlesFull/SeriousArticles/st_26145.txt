TG : We have many challenges . You are right . The first one is infrastructure . Airport infrastructure or aviation infrastructure in the continent . It is not as well developed as the rest of the world so much work is needed there . We ' re working with African governments to improve on that . The second one is brain drain from Africa to the developed world . And particular to the Gulf , and so this has been a problem for most African carriers . I think for all of us . But going forward we are building a huge aviation academy , the capacity has grown from 150 graduates to 1000 graduates a year . So going forward this program will give opportunity for the country .
