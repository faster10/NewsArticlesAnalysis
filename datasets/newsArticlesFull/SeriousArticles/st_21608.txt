The former first lady worked closely on the project with Heymann , who found her to be a highly perceptive accomplice . " She has a lot of experience from seeing the carefully organized houses that her dad built , and she has a very , very good eye , " he says . Early in the construction process Mrs Bush pointed out that the masons ' work on the Texas Lueders limestone that clads the exterior ( and some interior ) walls of the residence was absolutely perfect and thoroughly wrong . The Bushes wanted to have a subtly rustic , handcrafted look , and Heymann had deliberately chosen to use the so called rough back pieces that were traditionally thrown away in the trimming process rather than smoothly finished blocks . " We had to take away their levels , " the architect recalls , adding that the stone was relaid the old fashioned , slightly irregular way , with taut string and appraising eyes .
