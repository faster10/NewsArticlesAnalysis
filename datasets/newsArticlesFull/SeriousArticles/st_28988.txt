A self driving car needs technology that can make sense of the thousands of camera images and data from radar and Lidar . Companies such as Nvidia are working on artificial intelligence to decide how to handle the millions of situations a car will encounter . On Monday , the company unveiled a lunchbox sized automotive supercomputer with the processing power of 150 MacBook laptops . The company says Volvo will be the first automaker to work with the computers . Nvidia says the computers will be able to see images , read street signs , spot pedestrians and process information better than humans . " It really shifts the game then to a software defined vehicle , " said Daniel Shapiro , Nvidia ' s director of automotive marketing .
