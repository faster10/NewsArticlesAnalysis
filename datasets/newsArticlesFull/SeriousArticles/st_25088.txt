To the extent that Trump is running on any specific issues at all , our two potential billionaire overlords do not see eye to eye . The biggest difference between them is probably on gun proliferation . Bloomberg is a leader of the gun safety movement and has put his money where his mouth is . Trump is a big believe in gun rights , frequently bragging that nobody will ever mess with him because he has a concealed carry permit . He pantomimes shooting people all the time while on the stump even saying this past weekend that he was so popular ? he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and he wouldn t lose followers .
