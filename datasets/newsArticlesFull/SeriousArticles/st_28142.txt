The southwest monsoon occurs during the northern hemisphere summer , and is caused by the land masses of the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia heating up faster than the Indian Ocean . This creates an influx of cooler , moisture laden air from the ocean over the land . The southwest monsoon generally begins in mid May and ends in late October early November , though start and end times vary based on location . India , for example , has a southwest monsoon season that begins June 1 and ends September 30 .
