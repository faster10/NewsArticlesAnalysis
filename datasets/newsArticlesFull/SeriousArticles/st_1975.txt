The only way to thwart Putin ' s ambitions is through Russian domestic politics . A strong resistance by Kiev would force Putin to intensify and widen the scope of the campaign . This would require an increase of regular Russian troops in Ukraine ( estimated last year by NATO at 1 , 000 and by the Ukrainians last month at 9 , 000 ) to at least 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 . Russian casualties are likely to rise proportionately to the number of troops , reminding the families of Russian soldiers of the bloody 1979 ' 89 Soviet war in Afghanistan , which greatly contributed to the unraveling of the Soviet regime ' s legitimacy . Putin will be reluctant to choose this option , and the extreme political sensitivity of the issue explains the secrecy about Russian casualties and the creation earlier this year of a Russian " foreign legion " to minimize the losses of regular Russian troops .
