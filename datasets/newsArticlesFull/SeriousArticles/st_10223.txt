This year , like Black Friday , Cyber Monday is growing longer . Walmart has announced its digital deals will be available starting Sunday at 8 p . m . , while Target says its sales will last for a whole week . Of course , many stores will have holiday sales as soon as Thanksgiving . In perhaps the most depressing trend , Thanksgiving Day will be the fastest growing online sales day for the second consecutive year , according to Adobe , with an 18 increase and 1 . 6 billion in sales . ( Let s hope all that shopping happens long after dinner is eaten , dishes are done , and the family has chatted all day . )
