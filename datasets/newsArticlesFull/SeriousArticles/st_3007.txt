What made Star Wars such a universally appealing megahit ? Lucas had been partly inspired by an unusual source : Joseph Campbell s 1949 study of world religions , The Hero With a Thousand Faces .

The theory clearly worked for Lucas , and has worked for many movies since Campbell s book was later distilled into a seven page screenwriter s manual at Disney and influenced such major hits as The Lion King and Aladdin .
