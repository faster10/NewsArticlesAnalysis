I really care about what he says about other people , who don t have the voice and the platform , who are never going to be interviewed by People magazine , who could never stand up for themselves and respond to whatever is being said . And I have met so many scared people hard working immigrants who are scared . They re scared what will happen to them . They re scared that , you know , if he were to be successful ? and others on the Republican side because he s not the only one who makes these comments ? what would happen to them and their families .
