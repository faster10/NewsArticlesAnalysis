" If you go by the rules , he hit the face mask , " Rivera told reporters . " The thumb and the forefinger caught the mask and turned the head . That should have been enough . . . Believe me , I ' d be screaming if it was against us that he didn ' t . But when you look at it , as slight as it was , that ' s all it takes . I know a lot has been made about the rules in the league , but people have to understand the rules are in place for a reason . I ' m not a little bit offsides . I ' m offsides . I didn ' t just grab the face mask a little . I grabbed it . There ' s no interpretation for a little bit or a lot . If it happens , it happens . It ' s hard on the referees . They have to make a split second decision . "
