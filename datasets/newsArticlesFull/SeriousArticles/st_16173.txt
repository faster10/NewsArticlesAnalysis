Our organization measures success by the actions taken to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health . The goal is 5 million actions by 2015 perhaps signing a pledge , running a 5K or even a marathon or donating an old cell phone so it can be used to facilitate communication and medical care in rural areas . Our website , everymothercounts . org , suggests specific actions to take , many of them straightforward steps that help spread the word or raise resources for simple solutions . Individually they may seem small but together , they can save lives .
