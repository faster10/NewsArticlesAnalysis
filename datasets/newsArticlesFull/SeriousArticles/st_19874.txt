There ' s a stench of phoniness and hypocrisy ( nobody could have predicted , right ) over this endless controversy over the CNBC Republican debate the other night which now has the GOP candidates trying to , ahem , collectively bargain for a better deal with different debate partners who ' ll ask easier . . . excuse me I meant to say more substantive . . . questions . As 912 people have pointed out before me , nothing says that you ' ll stand up to Putin from the Oval Office better than confessing that you ' re afraid of policy questions from " flaming liberals " like the capitalism cheerleaders of CNBC ( including , for cryin ' out loud , the inventor of the Tea Party ! )
