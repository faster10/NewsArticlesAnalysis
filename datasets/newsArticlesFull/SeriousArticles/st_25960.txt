Internet enabled movements tend to lack the traditional single charismatic leader , inspiring and organizing the masses from on high . Rather , movements that rely heavily on the internet tend to have leadership structures that look like the internet itself a distributed web of nodes and connections , rather than a pyramidal , top down structure . This enables a decentralized form of organization bringing together unlikely combinations of people into rapidly formed movements . While this has the virtue of making movements more citizen centered and less bound to the cults of personality one often finds in and around protest movements , it also makes these movements more ephemeral and less sustainable . A lack of real structure and widely accepted leaders has limited the sustainability of many movements , both political and issue oriented .
