Griff : ? Copeland was off to an outstanding start this season with that interception in the end zone to seal the Western Michigan game and some lockdown coverage and strong run support against Oregon before suffering the neck injury . MSU has not updated his injury , in terms of what his status will be for spring football drills . Arjen Colquhoun has had a very good season and will have some NFL opportunities , and I think if Darian Hicks adds strength and weight he also will have a shot at a professional career . I ' ve not yet seen enough of the incoming freshman corners to judge .
