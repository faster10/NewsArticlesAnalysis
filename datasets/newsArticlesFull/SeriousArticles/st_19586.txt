There were lots of people panicking but it was still quite calm . A group of us managed to escape through a safety exit that was near the first floor of the venue . We were in the stairwell and they opened the doors . . . and we all ran out in the middle of the street escaping for our safety . . . I saw a few ? people down , I saw some blood , I saw someone who was shot in the leg . But I don t think I saw anyone properly down , but it was quite horrible . I m only realizing it now to be honest .
