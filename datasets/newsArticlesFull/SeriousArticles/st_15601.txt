The Republicans did a number of things to win that created the circumstance that leads to Iowa , where the top two candidates are both candidates that large parts of the party leadership wish weren t there . I think problem one was feeding the Tea Party and a particularly radical view of the United States and of Obama ? that somehow President Obama was a Muslim , a socialist , an extremist who was going to transform the country into something Americans wouldn t recognize . That was not true : he is not Muslim , even though it shouldn t matter if he were . He is not a socialist , as Bernie Sanders , by contrast , is showing us . He is not someone who wants to create a strange new America . The stock market s doing great , the economy is picking up . He probably hasn t done enough , and I think he thinks this himself , about income inequality .
