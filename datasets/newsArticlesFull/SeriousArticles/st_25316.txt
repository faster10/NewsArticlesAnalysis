Bernie Sanders had a bit of a stumble this week , too . He ' s always pledged never to run negative campaign ads , and many said he crossed that line this week with an ad clearly meant to contrast his views on Wall Street with Hillary Clinton ' s . Team Clinton immediately pointed out that Bernie had ( in their opinion ) broken his non negative pledge . Sanders , to his discredit , tried to claim that the ad really had nothing to do with Clinton whatsoever . In an interview , Sanders tried to make this case : " I think anybody who looks at that ad understands it ' s not a negative ad . " When told that Clinton was saying it was , Sanders responded : " Well , I know that that ' s what Hillary Clinton says , but Hillary Clinton is not right . Did you see any picture of Hillary Clinton in there ? Did you see any mention of Hillary in there ? "
