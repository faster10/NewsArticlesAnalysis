There are a lot of things that you can see in the theater ? a wall splitting apart to reveal something ? that you don t often get to see in television , said Kail , citing the transition between Frosty s Palace and the Beauty School Dropout number as a magical only on TV by way of the stage moment . The production team is presenting Grease as a traditional stage show , albeit with three separate soundstages that will require the actors to huff and puff between scenes to make their mark . We want to embrace the liveness of this and celebrate that we re making this tonight , Kail adds . Meanwhile , the 700 some live studio audience will add spontaneity and even background work , appearing just feet from the action in dances and pep rallies . ?
