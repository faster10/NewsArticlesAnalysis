2 . We can t doubt Oklahoma as a contender anymore : What was the knock on this Oklahoma team this season ? They didn t really have a four man that they could trust ? I m not sure that story line is really a thing anymore , not after the way Lattin played . I know he missed that free throw at the end of regulation , but he finished the night with 10 points , 14 boards , six blocks and a pair of assists in 39 minutes . He was terrific , and played like a guy Oklahoma can rely on as Ryan Spangler s front court counterpart .
