Certain public interest groups , like charities and nonprofit athletic organizations , do not have to pay federal income tax on their donations or dues . These tax exempt groups include 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations ( named for the relevant section of the code ) . To qualify , a group must be " operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare . " The definition of " social welfare " is broad , and applies to all points of view . The ACLU ' s lobbying arm , for which we work , is a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) . So is the National Right to Life Committee .
