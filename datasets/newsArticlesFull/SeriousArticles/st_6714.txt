How far they can go : The Chiefs have no reason to fear their first round playoff opponents . They beat the Texans 27 20 in Houston in September . The Chiefs have nothing to fear on the road in the first round . A strong case can be made that they ve been better on the road than at home this season . Despite Smith s struggles against Oakland , he s clearly behind only New England s Tom Brady and Roethlisberger among AFC playoff quarterbacks . He should be good enough to help the Chiefs get one playoff victory , if not more .
