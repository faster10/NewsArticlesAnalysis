All of this means the next Democratic debate could be quite good . I ' d like the voters get a chance to hear the differences between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy , on how to deal with Wall Street , on domestic economic issues facing the middle class , on gun control , on law enforcement , on immigration , on criminal justice reform , on marijuana reform , on trade agreements , on how to deal with Congress and on executive power in general . Some of these differences are small , and some are quite large . The voters deserve to have these differences clearly defined by the two candidates , in detail .
