Still , a rare double fault from the American helps . And then she hits it long , a careless shot there . But a winner , coupled with a roar , puts Williams back in front . A fierce return from Sharapova takes it to deuce . . . she ' s not going to make it easy for Williams . But a fine forehand , followed by an ace , gives the American the game .
