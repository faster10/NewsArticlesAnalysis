How low can the voting go ? This is a question that preoccupies political consultants . In the last presidential election , many pollsters were beside themselves , not because their predictions were off regarding demographic groups , but because the total number of voters ended up being larger than expected .

The prediction was that they would mostly stay asleep through the 2012 presidential election , but not nearly enough did and President Obama won a second term .
