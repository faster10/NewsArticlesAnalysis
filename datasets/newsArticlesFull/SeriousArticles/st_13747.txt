Alabama ' s ? Allen said the ? Crimson Tide ? concentrates on taking away the run so they can get after the quarterback . To have the opportunity to be in my first national championship game as a coach , and it comes against ? Alabama , I just have to smile at God on that one . Shoe Station locations staying open one hour after a winning game or until merchandise sells out are : Mobile ( both ? locations ) , Eastern Shore , Foley , Tuscaloosa , Dothan , East Chase , Prattville and Pensacola , Fla . " We look forward to hopefully playing our best four quarters " . Alexander kept Oklahoma standout ? Sterling Shepard ? in check for the majority of the Orange Bowl . In my opinion , that is the only way ? Clemson ? wins this game . Michigan State fans got a little buzz about stopping Derrick Henry and forcing Coker to beat them with his arm . But after thrashing the Spartans in the semifinal , the betting public was in love with Nick Saban ' s program and pushed their line toward a touchdown . Whether it ' s Saban winning his fifth national title , or ? Clemson ? going 15 0 , this is going to be special no matter what happens or how this turns out .
