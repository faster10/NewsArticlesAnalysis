Carolina Panthers : ? Coach Ron Rivera learned from his 2013 postseason experience that ended with a home loss after a bye week that perhaps keeping everything as normal as possible will help . So Rivera plans to practice again on Friday to maintain the routine he has all season . He has kept players around as much as possible to keep them from losing focus . They ' ll get Saturday and Sunday off , but it will be back to work on Monday to prepare for either Seattle , Washington or Green Bay . ? David Newton
