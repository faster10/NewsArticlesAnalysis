First of all America has gone through shutdowns before . Andrew Stiles notes in National Review that the U . S government has shut down 17 times since 1976 . The vast majority of those shutdowns happened when the Democrats controlled the House . They happened under Jimmy Carter over abortion policy ( remember when that divided the Democrats ? ) and under Ronald Reagan , mostly about budget priorities including efforts to nix Reagan ' s pet projects ( sound familiar ? ) . During the 21 day face off between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich , unemployment fell slightly and America emerged with a welfare reform deal . Not too bad .
