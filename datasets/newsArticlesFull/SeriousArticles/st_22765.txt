San Bernardino illustrates the problem . To get a visa to the United States , Malik ? who reportedly pledged her allegiance to ISIS in a Facebook post during Wednesday s attack ? had to go through an in person interview , biometrics , and checks against terrorist watch lists . The review included her workplaces , travel history , and family . The process is supposed to be especially rigorous for people from extremist infested countries such as Pakistan , where she was born . Then , to get a green card , she had to go through additional national security background checks using data from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security . She passed both screenings , most recently in July . Now Pakistanis are trying to blame Saudi Arabia for radicalizing her while the Saudis claim to have no information linking her to militants .
