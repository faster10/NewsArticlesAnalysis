Clinton s hard work courting black and Latino thought leaders is paying off . On Friday she unrolled the endorsement of Black Chambers , Inc . , an umbrella group for more than 100 national black chambers of commerce . Former Attorney General Eric Holder , the first African American ever to hold that position , threw his support to Clinton earlier this week . She has the backing of almost all of the Congressional Black Caucus , including its chairman , Rep . G . K . Butterfield ( D N . C . ) . She has similar support from prominent Hispanic Democrats ? including the man many think she might pick as a her running mate , Housing and Urban Development Sec . Julian Castro .
