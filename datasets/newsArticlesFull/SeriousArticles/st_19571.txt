The worry behind this election was that Philadelphia would not turn out , or produce a very low turnout , said Sen . Robert P . Casey Jr . ( D Pa . ) , who made nearly a dozen campaign appearances for the Democratic candidates between Halloween and Election Day and who has endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton for president . As it turned out , Philly contributed more than 10 percent of the statewide vote . Hillary , who already has a very strong base , can look to that . Her potential in our state is strong because she ll keep the Philly vote , do well in suburbs , and has a chance to exceed the president s numbers in western Pennsylvania .
