According to British officials , 450 British citizens or residents have traveled to Syria to fight over the past three years , and about 80 of those have returned to the UK . And the war in Syria is attracting just as it is in the United States fighters from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds , not just those of Syrian descent . A British official says the vast majority of British fighters going to Syria do not have any real links to the country other than a desire to fight in a holy war against the al Assad regime .
