Clinton , whose Health Security Act in 1993 inadvertently started the Democratic Party s long hibernation away from welfare liberalism due to its failure in Congress , recognizes this . She has spent the primary trying to tack to Sanders left on various issues including gun control and ( misleadingly ) Wall Street reform , has positioned herself as the only candidate willing to protect and continue Barack Obama s legacy , and made a line from one of the Democratic debates ? I m a progressive who gets things done ? a rallying cry for her whole campaign . Her choice of the word progressive , rather than liberal , gives an indication that she d like to paint herself as forward rather than left , but the message to potential voters is implied : If you want to keep the country moving in a leftward direction ? even at a snail s pace ? vote for me .
