Cooke : I felt there was a certain fit there . I definitely did go out of my way to make what I was doing to complement the material . When Donald Westlake wrote the books , he did so under a pen name , Richard Stark . The name really describes the approach and the style of prose . So I took that as my cue . I tried to strip out a lot of things you would see in my more mainstream work , a lot of the details , the line work I tried to break it down more into shapes and blocks of color . I didn ' t want to do black and white , but I knew full color was very expensive and wouldn ' t have been appropriate . I thought a one color approach was the perfect way to go . It allows you to get that black and white , film noir feeling from the images , but you have enough color there to give them some depth , sparkle and life that it wouldn ' t have otherwise . I really try to create it in the spirit it was written .
