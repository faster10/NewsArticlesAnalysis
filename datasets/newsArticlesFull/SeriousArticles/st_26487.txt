Not since Kurt Warner in 2000 has the league s MVP won a Super Bowl the same season . Newton hasn t been won the award yet , but it s a mere formality at this point . Now he has perhaps his toughest test defensively . He torched the Seahawks and Cardinals ? two of the best defenses in football ? but Denver s secondary is better than both this year . And neither has Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware coming off the edges . Newton has to keep to the game plan and continue to not turn the ball over . If he takes a few hits , becomes rattled and throws a pick or two , that s enough for Denver to take advantage . But Newton doesn t need 300 yards or 35 points to win . Zero turnovers and 24 points will likely be more than enough to secure Newton and the Panthers first ever Super Bowl .
