A : With your doctor ' s help , gradually step down your meds . Generally , you want to reduce drugs by one clinical dose per week : If you ' re taking 10 milligrams of traditional Ambien a night , start taking 5 mg a night for a week , Arand recommends . Next , cut that pill in half and take that amount for a week . Then , stop taking the drug altogether . Medications in pill ( not capsule ) form that aren ' t time release versions are OK to split . ( You can split Ambien , for instance , but not Ambien CR . )
