Walker : We know that human beings have lived in the valley of the river Vezere , which is my home , for over 40 , 000 years . This is the centre of pre history and the great cave paintings of Lascaux are just up the road . The Romans built a town near here and the invading Arab armies in the eighth century crossed the river near my house on their way to their historic defeat at the battle of Tours , when the Frankish army saved Europe for Christendom . The valley is filled with castles from the Hundred Years War , with chateaus from the centuries of French elegance , and it was also an important battleground between the French resistance and the Nazi occupation in World War II . I love this sense of living history , and try to bring it into my books .
