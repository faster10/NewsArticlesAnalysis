Well , they ( clearly ) need better mobile security . So , take whatever cell phone system the CIA , FBI and military operate on with all of the necessary security measures in place build an offshoot version of it only for celebrities , and charge them an exorbitant amount of money each month for it . In fact , charge them based on how scandalous the content on the phone is . The more nude pics or salacious texts you have , the higher your monthly rate . The money goes straight to the government , their nude photos stay safe , and our national debt just got lessened . U . S . A ! U . S . A !
