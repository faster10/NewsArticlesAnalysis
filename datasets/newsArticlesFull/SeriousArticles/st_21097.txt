You ' d think that the general feeling about him , the nearly universal good will , would extend to giving the benefit of the doubt to his son . I know that when I watched Jaden Smith in " The Karate Kid , " the echoes of his father in everything from his cool , appraising glare to the nimble speed of his responses is something I enjoyed like , say , hearing that raspy echo of Bob Dylan in Jakob Dylan ' s voice back in the " One Headlight " days . It ' s not as if this sort of situation happens every day what would be so wrong with giving the son ( or daughter ) of fame a break and simply enjoying it ?
