Swasey s widow , Rachel Swasey , said in a statement yesterday : Our loss cannot be expressed in words . While the nation now knows Garrett as a hero who gave his life for others , he was also a devoted husband of 17 years and a wonderful father to his two children . His greatest joys were his family , his church , and his profession . We will cherish his memory , especially those times he spent tossing the football to his son and snuggling with his daughter on the couch . . . Garrett found his calling as a police officer . Helping others brought him deep satisfaction . . .
