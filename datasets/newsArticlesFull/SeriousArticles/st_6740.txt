Harrison Ford , all gravel and growl , plays Col . Hyrum Graff , the head of recruiting . He sees in Ender the last best hope for Earth ' s survival : And a child shall lead them . . . and all of that . He taps Ender for a spot in the elite Battle School , where he faces down bullies using his unique brand of psychological jujitsu . The problem is , these initiation and training scenes go on forever . He forms a sort of chaste romance with a fellow cadet ( True Grit ' s Hailee Steinfeld ) , becomes an ace at an anti gravity laser tag variation of Quidditch , and earns the grudging respect of his classmates . While the movie looks stunning , it ' s also all a bit dull . I kept thinking what Ender ' s Game could have used was some of the fizz and subversive bite of Paul Verhoeven ' s Starship Troopers .
