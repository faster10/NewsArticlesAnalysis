The episode also featured plenty of callbacks to past episodes that neatly positioned Morgan ' s arc within the larger narrative : we revisited Morgan ' s shelter in King County where Rick , Carl and Michonne ran into him ( and Morgan first told Carl " don ' t ever be sorry " ) Eastman made him a poignant promise that someday , " you ' re gonna hold a baby again " which added context to the beautiful moment when Rick offered to let Morgan hold Judith in the premiere we got a different perspective on Morgan coming across the Terminus sign on the train tracks as he began his quest for Rick last season and Williams even visually paralleled Eastman apologizing to Morgan before knocking him out with his staff with the way Morgan knocked out the Wolf in 602 .
