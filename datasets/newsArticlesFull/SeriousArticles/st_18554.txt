BY THE NUMBERS CLINTON SEEN AS WINNER IN NOVEMBER A TRUMP PRESIDENCY INSPIRES ANXIETY . Most Americans expect that Hillary Clinton would prevail against her leading GOP opponent in November , while Bernie Sanders chances are rated less well . The thought of Donald Trump as president inspires high levels of public anxiety , according to ABC s CHAD KIEWIET DE JONGE . A new ABC News Washington Post poll also finds Americans divided about the need for a third party in this country ? but not so divided about a potential independent run by Trump , should he fail to win the GOP nomination . Fewer than a quarter say they d even consider voting for him as an independent candidate for president . With Trump as the GOP nominee vs . Clinton , 54 percent of Americans say they d expect Clinton to win among registered voters ( a more GOP leaning group ) , Clinton has 52 percent support . Clinton s seen by much wider margins as beating Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio . Sanders , for his part , is seen as beating Cruz or Rubio ? but potentially losing to Trump . http : abcn . ws 1KH5Hbj
