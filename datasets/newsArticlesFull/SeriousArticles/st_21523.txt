Wogan always had the beautifully measured air of a stoic man suffering the weird world of BBC light entertainment . He played the role deftly of someone held hostage by his starry fortune . His Eurovision commentaries represented the slow hysteria that sets in after three solid hours of bell ringing nuns and tone deaf crooners . Or those indecipherable pre song mini films made to introduce a country , in which France might be represented by a woman in Pierrot make up throwing onions in a river . He positioned himself during this televisual marathon as one of us ? the bewildered hoi polloi sat at home ? rather than a BBC face reading scripted platitudes .
