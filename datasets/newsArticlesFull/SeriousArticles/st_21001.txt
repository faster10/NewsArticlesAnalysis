Israel and Russia share a common fear of terrorism , and in 2014 Putin was one of the few world leaders to support Israel ' s Operation Protective Edge against Hamas , saying " I support Israel ' s battle that is intended to keep its citizens protected . " In 2005 , Putin became the first Russian president to ever visit Israel , visiting the Western Wall Judaism ' s holiest site as well as Israel ' s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial , where Putin observed a moment of silence . The Russian president even reportedly purchased an apartment in Tel Aviv for his then 84 year old Jewish German teacher . Putin returned to Israel in 2012 as the guest of honor at a state dinner and to inaugurate a monument to the Red Army soldiers who defeated Hitler in World War Two .
