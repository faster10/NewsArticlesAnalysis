Kimberling : I love it from a great distance . There are many things in Indiana that I appreciate more for having lived abroad . Turoni ' s Pizza in Evansville tops the list . Bloomington and Brown County are outstanding , and the Ohio is the most beautiful river in the world , as Thomas Jefferson observed 200 odd years ago . Not sure what the beautiful river criteria are , but it ' s true . I think a lot , in a possibly European inflected way , about the cultural heritage of southern Indiana ( five words that do not often appear in that sequence ) . It ' s not all pretty , but it ' s all important .
