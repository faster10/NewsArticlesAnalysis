I would argue his legacy goes beyond that . An argument could be made that the Cuban economy would have collapsed without the oil it gets from Venezuela . Chavez also ushered in a new area of populist leaders including Rafael Correa in Ecuador , Evo Morales in Bolivia and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua . They have all borrowed Chavez ' s playbook by catering to the poor and railing against the United States , a country they call " the evil empire . " They all benefited from cheap oil from Venezuela while Chavez made allies who helped him slowly but surely tilt Latin American politics to the left .
