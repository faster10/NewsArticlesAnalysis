There s a lot of football yet to be played , and there s a lot for us to play for , said special teams captain Matthew Slater . Obviously , we don t feel as if we ve done anything , yet . We still feel we have a lot left to prove , so we re excited about the challenge . We don t know who we re going to play , it could be one of three teams , so the whole bye week is going to be about us . It s going to be about getting back to the basics , finding ways to execute better , doing the little things a little bit better . From there , once we find out who we re playing , it will be more about game plan and things of that nature .
