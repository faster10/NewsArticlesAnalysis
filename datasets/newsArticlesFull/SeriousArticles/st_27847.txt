Years after its release , ? Rickman revealed he enlisted some friends to help rework the " terrible " script to give his character some decent lines , such as when the Sheriff walks past a couple of women in a corridor and says " You . My room , 10 . 30 , " and turns to the other and says " You , 10 . 45 . ? And bring a friend . " Rickman won a BAFTA ? for Best Supporting Actor for the role , while the star , Costner , got a ? Rasberry ? for Worst Actor of the year . ?
