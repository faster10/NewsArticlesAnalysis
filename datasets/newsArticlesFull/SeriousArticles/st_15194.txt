Clark spreads his musical bets on " Blak and Blu . " Instead of having one signature sound , he tries a dozen , delving into modern R B , retro soul , psychedelia and garage rock . A handful of the album ' s songs are cherry picked from Clark ' s Hotwire catalog , remade in studios that make everything sound bigger and tougher . Abetted by producers Mike Elizondo ( Dr Dre , Fiona Apple ) and Rob Cavallo ( Green Day ) , Clark is clearly aware that young listeners have heard the Black Keys , Prince and the Roots . Although most songs have a live , hand played flavor , a few of them including the title track tilt toward the static , looplike grooves of hip hop .
