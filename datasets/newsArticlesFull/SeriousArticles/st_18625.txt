That is not a fantasyland in which Trump is president . That is a past I can remember . That could have been me . The proponents of those U . S . facilitated cable whippings are still vocal , prominent and undeterred . I thought about my " luck " again , the luck that kept me safe during those years . The thing about being lucky is how many around you , how many who look like you , are left unlucky . This kind of luck leaves you cheering one moment and breathless the next , your chest taut as you begin to feel like everything inside you could snap at any moment .
