Baker ' s interview with Callahan reveals one reason this line of argument should be watched with great concern : Once we set an age after which we shall provide mainly palliative care , economic pressures may well push us to ratchet down the age . If 80 was a good number a few years ago , given the huge deficit and the pressure to cut Medicare expenditures , there seems no obvious reason not to lower the cut off age to , say , 70 . And nations that have weaker economies , the logic would follow , should cut off interventionist care at an even younger age . Say , 50 for Guatemala ?
