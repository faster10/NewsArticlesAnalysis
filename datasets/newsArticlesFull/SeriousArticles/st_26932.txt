Time to channel your inner boy band , Artie and Blaine ! For the Criss and McHale ' s first duet on the show , Glee is delivering yet another mash up , this time bringing together the music of a longtime pop queen and today ' s pop prince for the show ' s second Britney Spears themed episode . Criss revealed that they were directed to make the number " as cheesy and boy band as possible . " He and McHale even gave fans tuned into the stream a " boy band pose , " chins out , eyes squinted , pouty lips slightly parted . Let ' s hope there ' s plenty more where that came from when the mash up airs next week .
