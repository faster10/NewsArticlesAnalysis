The bottom line is that aside from the CNBC debate , the moderating panels have worked reasonably well . Rather than overreact by stacking the deck with self identified Republicans who don t bother to conceal their ideological favorites , the candidates should pipe down and return to a debate schedule that will include moderators with varying degrees of skill and restraint . Candidates need to be tested under adverse conditions , which sometimes includes nasty questioners . How else are they to prepare for the general election ?
