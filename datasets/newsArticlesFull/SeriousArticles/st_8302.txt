That ' s why I ' m asking for your help in creating a list of " must reads " on the subject of income inequality . That topic , which you voted for me to cover as part of the Change the List project , has been examined thoughtfully by countless writers , philosophers , historians , politicians , journalists , Web designers and documentarians . As I embark on a series about inequality in the United States , it makes sense to survey the smart , exciting works already out there . Why not make the creation of this must read list a collective , public experiment ? Hopefully , we all can benefit from the process , and the list will be public so others can learn from it , too .
