Pamela Stephenson : I ' m not quite sure what Billy ' s version of how we met is like because he was very drunk . I met him when I was a performer on " Not The Nine O ' Clock News " and he was a guest . He was just shaggy and some kind of terrible beastie . But I was attracted to him immediately , maybe because he was so unusual . I think what I picked up on was his dichotomy that beastiness and the underlying sensitivity that he has . I think that ' s something that audiences relate to , you ' re aware of all the toughness , but underneath you just know that there ' s philosophy and this poetic , Celtic nature that speaks to people . Also his pain , his underlying sadness and the pain of his childhood . . . when I first met him I think I connected with that .
