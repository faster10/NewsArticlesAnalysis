The Hollywood Foreign Press Association , which bestows the awards , seems OK with that . They enjoy the Golden Globes status as a looser room than other award shows , NBC s head of late night and alternative programming , Paul Telegdy , told Variety .

That maverick status blends nicely with Ricky s own approach to the evening .
