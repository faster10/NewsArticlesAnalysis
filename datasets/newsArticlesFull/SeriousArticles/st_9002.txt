Remembering the brilliance of Rickman on and off screen , in a long post , Radcliffe tweeted , " Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with . He is also , one of the loyalest and most supportive people I ' ve ever met in the film industry . He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post Potter . "
