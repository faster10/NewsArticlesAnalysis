10 . The Patriots have Edelman , Brandon LaFell , Amendola , Martin , Aaron Dobson and Chris Harper under contract at receiver next season , but Amendola s status is clouded by the fact his base salary spikes to 5 million and it s hard to imagine he s back at that number ( perhaps the sides work out a new deal as they did last offseason ) . I envision the Patriots looking to add a dynamic receiver this offseason , with the draft the most likely avenue . That s been one position that has challenged them over the years .
