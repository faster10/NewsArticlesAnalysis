Do you want to see more representation for female directors ? Sorry , every single movie nominated for Best Picture was directed by a man , and all but two ( Brooklyn and Room ) were about men . Were you hoping that the Academy would make up for th e Brokeback Mountain controversy back in 2006 by giving Carol a shot at winning Best Picture a decade later ? Nope , and the worst thing is that since Oscar voters only elected eight Best Pictures this year ( the group introduced a confusing system of 5 10 nominees a few years ago ) , two nominations were just left unused . It s like the Academy Awards just left an open chair for Carol , one of the most acclaimed movies of the year , on stage and forgot to fill it .
