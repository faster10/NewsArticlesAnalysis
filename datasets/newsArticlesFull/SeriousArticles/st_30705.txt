When I was in college , Japanese and Hong Kong pop culture were first catching fire at the fringes they ' d attracted plenty of enthusiasts , but those fans were no cooler than I was . ( Possibly less cool . ) By the time I was working as a young journalist , I found myself on a beat covering anime and action cinema , J rock and Cantopop , gadgets and gaming all things I was personally fascinated by , but couldn ' t quite believe had attracted the attention of the so called mainstream . And I secretly thought that it couldn ' t last . The popularity of Asian pop culture was a fad , and like all fads would eventually fade .
