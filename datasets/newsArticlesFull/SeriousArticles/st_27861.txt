I could continue to be flippant and dismissive , but for the fact that right wing political discourse undergirds anti Black violence . The Trump attackers will not be charged for their violence . But in the few days since Trump lauded their actions , his presidential candidacy is still going strong . And it is the potential for Trump s right wing demagoguery to whip up GOP supporters into a violent frenzy of the sort that happened this weekend that should concern us . Dylann Roof s crazed rantings about Black people taking over the country and needing to be stopped don t sound wholly different from the things Republicans say quite publicly these days .
