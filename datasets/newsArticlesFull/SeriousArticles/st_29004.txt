According to the Republican Right , Russia is the same bogeyman today that the Soviet Union was in the 1950s . In their view , the world in 2015 is pretty much the same as it was back then Mr Putin is Mr Stalin , the U . S . is the sole super power , we live in a uni polar world , the world is divided into black and white ( good and bad ) , and there is a simple solution to every problem . That doesn ' t sound like the world as it really is today , but a significant percentage of American citizens and policy makers cling to this simplistic , hopelessly outdated , and just plain incorrect view of the world . Putin is not Stalin , we live in a multi polar world , shades of grey permeate the landscape , and there are precious few solutions to many of the day ' s most pressing problems .
