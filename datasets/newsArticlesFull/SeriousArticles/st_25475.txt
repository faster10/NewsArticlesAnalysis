If cell phone voice calls were permitted , flight attendants would be placed in the impossible position of having to referee disputes between passengers who , jammed tightly into their seats on packed planes , argued over telephone etiquette and common courtesy ( which is no longer so common at all ) . Travelers would demand to be moved when no others seats were available , hand to hand combat might break out . On a street or in a public building , you can always walk away from a loud and obnoxious cell phone user . On a plane ? Where are you supposed to go ?
