ABOUT THE PATRIOTS ( 13 4 ) : Slot receiver Julian Edelman , who missed the last game in Denver , returned from a two month injury absence and provided an immediate spark to New England s offense with 10 receptions for 100 yards . Tight end Rob Gronkowski shook off knee and back ailments to grab seven passes for 83 yards and a pair of touchdowns as New England had just seven rushing attempts from its running backs . Brady threw for 280 yards and three touchdowns in November but was missing both Edelman and Danny Amendola while Gronkowski was carted off the field with just under three minutes to play in regulation . The Patriots were second to Denver in the regular season with 49 sacks but lost starting linebacker Jerod Mayo to a shoulder injury .
