Policy makers therefore need to understand and acknowledge the importance of COP 21 , as well as the fact that sustainable , holistic , inclusive and climate resilient development is the only way forward to achieving long term economic growth and social development objectives .

However , it seems that this is not likely to happen and Pakistan will probably contribute very little to COP21 , other than providing the usual lip service . As a result , if the Global Agreement is reached , Pakistan is likely to have little say in it and will be unable to take advantage of the financial , technical and capacity potential that such an agreement entails .
