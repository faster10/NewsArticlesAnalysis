Too soon we have to head back to the city to meet some friends for a last night in San Francisco dinner . We opt for a new hip spot we think the twentysomethings in the gang will like Starbelly , located in the Castro area and known for its beers and house cured meats . We feast on mini corndogs , Starbelly salumi , mortadella , salami , fall squash and goat cheese pizza . Not only is the food delicious but it ' s also affordable . Did I mention dessert ? Warm pear crumble , caramel pot de creme or chocolate spice doughnut with peanut butter curry ice cream .
