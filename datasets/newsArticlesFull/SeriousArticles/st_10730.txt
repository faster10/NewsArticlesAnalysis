All that said , Florida may be the hardest fought campaign in the country . Gov . Rick Scott has been a very successful manager of the state , but is not a natural politician . Former Gov . Charlie Crist is a great politician , but his swings from Goldwater Republican to Obama Democrat have made it impossible to predict what kind of governor he would be now . This race has so much money going into it , and is so intense , that it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen on Tuesday . A Scott win would be a signal that Democrats simply are refusing to turn out . A Crist win would be a signal that the Democratic machine has been able to mobilize apathetic and disappointed voters .
