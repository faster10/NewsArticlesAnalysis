Bush began the year as his party s de facto favorite in large part because his access to his family s vast network of GOP megadonors was supposed to fuel a shock and awe campaign that would make short work of his less moneyed rivals . The only thing shocking about his campaign so far , though , is how poorly it s gone . The former front runner currently sits in a distant fifth place in a recent average of national polls with less than 5 percent ? about 25 points behind polling leader Donald Trump and nearly 9 points behind Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio . It s a similar story in the early voting states : Bush is fifth in Iowa , sixth in New Hampshire , and fifth in South Carolina .
