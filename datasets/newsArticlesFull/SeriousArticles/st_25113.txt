How does a city get the Super Bowl ? Why would they want it ? At one time it was seen as a way to showcase a championship game that frankly not a lot of folks paid much attention to and go some place warm in the winter . The NFL hasn ' t always been a multi billion dollar business . Super Bowl I had to be carried by two different TV networks and was played before a less than sell out crowd . Give the NFL credit . Since then it has branded and marketed , moved franchises , consolidated leagues , fought off interlopers , cut deals with television providers and built the game to the point where it is now passed around between the owners like a bong at a bachelor party . Build a new stadium and you get the game . That ' s how Santa Clara got it and why else would you play it in Minneapolis in 2018 ? In February . Why would a city want it ? Well , cities don ' t initially want it , the owners in the cities do . They rally their buddies , friends , business contacts , clients and the next thing you know there ' s a ' study ' that points out what a great economic benefit it would be to host the game . It ' s BIG , it ' s BOFFO , it ' s WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT .
