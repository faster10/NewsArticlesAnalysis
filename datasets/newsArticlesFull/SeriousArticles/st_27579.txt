Putin cares little whether his actions violate international law . But the Europeans and Americans who will organize a response do care , and ordinary Russians may also care , which is why Putin is working to create the appearance of legal intervention . While only the U . N . Security Council ( where Russia holds veto power ) can authorize a collective response to Russian aggression , the legal principle of " responsibility to protect " allows individual states and groups of states to legally justify their response to illegal acts of aggression .
