There continues to be a disconnect between what academy voters and moviegoers like . The academy expanded the number of best picture nominations in 2009 from five , to as many as 10 , in order to allow for the inclusion of more popular films , such as " Avatar . " But the biggest film of the year ? " Star Wars : The Force Awakens " ? was excluded , despite nearly universally positive reviews : a 93 percent rating from 324 million reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes . But " The Force Awakens " wasn ' t totally snubbed . It drew five nominations , including one for composer John Williams in the best original score category .
