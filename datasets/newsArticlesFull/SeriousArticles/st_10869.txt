Radiation : An astronaut would receive a lifetime allowable dose of radiation in a single 30 month round trip , including 18 months on the surface . But this is only equivalent to increasing the lifetime cancer risk from about 20 to 23 . As the majority of this is received in transit between planets , with proper radiological protection on the ship , it would actually be ( radiologically speaking ) healthier for an astronaut to live on Mars with a radiation dose of 0 . 10 sieverts per year than to smoke on Earth at 0 . 16 sieverts per year .
