Tim of Dothan , Alabama " Heroes " ? A media term we sometimes use for comfort . Perhaps it ' s easier to reconcile the deaths of 3 , 000 of our fellow Americans if we refer to them as heroes it implies that they died for a noble reason . Perhaps it ' s less traumatic to lose a loved one if we can justify calling them a " hero . " But the sad fact is , many of those we lost , including my brother , simply got up that morning to face another ( supposed ) mundane day on the job . It ' s been six years , and the word " hero " still brings no comfort , no reconciliation .
