Authorities have since expanded their sweep . Over the past few weeks , they have rounded up scores of activists , closed down cultural centers and worked to ensure imams tell their followers that protests against Sisi are sinful . In recent days , police have also been conducting mass searches of flats , primarily in the downtown Cairo area near Tahrir Square , epicenter of the 2011 uprising . They say they have found dozens of foreigners who have overstayed their visas , recalling the Mubarak government s actions in 2011 , when foreigners were accused of inciting protest . Khouly and Ali , both secular , are not prominent activists but they were still caught up in the dragnet and held for five hours at a police station , their lawyer said .
