Regardless of the fact that Muslim Brotherhood declared in 2007 that they may never allow Egyptian " women or Coptic Christians " in decision making positions , they did not hesitate to exploit women to appear more moderate than other Islamist groups and appeal more to the political scene . In 2005 parliamentary elections , they put three women among the 133 candidates on their parliamentary election campaign platform . These women were the wives of prominent members in the group . They were politically weak and generally unpopular . One of them was Makarem Eldiary , who included many items in her political agenda that were clearly discriminatory towards women .
