PP : Well , every situation is unique , it s not as if the U . S . has had a lot of practice in overthrowing governments or establishing stability in Syria and we ve just talked about these other instances , other Middle Eastern countries , where , alright , it s gotten some experience , but it doesn t seem to have been able to figure out ways of imposing its will so that stability and order and democracy breaks out in these Middle Eastern countries . The very basic fact is , we ve got political cultures and sectarian and ethnic conflicts that simply do not provide very fertile ground for establishing a Western style government or society , however much we would like to establish it . Through the whole Middle East , with all of the unrest , through the years of what we called the Arab Spring which is now going on for over 4 years , really , the only bright spot has been Tunisia and after that , it s hard to see any other ones . Syria is one of the most extreme and violent cases , but it s hardly the only example of the dynamic that are in play .
