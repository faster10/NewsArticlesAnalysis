I ' ve auditioned for 11 game shows , and appeared on three of them . Back in 2001 , I appeared on ABC ' s " Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , " following my 80th or so attempt to qualify via phone auditions . I made it to the " hot seat , " lasting all of two minutes before I bombed out on a 500 question on collar stays . I went home with nothing , but was invited back a few weeks later to compete in a special game starring all the show ' s " zero dollar " winners . With new found confidence , I bounced back to win 64 , 000 before calling it a night .
