Not that he does much standing on Sunday night . The strangest thing about Trump s event is how , well , low energy he is . There is a school of thought that the real reason Trump skipped out on the debate last week was because he s getting tired ? the same reason he tends to fade halfway through debates ? and Sunday provided some evidence for that theory . Rather than uncork another stemwinder of his rambling , oddly hypnotic speeches , Trump sat in a chair for 34 minutes next to Jerry Falwell Jr . , the president of Liberty University who has endorsed him and is trying to help him with the evangelical vote . ( It is worth noting that Falwell s enthusiastic endorsement of Trump is hotly controversial among the Christian community . ) Falwell is a quiet , almost sleepy talker , but Trump , other than a few obligatory cut ins and interruptions , was content to let Falwell drive the car for the night . Trump looked a little more wan than usual , as much as he ? can ever be referred to as wan . If it hadn t been for all the American flags , you could have confused it with a sleepy talk at The Learning Annex .
