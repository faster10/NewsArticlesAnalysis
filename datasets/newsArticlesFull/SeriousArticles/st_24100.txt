Team Metropolitan : The team with by far the best goaltending tandem in the tournament , the Metro are strong in an area that doesn ' t usually matter much in an All Star game . That said , both Braden Holtby and Cory Schneider have been excellent this year overall . Schneider is one of the NHL ' s best OT goalies with a 5 1 record , while Holtby is 2 2 . They also have some really intriguing forwards . Late addition and first time all star Evgeny Kuznetsov and perennial all star Evgeni Malkin each have been very good in 3 on 3 this year and they ' ve got some defensemen who can really fire it from the point and like to get engaged offensively .
