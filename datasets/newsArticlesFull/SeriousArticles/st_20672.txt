Clarkson iffy : Lakers point guard Jordan Clarkson ( ankle ) was a limited participant in shootaround on Friday and is a game time decision for tonight ' s matchup against the Spurs . It doesn ' t sound extremely likely that he will play as of 4 ET , and if Clarkson sits it boosts the value of rising rookie D ' Angelo Russell ( 4 , 800 ) , who came off the bench and scored a career high 23 points against Minnesota on Wednesday . That was the first game of over 20 points for Russell and could be a confidence booster for the the young point guard , who has certainly taken his fair share of criticism since entering the NBA .
