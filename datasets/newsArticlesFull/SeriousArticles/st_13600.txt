First , Gates coalition is the creation of a slice of the business establishment : hedge fund magnate George Soros , Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman , venture capitalist Vinod Khosla , and other graying magnates . And history has generally proven that one generation s establishment , no matter how smart and rich , doesn t necessarily know what it takes to create the next generation s energy or transportation standard . Robert Fulton , who invented the steamship , didn t come out of the sailing industry . The railroad barons didn t come up with the set of the inventions that turned the next dominant phase of transport ? the car ? into a consumer product . That was Henry Ford , a cranky inventor who worked in his garage . The kerosene industry didn t invent the electric light bulb or turn oil into a business those honors fell to Thomas Edison and John D . Rockefeller , respectively . BMW didn t build the first cool all electric sports car Elon Musk did .
