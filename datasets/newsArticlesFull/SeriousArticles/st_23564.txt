The synopsis of " You Are Not Special " may seem scathing , but I found the speech to be quite uplifting , and I shared it with my son . He has another three years to go before graduating from high school , but I always like to remind him that his family and friends think the world of him and for the most part , just about everyone else on this planet doesn ' t give a damn about him . That ' s not mean or cruel , good or bad , that ' s just the reality of life . And that ' s OK everyone is special to someone , but no one is special to all .
