This was an aggressive approach , but Sanders needed to be aggressive . At this stage , the Iowa caucus is a tossup . Clinton leads by an average of just 0 . 6 points , reflecting a deep divide in Iowa polling . In polls conducted from registered voter files , Clinton excels , with her highest support among older people and women ? groups most likely to vote . But in polls conducted through random dialing , Sanders wins . As Nate Cohn notes for the New York Times , a recent poll found Mrs Clinton ahead by nine points among those who said they would definitely vote , with Mr Sanders ahead by 10 among those who said they would probably caucus . Sanders has less than a week to convert his likely supporters into definite supporters , and throwing a few elbows ? clarifying the differences between himself and his chief opponent ? is part of that approach .
