Two weeks ago , the Jets were a hot mess , coming off a tough loss to the Houston Texans a game in which they blew two chances in the fourth quarter to tie it up . They were 5 5 , looking very much like a team that lacked the maturity to handle a pressure packed homestretch . You know what happened next : Todd Bowles got mad in a team meeting , cut Quinton Coples , made a couple of lineup changes , and they beat up the ill prepared Miami Dolphins . Then came a 20 10 deficit against the Giants . Tom Coughlin passed up a field goal , Ryan Fitzpatrick turned crazy hot and Josh Brown missed a field goal .
