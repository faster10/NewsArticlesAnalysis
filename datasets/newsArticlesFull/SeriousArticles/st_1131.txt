Owners in every professional sport have to wonder how long the cable rights fees gravy train is going to last . Consumers want to move to a la carte programming ? where they can choose whether to pay for ESPN , NBC SportsNetwork , Food Network or any other channel individually ? if they are not cutting the cord all together .
