8 . " CSI : Miami " ( CBS : 10 . 8 million , 2 . 5 ) : Viewers don ' t really crave and holler for a real ending on procedural crime dramas like they do for serialized shows like " Fringe . " Personally , if I watched any TV show for a decade , I ' d want a final episode that gave a sense of resolution , some acknowledgement that a story is being told and not just a perpetual weekly reset . So I ' m bummed on behalf of those " Miami " fans who expected a true series finale . Hopefully CBS won ' t shortchange flagship " CSI " or " The Mentalist " when their time comes . ( And , yes , " Miami " cut for age expense ratings " CSI : NY " is slightly younger , and helping hold the fort on tough Friday night ) .
