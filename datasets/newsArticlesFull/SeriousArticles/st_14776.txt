" He ' s been doing very well , " Bennett said . " He ran the ball well today . He runs the ball hard and he ' s fast . He ' s been watching everything that Matt does . Early in your career when you have a guy like Matt in front of you , the best thing you can do is be an apprentice and watch everything he does and carry yourself like he does . Forte is a hell of a back and a hell of a guy . He is somebody you want to model your game after . I think Jeremy is doing a good job . He ' s always with Matt and asking Matt questions . We have a lot of confidence in Jeremy moving forward .
