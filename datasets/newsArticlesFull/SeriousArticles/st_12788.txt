Dubai : A small mountainous town located approximately 25km northwest of Damascus , Madaya was once a favourite summer resort for residents of the Syrian capital , who went shopping there for smuggled items from neighbouring Lebanon back in the 1980s . Of late , the city has made global headlines , not for its electronics and sport items , but for a haunting siege on its 40 , 000 residents since last July . Both the government and its opponents have been rushing to post online photos of the victims , trading accusations about who is responsible for the systematic starvation campaign . The opposition , whose activists are more active and social media savvy , insist that it is the Syrian Army and its Lebanese ally , Hezbollah , while government media insists otherwise .
