Given the fact that essentially the Iranians are propping up the Assad regime , you might reasonably conclude the Iranians have a lot of influence over the Assad regime , Earnest said . The Assad regime has for years been resisting a political transition and the question is now , are the Iranians willing to use their influence over the Assad regime to compel them to engage in this discussion ? ? ? constructively in this discussion ? ? ? to enact a political transition in Syria . It s unclear right now whether the Iranians are willing to do that . Maybe they won t be . It certainly is in their interest to do so .
