This will come down to two young centers on bad teams : No . 1 pick Karl Anthony Towns and No . 3 pick Jahlil Okafor . The edge goes to Okafor , who as an NCAA champion with Duke emerged a more complete player ( though both fled after their freshman years ) . Towns , also 19 , will play at Minnesota alongside ex MVP Kevin Garnett and last season ' s rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins , who will get first dibs on offense . Okafor will coincide with Philadelphia ' s third year player Nerlens Noel who he ' s been clicking with in the preseason .
