The amazing success of Christopher Clark ' s book " The Sleepwalkers " in Germany a hundred years after the outbreak of the war underlines just how important the question of war guilt still is in the eyes of many Germans . The book ' s argument of shared responsibility , of all international actors and a complex interaction in July 1914 , is translated into some kind of historical exculpation : Yes , Germany caused the Second World War , but it is not the main and sole culprit behind the escalation in 1914 and hence German responsibility for what went wrong in the first half of the 20th Century seems to be put in relative terms .
