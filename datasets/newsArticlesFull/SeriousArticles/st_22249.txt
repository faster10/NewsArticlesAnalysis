A publication recently shot down Carson ' s long standing claim in his biography and lectures of having turned down a " full scholarship " to West Point . Which supposedly had been arranged after he met with General William Westmoreland , our unsuccessful commander in the Vietnam War . Except Westmoreland wasn ' t in Detroit when Carson claims they met . And Westmoreland , not incidentally a terrible general , wasn ' t in a position to offer a full scholarship . Having gotten into West Point myself , I know that it doesn ' t give out full scholarships , it admits people who win appointments from members of Congress , the Senate , and the Executive Branch . You ' re not " on scholarship " at West Point , you are being paid as a member of the U . S . Army .
