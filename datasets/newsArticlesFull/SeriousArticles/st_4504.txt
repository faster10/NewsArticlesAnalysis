Texas has also reacted admirably to some of the revelations of false convictions . Michael Morton spent almost 25 years in prison for the murder of his wife , a conviction that would likely have been averted but for the misconduct of the prosecutor , Ken Anderson . In response to Morton ' s exoneration , the state enacted a sweeping law that mandates broad discovery of evidence to the defense . Moreover , Anderson , who had since become a district judge in Williamson County , was disbarred for his acts and briefly carted off to jail .
