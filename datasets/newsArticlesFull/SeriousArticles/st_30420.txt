The third pillar of Murray s year , beyond this Australian Open and the small matter of looking after a new born , is the Olympics . He is evangelical about the power of the Games ? nothing else in sport comes close , he says ? and resolute in his desire , four years on from London glory , to win back to back golds in Rio . It is an attitude shaped , according to Murray , by his scalding disappointment in Beijing in 2008 . I lost in the first round there , and really regretted it . I vowed never to let it happen again .
