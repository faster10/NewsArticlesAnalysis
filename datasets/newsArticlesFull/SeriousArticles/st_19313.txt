This year , King would have turned 82 years old . He would be in the club of all those veteran civil rights warriors who have made it to the 21st century . The iconic Rev . Joseph Lowery , a co founder the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King , turned 90 last week . Many now are in their twilight years . They march to a slower cadence , many with a third leg . Some are pushed along in wheelchairs . Many say the memorial is a marvelous and well deserved tribute to a man who helped America find its soul . A man who showed the country how its citizens could and should be treated despite their race , color , creed or station in life .
