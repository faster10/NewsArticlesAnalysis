Since the Democratic Party decided to forgo the social democratic ideals that it had fought for for much of the 20th century , especially with the election of Bill Clinton ? whose political hero is , ironically , FDR ? the entire political debate has shifted further and further to the right , to the point where the business friendly Affordable Care Act ? has become socialist . Sanders is fighting for the soul of the Democratic Party . And maybe this is , as Hedges put ? it , a waste of time . Maybe the Democratic Party is irredeemable . But Sanders is ultimately a pragmatist . He has vowed not to run as an Independent and not to become the next Ralph Nadar , to the great dismay of some purists , like Hedges . He does not want to help a Republican get elected president . And can you blame him ? The GOP is , as Noam Chomsky ? recently put it , no longer a normal party , but a radical insurgency that has pretty much abandoned parliamentary politics . ? Regardless of what you label Sanders ? and I believe the most appropriate label for him is progressive ? it is hard to deny that he is revitalizing the ? progressive spirit at a critical point in American history .
