But in second place in Asia is Vietnam , where CPJ ' s most recent prison census showed Vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1 . Add one more in late December , Nguyen Dinh Ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for " law violating " after police searched his home in southern Ho Chi Minh City on December 27 , and two more in January , Nguyen Quang Lap and Hong Le Tho , arrested on anti state charges of " abusing democratic freedoms " and you can see the pattern . Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in Vietnam . Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in Vietnam , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage .
