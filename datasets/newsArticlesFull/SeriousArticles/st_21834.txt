These are two words I never thought I ' d be typing as a strength for the Redskins . But give credit to Cousins for delivering when given full support by head coach Jay Gruden as Washington ' s starter ahead of Robert Griffin III . Cousins hit his stride in the second half of the season , completing at least 67 . 4 percent of his passes in every game between Weeks 10 and 17 with 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions . Overall , Cousins is the first Redskins quarterback to lead the NFL in completion percentage ( 69 . 8 ) since Sonny Jurgensen in 1970 . You like that , indeed .
