There were tons of college aged young women around , as well . ? Of course , Katy Perry played the rally and so getting to see her was a huge part of the draw . But , as some college girls I spoke to assured me , they were just as eager to see Hillary Clinton , and seemed mildly disappointed when I said that I thought Bill Clinton would probably do most of the rally talking . While both Clinton and Sanders had plenty of young people of all genders turning out , ? the young people of the Sanders crowd were just as male dominated as the Clinton crowd was female dominated . While waiting for the marchers over the bridge from the Sanders rally , I snapped a picture of some volunteers who were there to direct the march .
