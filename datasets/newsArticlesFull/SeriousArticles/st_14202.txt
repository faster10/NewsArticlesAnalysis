I think the thing that s admirable is the way the organization stuck with him , Rodgers said this past week . For a young quarterback , say , this year , as opposed to my first year , I think there s even more pressure and less job security for coaches and general managers as we re seeing in quarterbacks . To stick with him and allow him to play and continue to get better , gives you , as a quarterback , a lot of confidence . He s obviously paid some of that confidence back with his strong play .
