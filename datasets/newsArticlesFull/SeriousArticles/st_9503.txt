This was seriously terrible . You might say that blunders happen in debates . After all , Perry is not the first , nor will he be the last , to have a mental lapse in a debate . Remember Jan Brewer ' s Arizona gubernatorial debate last year ? When she appeared to have lost her train of thought in her opening statement and for about 15 seconds could only smile and laugh nervously as cameras rolled ? That was one of the worst moments ever in a debate , and she still won the election . So the question is : How much damage will Perry ' s gaffe do ?
