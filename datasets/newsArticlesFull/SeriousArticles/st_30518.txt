It ' s a family tradition . My father ' s father fought in the trenches of Europe in World War I , my uncles served in World War II . My brother Ole joined the Marines when he was 17 and now , 35 years later , he is still serving . Although he doesn ' t talk about his time in Iraq and Afghanistan , he , like my dad , carries his service in his heart and his mind . My brother always says his heroes are the Marines he lost in Iraq . To this day , he honors those men by staying in touch with their families and keeping their memories alive . Every day will always be Veterans Day for him .
