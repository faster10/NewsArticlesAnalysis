We all need to assess and decide over the coming weeks what is best for the safety of spectators at the Euros , said Lambert . We have worked for three years on safety measures with the Interior Ministry and the prefectures in each of the host cities . We have not finished the job , but we still have seven months to refine , tweak , adjust . It is obvious that lessons are being learned and will be drawn from what has happened in Paris . There will be additional and different things planned . Security is the major challenge in organising this event .
