In the wake of the most recent turmoil , leaders of the GOP still seem to be pinning their hopes on Trump voters falling in line , but history suggests that they won ' t . In 1992 and 1996 , when Pat Robertson won his 20 25 a bit below Trump ' s polling today those voters did not fall in line during the primary season . It is just that their votes did not matter as like Bernie Sanders this year Robertson was running against a single establishment candidate who easily won 60 70 of the vote . The problem the GOP faces today is that against a field of 14 , Trump ' s 30 share may hard to beat , unless most of those candidates drop out early on once the voting actually starts , or , as in 1992 , Trump takes the path of Ross Perot , who ran as a third party candidate with anti free trade rhetoric that mirrored Pat Buchanan ' s and won 18 . 9 of the national vote , enough to cost George H . W . Bush reelection and give the White House to Bill Clinton .
