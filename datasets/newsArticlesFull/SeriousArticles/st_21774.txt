TH : The way we do it is probably not what you have in mind . We go camping , we stay in huts , we grow beards in the way we ' re meant to according to the stereotype . But a lot of the time we ' re on ( tourist ) ships , so we get to a lot more sites than conventional scientists . We ' ll jump on board , or hitch hike and hop between tour ships , we might get to over 100 sites a year . Sometimes we ' ll only be there for three hours . But that ' s enough to set up or service a camera and to do a count of colony , or something like that .
