After the teams traded three and outs , the Patriots go ahead drive included a pair of completions to Amendola , who had his second 100 yard receiving game of the season in the absence of Julian Edelman , who suffered a broken foot last week . Amendola , who caught nine passes for 117 yards , left the game in the third quarter with a knee injury and did not return . Fellow receiver Aaron Dobson also left the game , with an ankle injury , and did not return , leaving the Patriots with just two receivers : Brandon LaFell , and Chris Harper .
