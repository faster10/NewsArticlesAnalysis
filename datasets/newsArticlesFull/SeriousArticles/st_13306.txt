Asked whether Christie should stay in office or resign to exclusively run for president , 45 percent said he should keep his day job and run for president at the same time , while 51 percent said he should resign the office from which he was first elected in 2009 and re elected in 2013 . For this and most of the questions asked , the results break down a decidedly partisan line , with strong majorities of Republicans ( 73 percent to 24 percent ) and Democrats ( 74 percent to 21 percent ) wanting Christie to stay in office and to resign , respectively .
