Michael Corbett : The biggest mistake right now is when you get that default notice , you ignore it . People think that if they just ignore it , it will buy them more time . It ' s absolutely the opposite . The first thing they should do when they get those notices is contact either the lender or go to HUD the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development . Get a certified counselor . There ' s free counseling out there for people , because if you just go ahead and ignore these notices , they automatically trigger legal action . And that moves it faster . If you want to buy some time , call the lender , call a counselor .
