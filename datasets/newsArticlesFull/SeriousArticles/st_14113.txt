Jarrod Leda of Tarentum , Pennsylvania Despite the hype , I am very excited for this new game . Some question why " Halo " got so big , as there are other good shooters very similar to it . I think , like " Star Wars " before it , it just got things right . And now , it ' s become iconic : the characters , the universe , it ' s something everyone who loves games can talk about and share . The game allows things that most other games would not the physics and mechanics of the engine are great . And it plays flawlessly on X box live . I can ' t wait .
