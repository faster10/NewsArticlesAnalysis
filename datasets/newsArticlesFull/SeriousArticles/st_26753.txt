The dog figurine finds its way to Bond s apartment in Spectre , and a tattered Union Jack flies near the end of the movie . But Spectre , in addition to not necessarily making much sense from scene to scene and within individual scenes themselves , lacks a similarly compelling animating idea . There s some incoherent nonsense about the morality of the surveillance state and drones vs . double 0s ( about which I ll have more to say on Monday ) . Surveillance is bad , apparently , unless you re Q using nanobots in Bond s blood to track him .
