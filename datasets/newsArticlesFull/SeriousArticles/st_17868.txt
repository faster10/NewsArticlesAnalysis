The same is true of the EPR nuclear reactor . The parent company Areva s nuclear operations arm has been dismantled and taken over by EDF , the energy major . NSA Ajit Doval , who was in Paris a week ago , reportedly told his opposite number Jacques Audibert that India would not renege on its commitment to the EPR . However , a concrete outcome for the six EPRs , slated to be built in Jaitapur , still appears a long way off despite separate MoUs detailing construction and operations signed between Areva , Larsen Toubro and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India .
