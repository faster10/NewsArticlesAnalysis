Harvey : Bell poses the Bengals ' biggest threat . Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther still remembers well Bell ' s 185 yard performance against him last year . He knows Cincinnati ' s struggles to contain Bell ' s counter runs resulted in a loss . They focused on Bell in the second meeting and held him to 20 yards before he left the season finale with a knee injury . This year , the Bengals have given up chunk plays to running backs , skewing their yards per carry allowed to 4 . 9 , 28th best in the NFL . To rein it back in this week , the Bengals have to tackle better and use linebackers to stretch the field horizontally to keep ball carriers contained .
