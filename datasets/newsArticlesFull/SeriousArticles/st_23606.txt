No mentor to model yourself after ? Maybe that s a good thing : When Cam came into the NFL , he d won the collegiate national championship game and the Heisman trophy , but many doubted he d succeed at the pro level . That s because he was a 6 5 , 250 pound running passing hybrid no one had ever seen before . Sure , he s a great athlete , they said . But can he read pro defenses ? Can he throw an accurate ball ? The main comparison was to JaMarcus Russell , the top draft pick of 2007 and one of the worst busts of recent memory . After the Panthers took Newton No . 1 in the 2011 draft , Cam put on the No . 1 jersey ? a not so subtle declaration of his own feelings about his worth ? and proceeded to become the kind of MVP caliber quarterback no one has ever seen before . Lesson : somebody s got to show what s never been done can in fact be done . Why not you ?
