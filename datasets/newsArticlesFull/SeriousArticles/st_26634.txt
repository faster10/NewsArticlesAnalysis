The good news ? Although " The Revenant , " " Bridge of Spies " and " The Big Short " barely feature female faces , there were strong roles for actresses in every other best picture nominee , while several ? " Brooklyn , " " Room " and " Mad Max : Fury Road " are really truly women driven stories . ( Although the lack of a best picture or director nod for ? " Carol " was a huge disappointment . ) The bad news ? Not one of the eight best picture nominees was directed by a woman . ( At least , unlike last year , women landed some of the screenplay nominations . ) True , the lack of visibility is directly a result of the lack of opportunity ? more than 90 of films are still directed by men , making the field of potential Oscar nominees very small . And the excellent , female directed films " Suffragette " and " Diary of a Teenage Girl " which could have been contenders were either too conventional , or too unconventional , to win and build early support . But that ' s an explanation , not an excuse , and today ' s restricted honor roll remains a call for change .
