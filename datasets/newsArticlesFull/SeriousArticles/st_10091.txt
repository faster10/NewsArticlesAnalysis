No matter how extreme a position the GOP caucus in Congress took , Cruz always took a more extreme one . The Republican leadership merely wanted to vote to repeal Obamacare Cruz pushed the party to shut down the government in the fall of 2013 in order to kill it . This strategy , of course , failed , but it represented a big win for Cruz . He officially became the party s enfant terrible , refusing to kowtow to the wishes of those Republican establishment sell outs John Boehner and Mitch McConnell . In an election cycle in which the defining characteristic is grass roots anger at the GOP establishment , running against Washington , and , in particular , the GOP leadership , is a winning message ? and Cruz s bona fides in this area are beyond reproach . At the same time , Cruz is still a senator , so he , at least theoretically , appears to have actual political experience and seems a less frightening presidential option than someone like Trump or the now fading Ben Carson .
