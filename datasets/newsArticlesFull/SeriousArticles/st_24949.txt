Our New Year ' s Eve would not be complete without bagna cauda , a southern Italian dip . Its literal translation is " hot bath . " To make it , you combine anchovies , tuna , garlic , and heavy cream in a sizzling skillet . ( A word of warning : The overpowering smell may ward off some guests . ) Still , we believe , as the Italians of Calabria do , that you must consume at least one cabbage leaf soaked in it or your luck in the coming year may be jeopardized .
