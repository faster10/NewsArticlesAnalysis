Another female driven success , " Maleficent , " dropped only 52 percent to snag second place with 33 . 5 million . With a two week total of 127 . 4 million , the film is lagging behind other CG heavy Disney reboots like " Alice in Wonderland " and " Oz : The Great and Powerful , " both of which featured " Maleficent " director Robert Stromberg as their production designer . But with a strong international gross and still yet to open in the major Asian markets , the Jolie starring fairy tale looks to be headed for a more than comfy global total somewhere in the half a billion range .
