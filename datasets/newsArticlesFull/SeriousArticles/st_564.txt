This was a tough way for the Patriots ' season to end . There will be no Super Bowl repeat , and Brady and Bill Belichick will not win a fifth ring together this season . The Patriots spoke often in the locker room about a play here and a play there , and repeating the cliche about it being a game of inches . Last year , Malcolm Butler made an unbelievable interception with the Seattle Seahawks a yard away from beating the Patriots in the Super Bowl . This year , the Patriots will go home thinking about the plays they didn ' t make , like a pass that was tipped and intercepted with 12 seconds left when the Patriots were trying to tie the game with a two point conversion .
