This is why , the Church is convinced , God chooses certain people to be celibate . Their mission is to witness to a transcendent form of love , the way that we will love in heaven . In God ' s realm , we will experience a communion ( bodily as well as spiritual ) compared to which even the most intense forms of communion here below pale into insignificance , and celibates make this truth viscerally real for us now . Though one can present practical reasons for it , I believe that celibacy only finally makes sense in this eschatological context .
