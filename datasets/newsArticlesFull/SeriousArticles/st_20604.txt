I think that many see the wall as essentially ending the problem of terrorism . The Israeli public as a whole has moved right and there is a collective belief that Israel can simply kick this can down the road and deal with the problem later . I think it ' s short sighted , in terms of demographics , regional politics , in terms of the technology of terrorism , pushing this problem away when there will be more Palestinians with the potential for being more radicalized , perhaps a greater international coalition arrayed against Israel . It doesn ' t seem to be a far sighted way to secure Israel .
