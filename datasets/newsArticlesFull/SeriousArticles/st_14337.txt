Speaking of which , there s really no better contrast between the whining on the GOP side and the comparatively presidential stature of the Democratic front runners . Clinton , for her part , powered through 11 hours of testimony before a mostly hostile Republican panel of congresspersons without a single letter or gripe in its aftermath . Conversely , the Republican presidential field wasted a solid chunk of their CNBC debate throwing crowd pleasing tantrums about John Harwood , of all people , and how very cruel he was being to them by asking about their records and policies . For a pack of tough guys who ve spent seven years impugning President Obama s masculinity and patriotism , they themselves obviously can t withstand the harsh Klieg lights of known badass John Harwood ? Haven t we heard for several years now about Vladimir Putin s bare chested , horseback riding virility ?
