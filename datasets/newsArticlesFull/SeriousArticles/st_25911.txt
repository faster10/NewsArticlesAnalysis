It was a long season ? this was just the fourth year that baseball lasted until November ? but a memorable one for these two teams . We know for sure there will be a rematch next season : these two teams open next year with a two game series in Kansas City . It will be a particularly painful Opening Day as the Mets watch the Royals raise their championship banner . Both teams look primed to get back to the World Series , but baseball doesn t work that way and you really never know . Among Kansas City s free agents are regulars Alex Rios and Ben Zobrist , starting pitchers Johnny Cueto and Chris Young , and relievers Ryan Madson and Franklin Morales . New York has bigger questions : while pitchers Bartolo Colon and Tyler Clippard are free agents , the debates will rage over whether to re sign Daniel Murphy and or Yoenis Cespedes . The Mets greatly benefited from Cespedes hot bat after acquiring him at the trade deadline , but may be disinclined to offer him a long term deal . Murphy was red hot for much of the postseason but he s typically a low power , low walk player with an inconsistent glove . But the Mets will need to go after some hitters to complement their great starting pitching .
