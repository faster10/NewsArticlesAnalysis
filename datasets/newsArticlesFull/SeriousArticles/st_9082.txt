As Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion , " The law before us is an outright ban , backed by criminal sanctions . Section 441b makes it a felony for all corporations including nonprofit advocacy corporations either to expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a general election . . . . If the First Amendment has any force , it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens , or associations of citizens , for simply engaging in political speech . "
