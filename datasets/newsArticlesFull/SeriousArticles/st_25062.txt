In response to the comment in the TOTC regarding the Chicago teachers union . The teachers may or may not be going on strike which simply shows that there is strength in unions and we should be emulating unions so everyone can earn a living wage . It ' s truly us against them when it comes to management vs . typical working people . To have the audacity to make statements about teachers being greedy is nonsense . This kind of nonsense has to stop , it ' s not us against them . Teachers are clearly discriminated against and are held to account for the failures of students when the true failures in the school system have to do with parents , not teachers or curriculum . We may spend too much money on administrations , but the failures still reside with the parents who allow their students to get away with murder .
