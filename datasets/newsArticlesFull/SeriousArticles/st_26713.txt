' Football clubs don ' t stand still , there ' s always change and you can ' t always control it , ' he reasons . ' I ' m a Liverpool fan so it hurt , I loved every day I went to work there , made some great friends and we had a great family atmosphere around the place . I ' ve got great affection for the club and I keep in touch with Brendan Rodgers , Ian Ayre , Raheem and Steven Gerrard . Although I left , they still treated me with the utmost respect and as they say , when one door closes another opens . '
