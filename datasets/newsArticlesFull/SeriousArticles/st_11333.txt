Michigan Avenue Streetwall , Chicago , Illinois This 12 block stretch of historic buildings along Michigan Avenue between 11th and Randolph Streets dates back to the early 1880s . The streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including Adler Sullivan , Louis Sullivan , D . H . Burnham and Holabird Roche , the National Trust said . Although the stretch was designated a Chicago Landmark in 2002 , the National Trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades .
