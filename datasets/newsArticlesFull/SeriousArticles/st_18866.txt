What happens with quarterback Robert Griffin III ? The Redskins picked up his 2016 option last spring , so he would count 16 . 2 million against the salary cap if they wanted to keep him . But there ' s no reason to do so and there ' s zero reason to think it would be wise given the salary figure . Griffin could always renegotiate his option , but why would he want to stay with a team that made him a third stringer all season ? It ' s time to move on from him and it ' s time for him to seek work elsewhere . Whether he can turn his career around remains to be seen , but it won ' t happen in Washington .
