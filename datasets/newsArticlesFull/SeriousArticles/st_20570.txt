The first time Eddie Van Halen and I met , it was around 1977 . We were on a stadium show with Boston , Black Sabbath , myself , Van Halen . He came to my dressing room , and said , " I ' m a Montrose freak , I love the band ! " And Ted Templeman told me , when he signed Van Halen , they were called something else , and he wanted to name them after the guitar player . He said on the first Van Halen record , he took the first Montrose record in there and said , " Boom . We ' re going to have eight great songs , they ' re going to be this long , they ' re going to be this tempo . " And pretty much patterned the whole thing after it right down to saying , " Why don ' t you guys get Sammy Hagar to sing in this band ? He ' s been thrown out of Montrose . " That ' s a true story !
