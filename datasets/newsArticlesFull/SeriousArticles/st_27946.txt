And that s the problem . If Burfict was on top of DeCastro 15 yards from the play there would ve been a flag , If Burfict hit a player the same way Shazier did it would ve been a flag . And don t give me because he s a repeat offender because that should only matter to the league office determining suspensions not calls on the field by refs . Joey Porter is not allowed on the field . He clearly was but no call . why ? The same reason the same referee was assigned the game . Pittsburgh wouldn t be nearly as successful if they didn t get every 50 50 a ref can give them . Remember the Super Bowl vs Seattle ? long history of being given games they didn t earn .
