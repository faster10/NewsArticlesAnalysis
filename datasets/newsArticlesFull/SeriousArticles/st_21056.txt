But then I look overseas . Until recently , Labour voters in the U . K . never thought they ' d be wiped out of Scotland . And then they didn ' t believe Jeremy Corbyn could become their leader . Many French thought the momentum of the National Front and Marine Le Pen would have been exhausted by now . In both countries , major parties had bid hard for the middle , leaving core constituent concerns unaddressed , and giving ground ( moral and political ) to far off challenges . Can it happen here ?
