The dripping typically sold in supermarkets contains 23 per cent monounsaturates the kind of fat in olive and rapeseed oils and 62 per cent polyunsaturates , found in ' healthy ' sunflower and soya oils . And it has none of the ' trans ' fats known to increase cholesterol levels . Crucially , it contains no sugar or additives either , unlike other spreads such as jam and peanut butter . Fashionable restaurants such as the Quality Chop House in London are making their own dripping by slowly rendering down beef fat , then refining it to a creamy white texture before serving .
