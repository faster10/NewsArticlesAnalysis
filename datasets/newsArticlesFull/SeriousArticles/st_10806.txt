Another reason why third place could be important in Iowa is how the narrative is shaped if Trump wins the caucuses . For example , if Trump and Cruz are clearly in first and second place and well ? ahead of the rest ? on caucus night , with a distant third place in the rearview mirror , then Cruz becomes the home for the growing " anybody but Trump vote " going forward . On the other hand , if Trump wins but second and third place are relatively close , then the " anybody but Trump " vote is likely to remain split heading to New Hampshire .
