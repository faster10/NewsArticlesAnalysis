" You hope that everybody ' s buying in , " Kelce said when someone else asked about team unity . " I think we have good leadership on this team . I think we have guys who can keep this team together . The reality of it is that this season has not gone the way anybody expected going into it . It ' s been absolutely horrendous . But the worst thing you can do as a team when things go like this is to separate . Or start saying things . Or start thinking you understand more than the coach does , or that you understand what ' s going on .
