He threw for 3 , 837 yards and 35 touchdowns and rushed for 636 yards and 10 scores in the regular season . Newton is the most polarizing player in the league today , and arguably the most polarizing player in Carolina history but if he isn ' t the NFL MVP this season , there should be a demand for a recount .
