The Rand Institute ' s Brook points out that , to Rand , selfishness did not mean disengagement from the world or sociopathy . " Rational self interest , egoism , in Ayn Rand ' s perception is not being Bernie Madoff , not thinking short term and satisfying just whims , and cheating and lying and stealing , " he said . " It is about pursuing what ' s truly in your rational , long term self interest , figuring out what ' s good for you , without exploiting , taking advantage , without stealing from other people , without sacrificing from other people to yourself .
