There ' s not much you can do to beat the Carolina pass defense . It ' s not easy when the Panthers ' front four reduces your offensive line to ash and forces your quarterback to throw two ugly interceptions , as Carolina did to Russell Wilson during the first half of Sunday ' s home victory . The Panthers don ' t necessarily need to beat up the opposing offense to win they posted the league ' s third best QBR across all situations this season , but they were still the ninth ranked defense in the league by QBR when they failed to get pressure on the opposing passer . They just cover too much ground . Consider the play Luke Kuechly made in the second half on Sunday , when he managed to fan out and knock away a corner route 20 yards downfield . Normal linebackers just don ' t do that .
