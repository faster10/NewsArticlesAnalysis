The prime minister s decision to make an unscheduled visit to Brussels came as Carl Bildt , the former Swedish prime minister , warned that the EU would be a more dangerous place if the UK voted to leave . Bildt told BBC Newsnight : We are living in a more dangerous world . That means friends must stay together . If you suddenly see a Europe that starts to fracture with a significant country leaving , that is going to be a weaker Europe ? and in my opinion a more dangerous Europe for everyone .
