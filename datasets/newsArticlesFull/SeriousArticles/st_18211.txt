Everyone would like , I think , to see a robust postal service the Post Office represents the nation at home . I still make special trips into town , a drive of several miles , to do " business " at the P . O . , where I meet friends to exchange gossip , buy special editions of stamps and , for nostalgic reasons , purchase aerograms to send to friends abroad . The bustling atmosphere is cheery , especially at Christmas , when people wait in line to get their odd shaped boxes weighed and posted .
