Harry Truman took his daily constitutional and played poker with his pals . John F . Kennedy sailed . Nixon bowled . Ford swam . Jimmy Carter , perhaps the most diligent worker of the bunch , played tennis . Ronald Reagan rode his horse . George H . W . Bush drove his speedboat . His son cleared brush . Lyndon B . Johnson found time for such activities as phoning a Texas clothier to order , in exacting and earthy detail , half a dozen pairs of pants . Nixon spent time , well lubricated by Scotch whiskey , in Florida with his friend Cuban American businessman Bebe Rebozo . And , of course , Clinton and Kennedy put aside affairs of state to pursue affairs of a different nature .
