While a number of figures in the Republican Party are clearly preparing to jump into the presidential race , each of them is flawed . Sen . Rand Paul of Kentucky espouses a kind of libertarianism that doesn ' t sit well with most of the party . New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie might rebuild his career , but " bridgegate " has greatly tarnished his reputation . Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker has a scandal of his own . Sen . Marco Rubio of Florida is untested on the national stage and will try to run as the " immigrant " candidate in a party that has stood by a very hardline position on immigration . Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush has to contend with the Bush name in an electorate that still harbors negative feelings about his brother ' s time in the White House . Rep . Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , who is becoming the most plausible candidate , is too closely associated with the right wing of his party and comes from a caucus of House Republicans who rank incredibly low in the polls .
