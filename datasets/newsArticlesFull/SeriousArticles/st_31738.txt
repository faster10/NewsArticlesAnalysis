" As a kid , I took my cues from Miss Piggy , chasing every would be Kermit in my vicinity with porcine voracity and what I thought was feminine charm . Remember how content Kermit was , just strumming his banjo on a tree trunk in the swamp ? That ' s the guy I ' ve chased my whole life , killing myself trying to show him how fabulous I am . Kermit never appreciated what he had in Piggy , because she was just one great thing about his awesome life . I wonder how many guys from my generation looked to Kermit as an example of what the coolest guy in the room looks like . How maybe they think it ' s fine to defer the advances of the fabulous women they know will always be there , while they dreamily pursue creative endeavors and dabble with other contenders . "
