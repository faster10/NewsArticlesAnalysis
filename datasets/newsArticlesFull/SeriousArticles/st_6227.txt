4 . Receiver Danny Amendola s said he will appeal if he is fined for his hit on Jamell Fleming in the second quarter , which drew an unnecessary roughness penalty as Fleming was looking up to down a sky scraping punt inside the 5 yard line . The play incensed the Chiefs . I thought it was a clean hit , Amendola countered . We re coached to do that . It s a big play if I block that guy and the ball bounced in the end zone and we get the ball on the 20 yard line . My initial view is that Fleming was defenseless even though he was on the kicking team this was a rare case where Fleming essentially became the punt returner and thus would be awarded the same protection as Amendola would in that situation .
