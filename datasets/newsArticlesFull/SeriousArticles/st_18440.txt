Shabalala : In sing with the group , I saw a need . I saw the people who support our music and felt like we had to do something for the people . My father ( Joseph Shabalala , founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo ) has been trying to build a school for kids . He said it was going to be very easy for me since it ' s not too far from where I live . I saw the kids there . Some of them don ' t have money to go to school or even for food . I felt I should give back to the community . We have done some of the things for the community but I wanted this to be personally coming from me .
