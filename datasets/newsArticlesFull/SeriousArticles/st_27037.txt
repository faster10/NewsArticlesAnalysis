? Hillary is getting better at managing ( and shaking off ) the personal pang of her likability deficit . At the J J dinner , in her recent television interviews , and in her Benghazi testimony , she is showing more of her real self ( even the all too human tetchy , the airily dismissive , the lordly without knee jerk defensiveness or wide eyed guile ) , and not getting tied in knots over how she is coming off . While this version of Hillary is still nails on a chalkboard to her conservative critics , it is a huge improvement over the recent past and probably enough to win under the right circumstances .
