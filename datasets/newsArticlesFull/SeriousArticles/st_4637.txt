For Erdo ? an , the threat posed by Demirta ? lies less in the almost blanket support he enjoys among Kurdish voters , which is naturally finite , than the almost one million non Kurdish votes he picked up in June , which could go up . Alevis , as well as members of the country s Shia , Christian and small regional minorities , have noted the HDP s pledge to release the country from the monopolistic understanding of the country as a Turkish Sunni nation , and from a president whose appetite for power is clearly undimmed . Then there are the liberals who took part in the brave but ultimately futile demonstrations against Erdo ? an in Istanbul two years ago , women attracted to Demirta ? s message of equality of opportunity and zero tolerance of domestic violence ( 31 of the party s MPs are women ) , and gay people , hitherto neglected by most of the Turkish body politic , but who receive lavish attention in the party programme . Its inclusivity is what marks the HDP out from the earlier Kurdish nationalist parties it has replaced , and while the idea was approved by ? calan , it is Demirta ? who implemented it .
