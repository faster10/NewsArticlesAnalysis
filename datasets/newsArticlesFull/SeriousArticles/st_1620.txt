Best Actress Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling says that the outrage over the Academy Awards all white actor nominations is racist to white people . If they had done something like this after last year s Oscars So White protest and folded that into this year s nominations , that would have been different . I never even thought of it from that standpoint . Rampling s fellow nominee this year Mark Ruffalo has also expressed support for the boycott , although he made it clear that he would be attending the ceremony .
