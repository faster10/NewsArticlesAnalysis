That said , to think the NFL favors the Steelers is kinda silly . Which team was it that was the only team that voted against the last collective bargaining agreement because they thought it gave Goodell too much power ? Which team gets itself intentionally fined in almost every game for spitefully crapping on the dress code for charity awareness ? Which team has James Harrison , who once said he wouldn t pee on Goodell to put out a fire ? One of the first things Goodell did when he came into power was try to force the Rooney family to sell the team over their horse racing interests .
