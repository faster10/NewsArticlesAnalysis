Finally , the Taylor trial was weakened by the distance of the trial from the location and the victims of his crimes . In 2006 because of security concerns , the Freetown based Special Court for Sierra Leone transferred Taylor to The Hague to be prosecuted in a courtroom leased from the ICC . This denied victims the opportunity to see firsthand the justice being done in their name . The distance also limited the number of Sierra Leoneans who could be called as defence and prosecution witnesses , which decreased the quality of evidence weighed by the Court .
