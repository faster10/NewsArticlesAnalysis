By the late 1950s , Shankar was making cross genre connections with the likes of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane , whose seminal 1961 recording of " My Favorite Things " was infused with modal inventions that carried the incantatory fervor of classic raga music . ( Coltrane would name his son Ravi after Shankar . This year , by the way , Ravi Coltrane , who like his father plays tenor and soprano saxophone , released his finest album to date , " Spirit Fiction " on Blue Note Records . )
