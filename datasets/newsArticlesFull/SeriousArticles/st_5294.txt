During this stretch , and in this game in particular , Thompson moved decisively off the ball , stretching defenses ' til they snap . I ve just gotten better at it , Thompson said of his off ball movement . Just being patient , play at my own pace , not trying to run 100 miles per hour , using the screen , knowing if my guy gets clipped a little bit it ll be tough for them to contest my jumper because I release it so high . Thompson continued , I feel like I ve been cutting a lot better these last three games , not just standing on the weak side .
