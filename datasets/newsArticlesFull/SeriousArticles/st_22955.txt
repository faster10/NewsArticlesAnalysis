When I heard that Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas are divorcing I was surprised at my own reaction , which was , honestly , sadness . I always thought they were an exciting couple both are passionate people who conquered a risky business , and each had a past that was just a little messy . Griffith had three marriages before meeting Banderas , two of which were to Don Johnson . Banderas had one previous marriage , but was certainly the epitome of the " Latin lover " in looks if not swagger .
