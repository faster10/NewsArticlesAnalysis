Mushahid Hussain Sayed , chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs , said it was a very positive and timely initiative of the prime minister and Chief of Army Staff General Raheel Sharif to defuse the tension between Jeddah and Tehran . This bold move of the Pakistani leadership was a good omen for the Muslim world , said Sayed , who is also secretary general of the Pakistan Muslim League Quaid ( PML Q ) . He was of the view that Pakistan had good relations with both Saudi Arabia and Iran therefore it could play a pivotal role in de escalation of tension between the two nations . Defusing the mounting Saudi Iran tension is in the interest of Pakistan as well as the entire region , he added .
