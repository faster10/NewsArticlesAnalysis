At the base Sunday , pro Russian protesters chanted on one side of the street , while pro Ukrainian protesters , including a priest and a man who read aloud from the Bible , rallied on the other . A group of women sang in support with Ukraine . Those who supported Russian intervention marched carrying Russian flags . They sang " Crimea is part of Russia " and recited verses that suggested former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea away , from Russia to Ukraine , in the 1950s without the consent of the people . There was a brief shouting match between the protesters but the peace was maintained .
