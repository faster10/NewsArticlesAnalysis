For me , " Homeland " is the show to beat . No , " Breaking Bad " is . No , " Justified " is . . . you see the " problem " here : We ' re living in a new Golden Age of Drama ! ( A Platinum Age ? ) ( A Twitter Age ? ) Add to this shows that don ' t have a prayer of getting nominated , led by " Fringe " and tailed by the artful trash of " Revenge , " and you ' ve got an amazingly diverse range of possibilities . In another era , one not so dominated by cable , series such as " Parenthood " and " The Good Wife " would , I would assert , have won multiple Emmys already .
