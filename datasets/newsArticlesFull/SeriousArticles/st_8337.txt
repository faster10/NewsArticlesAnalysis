Justice Manuel Mendez agreed with Schneiderman ' s contention that the companies are operating illegal gambling sites based on how New York law defines gambling . Lawyers for DraftKings and FanDuel argued that their clients could not have violated gambling statutes because they were taking in entry fees and not wagers . The main support for their contention was a New Jersey case an unpublished decision in Humphrey v . Viacom ( 2007 ) which Mendez disregarded , saying that what they took in were in fact bets under New York law .
