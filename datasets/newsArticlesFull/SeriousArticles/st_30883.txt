Cardinals : Wide receiver Floyd . Throughout his career , Fitzgerald has always drawn attention from defenses , but over the last three seasons , two of which he struggled to hit 800 yards , secondaries could stray away from focusing on him and get away from it . Not so much this season . He had the most catches of his career with 109 and showed in overtime on Saturday that he ' s still capable of making big plays in big games . But how does that impact Floyd ? Greatly . With defenses forced to keep one eye on Fitzgerald at all times this season , Floyd has been the beneficiary with single coverages , which he can take advantage of on deep plays . His 12 catches for plays of 22 yards or longer what the Cardinals consider explosive plays are a team high , and his 18 receptions on passes that traveled at least 15 yards are tied with Fitzgerald and John Brown for the team lead , according to ESPN Stats Information data . Because of his size 6 foot 2 , 220 pounds he can outjump and overpower smaller defensive backs . And he has learned from Fitzgerald how to use his body , which gives him a rather unnoticed advantage .
