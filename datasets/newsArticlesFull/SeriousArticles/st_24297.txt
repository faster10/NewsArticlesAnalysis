For years , Gov . Beshear has publicly urged national Democrats to run on the health care law , regardless of whether they re from a red or a blue state . You can tell there s a pent up demand and a craving for access to health care , he said in an interview here . People came out of the woodwork in droves wanting to find about this . This is a winner for our people , and because it s a winner for our people , it s going to be a winner politically . Beshear has been publicly attacking Bevin for saying he d roll back his signature initiative . He understands that this is now a popular issue for Kentuckians and he s trying to somehow find a way out of it .
