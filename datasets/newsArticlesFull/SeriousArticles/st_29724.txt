Once the shoe making capital of the capital , you ' ll find Marikina Shoe Museum here . But it doesn ' t house just any old shoes . No , it ' s basically a celebration of the shoes of Imelda Marcos , the country ' s former first lady , who still deeply divides opinions among Filipinos . A bit kitsch , a bit weird , with over 605 pairs of her footwear ( size eight and a half , if you must know ) and a selection of photos of the former first lady with world leaders , complete with hilariously obsequious captions , it ' s a sight to behold .
