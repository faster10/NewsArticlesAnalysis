I have written here for months that Marco Rubio makes the most sense on paper . ? Considering the very real demographic challenges in the GOP , if one were to conjure up a candidate to face the older white candidates being offered up on the Democratic side one , could hardly come up with a more perfect counterpoint ? than he . Many people have attested to his talent as a speaker and a retail politician , the big money boys love him , and he s from Florida to boot . So far he has ? not ? lived up to that reputation and he s teetering dangerously toward Scott Walker territory , with these ? lame excuses for failing to turn up for work at the U . S . Senate , ? and his less than compelling campaign appearances . Still , there s been a tiny Rubio boomlet over the past few weeks and some ripples in the polls that suggest he s still a top potential establishment candidate .
