Sit ' em : The targets are going to Davante Adams , but he isn ' t doing much with him , and James Jones isn ' t getting the looks as a result . Neither is really startable right now . . . . Richard Rodgers is getting a handful of targets , but he ' s still averaging under 27 yards a game . He needs a touchdown to help you , and those aren ' t plentiful . . . . The Detroit offense has turned things around lately , and the Packers ' defense is averaging 1 . 8 fantasy points a game in its last six . There ' s been some improvement the last few games , but overall there has to be a better option for you .
