The move is a surprise , considering how involved Turner has been with the Clintons . The former secretary of state met with Turner in October before her appearance at the Women ' s Leadership Forum . While she never formally endorsed Clinton , Turner was also involved in the Ready for Hillary super PAC , appeared at a Clinton organizing event , and served on the pro Clinton super PAC Correct the Record until recently . Former President Bill Clinton was also involved in Turner s unsuccessful run for Ohio Secretary of State last year .
