After two days of intense fighting between Seleka and the anti Balaka militias , the regional multinational force for Central Africa ( FOMAC ) has been able to negotiate a ceasefire to allow aid agencies to get there and assess the needs of those caught in the crossfire . We manage to film at the only hospital in the area , which is run by M decins Sans Fronti res . When we arrive we find a young man receiving first aid for a deep cut on his head it is from a machete . Beds in the in patient section are full most of the patients there have received surgical treatment for bullet wounds . Aid agencies believe the number of sick and wounded could be higher in the surrounding villages but that they are afraid to venture out to seek help .
