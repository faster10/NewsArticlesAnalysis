6 . People don ' t identify as voters : I found it fascinating that many people in Hawaii don ' t vote at least in part because they don ' t see themselves as the type of people who participate in civil society . A 36 year old man told me he never voted until two years ago , when he found a website asking people to pledge to vote . It was that simple . Once someone invited him into the system , he participated . No one had asked before . He ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives in the primary election this year .
