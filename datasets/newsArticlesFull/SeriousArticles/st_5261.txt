There are also things the health sector can do . Brazil has been a global leader in making the health sector friendlier to men . Started in 2007 , the Men ' s Health Initiative run by Brazil ' s Public Health Ministry is trying out creative ways to get men to come for HIV testing and preventive health care in general . One promising approach has been to invite men to accompany their pregnant partners for prenatal visits . Pregnant women are asked if they want to include their male partner , and if so , he is invited to join her . Then , he is invited to come back for a full check up for himself , including getting tested for HIV . The program has achieved rates of up to 80 percent of expectant fathers who come back in for a check up and get tested for HIV .
