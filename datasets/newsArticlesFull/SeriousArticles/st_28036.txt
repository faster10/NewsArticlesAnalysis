FROM THE IOWA CAUCUS BUREAU with ABC s JOSH HASKELL : It surprised almost everyone Tuesday when Iowa Governor Terry Branstad , who has pledged to not endorse a candidate before the caucuses , jumped head first into the 2016 race by saying h ed like to see Ted Cruz defeated because of his stance against ethanol subsidies . Branstad , the longest serving governor in Iowa and in the country , said to the Des Moines NBC affiliate after the Renewable Fuels Summit in Altoona , IA that he knows Cruz is ahead in the polls , but the only poll that counts is the one they take on caucus night and I think that could change between now and then . Cruz has called to phase out the Renewable Fuel Standard which requires fuel sold in the U . S . to contain a designated volume of ethanol . Iowa is the nation s largest producer of ethanol which has been championed by Branstad and members of his family including his son Eric who runs the advocacy group America s Renewable Future .
