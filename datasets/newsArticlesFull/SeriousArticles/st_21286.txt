In 2011 , political science professor John Sides , ? in a q and a ? with the Columbia Journalism Review , explained why we should distrust these kinds of polls that are a full year away from the actual election . The simplest fact about polling a presidential general election is this : early polls are much worse at forecasting the outcome than later polls , he explained , since the people being polled don t really have the same level of information that they re going to ? have closer to the election , when they start actually paying attention to the election coverage . ( Most voters aren t breathless political junkies like professional pundits are . Shocking , I know . )
