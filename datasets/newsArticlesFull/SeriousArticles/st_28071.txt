While her analogy is rather unhinged , her point about understaffing is important I was really kind of freaked out , post delivery , by how little the nurses seemed to care for or even check on my well being . When the ' nurse button ' proved pointless , I ended up hobbling down the hallway , barefoot , in search of a glass of drinking water . I was , meanwhile , nervous about my own abilities with a newborn , and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room ( something even more urgent than breastfeeding support , which definitely wasn ' t forthcoming ) , there wouldn ' t be a good way to get medical help . . . In a hospital . Yeah . I know my breastfeeding experience and entire post delivery experience would have been improved with better post natal care , along with one on one breastfeeding help .
