The NLD may well perform strongly in some ethnic areas , especially in cities where no one ethnic group predominates . There s no other party that can try to bring democracy to our whole country , says Tin Maung Toe , an NLD candidate in Taunggyi , who spent eight years in jail for his political activities . We respect the ethnic opposition parties but we need enough seats to form a government . Suu Kyi s campaigning in ethnic regions , including Shan , attracted ecstatic crowds . But ethnic allegiance and distrust of the Bamar , who many ethnic people simply refer to as Burmese , run deep . Local people say the USDP is Burmese and the NLD is also Burmese , says Hkun Soe Myint , general secretary of the Union PaO National Organization , which represents the Pa O people , and who spent years fighting in the jungle with an ethnic armed group . They are from the same source .
