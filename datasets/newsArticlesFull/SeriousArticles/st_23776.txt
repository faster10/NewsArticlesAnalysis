Rubio is a good speaker , is pretty informed about policy , and has a heartwarming personal story about his immigrant parents . When those journalists and commentators say so , and write stories describing how Rubio s campaign is about to blossom , they re expressing their faith in the process . Regardless of their personal ideology , they d like to believe that this whole chaotic mess eventually winds up in a somewhat rational place . If the GOP nominates Rubio , it s proof that the process works and one of our two great parties has not completely lost its mind .
