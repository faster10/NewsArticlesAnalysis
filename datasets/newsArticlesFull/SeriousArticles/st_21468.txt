Rolling Stone is no stranger to controversy when it comes to journalism ethics . The magazine has made waves with its editorial choices in the past and most recently came under fire for publishing a story about gang rape at University of Virginia that centered on one victim who largely fabricated her story . The magazine was lambasted for not following basic journalistic principals of fact checking and reaching out to key figures in the piece , including those accused of the rape . The magazine retracted the piece but is still facing an onslaught of lawsuits .
