Pan Jiahua : In this regard , China is more advanced . Over two thirds of . . . ( our ) cities . . . have low carbon city planning , and we have very clear targets within these cities to reduce energy consumption , to reduce their carbon emissions and not only from the production side but from the consumer side . And we are going to change our behaviors . You are talking about the increase in car ownership , well now the Chinese are coming back to bicycles . I think we are moving in the right direction and we need to accelerate the process .
