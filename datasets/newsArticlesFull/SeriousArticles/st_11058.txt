And yet the real problem with Belichick has nothing to do with his over reaching on extra points or kicking off to the Jets or twice forgoing field goals deep in Denver territory late in the game . Rather , it has to do with his team . The Patriots just aren t that good . Not by previous New England standards . Good Belichick teams don t struggle to move across midfield in big playoff games . They don t let Tom Brady get pummelled nearly every time he goes back to throw . They don t see Brady throw seven straight incompletions at key points late in the game .
