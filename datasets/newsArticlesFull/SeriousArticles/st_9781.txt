It s tempting to make excuses for the Warriors though , arguing they were beaten by fatigue and the schedule rather than their opponents . And it s perhaps hard to give credit to the Bucks , in part , because they just ended the most fun story in basketball in the most anticlimactic manner possible . This wasn t supposed to be how it ended . The streak was supposed to end on a bigger stage , in a more exciting game against a worthier opponent . Maybe , it could even have lasted until the NBA Finals rematch against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Christmas Day .
