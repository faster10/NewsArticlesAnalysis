Frustration with this ill considered ban isn ' t just partisan warfare . While my own politics are conservative , I am not reflexively hostile to alternative energy . Indeed , I have worked with both Republican and Democratic politicians and groups on energy and environmental issues . ( I recently co authored a report with former Democratic Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman on smart ways to cost effectively boost renewable energy , and have also worked on joint projects promoting sustained support for energy research and development with current Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz when he was at MIT ) .
