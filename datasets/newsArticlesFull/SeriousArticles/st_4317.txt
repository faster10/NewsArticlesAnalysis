" Every time Dez Bryant has broken the huddle in his career I think the defensive guys are looking for where No . 88 goes , " Garrett said . " So not only does he make a lot of plays , he draws a lot of attention from the opposing defense . Dez again is one of the most passionate guys I ' ve ever been around . He loves football , he loves his teammates , he loves this team , so when you don ' t have that presence that can have a negative impact on your team as well . I think the other guys have rallied around really well in his absence , but to get him back , just on the practice field and certainly once the game starts , will make a big difference to our football team , there ' s no question in my mind about that .
