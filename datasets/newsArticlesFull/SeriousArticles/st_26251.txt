Second set : Federer 3 6 , 4 4 Djokovic ( denotes server ) : These are worrying times for Federer , Djokovic accelerating into a 0 30 lead , whipping a sensational forehand pass from right to left . Federer approached the net and he was made to pay . Djokovic then rips a devastating forehand down the line to earn three break points . Federer saves the first two with some granite serving , then the third as he backpedals and stuns an awesome forehand down the line to make it deuce ! He follows that by walloping an ace down the middle and a backhand down the line forces Djokovic to scramble a forehand into the net . What a recovery from Federer and weirdly it was achieved with the minimum amount of fuss .
