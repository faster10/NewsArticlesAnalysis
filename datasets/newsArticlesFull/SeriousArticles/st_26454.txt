For example , one of God ' s precepts actually " one " is an understatement as it ' s repeated over and over and over again in one way or another throughout the Old Testament is found in Exodus 22 : 21 , " You must not mistreat or oppress foreigners in any way . Remember , you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt . " Another one of God ' s precepts can be found in Matthew 5 : 43 44 . You ' ve probably heard it before , " You have heard that it was said , ' You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy . ' ? But I say to you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you . "
