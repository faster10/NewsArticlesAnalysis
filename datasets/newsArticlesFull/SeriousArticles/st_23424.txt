A previous international agreement in 2010 formalized 2 C ( 3 . 6 F ) as the target maximum global temperature rise by 2100 , a level that most scientists believe would help prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming . ( Temperatures already have risen about 1 C above preindustrial levels , according to the British Met Office ) . Global t emperature rise over preindustrial levels is expected to top 5 C ( 9 F ) by the end of the century unless steps are taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions . But commitments that countries including the U . S . have submitted so far fall far short of the 2 C threshold , according to research , and many experts have called for the Paris agreement to include provisions by which countries review and strengthen their commitments every five years . Still , many of the world s most vulnerable nations say that even if the world can meet 2 C goal , it won t be enough and have called for a more aggressive target .
