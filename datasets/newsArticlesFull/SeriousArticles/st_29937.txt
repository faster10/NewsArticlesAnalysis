So it is sad really to see her throw this all away and apparently betray the secrets and interests of her client for the sake of telling a good story to a reporter . But that is exactly what she did when during a subsequent interview ( also in the 1980s ) she revealed that Taylor had taken and passed a polygraph test . She said on tape that she has " forever " lost her " faith " in polygraph tests . What Clinton really may have been saying here is that her client lied in claiming innocence when he took the polygraph test because he was really guilty .
