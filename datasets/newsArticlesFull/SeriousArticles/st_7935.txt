The C s will be without Marcus Smart , which will leave the task of slowing Steph Curry to Avery Bradley . There is no stopping Curry and his 32 . 2 points per game average , because even with him taking shots from 30 feet out he s still knocking down half of those smooth and silky heaves ? ( shooting 52 . 9 percent from the floor ) . But the same can be said for the rest of the Warriors squad , who as a team are ? shooting an NBA leading 49 . 6 percent as they make losers of every other team in the NBA .
