I don ' t think stage fright is important , but I think it ' s really important that you don ' t think you ' re great . Because once you get to that point , you just f everything up . You think that everyone ' s going to think you ' re great all the time , and that ' s rubbish . Artists and bands that I ' ve grown up loving , they get a certain amount of success and they ' re like , " Oh , this is easy . " And I ' m like , " I don ' t like you anymore . I like your music , but I don ' t like you . " And if you don ' t like the person , why are you going to let them into your life ? It ' s a whole package , which is what I think an artist should be .
