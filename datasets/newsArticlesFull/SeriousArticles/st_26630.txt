The senator from Texas has assiduously defended Trump during the campaign and made a fairly obvious play to be the recipient of The Donald ' s supporters should the time come . And Cruz had nearly 14 million in the bank at the end of the last quarter . One Bush fundraiser told me this week : " At first I thought the angry , frustrated vote would coalesce around Cruz or Rand Paul . Instead it coalesced around Trump . Now we ' ve seen Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina get a look . But if Trump does implode , a lot of his support could easily shift to Cruz . He has a ton of cash on hand . He is in a very , very good position to make a move . Marco is kind of like Jeb lite . "
