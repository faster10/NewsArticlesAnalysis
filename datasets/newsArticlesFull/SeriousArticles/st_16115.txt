" Homeland " is not a particularly heavily scored show . Callery said that if the audience notices the music too much , " then I ' m getting in the way . " But when it does contain music , Callery explained , " it ' s extremely transparent and very much in your face . " For example , the pilot episode contains a scene that Callery wrote the music for , where a live jazz band is playing at a bar while news footage of Brody ' s return plays on TV screens . Carrie studies the musicians ' finger movements on their instruments and concludes that Brody is tapping his fingers in some kind of code .
