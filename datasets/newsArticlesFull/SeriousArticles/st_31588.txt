In addition , Farook ' s representatives told media outlets on Friday that it is likely that most extended family and friends never even saw Malik ' s face because she always wore a niqab ( a veil that covered her entire face , except for her eyes ) wherever she was . Nizaam Ali , who knew Farook from San Bernardino ' s " traditional " Dal al Uloom al Islamiyah mosque ( where female reporters are asked to enter a separate door and sit to the side ) , told the LA Times on Friday that Farook liked Malik precisely because she didn ' t personify " the modern role of women today , working and all that . " Family members also indicated that Malik was very quiet , and that they did not have many conversations with her , certainly not about politics or ideology . Nor , they added , in such a conservative Sunni household , would Malik be expected , let alone allowed , to openly discuss such topics .
