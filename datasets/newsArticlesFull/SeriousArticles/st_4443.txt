Pawnshops are wonderlands of the obscure . In Dad ' s there ' s a jersey signed by cast members of TV ' s " Sopranos " that was picked up from a rabid fan , a guitar made from a toilet seat that was sold to the store by a band member down on his luck and a script from TV ' s original " Dukes of Hazzard . " " We paid pretty good money for it because it was unique , " Riley said of the script . " I honestly don ' t think it ' s a seller , it ' s just a conversation piece . " There ' s always a lot to talk about in a pawnshop . Every item has a story .
