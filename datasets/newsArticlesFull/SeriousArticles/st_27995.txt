First , Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority . Yes , many districts have been gerrymandered to all but ensure re election for Republican House members . But he should take the fight to his adversaries anyway . Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess . Their approval ratings are just below toe fungus . Can the President maneuver through this new landscape and turn it to his advantage ? Even getting more moderate Republicans into the House could be a step toward sanity . ( Sometimes you have to improvise to make a story line work . )
