Ganguli : Hopkins has really been remarkably solid for the Texans this season . His route running is strong . His hand strength helps him make some of those incredible one handed catches he doesn t get enough credit for making . The Chiefs will be in trouble if they ask Peters to handle him one on one because that hasn t worked well for anyone . Even Panthers corner Josh Norman had help . The best example of that was in the Texans win over the New York Jets when Hopkins abused Darrelle Revis . Most teams mix up coverages on Hopkins , and since that Jets game he has seen a lot more true double teams .
