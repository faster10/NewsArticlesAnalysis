Most international human rights treaties require regular reporting to encourage compliance by nations who are parties to these conventions . The " Supremacy Clause " of the U . S . Constitution describes ratified treaties as " the supreme law of the land , " so there is nothing unconstitutional about the U . S . government complying with ratified treaties or reporting on compliance of ratified treaties in fact , one could very easily argue that reporting on treaty compliance is entirely consistent with the " intent of the framers " of the Constitution .
