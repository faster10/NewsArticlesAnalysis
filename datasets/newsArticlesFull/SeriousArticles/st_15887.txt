In the sanctuary , the walls and ceiling are artfully askew , " so your eye and mind can wander , " said Bell , the architect . The bema , the podium at the center of the room , is positioned to be wheelchair accessible and keep all members level .

Skylights were placed to highlight the ark , the closet that holds the synagogue ' s Torah scrolls , as well as its " infinite " glass door and the Hebrew alphabet etched into it .
