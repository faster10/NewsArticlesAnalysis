I should point out that I like both football and politics . I thought about going into politics as a much younger fellow but instead decided to follow my first love sports , football in particular . Some of my fondest earliest memories are of watching the Lions play the Bears with my Dad in a steel girder supported stadium where the ' inexpensive ' seats were behind a post . Players would disappear behind it and come out the other side . Maybe . I played in high school and college and would later watch the games , college and pro , on a small black and white TV with my newborn son sleeping on my chest . I encouraged him to play . He did , high school and college , and his two knee surgeries convinced me to not encourage my grandsons to play . I won ' t discourage them , I just won ' t encourage them . A compromise .
