The issue of guns and how we as a country regulate their ownership and use must be addressed and soon . I am like many gun owners who , polls have shown , stand by both our right to bear arms and the responsibility to create safety measures that protect the public . Yes , we want to have our cake and eat it , too , and I firmly believe such a middle ground not a " flip flop " a la Romney , nor an empty promise , a la Obama exists . But we need to jump start the conversation and stay well clear of the fiery rhetoric .
