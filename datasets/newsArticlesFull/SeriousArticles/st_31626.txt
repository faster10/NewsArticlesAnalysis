His AAU coach was a terror . Yelling the entire practice , he often degraded his 10 year old boys . He told them they were nothings , just little black boys who would probably end up dead or in prison before 21 . He screamed , eyes bulging , that without basketball they ' d be nothing . He shoved them , when he thought no one was looking . And who knows what he said to his team when parents weren ' t within listening distance . So , his father and I always stayed close by , just in case things got out of hand .
