Soon after the recent Academy Award nominations were announced , I publicly stated that it was pretty preposterous that not a single African American was nominated in one of the 30 available top slots . I even gave some specific suggestions for who I thought should have been nominated . What I didn ' t see coming was the level of national frustration over the issue . I honestly thought a few of us who live and breathe issues of racial injustice would talk about the Oscar snubs for a day or two , and that most people would move on . That clearly hasn ' t happened .
