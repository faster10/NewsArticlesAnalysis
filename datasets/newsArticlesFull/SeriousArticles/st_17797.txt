When the Patriots did throw deep against the Broncos on Sunday , it was often to running back James White on wheel routes with a linebacker covering him . Sure , it ' s a nice matchup , but is that what you want ? The Patriots haven ' t had a receiver who can rip off chunks of yardage since Randy Moss left . Imagine having a threat on the outside who can demand consistent attention from defenses and combining him with the likes of Rob Gronkowski , Julian Edelman and retuning running back Dion Lewis in 2016 . That kind of offense would give defensive coordinators nightmares .
