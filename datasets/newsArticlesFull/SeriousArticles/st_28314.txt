It goes without saying that religious differences need to be handled with extra care and sensitivity . Human history has been plagued with wars and conflicts either in the name of religion or in the excuse of religion with ulterior motives . Therefore , whenever religion is touched upon , normally " your religion for you and my religion for me " is a good guidance for avoiding calamities . If anyone in the West wants to convert to Tibetan Buddhism and revere the Dalai Lama , or the 14th Dalai Lama to be more accurate , as not only a spiritual leader , but as the reincarnation of all the previous 13 Dalai Lamas and , more amazingly , as the reincarnation of the great God Avalokite Svara , China , rather than having any grudges against him , probably would treat him with all the due respect as a true believer . But China views many Western sympathizers of the Dalai Lama , especially those Western politicians , as having ulterior political motives aimed at infringing upon China ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity . But why such sharp contrasts ?
