We don ' t know what he would have done , of course . Based on his major league record , Irvin looks more like a high average hitter , a guy who sprayed the ball around to all fields , than a pure power hitter . The Polo Grounds , where the Giants played , had extremely short distances down the lines just 279 feet to left field when Irvin played there , and even shorter to right field . But it ballooned out to 475 feet in center field . Dead pull hitters such as Mel Ott learned to take advantage of the short dimensions . In 1951 , however , Irvin hit 16 of his 24 home runs on the road in 1953 , he hit 14 of 21 on the road in 1954 , he hit 10 of 19 on the road . He didn ' t strike out much , even for his era ( in 1953 , he drew 70 walks and struck out just 23 times ) . That looks more like a player who would have won batting titles in his prime than a 600 home run guy .
