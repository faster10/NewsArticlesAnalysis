So what happened ? This is where Theranos has become its own worst enemy . The Wall Street Journal story alleges that employees at Theranos ( who are unnamed in the article ) understood that their technology , while promising , simply failed to live up to the hype . Might this simply be a case where aspirations were way ahead of the available technology , like introducing a personal computer in 1950 as opposed to 1980 ? Is this a situation where a company and a culture believed its own hype even when a simple investigation proved otherwise ?
