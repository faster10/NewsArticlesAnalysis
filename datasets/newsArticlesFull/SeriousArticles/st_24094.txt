First , neither Russia nor Turkey needs U . S . encouragement to keep up the fight against ISIS . True , the Russians first priority is to support the Assad regime , on which they depend to project power in the region , and their initial airstrikes have focused almost exclusively on non ISIS targets . Eventually , though , as Putin himself has noted , ISIS does represent a threat to Assad ( and clearly to Russia in the wake of the ISIS downing of the Russian airliner ) , and the U . S . can expect that Russia will turn eventually to deal with it .
