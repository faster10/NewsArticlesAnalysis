I believed we had learned lessons from the George Zimmerman case in how to better handle cases like the Michael Brown shooting . Zimmerman , you ' ll recall , was charged with shooting Trayvon Martin , an unarmed black teenager in Sanford , Florida , in 2012 . I was Zimmereman ' s lawyer . That case caught national attention for the shooting itself , but almost more for the way law enforcement was perceived to have mishandled it and for the racial animus it exposed over how young blacks are treated in the criminal justice system .
