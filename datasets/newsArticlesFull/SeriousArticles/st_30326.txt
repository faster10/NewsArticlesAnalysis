I arrived in Thailand not long after the massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated Asia in December of 2004 . Thai voters were scheduled to go to the polls just a few weeks later . Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra rolled up his sleeves and got to work on the crisis . He traveled to the regions wiped away by the tidal wave , he visited the survivors , showed himself on television leading the rescue and recovery effort , giving instructions to local officials , refusing international aid , declaring proudly that Thailand could take care of itself .
