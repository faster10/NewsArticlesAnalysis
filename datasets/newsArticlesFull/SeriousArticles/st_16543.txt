Other reports put the small number of troops at less than 50 , but the important thing is that we now have combat troops in Syria . Once you ve crossed that line ? something President Obama has tried to avoid ? adding more and more troops is just an adjustment , and one barely worthy of a news article . It s easy to see the number of troops there just going up over time , as the military says , Well , we did operations A and B , and that went pretty well , so what we need now is the ability to do operations C , D , E , F , and G . We only need a few hundred more troops to get that done . And we keep ratcheting up our involvement little by little .
