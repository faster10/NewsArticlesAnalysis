Henry : Yeah . I know some resilient people . Resilient people meaning under the worse circumstances in the world , they won ' t leave the things they love . We often have to go through that . Just like that last situation we had with Hurricane Katrina . A lot of people refused to leave . We ' re not just going to walk away from these things . I ' m one . I stood back , I was in neck high water and got stranded down there and had to run for higher ground , trying to stay back and protect the things I loved the most . I understand a lot of what the people in that movie , who live on that island , what they go through .
