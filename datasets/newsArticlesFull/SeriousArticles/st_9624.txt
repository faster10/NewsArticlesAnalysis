I don ' t want to paint Alaska as an awful or isolated place . The stats are horrifying , as are many of the stories I heard . But sexual violence is a serious concern across the country , and states like South Dakota , Oklahoma , Michigan , New Mexico and Arkansas have rates of reported rape well above the national average . It doesn ' t have to be this way . I will anxiously await photos from the " Choose Respect " rallies . Alaska is also a beautiful place full of strong people . And this week , all of us will get a chance to see them and , hopefully , you demanding a safer future .
