After a few glasses of wine on Christmas Eve , my family and friends play Name That Tune using my late mother ' s collection of wooden nutcrackers . The rules are simple : You " crack " out the song using the jaw ' s lever , and the group has to guess what it is . Christmas carols are typically easy to identify I can pull off a mean version of " Jingle Bell Rock " but opera , which was my mom ' s favorite , and blues , my uncle ' s music of choice , are nearly impossible to recognize .
