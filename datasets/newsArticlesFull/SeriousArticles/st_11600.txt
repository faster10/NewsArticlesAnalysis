Jeb Bush was better in this debate than in past ones , and he may yet prove to be the tortoise in a field of hares . He excites few Republican voters , but his solid conservative record as governor of Florida has yet to get the attention it deserves . Besides , well known veterans from the party ' s center are usually the ones who win the nomination ? such as Mitt Romney in 2012 , John McCain in 2008 , and George W . Bush in 2000 . That ' s not to say Bush will be the nominee some other candidates have ambitions of uniting Republican factions ? and could take command of the primary season .
