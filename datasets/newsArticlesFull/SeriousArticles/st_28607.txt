As for the tragedies that have already taken place , these brands should contribute to worker compensation funds for victims and victims ' families , including those in the fire at Tazreen . To date , Wal mart and Sears have refused to contribute . Both companies maintain that subcontractors had used the factory without their authorization , so they are not responsible . I single out Walmart because its past actions have been painfully inadequate . Walmart has refused to sign onto the protocol designed to enhance fire safety and improve factory structures , saying it is putting its own standards in place , which are perfectly adequate . Yet those are Band Aid measures that are woefully insufficient .
