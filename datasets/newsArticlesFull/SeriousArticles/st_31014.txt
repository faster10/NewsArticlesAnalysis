If all our platitudinous talk about American exceptionalism and American values like tolerance and diversity and being a shining city on a hill are to mean anything , moments like these are where the rubber meets the road . The argument that we should accept Syrian refugees is not about US national security , and , ironically , it s not even about ISIS . It s a lot simpler than that . It s who we are as nation and what we aspire to be . It s about refusing to fall victim to fear and ignorance , but also proudly and unabashedly portraying the acceptance of Syrian refugees to our shores in positive terms ? as the manifestation of our basic humanity .
