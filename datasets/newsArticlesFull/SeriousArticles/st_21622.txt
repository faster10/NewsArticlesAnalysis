Well , it depends on how much faith you put in numbers . The Trent Dilfer of 2000 , in an era when passing stats had yet to hit their current day video game heights , had a higher passer rating than Manning s from this year by nine points . He also threw more touchdowns than interceptions , while Manning had 17 interceptions to just nine TDs this year . Forget Dilfer , Manning s numbers this year are even inferior to what Tony Banks , the guy who got benched for Dilfer , put up in the 2000 season . Tony Banks ! And Manning has done all this ? or not done it , in this case ? with star wideouts in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders . The Super Bowl Ravens had Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor as their top wide receivers . ?
