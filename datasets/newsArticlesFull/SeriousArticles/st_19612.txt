All set ? No , Christoph Waltz isn ' t merely Franz Oberhauser . He ' s Ernst Stavro Blofeld , 007 ' s greatest and most fearsome enemy , as pretty much everybody guessed when they cast Christoph Waltz in a James Bond movie called Spectre . A legal dispute has kept Blofeld out of the 007 franchise since 1981 ' s For Your Eyes Only , but he remains Bond ' s most iconic villain ( even if modern audiences know him best through Austin Powers ' only marginally exaggerated parody , Dr Evil ) . Shortly after Skyfall was released , MGM finally acquired the rights to use Blofeld again , and Spectre doesn ' t waste any time building up the qualities that established the character as 007 ' s Moriarty by the end of the movie , we ' ve met his fluffy white cat and seen him acquire the facial scar worn by Donald Pleasence ' s Blofeld in You Only Live Twice .
