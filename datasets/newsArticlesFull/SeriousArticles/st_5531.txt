( RollingStone . com ) Bob Dylan describes " Tempest , " his 35th studio album ( out September 11th ) , as a record where " anything goes and you just gotta believe it will make sense . " But it isn ' t the record he set out to make . " I wanted to make something more religious , " he says . " I just didn ' t have enough religious songs . Intentionally , specifically religious songs is what I wanted to do . That takes a lot more concentration to pull that off 10 times with the same thread than it does with a record like I ended up with . "
