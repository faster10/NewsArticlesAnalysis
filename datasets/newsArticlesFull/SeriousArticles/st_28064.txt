Another alarming trend that has emerged in several countries across the EU is a rising nationalism exacerbated by the migrant crisis . In some countries , governments have embraced a brand of illiberal democracy which calls into question the very democratic values of the EU . It is worrying that we have seen an erosion of these principles in some corners of the union . We should make clear our support for the EU s democratic principles and our opposition to the chorus of illiberal voices in Europe . The US should reenergize ties and provide support to democracy and human rights civil society organizations across the continent , especially in central and eastern Europe , where strong civil society connections have atrophied as attention shifted elsewhere .
