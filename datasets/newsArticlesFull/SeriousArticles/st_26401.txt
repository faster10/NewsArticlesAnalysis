If Curry ' s excellence looks like a problem with no good solution , then the Spurs can at least hold some confidence that they will not be so sloppy in their remaining three regular season matchups . San Antonio turned it over 26 times on the night , more than twice their 12 . 9 per game average , for 32 points . Those giveaways included 15 steals that allowed Golden State to get out in transition early to set tempo and force the visitors into more uncharacteristic mistakes . It was a rare sight for a Spurs organization that has become synonymous with self confidence and calm under pressure .
