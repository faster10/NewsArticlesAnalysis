Djokovic s first two sets against Federer were incredible . But before his supreme run over the last year and a half , the areas where you could attack him were his second serve and his forehand , which at times would become a little bit suspect . If Djokovic has any slight weakness from the back of the court when pressure mounts , it is usually on the forehand side . When he gets nervous , his forehand gets slightly erratic and he begins to doubt himself . This is where you have to keep the pressure on him and not drop your level at all , because if you do he will come back with a vengeance .
