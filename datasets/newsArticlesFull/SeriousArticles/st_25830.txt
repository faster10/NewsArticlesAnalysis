So now let s shift our focus entirely toward the outsiders . But in order to understand their influence , let s let outsider have a looser meaning . We include those who ve never held office , of course , but also those who looked like outsiders before this new crowd arrived : Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum . The last two are outsiders in the sense of being uncompromising religious right candidates , representing a constituency that s always disappointed in getting what it s been promised . Paul is a libertarian , which puts him at odds with the GOP establishment in several ways ? from the war on drugs to war in general ? while Cruz has been a bomb thrower in Washington . If Trump and Carson weren t in the race , all four of these candidates would have a shot at defining what outsider meant for the GOP this cycle , and in turn , a shot at defining conservative identity as well . Limiting ourselves to candidates over 2 again , Santorum doesn t make the cut , you can see what the post April race with the rest of the outsider field looks like here .
