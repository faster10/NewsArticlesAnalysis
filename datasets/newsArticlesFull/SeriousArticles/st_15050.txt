None of them will forthrightly declare that Canadian born Sen . Ted Cruz is eligible to serve as president . After Trump renewed speculation that Cruz is constitutionally ineligible to serve as president , others refused to rule out the possibility too . Some of these Cruz birthers , like the outlying constitutional law professor who wrote this Washington Post opinion piece , believe that the consensus understanding of the Constitution s natural born citizen clause ? that it is meant to include U . S . citizens who are born as such , even if born abroad ? is incorrect . But others may ( may ! ) be fueling the skepticism because they consider it fun and or politically savvy to troll Cruz . To wit , an unseemly number of leading Republicans are claiming they don t want to get involved in the question of whether Cruz , who has a better chance than most of becoming the Republican presidential nominee , would be constitutionally able to serve as president .
