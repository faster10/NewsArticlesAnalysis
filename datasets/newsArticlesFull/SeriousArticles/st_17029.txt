Matt Dollinger : Thunder and Clippers near ceilings . ? It just so happens that the NBA has two historically good teams in the same conference right now . Sometimes , them ' s the breaks . When Michael Jordan and the Bulls were dominating the ' 90s , there were plenty of championship caliber teams ( Jazz , Pacers , Knicks etc . ) that weren ' t able to reach the mountain top because they were playing in an era with an all time great . The same could be true for the Thunder and Clippers . Each has two superstar talents and strong supporting casts , but neither has shown the cohesion , chemistry of capability displayed by the Warriors or Spurs . Oklahoma City and Los Angeles have built championship caliber teams , but how much better can they get than their current product ? What players can elevate their games to the next level ? What trades can be made to topple conference rivals ? The truth is , there might not be any answers . Both teams have been knocking at the door for years , but neither has been able to take the next step . ?
