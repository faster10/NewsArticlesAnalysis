These are still rival campaigns , though . While they will band collectively to prevent such things as reporters asking them questions about the chasmic gaps in their tax plans , each campaign still has its own interests to push . Consider this NBC News Telemundo business . The Bush camp wants them reinstated , since Jeb s whole message is about broadening the appeal of the party and he speaks Spanish . But Trump s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one . Trump s rhetoric on Hispanics might not go over well with Telemundo s moderators and audience . And since Trump deserves credit for the large audiences GOP debates are commanding , he would seem to hold more leverage than Bush .
