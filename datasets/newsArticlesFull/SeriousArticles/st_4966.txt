On January 28 , local authorities granted our team access to the town of Konna to conduct the first humanitarian assessment there . We had only four hours to get in and out . Konna was the first town captured when armed Islamist rebels who control northern Mali began aggressively moving south on January 10 , triggering French military intervention . Beginning with airstrikes on January 11 , French and Malian military forces fought intensely against the Islamist rebels in Konna for more than a week , forcing many of the town ' s residents to flee their homes .
