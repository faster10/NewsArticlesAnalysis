Early in the fourth quarter , Fox passed up a chance to cut an eight point deficit when he let the offense go for it on fourth and 4 from the four yard line . Cutler s pass to Langford was incomplete and not particularly close . I liked the idea to go for it with 10 minutes left , but the plays preceding the call were perhaps worth second guessing . After a 40 yard completion to Wilson on a great scramble by Cutler got them to the 7 yard line , the Bears passed three times before the fourth down .
