The 43 year old forward made it very clear he did not want to be voted into the All Star Game because he would rather be resting up for the second half of the season . The fans did not listen . But because Jagr didn ' t want the one game suspension that comes with sitting out the game , he was there this weekend and doing his thing . He continued to play up the " I would rather be anywhere else " angle at the end of the night . Because the Eastern Conference won the skills competition , they had the opportunity to pick whether they would play the first or second game in the 3 on 3 tournament on Sunday . They chose to go first . When asked if there was any advantage to playing first Jagr said , " Well , if we win we get more time to rest , and if we lose I get to fly home sooner . "
