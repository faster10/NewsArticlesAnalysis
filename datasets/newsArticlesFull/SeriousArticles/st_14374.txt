The World Series resumes at Citi Field on Friday night , with the Royals looking to bury the Mets in a 3 ? 0 hole and New York hoping to make like its last championship team in 1986 and erase its current 2 ? 0 deficit . As you most likely know , the only major league team ever to come back from a 3 ? 0 deficit in a best of seven series was the 2004 Red Sox , but one out of every five teams to fall behind 2 ? 0 in the World Series has come back to win the Series , including the 1986 Mets and ' 85 Royals .
