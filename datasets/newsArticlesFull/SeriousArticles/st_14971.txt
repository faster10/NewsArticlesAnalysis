Sanders , who polls show is the favourite to win New Hampshire , has a plan that would make all state colleges and universities tuition free , a 75 billion per year project that his campaign says would be funded by a tax on Wall Street speculation . " This country made a commitment a very long time ago to provide tuition free education from kindergarten to the 12th grade , " said Warren Gunnels , a policy adviser to Sanders . " And right now a college education is just as important as a high school degree was 50 years ago . "
