But the perception shared by all sides that gun violence is worse than ever before , whether we blame that inexorable worse ness on black gangsters in baggy pants or white nutjobs in dad pants , is itself a symptom of our widespread national delusion . In fact , the numbers for 2013 ( the most recent for which FBI data is available ) , provide a murder rate of 4 . 5 deaths per 100 , 000 people ? the lowest since 1957 . Yes , I said Nineteen hundred and fifty seven , the year Dwight Eisenhower sent federal troops to desegregate the schools in Little Rock and the year Elvis Presley bought Graceland and the year the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles . In that impossibly distant era , we had approximately the same murder rate we have right now . What political consequences derive from facing that improbable fact ? I have no idea , but setting ourselves free from any aspect of the paranoid thinking and collective powerlessness that define so much of American life is a pretty good start .
