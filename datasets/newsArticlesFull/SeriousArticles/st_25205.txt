Apple and Alphabet s ? business models represent opposite approaches to selling technology tools and products . Apple releases a small number of premium priced products that connect to a slate of services such as iTunes and the App Store , while Alphabet relies on its free services that bring in enough users to let it profit from selling a huge quantity of advertising . The two companies had a cooperative relationship for many years , and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt sat on Apple s board . The alliance turned into a rivalry after Google released the smartphone software Android , which Apple co founder Steve Jobs said copied Apple s designs , leading to multibillion dollar patent lawsuits around the world .
