What were they thinking ? : Just as the Texans threatened to score for the first time in the game , coach Bill O Brien and offensive coordinator George Godsey decided to run a gadget play . The Texans snapped the ball directly to J . J . Watt , who lined up in the Wildcat . Watt ran behind nose tackle Vince Wilfork and lost a yard . It was a wasted play . And on the next play , Hoyer threw his second interception of the game ( he had ? five turnovers in all ) , continuing a dreadful first half for the home team .
