As an investigator , I first try to assess how someone normally speaks . To do that , I begin an interview by asking questions that I know the answers to , like " What ' s your full name ? " or " Where do you live ? " Some folks are naturally animated and talk fast others are more subdued . Once I know which type of talker a person is , I start asking him questions that I don ' t know the answer to . If his manner shifts abruptly going from calm to agitated or lively to mellow chances are he ' s not telling the truth .
