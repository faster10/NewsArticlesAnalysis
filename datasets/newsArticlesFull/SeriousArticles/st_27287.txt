Sam Worthington , as the mighty Perseus ( otherwise known as the dude who slayed the Kraken ) , takes on a two headed griffin like creature that trashes a village with its incendiary breath . The spears and tridents that various warriors keep clutching glow in their fists like molten iron . And the film ' s most deluxe monster is Kronos ( father of Zeus , Hades and Poseidon ) , who , after being overthrown and imprisoned , has now risen up in the form of a really , really gigantic giant made entirely of volcanic rock and ash , with humungous arms that disintegrate and reconstitute themselves as they throw off fiery streams of lava .
