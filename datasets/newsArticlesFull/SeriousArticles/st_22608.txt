Deshaun Watson , college football s premier dual threat quarterback , against the Alabama front seven , the best pass rush in the sport , has all the makings of an epic matchup . It s so intriguing , maybe they should push it back to New Year s Eve . The Crimson Tide didn t allow a quarterback to run for more than 29 yards this season in a particular game , but they didn t face anyone with the skill set or explosion of Watson , who ran for 1 , 032 yards and 12 touchdowns while throwing for 31 scores and completing 68 . 2 percent of his passes . Clemson will push the pace , hoping to limit the substitutions the ridiculously deep Alabama defense likes to make to stay fresh , and hope to be productive enough on the ground ? the Tigers have averaged 229 rushing yards per game this year ? to keep the Crimson Tide defensive front honest .
