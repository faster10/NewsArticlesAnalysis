Second set : Djokovic 6 1 , 5 2 Federer ( denotes server ) : Federer must think that Djokovic is going to show a bit of sympathy when he hits a forehand winner for 40 30 . Go on , let him have the game . Be nice . Be a friend . Go on . Please ? Think again . Djokovic keeps on cyborging , crisp tennis earning him a set point . Federer saves it with an emphatic smash ? not before Djokovic had hoicked back the first emphatic smash ? but Djokovic carves out a second opportunity with a piercing forehand . Yet Federer is determined to at least salvage a sliver of dignity . He saves the second set point , Djokovic only able to net a forehand return , and he holds with some resolute serving . Yet he s probably only delaying the inevitable . Federer hardly ever elects to receive when he wins the toss , says Amar Breckenridge . Was that a signal that he was fearful ? In any event , seems like Djokovic sensed blood right from the start
