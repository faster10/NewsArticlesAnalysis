Republican wimpiness is on full display right now . The GOP presidential candidates ' campaigns all had a confab this weekend to come up with a list of demands to fix the debate process . Reportedly , Donald Trump isn ' t going to get on board ( he ' s going to cut his own deal with the networks , or something ) , but most of the other campaigns are signing a letter addressed to future Republican debate hosts . This letter is actually pretty wimpy , if reports are to be believed ( it was a private meeting , so no public documents were released or anything ) . The candidates want opening and closing statements . They want pre approval of any text that appears on screen next to them . It ' s pretty small ball stuff , really . Some radical ideas were considered , but reportedly couldn ' t get consensus among all the campaigns .
