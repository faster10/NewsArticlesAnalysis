" This is unprecedented for us , " said Rosemary Barnes , a spokeswoman for Mineta San Jose International Airport , which is expecting a big bump in commercial passenger counts around Super Bowl Sunday , at the same time its private jet traffic jumps tenfold above normal . " In terms of air traffic , this Super Bowl will be significantly larger than anything else we ' ve ever seen . We ' ll all notice that increase in private planes before and after the game , and when you add in media and security aircraft and helicopters , it ' ll be a very busy time in Bay Area skies . "
