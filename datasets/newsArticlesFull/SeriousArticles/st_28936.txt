It was 1966 and Brian Wilson was going to outdo " Pet Sounds , " the Beach Boys classic released in May of that year . He had a vision of an album that would summarize the American journey . With lyrics provided by Van Dyke Parks , Wilson worked over his songs endlessly , trying to harness the sounds running through his head . He almost went mad . In the end , it was too much around May 1967 , he pulled the plug . The end of " Smile " was the end of a chapter for Wilson and the Beach Boys : They would never attempt to scale such musical heights again . But the album refused to go away . Bootleggers put out versions , and Capitol released about 30 minutes on the Beach Boys ' 1993 box set . Wilson himself revisited it for a 2004 solo album . Now comes the original recordings , showcasing song progressions , studio chatter and those gorgeous Beach Boys harmonies on such songs as " Heroes and Villains , " " Cabinessence " and " Surf ' s Up . " The deluxe box includes vinyl , archival photographs and other " Smile " related material . The greatest unreleased album of all time ? You be the judge .
