Kristen Bell : At the time ( of the Kickstarter campaign ) , I thought , " Of course this is happening . This is what ' s supposed to happen . " The farther I get from the date of that occurrence , I start to realize how absolutely farfetched this idea was to throw out into the universe . I start to realize the size of our balls what we attempted and thankfully succeeded at having happen . When we were talking about our Kickstarter launch I had no doubt in my mind that we would make our goal because it has been discussed in every interview I ' ve done since the show was canceled . I was led to believe there was still a good amount of interest , but certainly never in a million years thought we would surpass the goal as much as we did . It was a ballsy response from the fans too , by the way .
