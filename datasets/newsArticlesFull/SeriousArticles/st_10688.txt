Back then it was Verdasco , cowed by the size of the challenge in front of him , who double faulted on the final point . Today it was Nadal , plagued by self doubt as he never was in his pomp , who double faulted at a critical moment in the first set tie break , and never quite got back on terms . He scrapped with his usual indomitable spirit , but Verdasco lifted in the final set to flay winners from all angles , reel off six straight games , and claim a 7 6 , 4 6 , 3 6 , 7 6 , 6 2 win in 4hr 41min .
