This Fourth of July , I will be flying back to the United States , from England , after a three week research trip for a novel I am about to begin writing . I smile widely when I compare life now to where I was nine years ago . I smile because I ' ve chosen to make my war experiences a source of strength versus letting them make me weak . The darkness has largely subsided , and I now know that war can give you a valuable sense of perspective . Because when you have been that close to death , especially at a young age , the rest of your days become infinitely valuable and take on new meaning .
