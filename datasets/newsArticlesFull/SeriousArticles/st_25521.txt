I met Ferzat in at the Oslo Freedom Forum , a gathering of dissidents and human rights activists , where he received the Vaclav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent . Being in his presence was the human rights nerd version of a basketball fan meeting LeBron . But what impressed me most about Ferzat is that he ' s maintained his wit and cheer despite the darkness that has fallen on him and on his country , which is in the grips of an intractable two year war that ' s killed an estimated 80 , 000 people .
