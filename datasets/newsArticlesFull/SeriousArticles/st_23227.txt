You could argue that any one of these ( other than the cuts to Medicare ) is on the smaller side . But when you add them up , they start to get significant . So much so , that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Affordable Care Act reduced the long term fiscal gap by 2 of the gross domestic product over the next 75 years . That ' s about 25 to 33 of what is necessary to stabilize the debt in the long run . Granted , some of that deficit reduction comes from new taxes . But some of it also comes from reduction in future spending . Parts of the act cost money . Parts of the act save money . Overall , it is deficit reducing .
