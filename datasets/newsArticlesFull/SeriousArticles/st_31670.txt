NBA players are eons ahead of other pro athletes when it comes to style . Injuries suck , but it ' s still always a sight to see these guys on the bench in their impeccably tailored designer suits , pocket squares , jaunty hats and shoes big enough for Mother Hubbard and all her children . Amare Stoudemire , Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh are just a few of the big fellas who truly seem to enjoy the process of getting dressed , almost as much as Craig Sager does . ( And a hearty welcome back to him tonight . )
