Even with this long process of appeals , our system is far from perfect . Innocence projects around the country have saved 144 death row inmates since 1973 by presenting new evidence that has proven them not guilty . Think of how many innocent people we have executed , when the number should be zero . We should all be shocked and appalled . Since we know innocent people sometimes get convicted based upon bad identification , faulty witnesses , improper police activities and incompetent counsel , can ' t we at least agree to avoid killing somebody when we know we have an imperfect system ?
