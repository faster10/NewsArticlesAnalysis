But there s still plenty in Carson s long list of questionable stances that will hurt him among hardcore Republican voters . Mention as often as possible that , until about three seconds ago , Carson wanted to eliminate Medicare and replace it with a form of health savings accounts . Eliminate Medicare is the consistent conservative theoretical position on Medicare . But it s not one that many Republican voters care for , because Medicare is fantastic . Also point out that Carson loves legalized abortion . Say it just like that . It s close enough to being almost , maybe , slightly true , at one point long ago , perhaps . In other words , it s grounded enough by presidential debate standards . It is also worth pointing to the strong evidence that Carson is a grifter , and his presidential campaign one long ? and thus far highly successful ? grift .
