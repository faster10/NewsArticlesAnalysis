The problem with the gun in America is that the left has politicized it . An entire advocacy has been developed and is part of their political platform . Their call for gun control is deceptively wrapped around a theme of reducing street violence and mass killings . The flaw in their argument is that none of the remedies they offer to reduce these senseless acts has anything to do with why this violence occurs . For the anti gun cabal , this is more about defeating a political adversary , the influential National Rifle Association , than it is about reducing gun violence .
