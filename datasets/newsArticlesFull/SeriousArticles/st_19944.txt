This means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they don ' t already know , rather than wasting it on what they already do . Students at CfA can be confident that their time and money are well spent and , at the end , they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do . CfA is not the only one to offer this to students , nor the only model . Hundreds of schools , from Antioch to the University of Michigan to Purdue University , are looking to offer competency based certificate , associate , and baccalaureate degree programs . How are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition ? In many cases , the answer is surprisingly simple and , sadly , not commonplace in higher education by focusing on what students need in order to , wait for it , learn . Fancy amenities , great football teams and sprawling college campuses may bring attention , but they have little to nothing to do with student learning . Some competency based programs don ' t focus on research faculty are hired for specific expertise , like curriculum design , English literature or advising . Other programs use technology and data analytics to help students and faculty understand where students are doing well and where they are struggling . This allows for more targeted , personalized support by faculty .
