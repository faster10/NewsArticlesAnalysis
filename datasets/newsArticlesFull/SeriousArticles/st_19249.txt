Interestingly , conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that clear majorities of NRA members are more reasonable about implementing such common sense measures than their more rigidly ideological parent organization . For example , 71 of NRA members would bar people on the FBI terrorist watch list from buying and owning weapons , according to a poll Luntz conducted for the Bloomberg backed group Mayors Against Illegal Guns . Likewise , 79 of NRA members support requiring background checks on gun retail employees , 74 would support background checks on all potential gun buyers and 64 support requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms .
