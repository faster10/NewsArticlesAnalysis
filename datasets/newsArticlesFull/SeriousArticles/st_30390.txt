The Filipino people , regardless of religion , are in favor of RH . In June 2011 , the Social Weather Stations , a survey group , reported that 73 of Filipinos want information from the government on all legal methods of family planning , while 82 say family planning method is a personal choice of couples and no one should interfere with it . An October 2012 survey among young people aged 15 to 19 years old in Manila shows that 83 agree that there should be a law in the Philippines on reproductive health and family planning .
