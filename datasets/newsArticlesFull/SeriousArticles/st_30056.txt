One of the ISI agents was Abdul Rasheed , a BSF head constable , who was handled by one Kaifatullah Khan aka Master who belongs to Rajauri ( Jammu and Kashmir ) . ? ? What is important to note is that this head constable was posted in the intelligence branch of BSF . This exposes the vulnerability of the intelligence branch of such a vital paramilitary force ? ? it guards ? ? our frontiers and the nature of the job makes its intelligence wing critical . That the ISI penetrated deep into the intelligence setup raises questions on the level of competence and capabilities of our counter intelligence mechanism .
