" The one thing I think this Golden State Warriors team couldn t do on a daily basis against us that they re doing against everybody else is go small . You have Magic Johnson and James Worthy and Kareem Abdul Jabbar as post up players that demand a double team . It would be a whole lot harder for the Warriors . Warriors forward Draymond Green is a great defender and I have a lot of respect for him , but guarding James Worthy ? Or guarding Kareem ? That wouldn t happen . It would be interesting . It would be very interesting . "
