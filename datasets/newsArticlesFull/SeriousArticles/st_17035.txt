Jeremy Woo : Kings will make the playoffs . ? Alright , I said it . I believe in Boogie Cousins and I want to believe in his team . Are they capable of winning a playoff series ? Doubtful . But can they nurse a one game hold on the eight seed for a few more months ? The Jazz are injured , the Kings boast more talent than the Blazers , and both the Nuggets and Pelicans would be better off long term by picking in the lottery . If Sacramento s pick falls outside the top 10 , it goes to Chicago , but it s visible how badly the franchise wants and needs a postseason berth to save face after years of disappointment . Cousins , Rajon Rondo , Rudy Gay and some not so bad role players should be enough to get it done . This will be captivating television in some form or another .
