Spanos and Davis need to get a deal done in their home markets . Either build a stadium on your own or with help of your current cities or sell the teams . Neither have any leverage except for LA and going there for either of them will not be the same as having their own stadium in your own city . San Antonio and London are not options . Neither want STL and Im not sure STL wants them unless they are paying for it . Stop dragging this out and get it done . These two owners played the game . The NFL and Stan beat them . Now they are finding out that the King of California , if not the NFL is from Missouri . Believe me I hate saying that . Sure sounds like its true after what the NFL did for Stan .
