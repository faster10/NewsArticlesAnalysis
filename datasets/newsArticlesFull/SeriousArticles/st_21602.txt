Central Texas , especially that sweet spot halfway between Dallas and Austin where small swaths of the legendary old prairies remain , is an earthly paradise . Blowsy live oaks spread their heavy limbs beneath cloud spattered skies , while creeks and rivers most prominently the meandering Brazos ripple alongside gently rolling pastures gilded with waving grasses . These natural glories are precisely what led Laura and George W . Bush to choose the area for their Prairie Chapel Ranch , the retreat they completed in 2001 , just after he became the 43rd president of the United States . Occupying some 1 , 600 acres near the flyspeck town of Crawford , about 25 miles west of Waco , the property is anchored by a strong but relatively modest home that quietly honors its location .
