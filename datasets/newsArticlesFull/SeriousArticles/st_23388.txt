As a writer , I have to read and reported on this without bias knowing full well that I represent the demographic of individuals Trump has just spit on . However , I think the fact that I am a part of that demographic helps to see just how disrespectful and disgusting this is . There ' s an extra push to work hard when you have a disability . With that comes a heightened sense of pride when you achieve something on your own , as well as a deep sense of accomplishment knowing you ' ll be recognized and appreciated for what you ' ve done . It isn ' t because you want to be famous or in the spotlight , but because people are looking passed the shadow of your disability .
