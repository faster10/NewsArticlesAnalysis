After three weeks at No . 1 , The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug tumbles like a dwarf in a barrel to third place with 16 . 3 million . So far , the second episode of Peter Jackson ' s trilogy isn ' t reaping quite as big a pile of gold as the first : Smaug comes out of its fourth weekend with a healthy 229 . 6 million , but that ' s still 34 . 2 million less than An Unexpected Journey had at this same point last year . The first Hobbit took in a grand total of 303 million domestically , which means the second one most likely won ' t make it past that three double zero mark . If that ends up being the case , it would be the first of Peter Jackson ' s Middle Earth films not to do so .
