" My heart stopped and they actually had to revive me . . . at one point they were trying to replace the tube into my windpipe . I flat lined . They were able to get me revived and the same thing happened the very next day . I had the tubes going down into my windpipe and I just knew that I couldn ' t breathe . That was the absolute worst part of the whole thing . The pain in my stomach , fine that felt like someone had just taken a knife and cut my entire insides out . That hurt . That was nothing compared to not being able to breathe . That sensation of not being able to breathe , it was just like trying to go run a marathon breathing thru a cocktail straw . "
