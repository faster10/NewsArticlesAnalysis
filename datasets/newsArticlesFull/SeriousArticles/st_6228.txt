6 . With the Patriots running 51 of their 59 offensive snaps against the Chiefs with three or more receivers on the field ( including penalties ) , it limited the snaps played by tight ends other than Gronkowski . That s why Scott Chandler played only five snaps , four of which came on kneel downs . The Patriots haven t had such a receiver heavy attack in recent weeks , but with Edelman returning , it makes sense to think we ll continue to see it as that gives the Patriots the grouping that threatens defense the most . In that sense , it reminds me of a 2007 type approach , when the Patriots were mostly an 11 personnel team ( one back , one tight end , three receivers ) .
