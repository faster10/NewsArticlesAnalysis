Either ? way , the equation ? of the Clinton accusations and the Cosby accusations simply doesn t pass the smell test . ? Cosby has been accused by more than ? 50 women of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault , and there s no reason to think anyone would lie about it . Clinton , in contrast , has been accused of sexual harassment by Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey , and the only substantive accusation of rape , made by Juanita Broaddrick , was thoroughly investigated in the 90s . ? There simply is no evidence , one way or another , to tell if this was a sincere accusation or yet another incident of a wild eyed Clinton hater with a grudge telling tall tales of murder and mayhem coming from those dastardly and satanic Clintons . Not all rape allegations are the same . And it s not feminists who are suggesting they should be treated that way .
