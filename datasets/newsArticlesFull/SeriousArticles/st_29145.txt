The discovery of this new particle is notable for what it tells us , but also for what it doesn ' t . There were some intriguing anomalies in the observation of this Higgslike particle . For example , the rate at which the new particle is produced seems to be slightly higher than the one predicted in the Standard Model . However , this could merely be a statistical fluke that results from the fact that to date only a few score of Higgs candidate events have been observed amongst billions of particle collisions .
