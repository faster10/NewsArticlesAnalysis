Hollande , betting on the anti Sarkozy mood , refrained from making big promises , and even his signature reforms had a lot of fine print . For example , he announced that he would recruit 60 , 000 more teachers but by shifting existing civil service jobs from other ministries to education .

He pledged to renegotiate the European Fiscal Compact Treaty that Sarkozy negotiated with Merkel but only to add a growth stimulus , not to alter the new disciplines it imposes .
