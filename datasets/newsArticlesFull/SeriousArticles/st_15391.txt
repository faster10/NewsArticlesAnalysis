The prime minister could answer the last question quite easily : the Canadians and the Aussies were basically a bunch of pussies . As for the others , he could only offer the strongest possible assurances . And confusion . There is deconfliction , he announced gravely , as if he had understood what he had just said . This was more than good enough for Crispin Blunt , the chair of the foreign affairs committee , who had previously voted against bombing . He was happy to confirm that this time round he was up for a bit of deconflicting , reconflicting and unconflicting . He had no conflict with conflict .
