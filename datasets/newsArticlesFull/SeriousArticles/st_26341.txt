To rid Syria of al Assad ' s dictatorship and prevent it from falling into the hands of jihadists who are cut from the same ideological cloth as the men who drove the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 , the United States may have to commit itself to Syria for more than a decade fighting the jihadists , subduing al Assad and his allies in Hezbollah , protecting Israel and preserving Lebanon ' s fragile peace . After Afghanistan and Iraq , is there an appetite for such an enterprise anywhere ?
