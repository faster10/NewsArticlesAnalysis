The radar signatures offered evidence that the flight had turned west after its last contact with air traffic controllers , and that contact was lost over the Strait of Malacca . But radar operators did not see it in real time , meaning an opportunity to track the plane while it was in flight may have been lost . While the radar data was the key reason for expanding the search west of Malaysia , it took officials until March 11 three days after the disappearance to explain why they were looking so far off the plane ' s expected course . All the while , search efforts continued in places where data showed it could not have been the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea .
