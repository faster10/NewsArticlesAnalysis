Before Bobby Jindal was an ex governor whose project to ruin his state as an advancement mechanism for his national political ambitions failed calamitously , he was a thirtysomething political prodigy whom party leaders hoped might serve as a counterweight to the Democrats new star , Barack Obama . Jindal , elected in 2007 , was the subject of vice presidential speculation in 2008 and later granted the opportunity to rebut President Obama s first address to a joint session of Congress in February , 2009 . ( It wasn t technically a State of the Union , but it was basically the same thing . )
