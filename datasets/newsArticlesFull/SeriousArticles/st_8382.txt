Mandery : " There ' s a lot of evidence that Stewart made a deal with White because he emerged ( in June 1972 ) with a changed position on capital punishment . Where he had previously been against it in all cases , White was now taking the position that his problem with the death penalty was its application . He told his clerks at the beginning of the term that he wanted to write a " short snapper " saying that the death penalty treated people as a means to an end , and was therefore unconstitutional . And there are hints in some of Stewart ' s earlier opinions that he was , in fact , morally opposed to capital punishment . But that is not the position that he ultimately articulated in his concurrence in Furman . "
