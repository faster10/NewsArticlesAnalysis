The Democratic and Republican Iowa results have three things in common . First , they are an undeniable and unequivocal rebuke to the party establishments . Cruz , an ideologically driven pious Texas senator , whose grandstanding in the senate has irritated his colleagues , is far more loathed by the Republican leaders than Trump . Add the 52 they got between them to the 9 who backed Ben Carson ? the brain surgeon who claimed pyramids were for grain storage and called Vladimir Putin a one horse country ? and you have almost two thirds of Iowans rejecting anything close to a consensus candidate who could unite the party .
