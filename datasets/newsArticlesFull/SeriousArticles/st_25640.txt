China and Arab countries need to pursue independent paths of development . There is no panacea in the world , nor a universal model for development . Nobody understands the history and future of the Middle East better than the people of the region . Only by pursuing our own path can we broaden our journey and make it more durable . The aspiration of the Arab people for a better life not only provides the momentum for reform , it also lays the foundation for regional stability . China will continue to support Egypt and other Arab countries in pursuing development paths suited to their own national conditions and share development experience to jointly address the challenges of our times .
