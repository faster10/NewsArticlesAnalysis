Actors and actresses of colour were kept out of the 20 award slots available in the best actor , best actress , best supporting actor and best supporting actress categories . I m not by any means saying these are not stories that deserve to be told , because these are stories that need to be told , but I am saying they are not our only stories . For example , a 2012 USC study discovered that though Latinos represent 32 of frequent moviegoers , they are actually the most underrepresented demographic on screen with only 4 of speaking roles in films . Last year , almost 37 million people watched the Oscars telecast , and that s just in the USA alone . But for 87 years , there has been a sizable lack of diversity when honoring the best of the best with a golden statue .
