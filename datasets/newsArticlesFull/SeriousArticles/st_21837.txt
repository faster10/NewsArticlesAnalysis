After two straight Super Bowl appearances , Wilson took his game to an even higher level in 2015 . He became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4 , 000 yards , run for 500 yards and toss over 30 touchdown passes . Wilson was red hot down the stretch with running back Marshawn Lynch ( abdomen ) sidelined and replacement Thomas Rawls suffering a season ending ankle injury . Wilson threw for 24 scores with just one interception in the final seven games . The wild part is that Wilson did this without injured tight end Jimmy Graham , who never fit into Seattle ' s offensive system despite being a prized offseason acquisition .
