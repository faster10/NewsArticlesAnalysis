Though he has not yet fixed the ticklish problem of dropped calls , Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has made major progress in other areas in his ministry . BSNL was in the red to the extent of Rs 8 , 000 crore when he took charge . Now it has turned the corner reporting a Rs 672 crore operating profit . At BSNL s recent annual general body meeting it was announced that revenues were up by 4 . 1 per cent , the highest in the last five years . The number of mobile customers has gone up from 7 . 60 crore in April to 7 . 95 crore in October . The turnaround has come about because Prasad sent the message down the line that BSNL would adopt competitive policies to best the private sector and not sit back and make way for private players . As an inducement , incoming mobile calls were made free while landline BSNL calls during the night time are free .
