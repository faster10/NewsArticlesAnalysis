Pellegrini , who broke the news of his departure to the players after training yesterday , wanted it to be made public ? in part because he has ambitions to manage again in the Premier League next season . He will be of interest to Chelsea , having delivered the title to City in his first season . The Tottenham chairman , Daniel Levy , is unlikely to let Mauricio Pochettino leave this summer , which would leave Pellegrini up against Antonio Conte , Jorge Sampaoli , Diego Simeone and Didier Deschamps ? all unproven here . ?
