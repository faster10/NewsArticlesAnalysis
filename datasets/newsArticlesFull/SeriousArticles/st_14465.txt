After leading the pack on Friday , the quasi found footage horror film " Sinister , " produced by Jason Blum and Brian Kavanaugh Jones ( Insidious ) and directed by Scott Derrickson ( " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " ) , ultimately fell to third with 18 . 3 million . It ' s a respectable showing , besting studio Summit Entertainment ' s expectations and making back its 3 million budget six times over , thanks to a savvy marketing campaign that began with the film ' s surprise showing at the SXSW Film Festival in March . Still , the opening was lower than last winter ' s " The Woman in Black " ( 20 . 9 million ) or " The Devil Inside " ( 33 . 7 ) , and with a par for the genre " C " CinemaScore , the film better hope to vacuum up as much horror audience money as possible before Paranormal Activity 4 also produced by Blum blasts into theaters this coming weekend .
