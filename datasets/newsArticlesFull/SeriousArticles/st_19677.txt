Tom is my friend and has been my friend , the GOP presidential front runner said Monday . We just didn t do a good job of it . We obviously wanted to establish the run and try to control the game that way . I think that s the most important task for me . The Patriots dropped back to pass 22 times ( plus two accepted penalties ) and the Patriots ran the ball just six times ( plus one accepted penalty ) . DeVante Parker who was the recipient of one of Tannehill s touchdown passes had five receptions for 106 yards . Defensively , Dont a Hightower and Chandler Jones should be back on the field , giving the Patriots a healthy front 7 that has been elite when the full unit has been on the field . The Patriots statistically are one of the worst rushing teams in the league . Believe me , I ll be doing everything I can to be out there . He s just scratching the surface .
