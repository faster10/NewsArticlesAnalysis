For more than 20 years , Bill and Hillary Clinton have engaged with black voters , black leaders , and black communities . They re familiar . And when coupled with the role blacks play in the Democratic primary ? stalwart voters who tend to support the safest choice ? this adds up to a powerful advantage for Hillary . So much so that the only candidate to breach it ? Barack Obama ? had to run an almost flawless campaign , in addition to being black himself . Had Obama failed to build ties to the black political establishment ? and had he failed to show his viability with wins among white Democrats ? it s not clear he would have overcome and reversed Clinton s advantage with blacks .
