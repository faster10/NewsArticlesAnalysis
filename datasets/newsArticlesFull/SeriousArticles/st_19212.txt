People will always say that " He Stopped Loving Her Today " was George ' s best song and perhaps the greatest country song of all time . I certainly wouldn ' t disagree . But do yourself a favor and dig a little deeper . One of those nights when you are feeling down or lonesome , instead of going to the usual modern day distractions , grab some whiskey and listen to " A Picture of Me ( Without You ) , " " The Cold Hard Truth , " " A Good Year For The Roses , " or my favorite , " The Door . " Put your heart in George ' s hands and trust that he will take care of it .
