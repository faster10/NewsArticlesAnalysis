Unfortunately for the photographer here , copyright ownership does not work the way ownership does on the farm . Because the monkey cannot create a copyrightable work , that work can never be copyrightable . On the other hand , if the photographer takes a work by an animal and turns it into an ink blotted , Andy Warhol inspired piece of pop art , then he acquires rights in the new creation . But in the case of a monkey ' s selfie by itself , that photograph immediately and forever falls into the public domain , and can be used by anyone , without permission .
