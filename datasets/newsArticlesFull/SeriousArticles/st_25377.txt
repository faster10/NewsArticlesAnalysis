I am surprised that more was not made of Marko Arnautovic ' s cowardly push on Mathieu Debuchy . The Stoke man shoved Debuchy while he was in mid air and now Arsenal ' s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding . On Tuesday when West Ham ' s Morgan Amalfitano shoved Leighton Baines , the Everton defender was lucky to escape injury . It is a cheap shot , it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me . I fractured my shoulder playing against Italy when somebody shoved me when I was already falling . It leaves you no time to brace yourself .
