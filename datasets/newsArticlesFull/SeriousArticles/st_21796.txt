Studies have shown that while the use of ethanol does limit the need for fossil fuels and reduces greenhouse gas emissions caused by petroleum based fuels , there are other environmental concerns that may outweigh these benefits .

This boom in corn growth has caused nutrients to be stripped from once fertile soil , chemicals from overused fertilizer to run into drinking water and dormant amounts of carbon dioxide to be released from freshly dug soil .
