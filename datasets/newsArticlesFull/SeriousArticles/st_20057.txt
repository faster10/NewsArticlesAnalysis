During Friday ' s broadcast , you will hear first hand from patients bravely participating in clinical trials and scientists on the front lines of the war against the disease , and your favorite movie stars will share stories of real people , just like my mom , who went through hell and back because of cancer . But after all , we are the entertainment industry , and therefore you will be entertained by the likes of Coldplay , Alicia Keys , Tim McGraw and Taylor Swift . ( I personally picked the music . You ' re welcome . )
