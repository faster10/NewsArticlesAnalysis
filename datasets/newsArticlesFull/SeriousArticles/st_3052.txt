It should be encouraging for Patriots fans , however , that the Patriots defense kept the Broncos running attack in check for most of the first half when they met in Denver in Week 12 . The Broncos rushed 16 times for just 46 yards , a 2 . 8 yard average but that was with stalwart linebacker Dont a Hightower on the field . After No . 54 left the game with a knee injury , the Broncos rushed 16 more times , but for 179 yards . Ronnie Hillman rushed for 28 yards and a touchdown in just the first two running plays after the Hightower injury . C . J . Anderson s game winning 48 yard run skewed the numbers a bit , but even without that fatal play the Broncos rushed for 5 . 6 yards on average after Hightower went down .
