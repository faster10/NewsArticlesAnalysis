As a denouement , after I exited the PATH I got my usual Dunkin Donuts and the cheerful young ladies who took my order were all wearing the Hijab , or traditional head scarf . Hey , that s fine . Whatever floats their boat . I could see their smiling faces . I could read them and interact with them . I could find some common ground , if not in religion then at least in the shared experience of the New York daily grind . If one cannot see the difference between these contributing immigrants in the simple and unobtrusive head scarf , and the cloaked , isolated , oppressed specter behind the black shroud ? as though someone who dresses and acts according to a man s interpretation of the alleged insistence of a 7th century warlord is just another commuter ? then you are complicit in the mass cultural suicide already well underway in Europe .
