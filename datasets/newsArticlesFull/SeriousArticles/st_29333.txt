I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments , from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of " don ' t ask don ' t tell , " to the killing of Osama bin Laden . Moreover , I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay , among others . But , after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers , I ' ve reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide . I ' ve reached a point of political despair .
