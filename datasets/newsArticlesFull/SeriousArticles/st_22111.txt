Derek Jeter , you see , does not have a Twitter account . He does not refer to himself in the third person or have his nickname tattooed across his back . ( Come to think of it , he doesn ' t really have a nickname . ) He ' s never gone out of his way to publicly humiliate an opponent or prop himself up with inane boasts of superiority . If the words " I ' m the man " ever escaped his lips , they were surely followed by , " . . . who ordered the pizza about 20 minutes ago . I decided to pick it up instead . Can I also grab a bottle of water and some napkins ? "
