Case in point : At a summer fundraiser for former GOP Rep . Allen West of Florida , an attendee said , " I personally believe that Obama is a Muslim . . . and I believe that he is doing everything in his power to bring this country down . " West seized the opportunity to fan those flames by first insinuating that Obama said as much , followed by , " The President has an Eastern orientation " using his own affinity for SEC football to support his claim against Obama . I felt a little dumber after watching the exchange , and yet no one in the audience seemed to mind .
