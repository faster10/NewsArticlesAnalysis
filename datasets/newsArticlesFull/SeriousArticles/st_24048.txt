What this means is that even though Bush still has an estimated 60 million or more to spend , it ' s not going to do him any good . When the voters just aren ' t buying what you ' re selling , it doesn ' t matter how many times they hear the pitch , in other words . Jeb , like Hillary Clinton in 2008 , had one simple plan to win the nomination : be inevitable . Unlike Clinton , however , all Bush ' s money and all his inevitability might not win him even a single primary . After spending a fortune , he ' s fallen under five percent in the polling . That ' s a pretty dismal return on investment , folks ! Because there ' s no easy answer for Bush ( " throw more money at the problem " has definitely not worked yet ) , he can ' t even be considered a contender for the prize any more . Bush is now merely " at the forefront of the absolute longshots . " That ' s it . How the mighty have fallen .
