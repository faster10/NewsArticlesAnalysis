These matters raise serious moral and ethical questions that are excruciatingly painful to answer . The war against this kind of terrorism is likely going to be a long and painful one . And we may well have to wrestle again with some very tough choices . Do we maintain a principled position against negotiations , discourage private citizens from their own efforts even threaten to prosecute them if they try to pay ransom ? Or do we approach each terror filled hostage taking situationally and maintain some flexibility to see whether lives can be redeemed ? I ' d be in favor of the latter .
