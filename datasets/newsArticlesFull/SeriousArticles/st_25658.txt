I make no excuses for including the tiny Madrigal stadium , because of the atmosphere generated within and outside it . The ground only holds 25 , 000 , but as the town itself has a population of under 50 , 000 , it means half its inhabitants are watching the action when the stadium is full . The tiny surrounding streets occasionally play host to a giant yellow submarine the team ' s nickname which is paraded before kick off and the general feeling is one of friendliness mixed with steely determination . I guarantee that no ground this size anywhere in the world makes more noise , a reason , I ' m sure , why the club continues to punch above its weight in La Liga .
