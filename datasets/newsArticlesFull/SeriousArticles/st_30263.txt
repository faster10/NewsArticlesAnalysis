As three point favorites in Cincinnati , Pittsburgh ' s Week 18 total is just above 24 points the highest team total of Wild Card Weekend . . . . With workhorse back DeAngelo Williams ( ankle ) not expected to play , a pass oriented game plan is a virtual certainty on the Steelers ' side . Ben Roethlisberger did struggle from a fantasy standpoint in his two 2015 meetings with the Bengals , posting finishes of QB22 in Week 8 and QB25 in Week 14 . Big Ben moved the offense consistently in the latter game , however , going 30 of 39 for 282 yards and narrowly missing a 24 yard score on which Martavis Bryant could ' ve done a better job positioning to reel in . The Steelers also took their foot off the gas after compiling a 23 7 third quarter lead that grew as big as 33 13 in the fourth frame . Cincinnati finished the year ranked top ten in Football Outsiders ' pass defense DVOA and does not pose an attractive matchup , but for my money Roethlisberger is the best quarterback option on a challenging Wild Card slate . . . . Fitzgerald Toussaint replaced Williams as Pittsburgh ' s lead runner in last Sunday ' s win over Cleveland , logging 12 ineffective touches while dominating snaps after the Williams injury . No . 2 back Jordan Todman was a healthy scratch , but is expected to have some involvement this week . A short yardage option could be FB Will Johnson . Toussaint went undrafted in 2014 after running 4 . 53 at 5 foot 9 , 205 at the Michigan Pro Day . He has three career receptions in the NFL and caught only 31 passes in four college seasons . In their final nine games , the Vontaze Burfict led Bengals held opposing running backs to 555 yards on 159 carries ( 3 . 49 YPC ) . The fact that Toussaint figures to handle double digit touches in a good offense makes him dart throw worthy , but there are more reasons to dislike than like him .
