He has become the most dominant force in all of pro football and I m talking about as a pocket passer , a runner , a short yardage touchdown scorer and team igniter . That team is feeding off everything Cam , including the sideline photo they take while the game is still going on . Some people feel that s disrespectful . But that s Carolina . It s who they are , and now he s backed up by a defense that s on one of the all time turnover rolls . That defense is creating crazy , contagious , runaway momentum for both sides of the ball . It s one of those rolls that a team gets on late in the season and you just can t stop them .
