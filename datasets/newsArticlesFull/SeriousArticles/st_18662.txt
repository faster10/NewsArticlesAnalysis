Vick ' s road to fan acceptance is the same one that will take him to a new contract his two year deal ( which with bonuses and incentives have earned him a reported 7 million ) runs out this season . He seems to realize the practical truth that what he does is going to amount to much more than what he utters . He recently told Sports Illustrated , " I don ' t think me saying the right thing is going to get me a new deal . It ' s all about my play . It ' s all about how you conduct yourself as you play well . I don ' t have to put on a front around anybody . "
