This final playoff meeting has appropriate heft . The two teams , and the two men , transcend stats . We know Manning has taken an eraser to the archives , bumping Brett Favre from the more meaty records . But if he loses on Sunday , Manning will be compared even more to Favre . Both will be seen as pyrotechnic passers who often had a vital gaffe in the biggest moment . Favre has his season ending interceptions against New York and New Orleans in the NFC Championship . Peyton s pick six against the Saints in the Super Bowl all but sealed his doom .
