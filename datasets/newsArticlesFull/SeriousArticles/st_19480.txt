The Kevin Hart Ice Cube comedy " Ride Along " fell 21 . 9 percent from last weekend and snagged the third place spot after three weekends at No . 1 with 9 . 4 million . This places the PG 13 rated 25 million Universal pic at a 105 . 2 million domestic total . Universal had success opening 2013 s " Identity Thief " in the early part of the year . That film went on to net about 134 . 5 million after 17 weeks in theaters ( 11 on over 1 , 000 screens ) . " Ride Along " could definitely beat that . For Hart ' s starring roles , crossing 100 million is a career high , too . " Think Like a Man " topped out at 91 . 5 million in 2012 . Hart has three more releases slated for this year , including next weekend ' s " About Last Night . "
