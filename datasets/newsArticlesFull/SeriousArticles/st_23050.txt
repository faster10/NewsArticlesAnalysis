Republican presidential candidates apparently all want nothing more than : " Could you please give me your campaign ' s talking points on subject X ? " Or perhaps : " What are the lines you use on the campaign trail which get the biggest applause ? " They do not want any of their " facts " challenged , obviously , and they do not want anyone to bring up embarrassing quotes or events from their past . These are all deemed " gotcha " questions , and will be banished from the debate setting . Otherwise there will be a chorus of : " WAAAAH ! He was MEAN to me ! " in the post debate spin room . This is the Daddy party ? Really ? These are the guys that are going to go toe to toe with Russia and China and make them back down through sheer strength of personality ? Are you kidding me ?
