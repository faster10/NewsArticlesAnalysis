The jewelry sold quickly and inspired Dovel to team up with her friends Jessie Simonson , Anna Nelson , Brooke Hodges and Alli Swanson to create the company 31 Bits . In August of 2008 , the five traveled to Uganda and started purchasing jewelry from six women , promising to employ them for at least two years . Dovel stayed in Uganda in order to oversee operations while Simonson , Nelson , Hodges and Swanson traveled back to the States to spread brand awareness . Through its success , 31 Bits has been able to hire more women and launch programs for its Ugandan employees that include English lessons , health education , and business development programs .
