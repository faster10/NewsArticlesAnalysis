Carney : I don ' t think he gets surprised or disappointed by the revelation that the world doesn ' t bend to your will and your agenda all that willingly . It ' s been the fundamental responsibility of being president , and a huge part of the job , to deal with these kind of crises overseas and potential threats to the United States . I don ' t think he is disappointed . I think he is realistic about the fact that there is still a lot of work he wants to get done . And he knows that the time he has left will go by pretty quickly . My guess is that he realizes that the absolute necessity of dealing with the Islamic State , and with the situation in Ukraine , reduces the amount of time and focus he can put on other topics . But it ' s not really a choice for him . You don ' t have the choice you just have to do it .
