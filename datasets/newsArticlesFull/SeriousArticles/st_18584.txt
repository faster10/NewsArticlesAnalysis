With Thompson and Barnes out , Curry and Green had to generate much of the offense . Curry struggled to get free from Bradley s clutches , and the Warriors generally found space scarce . The Warriors are used to the room Thompson provides , moving the ball around until holes open in the defense . This time , they could not be so patient . Green had to forge a difficult path on quite a few possessions , driving into a gnashing Celtics defense and throwing himself into transition opportunities . Curry had to fire the ball up when covered , just because that s what the situation required .
