Edwin has a consuming obsession with Patsey ( Lupita Nyong ' o ) , the slave who picks more cotton each day than any other slave ( 500 pounds of it ) and whom he regularly rapes . Their ' ' relationship ' ' becomes part of a debased triangle , since Edwin ' s wife ( Sarah Paulson ) is aware of his fixation . Due to her jealousy , and to Edwin ' s disgust at his own desires , Patsey is subjected to the torments of hell . Lupita Nyong ' o ' s performance is shattering . She goes to a place of private terror and communion beyond pain . When Edwin is whipping Patsey , McQueen plays a startling trick : He holds on the image of Edwin brandishing the whip a Hollywood clich and then , as we ' re lulled into that familiar ' ' it ' s only a movie ' ' mode , the camera , without a cut , spins around to show the obscene violence of the whipping . The mortification of flesh hits us in the solar plexus .
