Josh McDaniels had no clue what Wade Phillips was up to . He didn t have an answer for Denver consistently taking away the first option in the passing game , and he refused to give help to his struggling tackles , allowing them to be burned by the rush so often they had to fly home in hazmat suits . Matt Patricia figured out how to keep Denver s zone blocking stretch runs under control , shutting down the cut back lanes that were wider than the Mass Pike in the first game . As for Bill Belichick , he did some odd things like deciding to take the ball after winning the opening coin flip . That was uncharacteristic , and when his offense got stuffed and Denver came back and scored , it backfired . He twice decided against late field goals inside the red zone because at some point he needed a TD . Critics were irate , but he always goes for it on fourth down in such situations , so don t complain now . Also , his offense had been sluggish , and there was no guarantee it would get close again . The moves made sense . And spare me the he didn t try to win in Miami argument . You get your QB hit 23 times , throw three picks , fail to convert on third down and twice fail on fourth down , you could play the game in Tom Brady s backyard and you still wouldn t win .
