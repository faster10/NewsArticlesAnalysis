Sure , plenty of the credit goes to the play call . And plenty of it goes to Curry , too . His mere presence as he runs through those two picks , whose basketball vernacular term is elevator doors , sends multiple defenders flying at him . But where is Jordan , who has finished third in Defensive Player of the Year voting in each of the past two years despite committing flaws like the one above ? He s hanging in the corner , not really guarding anyone as he tries to guard everyone , unaware that Draymond Green is about to roll to the hoop , a common next step for Green after the Warriors run this elevator doors play .
