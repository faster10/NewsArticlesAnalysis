EC : I never intended to make the documentary of all documentaries . I was just trying to keep myself occupied with something to do because we were out there for so long . I just had never shot a documentary before . They wanted five minutes for a TV promotional or something and I thought sooner of later I could get five minutes of film and then it went on to 15 minutes . I just kept shooting but I had no idea . . . the evolution of myself that I saw with my camera . So , it was a surprise for both of us and a life changing experience .
