First , the Warriors are an all time great team . Not great for this year , or great for this era , but great for all time . That ' s the only conclusion you can draw from 13 0 with two wins vs . the Clippers . Everything went wrong for Golden State in the first 12 minutes Thursday night , and yet they still wound up winning the other three quarters . So listen , in that way , this loss shouldn ' t be held against the Clippers . Facing a team as good as the Warriors facing undefeated defensing NBA champions who shot 57 percent from 3 point range while putting together a defensive clinic in the closing quarter , should be enough to justify a loss for the Clippers , or any team , no matter how much they were up .
