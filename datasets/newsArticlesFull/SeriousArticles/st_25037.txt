Republican reform proposals , on the other hand , take aim squarely at the most widespread forms of coverage . Conservatives have long called for an end to the tax exclusions that have helped to make employer coverage nearly universal in the United States . They would not eliminate them entirely , rather replacing provisions that currently exempt employer sponsored coverage from income and payroll taxes with capped deductions and exclusions . For many employees this will result immediately in higher taxes or premiums . Moreover , Congress is unlikely to adjust the fixed dollar subsidies to keep pace with health care inflation , so excess cost increases will simply be shifted dollar for dollar to employees .
