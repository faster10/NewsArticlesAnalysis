The exchange was a minor triumph for Trump , whose campaign has been a testament to the complete irrelevance of rational policy debate in the Republican primary , especially when it comes to economics , the subject of Wednesday s debate . Over the campaign , the GOP candidates have rolled out variously gaudy and implausible tax cut plans , all while promising to keep the country from falling deeper into debt . Even Jeb Bush , the early establishment favorite , has engaged in this sort of magical thinking , offering up a proposal that could cut up to 3 . 6 trillion from government revenues over a decade , according to the conservative Tax Foundation s high end estimate . Marco Rubio , who s quickly becoming the new favorite of party mainliners , actually goes further ? he d cut as much as 6 trillion . But Trump s approach is notable for its sheer thoughtlessness . His blueprint is suspiciously similar to Bush s , but with even lower tax rates , resulting in the budget busting , 10 trillion monster that he says he will somehow balance by cutting government waste . ?
