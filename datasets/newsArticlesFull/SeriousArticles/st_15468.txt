The FBI says some of the weapons Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez used in his attack on a pair of military facilities were purchased legally and some were not . It is unclear when the purchases were made and whether he was subject to a background check . Relatives say Abdulazeez had a history of mental illness , made a series of overseas trips and was arrested in April on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol . In May 2013 , he failed a background check for an engineering job at a nuclear power plant in Ohio .
