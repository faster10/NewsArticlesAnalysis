Tundag , The ( Philippine ) Freeman : The United States finally made good an earlier promise to test the territorial claim of China over the whole of the South China Sea by sending the USS Lassen , a guided missile destroyer , to within 12 nautical miles of one of the man made islands that China has been building . . . . This naturally riled China . But beyond saying it repeatedly warned the U . S . warship and followed it for the duration of the sail through , China did nothing to provoke a real confrontation .
