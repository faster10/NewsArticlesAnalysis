After each new outrage , President Obama makes his customary mournful utterance about how other major Western nations don t have these kinds of shootings on anything close to the American scale ( which is perfectly true ) , while knowing perfectly well that nothing whatever will be done to address the situation during his last year in office . Republican politicians , whose souls have been sucked from their bodies and replaced by National Rifle Association talking points , manifest the symptoms of gun insanity in their most obvious and offensive form . They pull long faces and tell us that prayer is more effective than gun control and that if only teachers and medical providers and social service workers and , I don t know , line cooks at Pizza Hut were all strapping Glocks , this issue would take care of itself . In the case of the San Bernardino shooting this week , we then get the level of meta madness in which right wingers are openly gleeful that the shooter appears to have been a Muslim , and may ( or may not ) have been motivated by some degree of religious zealotry .
