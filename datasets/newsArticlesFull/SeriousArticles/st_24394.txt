For political junkies , results like these are puzzling . They ' ve seen plenty of Trump ( and the other candidates ) , and they know what they think of them . While there may be some new development or revelation that alters opinions a bit , it ' s really unlikely that a focused political observer will go all the way from " I ' ll never vote for that guy ! " to " He ' s my guy ! " , or vice versa . But voters do just that , all the time . They jump on bandwagons , they abandon sinking candidates , and they ' re affected by what happens in the campaign .
