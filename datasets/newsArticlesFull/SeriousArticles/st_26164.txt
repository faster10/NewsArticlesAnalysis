It ' s unclear why passing port on the left is so important some say it has to do with naval tradition ( the port side of a boat is on your left if you ' re facing the helm ) . Regardless , passing the decanter to the right is a big gaffe . So is not passing it at all . If you ' re at a meal and the decanter stalls , then ask the person with it , " Do you know the Bishop of Norwich ? " If they say they don ' t know him , reply , " He ' s a very good chap , but he always forgets to pass the port . " It sounds weird , but it ' s true . This is such a nationwide tradition , the Telegraph wrote an article on it .
