This is a great opportunity for our team to play in the SEC Championship Game . This is something that we still feel is very , very important and something that ' s a significant accomplishment because of the quality of our league , winning our division and having an opportunity to play against a really good Florida team . This is a very talented team . They ' re extremely well coached . Jim McElwain has done an outstanding job there . They ' ve won 10 games . They ' re probably the best overall team that we ' ve played against all year long . They ' re a great defensive team . Probably the highest ranked defensive team we ' ve faced all year long from a national standpoint . They also do a great job of taking care of the ball and getting turnovers . They have a very positive turnover ratio . Very talented players on offense . The quarterback , Treon Harris , is a dual threat kind of guy that can make plays passing or with his feet . Reminds me a lot of Blake in terms of his style of play . Kelvin Taylor is an outstanding running back , probably as good as we ' ve played against all year . They have some very talented receivers and good skill guys who can make big plays , and this is one of the most talented special teams . They ' ve struggled a little bit on field goals this year but other than that they have one of the highest net punts in the country . They have a great punt return guy , kickoff returns have been really good for them . This team is really , really good on special teams . "
