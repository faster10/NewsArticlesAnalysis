The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission ( IGLHRC ) , of course , condemns these acts . But it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves . Indeed , despite our efforts , and those of other independent observers , neither the accusations nor the exact nature , time , and location of the executions can be corroborated . We know nothing about the victims ' sexual orientation or gender identity . Without evidence or independent confirmation , we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved .
