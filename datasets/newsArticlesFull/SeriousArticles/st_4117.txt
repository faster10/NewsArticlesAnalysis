" This is obviously Steve ' s team . The more he can do , the better , " Walton said . " He was very active in shootaround today . Obviously we ' ll continue to encourage him to do as much as he wants when he ' s with us . But as far as thinking about transition back , that ' s not going to be beneficial until I know for certain , or we as a staff , that Steve ' s going to be taking over again . We don ' t know when that will be . So we ' re still preparing the same for not having him with us . "
