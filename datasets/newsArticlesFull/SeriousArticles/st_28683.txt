The things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths : We helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety . It makes me proud as a network engineer working partially in security knowing that , in a way , what we did as a group made for safer computing today . There are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords , companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems .
