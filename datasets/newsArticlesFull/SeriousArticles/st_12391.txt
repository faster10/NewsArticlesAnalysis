Keep in mind , the U . S . is only accepting 10 , 000 Syrian refugees , a vastly smaller number than the more than 800 , 000 that have entered Europe . In such huge numbers , European nations have understandably had trouble vetting everyone . The U . S . will accept less than two percent of that number , and they ll have to go through a rigorous screening and cross an ocean . We re not looking at an anonymous mass of humanity scrambling across a fence ( you re more likely to find that at the border with Mexico ) .
