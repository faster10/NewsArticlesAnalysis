Chasing points : The Patriots ? with Brady and Gronkowski , Julian Edelman and a bunch of running backs ? are averaging 34 . 5 points a game . The fewest points they put up in any game this season was the 27 they scored in last week s routine victory over the Redskins . The Giants are allowing 25 points per game . Connect the dots and it is obvious this defense ? starting a different lineup for the 10th time ? is going to have to summon up a tremendous performance to keep the Pats under 30 . You know what that means : The only hope for the Giants is to win in a shootout .
