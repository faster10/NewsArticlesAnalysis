" It was close to the time he was going to make his decision ( about turning pro or going to college ) , " Rego recalled . " It was after a workout and I have a hand truck full of cases of canned Gatorade to take down to our offices at Vet Stadium and I ' m loading them into my car . He ' s outside waiting for a ride , like a high school kid would , and the next thing I know , he ' s grabbing the cases and loading up my car with the Gatorade . He then says to me , ' You ' ve been around for a long time . What do you think I should do ? ' I had been around about eight or nine seasons then . So what I told him probably proved to be the beginning and the end of my scouting career . I told him he should go to college . My advice was to go for one year and at least live that college life , because once you turn pro , you ' ll never get that . He still busts my chops about that . "
