Yet Republican Party presidential candidates don ' t believe that President Barack Obama has genuflected low enough to the Saudi monarchy . For instance , Jeb Bush insisted on the need to rebuild " our relationships with allies and key relationships in the Middle East , including the Persian Gulf states . " The Saudis and others are " important partners . " New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie complained that the Saudi king did not attend the administration ' s Gulf summit last fall and demanded that America " stand with those who share our values and interests , " in this case apparently theocracy and dictatorship . Similarly , the Wall Street Journal , while allowing that " the Saudis are often difficult allies , " asked " who lost the Saudis ? " But America never won them . Rather , the royals consistently triumphed , brilliantly manipulating the U . S . to advance their interests .
