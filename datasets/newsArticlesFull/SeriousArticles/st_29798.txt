Sit ' em : If you ' re using a Detroit running back , it ' s clearly Theo Riddick in PPR and either he or Joique Bell in standard you can safely ignore Ameer Abdullah in either format but in general you can do better elsewhere . . . . The interesting fantasy sleeper that was Eric Ebron early in the season has disappeared he has two or fewer fantasy points in five of his last six games . . . . The Lions ' defense is trending up slightly , but still is a question mark against what should be a strong Green Bay offense .
