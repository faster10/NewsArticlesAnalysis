PB : I think there is widespread skepticism among the American people . But on occasion , what we ve seen is that the so called CNN factor what we now might call the twitter factor does kick in on a case by case basis and a demand , to quote do something , emerges . The problem we face here and I am afraid in other countries in the world , in Europe , in Russia and elsewhere doing something too often is equated with doing something military . So , instead of saying " Yes , this is a terrible situation for whoever " ? whether it is the ? Yazidis who were trapped on Mount Sinjar , whether it is a group of hostages being imprisoned by ISIS . These are terrible situations that require response . They don t necessarily require a military response . And when military responses are used it makes the other responses that in the long run are going to be the only way of ending this war it makes them even more difficult , sometimes impossible .
