Obviously , the high visibility of the current gridlock in Congress has Americans disgusted , and understandably so . But that gridlock wasn ' t produced by some enormous entity called " Washington . " It was the product of a decision Republicans made in 2009 to oppose Obama on any legislation of any consequence . They could have chosen a different way of doing things , but they didn ' t . And then when the elections of 2010 , 2012 , and 2014 made the GOP caucus more and more conservative , its members decided to force a government shutdown and debt ceiling crises in an attempt to blackmail the president . Those were decisions made by human beings , not a " system " that can be cleaned up with enough integrity and common sense on the part of the next president .
