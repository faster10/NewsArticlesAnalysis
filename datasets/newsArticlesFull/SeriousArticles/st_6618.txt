Just two days before the U . N . session , Iran ' s conservative Kayhan daily , thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei , published an article that showed just what Iran ' s women ' s rights activists are up against . The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U . N . commission , describing its notion of " gender equality " as " unacceptable to the Islamic Republic . " The article accused Molaverdi of " negligence " for participating in events that could damage Iran ' s reputation and interests , and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran ' s security and intelligence agencies .
