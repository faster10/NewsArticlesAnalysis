CM : I would say among people who traditionally vote for the Democrats , there is a huge amount of support for Bernie Sanders . Because he is saying the kind of things that they believe , not the kind of things that Wall Street wants to hear . In the US we have a mass movement right now of people demanding the minimum wage to be raised to 15 per hour . And Bernie Sanders has embraced that movement . There is a mass uprising right now against police brutality and racism . Bernie Sanders has got closer and closer to that movement as well . And Bernie Sanders is very much becoming a candidate who is associated with people in the US , ordinary , average working class people who are upset about the direction their country is moving in and feel like the Obama administration has kind of betrayed them and not offered the hope and change they were so excited about in the two elections when Obama was elected overwhelmingly . ? So , there is a real fight going on within the Democratic Party between the establishment Democrats , the Democratic Leadership Council and the average person who votes for the Democrats who have just not seen the changes that they want to see . And Bernie Sanders has become somewhat symbolic of the frustration among the rank and file of the Democratic Party , among the labor unions and among the very progressive organizations in the US .
