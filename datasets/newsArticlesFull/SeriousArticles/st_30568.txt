JL : You re right . There are other priorities besides destroying the Islamic State . All of the rebel groups want to destroy Assad before they destroy the Islamic State , and they re not going to get drawn into what they call sahua and be agents of America and so forth there are few militias that are willing to do this , but the vast majority wants to have nothing to do with fight against ISIS before they take the fight to Assad , and that s , of course , one of the big problems , both to the Russians and for the U . S .
