Litvinenko , a Russian national , had been employed by the FSB and its predecessor organization , the KGB , until 1998 when the inquiry says he was kicked out for making public allegations of illegal activity within the spy service . Litvinenko moved to London where he worked as a writer until one day in 2006 he suddenly became ill for no apparent reason . It was only weeks later and hours before his death that health officials realized he had been poisoned with " extremely high levels of the radioactive isotope polonium 210 " likely slipped into his tea during a lunch meeting with two Russians , according to the inquiry report .
