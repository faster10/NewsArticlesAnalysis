Read that out loud . Seriously , read all of those names out loud . Now , think about trying to answer that question after hearing 12 names listed or worse , trying to answer it a few months ago when there were 17 candidates . If you re not in Iowa or New Hampshire , don t care about politics or just haven t been paying attention , what name are you going to pick out ? Probably a name that caught your attention someone that you know . Perhaps Donald Trump , whose name recognition is the highest of all candidates .
