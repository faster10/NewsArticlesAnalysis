Open primaries , such as in New Hampshire , where independents are allowed to vote , often have the additional benefit of selecting the best general election candidate , the one best able to appeal to centrists as well as conservatives . Look , I ' d like to see more open primaries across the nation as a means of achieving a more representative democracy , less disproportionately dominated by partisan activists . But surely , registered Republicans should have the ability to vote for the candidate of their choice , regardless of ridiculously restrictive local election laws .
