Prof Tim Key , from the Cancer Research UK and the University of Oxford , said : This decision doesn t mean you need to stop eating any red and processed meat , but if you eat lots of it you may want to think about cutting down . Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn t going to do much harm having a healthy diet is all about moderation .
