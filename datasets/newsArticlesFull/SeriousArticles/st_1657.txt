Brining keeps food moist by hydrating the meat using salt before cooking . It is perfect for free range turkey , which has a tendency to dry out ( more commercial birds usually have water and salt added ) . You ' ll need a container large enough to hold the whole turkey covered with brine in the fridge . A basic brine is 1 cup of rock salt dissolved in 4 litres of hot water ? you can add other flavourings such as sugar , apple juice and onion pickling spices to add a little flavour . Brine for 18 hours for smaller birds and up to 24 hours for larger . Rinse the turkey thoroughly to wash off excess salt after brining and before stuffing , and keep in mind when making stuffing and gravy that there will still be salt in the turkey and pan juices , so season with care .
