It works like this . Commercial fishing fleets target species for the global market , including American consumers . They go after the seafood we love to eat like shrimp , salmon , tuna , crab , and lobster , setting traps and casting gillnets , purse seines , trawls and longlines . But in the course of catching the target species , they often entangle , trap and hook other animals like non target fish , seabirds , sea turtles and marine mammals . It ' s a tragedy for those animals caught in the wrong place and the wrong time collateral damage that may cause some populations to go extinct .
