Because of this , Hillary Clinton is getting more worried and a lot more snide in her attacks on Sanders . The cynicism she ' s currently displaying is rather breathtaking , but it does serve to remind folks that Clinton is a no holds barred campaigner ( as she proved against Barack Obama , eight years ago ) . How you feel about this depends on how you feel about Clinton it could be seen as a good thing ( for the upcoming general election fight ) , or a bad thing ( Clinton saying anything to win ) . But we ' ll have more on Hillary ' s campaign in the awards , so we ' ll just mention it in passing here .
