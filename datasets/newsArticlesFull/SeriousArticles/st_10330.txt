A self described democratic socialist who has been on a 40 year mission against Wall Street greed , Sanders is the darling of white progressives and millenials . This helps a lot in states like Iowa ( 94 percent white ) and New Hampshire ( 92 percent white ) . If those two states were representative of the country as a whole , Sanders would be on track to become president . The problem for Sanders is there are another 54 states and territories that also vote and ? with the exception of Wyoming , Montana , the Dakotas and his home state of Vermont ? they are a lot more diverse .
