It s a surreal moment to know I won t be able to see him anymore or talk to him , Towns said . Saunders spent two more years in the collegiate ranks , as an assistant at Tulsa from 1986 88 . Saunders had not signed on to be part of a rebuilding project ( and in fact openly questioned his desire to coach young players ) but rolled up his sleeves and got down to the dirty business of making chicken salad out of the chickenshit of Andray , JaVale , and Nick , all the while protecting the young Wall and encouraging his development . He wasn t our best player , but he was our most valuable player . I m pissed because we have to walk back to the hotel 7 . 5 miles . And we did it . He was just great to be around .
