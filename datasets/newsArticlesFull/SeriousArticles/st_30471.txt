Harrison and Shankar met the next year and the " quiet Beatle " went to India to study sitar with the master . Back then , whatever the Beatles were interested in , the rest of the world was interested in , too . Brian Jones picked up the sitar on the Rolling Stones ' 1966 hit " Paint It Black " and the Byrds appropriated a sitar sound ( and a Coltrane riff ) that same year for " Eight Miles High . " " Raga rock " lasted just long enough to make the sitar part of the shorthand soundtrack of what ' s often derisively labeled " the hippie era . "
