Capitalize on punts : This should have spelled victory for Bama against Ohio State , as Tide punter J . K . Scott put five inside the 20 and the Buckeyes started fourth quarter possessions in the shadow of their goalposts . An intercepted Blake Sims pass and one breakaway Ohio State run turned the tables , but odds aren t in favor of that repeating . On the other side , go tell the Spartans about Tide punt returner Cyrus Jones . Or tell Mississippi State , or Charleston Southern ? Jones had TD returns against them all .
