I could not have done any of this without an amazing husband and partner who sacrificed some of his own professional ambitions to partly stay home with our children during their infant years . ( What would my old fashoined machista Colombian father think about that ? ) But no matter how nurturing and caring husbands are and how much we trust them to fulfill our children ' s every need , the pangs of a working mother never subside . Guilt pangs , pangs of wanting to be there to not miss a single thing , pangs of letting your children down because you are not at their side every waking minute .
