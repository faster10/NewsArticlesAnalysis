Mike Piazza was coy about what hat he ll wear on his plaque a few moments after earning 83 percent of the vote and gaining entrance to the Hall of Fame Class of 2016 , but there is little doubt that he will be a Met , even if he started baseball life as a Dodger , even if he finished as a Padre and an Athletic , because of the 7 ? mostly magnificent years he logged in New York , because of the array of big moments he assembled , because of the home run he hit on Sept . 21 , 2001 , the night sports returned to New York , one of the most unforgettable home runs ever hit within the borders of New York City .
