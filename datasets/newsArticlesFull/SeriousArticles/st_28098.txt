David Mitchell ' s 2004 Booker nominated novel begins midstream , well into what purports to be the diary of an innocent 19th century lawyer traveling the South Pacific in the company of unscrupulous mariners and brigands . In a kind of literary relay , this manuscript is devoured by a young apprentice composer in the 1930s , who comments on it in his letters to his male lover . Letters that turn up 40 years later when the lover a nuclear scientist is embroiled in a deadly corruption cover up , which is the basis in turn for a pulp suspense novel read by a cranky British publisher , and so on and so forth all the way into the 23rd century and beyond .
