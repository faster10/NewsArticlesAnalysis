NOTES : TE Tyler Eifert ( concussion ) was among the Bengals ' inactive players . If the Bengals do play host to a Wild Card game the weekend of January 9 10 , looks like McCarron would be the likely starter . But even if the Bengals are forced to enter the first round of the playoffs with McCarron behind center , they are confident the backup can do something that no quarterback since Boomer Esiason has done : lead the Bengals to a playoff victory . The young quarterback couldn ' t pounce on the ball as DeMarcus Ware ended up with it to finish off the game . " I ' m feeling good , I ' m cleared and I ' m ready to play , " he said . . . . They out gained the Raiders and won the time of possession battle in the loss .
