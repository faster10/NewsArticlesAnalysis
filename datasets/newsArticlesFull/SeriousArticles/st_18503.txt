I believe that in the case of MH17 the United Nations should also oversee immediate sending of an international team of investigators , covered by force if necessary , to ensure that relatives ' needs , the bodies themselves and the evidence field are protected . It is already very late , but not too late . There has already been looting , abhorrent to relatives , there is something particularly unsavory about the thought of unauthorised interference with bodies , or indeed personal effects of the dead .
