Whoever wins Iowa on the Democratic side , the margin of victory may be tiny . In fact , Martin O ' Malley supporters could be the key , due to the strange process of the Democratic caucuses . If , in the first round , one candidate doesn ' t earn a certain threshold of support , they are essentially told to give up on the longshot and choose between the frontrunners . O ' Malley is polling in the single digits , meaning there will likely be many individual caucuses where he doesn ' t get enough support for the second round . At that point , his supporters will either have to move into the Clinton or Sanders camps , or just not vote . But if Clinton and Sanders are very close , the O ' Malley supporters may be the margin of victory . That ' s all pretty wonky , I admit , but it ' ll be something to watch for on caucus night .
