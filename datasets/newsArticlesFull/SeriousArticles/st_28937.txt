What sound was Brian Wilson pursuing ? It was Phil Spector ' s Wall of Sound , that echo y , mighty mass of music that spilled through AM radios like the voice of heaven itself . Undergirding it all was the Wrecking Crew , the band of L . A . session kings ( including drummer Hal Blaine , guitarist Glen Campbell and saxophonist Steve Douglas ) who never let up on the beat . This set presents the original albums from the Crystals , the Ronettes and Bob B . Soxx and the Blue Jeans , with an extra disc of label sides for good measure .
