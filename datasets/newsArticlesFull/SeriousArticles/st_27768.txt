I don t pay any attention to this , said Clinton , who added that primary polls are unpredictable and have only gotten harder to conduct . I don t feel that it s a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night . I can only tell you that the energy , the enthusiasm , the excitement of my volunteers , my organizers , the voters who come , who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building . That s my experience . So I ll let people poll and try to figure out who s gonna actually show up . I m looking at people who are showing up , making up their minds and trying to , you know , convince them to come out and caucus for me .
