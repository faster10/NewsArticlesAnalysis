There was no third Super Bowl title for 37 year old Roger Staubach during his final campaign in 1979 , although he had rallied the Dallas Cowboys to the playoffs with a thrilling 35 34 regular season finale victory over Washington . The following Sunday , the Los Angeles Rams upset Dallas 21 19 in the first round of the playoffs . Staubach , who had led the NFL in passing the previous two seasons , was 12 for 28 for only 124 yards with a TD pass and an interception . The final throw of his career bounced off Cowboys offensive guard Herbert Scott . Although Staubach still possessed top shelf skills , a series of concussions helped persuade him to call it a career .
