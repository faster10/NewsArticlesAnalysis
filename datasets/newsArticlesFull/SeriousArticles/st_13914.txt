SF : The surprise is that it has reached this stage again , trying to force the hand of the ATP . In 2007 , Betfair were so fed up with ATP inactivity that they voided all bets on the Nikolay Davydenko Vassallo Arguello match ? the only time they have ever done that , and quite costly for them . The story made the Reuters , AP and AFP wires around the world ? and the TIU was formed . What was particularly striking was the level of detail supplied by investigators like Mark Phillips , and then it went nowhere . It is as if the TIU have a ' Too Hard ' basket , and any case involving a player ranked under 200 is just dismissed as too hard to win .
