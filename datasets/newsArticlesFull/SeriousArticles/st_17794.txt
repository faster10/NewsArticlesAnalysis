" I ' m not running for office , I ' m just here to make good music , " West said . " When I did that interview , I was really vocal about a lot of the things that I ' ve been dealing with over the past 10 years when I was put in the classification of ' just a celebrity . ' For me , I ' m a creative genius , and there ' s no other way to word it . I know you ' re not supposed to say that about yourself , and I say things the wrong way a lot of times , but my intention is always positive . . . . I want to help the world . "
