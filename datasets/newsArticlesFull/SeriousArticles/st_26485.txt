Even if Manning gets rid of the ball quickly , he ll be throwing into maybe the best secondary in football , led by breakout star Josh Norman . And if you ve seen Manning throw at all this year , well , he hasn t looked quite like his former self to say the least . That means the ground game will have to get it going against the fourth ranked run defense in the NFL . While CJ Anderson wasn t the stud many expected him to be this pre season , he and Ronnie Hillman have become a formidable 1 2 punch in the backfield . And their magic numbers are 30 and 105 : Denver is 8 0 when they run the ball 30 or more times , and 9 0 when they run for at least 105 yards . If Manning has to throw 45 times Sunday , things could be awfully bleak .
