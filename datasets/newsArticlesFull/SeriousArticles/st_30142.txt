Bush , who initially said he ' d only run for president if he could do it " joyfully , " now seems a little exasperated with the whole thing . " If this election is about how we ' re going to fight to get nothing done , then I don ' t want anything ? I don ' t want any part of it , " he told an audience in South Carolina last weekend . " I ' ve got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around , being miserable , listening to people demonize me , and feeling compelled to demonize them . That is a joke . Elect Trump if you want that . "
