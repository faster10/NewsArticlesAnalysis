Welcome to the party . Within seconds it s clear the glum vibe of last year s divorce album Ghost Stories is not welcome here . The only thing you ll be consciously uncoupled from here are your feet as Coldplay whip up a dancefloor friendly mixture of 1985 U2 with some Daft Punk disco grooves and Stargate s crisp production . They ve done this before ( and arguably better on Every Teardrop is a Waterfall ) but this will be a perfect opener to get a stadium on their feet and make Chris Martin work up a sweat .
