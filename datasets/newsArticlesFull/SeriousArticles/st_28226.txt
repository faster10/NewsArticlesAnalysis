Advocates of allegedly " new " designs such as the sodium cooled integral fast reactor ( IFR ) touted in " Pandora ' s Promise " are reaching back into the atomic dark ages . Previous incarnations of this design have suffered fires , leaks and disastrous economics . For example , Monju in Japan , cost 10 . 11 billion and generated just one hour of electricity before closing . The " new " IFR design is decades away , economically unappealing , proliferation risky , and its safety claims are unproven .
