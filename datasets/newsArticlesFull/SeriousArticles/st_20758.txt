DAVID ROHDE , REUTERS : I think that the missile defense is one step forward , working with the Chinese as well . And I think we need to more broadly engage , engage in the region with Asia . And this whole issue of North Korea shows that foreign policy matters . We don ' t want to engage , I understand the sort of post Iraq and Afghanistan hangover . But the North Koreans are not giving us sort of a time out to sort out our domestic issues . The Iranians are not giving us a time out . They ' re pouring tremendous amounts of weaponry into Syria . You know , we have to respond to cyber attacks that David has talked about from China . And this is just this latest example of , I think , the administration needs to step up its game , generally speaking , in foreign policy . They can you know , they have to chew gum and walk at the same time .
