Director Steve Martino ( Ice Age : Continental Drift ) includes affectionate nods to the old stories , often referenced in black and white line drawings . After a while , the movie becomes an exercise in nostalgia , a running checklist for longtime Peanuts fans . Unseen adults have their indecipherable honks ( this time , Troy Trombone Shorty Andrews plays the horn sounds ) . The clever opening has Schroeder playing the 20th Century Fox theme on his toy piano , and Sally , Pig Pen , Peppermint Patty and the wise Linus all get a little screen time , too .
