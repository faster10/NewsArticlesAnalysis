The most difficult aspect of the prenuptial agreement is informing your future wife ( or husband ) : I love you very much , but just in case things don t work out , this is what you will get in the divorce . There are basically three types of women and reactions . One is the good woman who very much loves her future husband , solely for himself , but refuses to sign the agreement on principle . I fully understand this , but the man should take a pass anyway and find someone else . The other is the calculating woman who refuses to sign the prenuptial agreement because she is expecting to take advantage of the poor , unsuspecting sucker she s got in her grasp . There is also the woman who will openly and quickly sign a prenuptial agreement in order to make a quick hit and take the money given to her . Trump : The Art of the Comeback , 1997
