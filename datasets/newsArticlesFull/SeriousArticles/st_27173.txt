Johnson : My ranch is up on the Wyoming Montana border at the base of the Bighorn Mountains . Due north is the Northern Cheyenne reservation , slightly to the west is the Crow reservation , down to the southwest we have the Arapaho and the Shoshone , and then due east and a little to the south we ' ve got the Lakota . So we ' re surrounded by these sovereign nations . For me , that ' s part of where I live , and to leave that out would be , excuse the term , criminal . I think whenever you ' re writing about a place or a people , if it ' s something you care deeply about , then the one thing you owe them is honesty . That means you can ' t just sugarcoat it . You have to be as honest as you can about the people , about the place , about everything . Whether it ' s the rampant alcoholism or unemployment or educational problems .
