The record number of QBs taken first overall shows that a can ' t miss signal caller at the top of the draft can actually miss quite often . The Newton Palmer faceoff Sunday will mark just the second time that two former No . 1 overall QBs have met in a conference title game . The first time came four seasons ago in the NFC title game when Eli Manning ( top pick in 2004 ) led his Giants into San Francisco to beat Alex Smith ( first player taken in 2005 ) and the Niners en route to Super Bowl XLVI . The number of top spot QB clashes increases if you include supplemental drafts . Steve Young was the first player taken in the 1984 supplemental draft of USFL players by the Bucs and went on to play in three straight NFC Championship games for the Niners against 1989 No . 1 overall pick Troy Aikman and the Cowboys . ( The Jets also took a QB in that USFL draft but he was not quite a Steve Young ? Ken Hobart of the Denver Gold never panned out in the NFL but did have a solid career in the CFL . ) Had Young not signed with the L . A . Express he still might not have been the first player taken in the regular draft as the Patriots had the first pick and had just drafted Tony Eason the year before .
