While the Rams have called St . Louis their home since 1995 , they have a bright future to look forward to . Kroenke has plans for an impressive facility that will sit on the grounds of the old Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood . Goodell said that Kroenke ' s vision for the facility was one of the swaying factors . The stadium is projected to open in 2019 and it ' s estimated cost could reach 3 billion . St . Louis leaders expressed disappointment saying the NFL " ignored the facts . " The league has said that any team relocating will pay a fee of 550 million . Kroenke can pay the relocation fee in two ways , according to St . Louis Dispatch ' s Jim Trotter : 550 million up front or 64 million for the next 10 years . According to the report , Kroenke is expected to pay up front . Several logistics , including when the move will occur and where the team ' s practice facility will be , are still to be determined .
