The inside the park could have been an out because the ball was catchable until left fielder Michael Conforto and Cespedes looked at each other as it was descending . Cespedes then made a weak attempt at a back handed grab that did nothing . Still , it would have been a double had the ball bounced on the warning track and off the wall . Nevertheless , the ball hit Cespedes leg and rolled along the warning track toward the left field foul pole . Conforto chased after the ball , but Escobar scored standing up for a very quick 1 0 advantage .
