What happens the next time Turkish planes violate Syrian air space . What happens if a Turkish plane gets shot down by a Russian or Syrian fighter or if it is brought down by a Russian SAM battery that is ostensibly being " manned " by Syrian troops ? Staging a military incident to further a diplomatic strategy is a dangerous gambit , one that could easily spin out of control . Media pundits who suggested this could be " the beginning of a Third World War " were overstating the situation , but the possibility of continued fighting between Russia and Turkey , a NATO member , is a serious matter that could cause enormous problems within NATO and which could possibly either draw in the United States or further erode the perception of American leadership in the world . From Putin ' s standpoint any developments that potentially isolates Turkey diplomatically , creates turmoil in NATO or underscores the lack of American leadership is a win . In the meantime , the Obama Administration continues to insist that " ISIL is being contained . " Is it any wonder than no one believes them ?
