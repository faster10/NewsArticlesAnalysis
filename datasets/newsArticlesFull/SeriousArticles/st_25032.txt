And yet it just goes to show how much space debris exists up there above our heads . It is easy to think of a serene solar system , with the eight planets quietly orbiting around the Sun and only a few moons for company . The reality is that we also share our cosmic neighborhood with millions of other , much smaller bodies : asteroids . Made of rock and metal , they range in size from a few meters across , up to the largest Ceres which is 1000 kilometers wide . They are left over rubble from the chaotic birth of our solar system around 5000 million years ago and , for the most part , are found in a " belt " between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter . But some are known to move away from this region , either due to collisions with other asteroids or the gravitational pull of a planet . And that can bring them into close proximity to the Earth .
