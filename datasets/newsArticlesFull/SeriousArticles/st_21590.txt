Nominations from another planet ? Matt Damon is beloved for his turn as space stranded botanist Mark Watney in the fall blockbuster " The Martian . " The rest of the cast is well regarded too , including Jeff Daniels and Chiwetel Ejiofor on the ground and Jessica Chastain and Michael Pena in space . Yet come Wednesday morning , there was not a single nomination for any of them not ensemble , not supporting , nada . ( This should , incidentally , be concerning for those at Fox and elsewhere hoping for a best picture win : You have to go back more than 20 years , to the second SAG Awards ceremony ever , to find a movie that failed to land a single SAG nomination and went on to win best picture " Braveheart " did it that year . )
