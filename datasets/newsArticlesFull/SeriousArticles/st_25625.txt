But I really admire the governor for his courage to say in his article that " we need to compete with China . " This is something I see as a very bright point in his article because I think eventually African people should be confident enough to stand up , to compete with any country of the world . Without that kind of competition Africa can never develop itself and I always say that there is no loser in this competition everyone benefits from this kind of competition because this competition means development .
