Decent defense : For the first time since perhaps the Super Bowl season of 2010 , the Packers have a defense on which they can depend . It might not be the turnover machine that Dom Capers had in that playoff run , when Tramon Williams intercepted passes in both the wild card and divisional round ( returning the latter for a touchdown ) and B . J . Raji returned one for a touchdown in the NFC title game and Nick Collins did the same in the Super Bowl , but it ' s not the leaky machine that has cost the Packers in the postseason the last few years . Even in the 38 8 loss at Arizona in Week 16 , the defense held up OK . The Cardinals defense got 14 points off the Packers ' offense thanks to a pair of strip sack fumble returns for touchdowns .
