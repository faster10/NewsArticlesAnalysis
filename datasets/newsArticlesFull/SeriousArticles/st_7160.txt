Not only are we all supposed to rejoice that 9 billion of taxpayers ' money has been spent tarting up part of east London that I have never visited and now have even less reason to go there , we must all celebrate and cry uncontrollably when sports men and women win events that I have never even heard of . Coxless fours ? Taekwondo ? Handball ? I wouldn ' t have minded if there were real sports in the Olympics crazy golf , kite flying , staring contests to name just three of my favorites but many of the events that really took place are just crazy .
