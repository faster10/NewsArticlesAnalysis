The irony is that as fewer people are going to movies , the annual spectacle that is the Oscars is taking up greater and greater space in the public arena . The upside is supposed to be a rare communal pleasure the way such occasions ( as the clich has it ) bring the country together . Like Christmas . Or the political campaign . Or a natural disaster . For once in our fragmented era , old and young , blue and red , presumably join hands in a virtual auditorium to admire some dresses and laugh at some jokes .
