The best seat in an NBA arena this season , unless you are accompanied by a small child , is the one next to the Minnesota bench . Here is a brief sampling of the Garnett sound track from the Oklahoma City game , which , it bears repeating , did not actually count . To point guard Lorenzo Brown : You re by yourself , Zo ! To your right , Zo ! Yeah , Zo ! To Dieng : Sit down , G ! Two man game , G ! Good job , G ! To Towns : Hurry up , Kat ! Get back , Kat ! Stop the ball , Kat ! To a referee , after a questionable foul : We re all in preseason form ! After a Thunder air ball : That ' s a terrible shot ! After a Thunder dunk : Oh , no ! Oh , s ! He never shuts up , writhing when the Timberwolves allowed a bucket and howling when they forced a brick . At one point an amused T Wolves veteran turned to a reporter and joked , KG is crazy . Perhaps , but they d better listen to him . The day Garnett retires , he is expected to become part owner of the franchise , a highly animated boss .
