That hasn t hurt Trump too much so far . After all , most Christians don t know much about their own religion , so he s not all that different from the base on that front . But politics is an aspirational vocation , and his inability to look like the kind of Christian that the base voters would like to be could hurt him . Especially if you re comparing him to Carson , who speaks fundamentalism like it s his first language . Carson s presence will remind voters that they want a candidate who hits all the marks : Hard on immigrants but just as hard on ? gay people , willing to make snarky jokes about liking naked ladies but also eager to make sure that women who enjoy sex are punished for it . Trump simply isn t the whole package , something that might start to haunt voters as they get closer to the primary season .
