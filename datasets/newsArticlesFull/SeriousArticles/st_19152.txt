Instead of my usual optimism and tenacity , I was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure . I was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me . I didn ' t trust the drivers to see me , and I didn ' t trust in my cycling ability to be able to stay out of harm ' s way . I had pushed past the boundaries of my comfort zone , into a place where I lacked control . That is not a place I ' m used to visiting , let alone taking off my coat and staying awhile .
