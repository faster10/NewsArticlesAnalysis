The problem of distance for international institutions is more than geographical and also one of a particular international legal mentality . Even international courts such as those for Sierra Leone and Cambodia , which are based in country , are often wilfully detached from those societies , citing the need to remain neutral and impartial from domestic political influences . The transplant of foreign modes of law , with its wigs and gowns , and imposing , high security courtrooms separate international law from local populations , even when those courtrooms are physically located in conflict affected countries . Further highlighting this separation , when these international institutions pack up and leave in the coming years , they will have contributed little to the building of domestic legal infrastructure or training of local judicial personnel , who will have to carry on the task of delivering justice long after foreign lawyers have departed .
