I m looking for someone to provide some leadership on issues that are critical to the African American community , starting with income equity , jobs , he says . I remember all too well what happened in 2007 when this economy crashed , in large part due to the fact that Glass Steagall was gutted in 1999 . That allowed the banks and Wall Street to do what they did . I m looking for someone to restore Glass Steagall and put some controls on Wall Street and on banking in this country . I m looking for someone to expand health care . I would love to have single payer Medicare for everybody .
