5 . With the Patriots visiting the Giants today , it s timely to pass along some front office perspective from New York general manager Jerry Reese , who once relayed to me how attending Patriots Giants joint practices in 2001 provided him with an important perspective that remains relevant today . Reese was a Giants pro scout at the time , and he remembers assessing practice and thinking to himself , The Patriots don t look like a very strong team . Bill Belichick probably would have agreed with him at that moment , but of course , they went on to win the Super Bowl by building momentum throughout the season . That lesson has stuck with Reese as he proceeded throughout his career from pro scout to director of player personnel ( 2004 2007 ) and general manager ( 2007 present ) . The lesson : Be cautious with sweeping full team evaluations in training camp and early in the season .
