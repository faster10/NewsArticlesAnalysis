A real work of beauty . The home of Benfica and the Portuguese national side was entirely rebuilt for the Euro 2004 finals and what a job the architects did . Known as ' The Cathedral ' by supporters and locals , the stadium ' s capacity , once a remarkable 120 , 000 , was nearly halved , but what it lost in terms of spectators , it made up for in a stunning , modern arena . Bedecked in the red and white color of Benfica , the stunning red arches over the roof and pretty surroundings , makes this one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world .
