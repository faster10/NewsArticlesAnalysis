Rick , Carl and Michonne were the only three from the original clan in Sunday ' s episode , which offered an especially intimate view of Carl ' s struggle . He was angry with his father , Rick , for the desperate state they ' re now in , so much so he believes he can make it on his own and wouldn ' t care if his dad were dead . ( That ' s obviously not so true , given his hesitation to shoot him . ) Carl did test out his solo survival skills , and although he nearly was turned into a walker , the experience left him unscathed and with a renewed perspective . Carl is becoming a man and one who clearly enjoys giant cans of pudding .
