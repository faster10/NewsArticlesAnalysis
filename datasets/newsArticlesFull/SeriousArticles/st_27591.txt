Obviously ? OBVIOUSLY ? I watched it all , every single glistening toothy grin , but basically no one need bother . The official Twitter account basically has everything of note that happened embedded either as gifs or , in the case of Shawn Mendes performance and various other memorable moments , entire videos . There are even weird gif things that you can control by running your cursor backwards and forwards , which in the case of this one here makes Sharon Osbourne seem like she s dancing ( she s actually kicking someone in the backside , but more on that later ) .
