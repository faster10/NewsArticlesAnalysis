What to do about Sean Smith and Eric Berry ? These two are potential unrestricted free agents but fit into a different category than Johnson and Hali because of their respective ages . Smith , a cornerback , turns 29 in July and Berry , a safety , will be 28 in December , so each could have at least a few good seasons ahead . Smith has been an important component in a strong Kansas City pass defense the last couple of seasons . It s no coincidence the Chiefs improved dramatically on defense shortly after he returned this year from his three game , season opening NFL suspension . The Chiefs drafted Marcus Peters in the first round last year and he played well as a rookie , but Kansas City doesn t have a lot of depth at corner . Phillip Gaines will return at some point after tearing his ACL early this season . Berry played well this season after returning from his bout with lymphoma and is a fan favorite for what he has overcome . But Berry will be expensive for the Chiefs to retain .
