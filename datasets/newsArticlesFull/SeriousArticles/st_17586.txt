I kind of agree with the department ' s main reason for exterminating New York state ' s resident mute swans ( by the way , that ' s the species ' name , because they ' re usually silent ) . Non native species often pose problems . I just have two problems with the plan . One , I don ' t think mute swans are really too much of a threat to anything or anyone in New York state . They live mainly on Long Island and the lower Hudson , with a few on the Great Lakes . They number just around 2 , 200 birds , total , in the whole state . Not exactly a plague .
