A South African judge on Tuesday granted bail to double amputee Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius . Bail was set at 692 . Pistorius will remain under house arrest at his uncle ' s mansion until sentencing on April 18 . He was originally convicted of the equivalent of manslaughter for fatally shooting his girlfriend , law graduate and model Reeva Steenkamp , through a bathroom door on Valentine ' s Day 2013 . Pistorius said he thought she was an intruder . Last week the Supreme Court of Appeals convicted him of murder , saying he should have known he might kill the person inside , no matter who it was .
