The Venezuelan opposition ' s landslide election victory got bigger on Tuesday , when electoral officials announced that the coalition had won a supermajority in the National Assembly . The opposition won 112 of the 167 seats in the Sunday vote , with the ruling socialists taking only 55 . The two thirds majority will give the opposition greater leverage to reduce the power of President Nicolas Maduro , the hand picked successor of the late Hugo Chavez , who led socialists into power 17 years ago .
