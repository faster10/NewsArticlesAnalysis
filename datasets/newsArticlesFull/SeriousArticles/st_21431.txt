The New York Jets and Buffalo Bills looked like Christmas ornaments during Thursday night ' s game . The Jets wore all green and the Bills all red as part of the NFL ' s color rush promotion . Apparently , this was disconcerting for the color blind among the audience . There will be three more of these on Thursday nights . The objective , of course , is to sell more merchandise . Meanwhile , Carolina cornerback Josh Norman became the latest to be fined for violating the league ' s uniform code because he wrote the words " proud " and " brave " on his red , white , and blue cleats during Salute to Service Week . The penalty was 5 , 000 . Until these sorts of fines stop , the NFL players union should refuse to cooperate with any of the league ' s promotions .
