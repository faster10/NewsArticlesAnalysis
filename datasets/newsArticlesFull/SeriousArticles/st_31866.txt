Michigan looked like it had a 23 21 win over its in state rivalry wrapped up . All the Wolverines had to do was execute a punt with 10 seconds left . Then things went wild . Punter Blake O ' Neill mishandled the snap and then lost the ball while trying to get a kick off anyway . It ended up in the hands of MSU defensive back Jalen Watts Jackson , who ran it back 38 yards for an improbable touchdown that gave MSU a 27 23 lead with no time left at the Big House . MSU would not be heading to the Big Ten championship game this weekend if not for that play .
