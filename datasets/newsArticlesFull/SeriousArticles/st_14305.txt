Life in the lanes has improved in the five years since Ms Suu Kyi came out of house arrest . Outside the township a new road has been built , and the previously fitful electricity supply has become dependable . But the struggle goes on : the government announced with a flourish that primary schooling would be free ? but then the teachers , very poorly paid , demanded informal payments from parents , ranging from 8 , 000 Kyats ( ? 4 ) per month in primary school to 100 , 000 Kyats ( ? 50 ) per month in secondary school . Today this family s only breadwinner is their second daughter , who works in a company and brings home 300 , 000 kyats ( ? 150 ) per month . It s no surprise that life remains very tight . ?
