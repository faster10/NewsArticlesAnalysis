Drink up at a sparkling water fountain . Leave it to Paris to create a public water tap inside a lovely park , no less with the bubbly stuff . For the past couple years , the Jardin de Reuilly in the city ' s southeast 12th arrondissement has been serving up cooled sparkling water to quench Parisian thirsts ( available any time the park is open ) . The park ' s La P tillante public fountain was the first in France to add carbon dioxide to the city ' s tap water , and locals lapped it up by bringing their own bottles to fill . You ' d expect no less in the country that gave the world Perrier .
