This reasoning reflects a different vision of progress than what many Sanders supporters believe in . Some Sanders supporters are straightforward economic determinists who think fixing corporate power will solve gender and race problems . Sanders himself has said he thinks the slow pace of progress on racial justice has been " to a large degree " driven by the influence of big political donors . A more nuanced view would be that there is no true gender or racial justice without economic justice . Class doesn ' t determine gender or race politics , but each concept relies on the other for part of its meaning . Clinton ' s bankruptcy bill vote , for instance , wasn ' t just a class issue . It was also a gender equality issue and a childhood development issue .
