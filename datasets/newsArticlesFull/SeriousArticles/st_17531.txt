In many African countries , youth often feel excluded from the political process . As young people are the biggest consumers of technology , platforms are being developed that enable them to become more actively engaged . In Kenya , Youth Agenda is utilizing an SMS platform to encourage youth to vet their leaders according to policies and attributes instead of along tribal lines . The platform is also used to gauge political opinion . The feedback is collated into reports which are fed into government , giving youth a voice and allowing them to contribute to the development of policy .
