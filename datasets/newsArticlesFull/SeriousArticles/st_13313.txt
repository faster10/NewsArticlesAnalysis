Last season everything came together . Curry and Golden State romped to the NBA championships , defeating James and Cleveland in the finals . Before that , Curry had earned his first NBA Most Valuable Player award as the Warriors compiled a 67 15 regular season record , matching the fifth best of ? all time . This season promises even better . As of last night , they were a scarcely believable ? 20 0 . They had consigned the previous 15 0 record start , set by the Houston Rockets in 1993 , to the dustbin and were on pace to eclipse the best regular season mark of 72 10 , set by Phil Jackson s Chicago Bulls in 1995 96 and ? powered by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen .
