Kotkin : I ' m almost sure that these categories of racial or ethnic identification will still be as important as they are now . Historically , people were defined in a binary matter by race . But now more than ever , ethnicity is intertwined with identity and shapes the way people grow , what they believe and their perspectives on a variety of topics . Now , a gay person is the same no matter what race . A conservative is conservative . Thus , these cultural and ethnic backgrounds will be key markers in terms of identity for Americans .
