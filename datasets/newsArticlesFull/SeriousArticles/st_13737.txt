In it , Mondes reached a maximum speed of 21 . 4 miles per hour on his way to arriving safely at first base . Compare that with Hamilton s top speed of 21 . 9 miles per hour on this nearly successful attempt to reach on a bunt last season , and you can see why the Royals think they might benefit from having Mondes on the roster ( Hamilton is said to have once had the fastest time to first base in Major League history , and if Mondes is getting close to his top speed then the prospect is certainly someone to watch ) .
