The central reason we will not be more effective at achieving our national security border goals is because U . S . policy , since the 1980s , effectively treats all border incursions as equal threats to the homeland . This diminishes our ability to prevent true threats such as drug cartels , human traffickers and potential terrorists from " flooding the zone " and gaining passage into the homeland . These criminals know that a small percentage of their goods and vehicles will be inspected and seized . For them , this is the cost of doing business . Unless we begin to prioritize threats and facilitate the legitimate entry of validated economic migrants , the cost benefit analysis will remain in their favor .
