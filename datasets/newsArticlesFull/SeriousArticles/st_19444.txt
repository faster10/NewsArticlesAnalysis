On Wednesday , a rally was staged outside 30 Rock demanding that Trump be dumped , in light of the comments made about Mexican illegal immigrants after announcing his candidacy in June . Alex Nogales , president of Hispanic National Media Coalition , which organized the rally , said NBC and " SNL ' s " Lorne Michaels have refused to discuss the request , sent via letter . That ' s " very lamentable , " he said , " because in the long term , NBC is going to lose the Latino population as an audience and the goodwill they gained when NBC did away with Trump , " by severing ties with " The Apprentice , " and selling its stake in the Trump controlled Miss USA organization .
