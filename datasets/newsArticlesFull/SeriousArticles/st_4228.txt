There is a ton of credit to be shared by the players on Pittsburgh s defense . As a unit , there were few mistakes and it paid dividends in keeping Peyton Manning and the Denver offense from scoring opportunities . Especially stingy in the red zone , the Steelers only allowed the Broncos to score once on a one yard run by C . J . Anderson . Although the Steelers mixed their blitz packages , only James Harrison recorded a sack . The Steelers limited Denver to a third down efficiency rating of 20 percent ( 3 of 15 ) and were dedicated to keeping the Broncos receivers from getting big catches over the top . It was one of the most consistent games from the Steelers on defense in 2015 , but without enough points put on the scoreboard by the offense and zero takeaways , there just was not enough disruption to change momentum in Pittsburgh s favor .
