All of this has the potential to strike a chord with the public ? if they can look past the word socialist , with its overtones of Russian hats and French strikes . It s odd that when a far Right politician like Trump talks about economic populism , everyone assumes that it ll be a vote winner . But when Sanders also discusses wages , prices and the damaging effects of inequality ? it s dismissed as hippie talk . Yet thoughtful conservatives ought to look long and hard at Sanders , consider the points of commonality and wonder if they point to an agenda that we can all build a consensus around .
