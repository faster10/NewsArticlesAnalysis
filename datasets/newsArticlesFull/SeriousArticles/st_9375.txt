There were holes in that diplomatic statement , not least this one : The ceasefire would not apply to offensive or defensive actions against Da esh ISIS or Nusra an al Qaida affiliate or any other group the conference of 20 nations at Vienna agrees to deem terrorist . ( Italics added . ) Even at the time , Russia and Iran said they considered all groups fighting in Syria , except for the Assad backed Syrian army , to be terrorists . Now that the Turkmen militia ? which calls itself the 10th Brigade and is associated with the Free Syrian Army , one of the U . S . backed moderate rebel groups ? has shot at Russian pilots as they helplessly parachuted to earth , Putin will likely be more insistent on this point . If that s true , there will be no real cease fire and thus no prospects of a political transition and thus no end to the war .
