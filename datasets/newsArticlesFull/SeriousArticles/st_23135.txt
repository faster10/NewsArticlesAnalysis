President Obama must end the federal Department of Defense 1033 Program that gives military grade weapons to local and state police forces including school police . The Strategy Center has initiated a No Tanks in LA and the U . S . Campaign along with other civil rights groups calling for an end to this counter insurgency program that provides tanks , armored vehicles , and M16 rifles to local police forces . As the protests against police brutality and poverty in the U . S . escalate so has police violence and intimidation tactics against demonstrators . As the climate crisis intensifies both inside and outside the United States , daily life is marked by droughts , floods , extreme weather events , food shortages , hunger , famine , mass poverty . This in turn generates massive movements of internally displaced people and world refugees and immigrants who in turn will be making demands on world governments including the U . S . It seems clear that U . S . ruling circles have no plans to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emission but do have plans to repress rather than address mass protests thus arming local police forces with tanks , grenades , and M16s . We have to end this Department of Defense civil rights , human rights , and environmental rights injustice and bring international awareness about and pressure upon the Obama administration to end this repressive program .
