In the past , it was fairly easy for GOP party leaders to rid themselves of a party nuisance such as Palin . After all , they controlled the money , media spin and party apparatus . They banked that they could maneuver and massage the primaries and convention to ensure that the noise and mischief the outsiders could make would die before the primary season began .
