Staying in Marrakech is best experienced at a riad , a traditional Moroccan home built around a central courtyard . The whole idea was originally to create as private a dwelling as possible , so even finding the entrance to one can be a challenge ( always ask your hosts if someone can meet you , if not at the airport , at least at the edge of the Old City to get you there ) . The best have only a few rooms , each uniquely decorated and appointed . Your hosts will be more than ready to offer suggestions on where to eat , what to see , or just to offer a soothing cup of tea on the rooftop terrace .
