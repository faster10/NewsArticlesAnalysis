Balotelli was not souvenir hunting and you can see from his reaction that he has little interest in taking Pepe ' s shirt . On this occasion , he genuinely looked to be minding his own business and had not walked off the pitch pestering Pepe . All he has been guilty of on this occasion is naivety . If he had walked another three or four steps down the tunnel , we would never have known . If he had thought properly , he could have done what Steven Gerrard did with Alvaro Arbeloa and taken Pepe ' s shirt after the game .
