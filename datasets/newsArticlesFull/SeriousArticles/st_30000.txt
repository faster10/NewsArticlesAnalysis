It wasn t all on Powell , that d be wildly unfair because even before it got to that 43 yard field goal attempt Washington State had a ) given up a 22 10 third quarter lead b ) Luke Falk threw two interceptions to halt the Cougars offensive momentum c ) the defense allowed a 30 yard Christian McCaffrey run that set up a Conrad Ukropina field goal . Also , let s not forget that Powell had also made five field goals earlier in the game that kept the Cougars alive . But the win gave Stanford control of the North , and even after a two point loss to Oregon a few weeks later the Cardinal still controlled their own destiny .
