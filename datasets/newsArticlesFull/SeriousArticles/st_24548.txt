Bob s former colleagues have not forgotten him . We continue to stand with the Levinson family , said FBI Agents Association President Renaldo Tariche . Bob , married for 38 years with seven children , has missed more than nine years of accomplishments and milestones in the lives of his children . Each day brings renewed heartache to his family and friends . We celebrate today s release of Americans , but the world should not forget Levinson s continued unjustified imprisonment and continue to work for his release .
