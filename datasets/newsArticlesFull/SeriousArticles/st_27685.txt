Despite some controversy over short staffed precincts late Monday , the Sanders campaign says that it doesn t foresee contesting the final results ? though it is calling on the state party to release the raw vote count from the night . It s unclear if the party will release the vote ? or even if they have an accurate tally given how the chaotic caucus process works ? but Bernie is hoping that a raw vote total will allow him to claim his own qualified victory despite his narrow loss in the delegate column . There is a strong case to be made that more Iowans showed up to caucus for Sanders on Monday night than did for Clinton . That s because a precinct with seven county delegates awards seven county delegates regardless of whether seven people show up to caucus or 700 do . Given that Bernie s support appeared to be concentrated around college campuses ? while Clinton s appeared more evenly spread out across the state ? it s possible that he was short changed by the system . In one Sanders heavy precinct near the University of Iowa , for example , 646 people showed up to caucus on Monday , a roughly 70 percent jump from 2008 . ( That caucus occurred earlier in the year , when many students were still home for winter break . )
