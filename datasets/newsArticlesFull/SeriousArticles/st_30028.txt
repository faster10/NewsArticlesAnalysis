The recent wave of protests against the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines ( PIA ) by its employee union is nothing new , and to an extent it is understandable . A large number of them have been appointed due to their political affiliations , many have roles that could much cheaply be outsourced or replaced by modern technology , while others simply are uncertain of their fate , which feeds their desire to maintain the status quo . It is certainly the duty of the government and the management to ensure that no employee is unfairly treated or has to go through the torture of an uncertain future , but what should be made clear to all of the employees of PIA is that the airline can no longer be bailed out by the people of Pakistan .
