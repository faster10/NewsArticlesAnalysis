On one hand I ' m really looking forward to that because I put so much into wanting to be the best and be competitive that I can be for my team every weekend , that , you know , I ' m kind of ready to take a shift in that , he said after finishing sixth in the season finale and third in the driver standings . ? I ' m still going to , I think , apply that same kind of competitiveness to doing my job up in the booth and some of the other things that I ' m going to be doing . I know I just have that in me naturally .
