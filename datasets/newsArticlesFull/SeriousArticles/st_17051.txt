" Obviously he was in a great rhythm , " LeBron said of Love . " He shot the ball extremely well . I think he missed his first three and we got an offensive rebound and we kicked it right back to him and he was able to make his first one . He just had a great rhythm . He went inside , he went outside and when you got someone going like that , automatically my I . Q . and conscious automatically get sparked and say , ' How can we find him ? ' I remember one play for instance when J . R . hit me on the slash and I had a wide open layup but I seen him in the opposite corner and I wanted to throw it to him and I was able to hit him and he knocked it down . So , when a guy is in a rhythm you just try to find a way to get it to him . "
