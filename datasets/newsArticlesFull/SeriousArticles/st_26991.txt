The biggest thing people should be talking about is kids playing tackle football at the park with no protective equipment . I remember one Turkey Bowl we played , ground was frozen I tackle d someone who had 30 lbs on me from behind , my head hit the frozen ground then his hip landed on my head . the rest of the game I played on the line acting like I was rushing the passer but I was actually just trying not to fall over because I was so dizzy , had headaches for a week after and never told anyone .
