Perhaps the surprise of the evening was Brie Larson s win as best actress ( drama ) for the harrowing movie Room , based on Emma Donoghue s novel . Again , of course , it is a survival theme , and the importance of this could perhaps be expected to trump everything else . I personally was disappointed that Saoirse Ronan did not win for her very subtle , nuanced and sympathetic performance in the romantic drama Brooklyn , as the emigrant who re immigrates back to Ireland and confronts her own alternative possibilities of existence . Larson also came out ahead of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in Carol and the increasingly impressive Alicia Vikander in The Danish Girl , so this really was a career highpoint triumph for her .
