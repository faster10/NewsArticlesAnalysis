Play of the week : A lot of really , really good contenders . There was McCaffrey s screen turned 49 yard touchdown . That Charles Nelson touchdown was pretty amazing . If you watch it frame by frame , he actually leaps just before the 2 yard line and carries all the way into the end zone . Trey Griffey s 95 yard touchdown in a losing effort was dizzying . That Dwayne Stanford touchdown catch , though . And I just have a thing for really instinctive defensive plays . And Cam Denson s pick six was brilliantly read . So once again , I ll leave it to you to decide . ( And note , none of the aforementioned special teams touchdowns were mentioned , which goes to show what a ridiculous week this was for outstanding plays ) .
