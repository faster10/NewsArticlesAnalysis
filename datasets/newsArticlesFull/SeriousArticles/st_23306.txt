The Rolling Stone cover correctly assumes that there is no such rift . It assumes that of course we all hate what the Tsarnaev and his older brother , the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev , are accused of doing ( Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings ) . The words on that cover state what many of us the " us " that covers our culture believe : He was a bomber . There isn ' t even an " alleged " there , and the premise of the article stated on the cover also denies that qualifier : " How a popular , promising student was failed by his family , fell into radical Islam and became a monster . " In case you were unclear about where Rolling Stone stands on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , the words " bomber " and " monster " should make it clear .
