It is equally tricky to describe the transformation needed other than to compare Bush s predicament to the difference between Romney s primary run in 2008 and his run in 2012 . In 2008 , he was robotic , overly deliberate and passive in the face of barbs from Sen . John McCain ( R Ariz . ) . In 2012 , whether right wingers like to admit it or not , he was a much improved candidate , the only one who looked presidential . He was looser , more direct , entirely willing to pin back opponents ears in the debate . ? That ? is the sort of metamorphosis Bush must undergo , but in a matter of weeks , not years . It is , needless to say , easy to tell a candidate , Be more confident ! or Look like a winner ! It s is quite another to do so when the candidate is struggling .
