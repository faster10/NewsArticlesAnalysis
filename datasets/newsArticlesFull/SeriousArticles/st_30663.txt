So , despite our noble desire to love our fellow man , we are all suspicious of " The Other " in this case , the young man in a hoodie in the rain . Whether that figure comes in the form of a black teenager , a gay co worker , the Muslim neighbor , the overweight teacher , the barista with the tattoos and piercings , or , yes , even the gun owner , we all have biases . And yet most of us will never admit we have them , placing our own Gandhi like bias free self image on a pillar of fairness and equity . But the truth is , the more we deny we have biases , the more we broaden and deepen those prejudices .
