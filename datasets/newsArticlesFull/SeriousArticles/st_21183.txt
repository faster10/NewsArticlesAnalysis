Slow welcome back : Dez Bryant s return brought energy to the crowd , but that didn t translate to the stat column . Bryant finished with two catches for 12 yards , with Richard Sherman shadowing him regardless of which side Bryant lined up on . The only time Sherman wasn t on Bryant was in the slot . Bryant s first catch came on a rocket screen in the slot , but Sherman was able to stop Bryant for a 2 yard loss . Sherman drew offensive pass interference on a deep ball , but it was a smart play by Bryant to break up a sure interception . This was just the seventh time since Garrett took over as coach that Bryant had two or fewer catches .
