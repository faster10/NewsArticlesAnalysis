Sybrina Fulton realized the need to fight not only for justice for her own son , but also for other families and their children as well . " When this initially happened to Trayvon , we thought this was about Trayvon , " Fulton said . Then , when she saw how many lives were touched by Trayvon ' s death , she became a voice for the voiceless , like others before her . " We have to speak out for those people , just like Trayvon , and just like Dr King , and just like Medgar they were sacrifices for better lives in a better world . "
