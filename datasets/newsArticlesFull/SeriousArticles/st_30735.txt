Lloyd ' s body , riddled by . 45 caliber bullets , is found in the industrial park . Prosecutors say they have more video showing Hernandez ' s fianc e throwing out a trash bag under suspicious circumstances . They say she was ditching the murder weapon to help the father of her child . And for the coup de grace , the bubble gum reappears . A chewed piece of the gum is found in a rental car company trash container stuck to a . 45 caliber shell casing consistent with the ammunition used to kill Lloyd . The defense asserts problems with how this evidence was recovered but the jury may believe that the gum and DNA link Hernandez to the murder weapon , which was not recovered .
