You see a similar pattern with the Bill Clinton controversies . It s important to remember that conservatives spent the 90s bitter over the fact that Anita Hill dared come forward and testify against Clarence Thomas , alleging that he had sexually harassed her when she was working under him at the EEOC . Even though Hill s testimony did not prevent the Senate from confirming Thomas seat on the Supreme Court , later journalistic investigations made it clear that Hill was almost certainly telling the truth . The embarrassment of the whole situation haunted the conservative movement , and there was almost a tit for tat quality to the immediate efforts to find someone who would point the same finger at Bill Clinton .
