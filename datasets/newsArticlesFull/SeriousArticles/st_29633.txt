Tuesday the Clinton campaign ? released a signed letter by ten prominent diplomats and career national security wonks backing Clinton for President and calling Sanders foreign policy expertise into question . The letter was both unsurprising and underwhelming . Unsurprising because it was signed by former Bill and Hillary Clinton appointees ( half of whom have connections to weapons contractors and all of whom will be looking for work in January 2017 ) and underwhelming because she could only muster ten signatories . This isn t to say there aren t legitimate critiques of Sanders s foreign policy ? there certainly are ? but as the democratic primary race heats up with only days until the first primary , Clinton and her partisans are doubling down on the conventional wisdom she can pass the Commander in Chief test due to her foreign policy experience ? ? a consensus widely shared by registered Democrats , 72 of whom trust Clinton over Sanders on matters of foreign policy .
