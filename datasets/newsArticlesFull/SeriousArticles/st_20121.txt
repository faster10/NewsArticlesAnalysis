In 2012 , a for profit called the New York Real Estate Institute gave Trump ' s foundation 10 , 000 just as it was launching a seminar taught by a Trump Entrepreneur Initiative teacher , Stephen Gilpin . Trump himself plugs Gilpin in a quote on the course ' s webpage . Two of his children , Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr . , also provide the institute with glowing " testimonials " atop its homepage . A year after its first donation , the institute ' s president , Richard Levine , appears to have personally donated another 10 , 000 to Trump ' s foundation . Levine did not reply to multiple emails seeking confirmation of the donation details and a comment about the gifts .
