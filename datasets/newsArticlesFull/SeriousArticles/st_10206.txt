But he wasn ' t worried about falling debris landing on inhabited places , even though , like the UARS satellite a few weeks earlier , big pieces of ROSAT ( the glass mirrors ) were expected to hit the ground before burning up completely .

Dr Hasinger estimates that space debris as large as ROSAT falls to Earth every few weeks , almost all of it unreported and unnoticed .
