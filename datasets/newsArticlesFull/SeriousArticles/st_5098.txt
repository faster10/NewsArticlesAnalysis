Winner : The Purge . There were 109 fewer voters this year after a Hall of Fame directive that changed the eligibility requirements , eliminating those writers who hadn ' t actively covered the game in the past 10 years or so . Those voters historically voted for fewer players on their ballots and didn ' t vote for the PED era sluggers . The percentage increases that Piazza , Bagwell and Raines enjoyed were also seen by others . Mike Mussina had the largest increase , at 18 percent . This is all a good thing . As I ' ve written , the 1980s and 1990s remain vastly underrepresented in Cooperstown compared to other eras . At least we now have nine new Hall of Famers elected the past three years , after just nine had been elected the previous seven years .
