We are asking State to pause its review of Keystone XL based on the fact that we have applied to the Nebraska Public Service Commission for approval of its preferred route in the state , said Russ Girling , TransCanada s chief executive officer , in a statement . I note that when the status of the Nebraska pipeline route was challenged last year , the State Department found it appropriate to suspend its review until that dispute was resolved . We feel under the current circumstances a similar suspension would be appropriate .
