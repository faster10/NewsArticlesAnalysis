The cold open , at least , is pretty spectacular . It ' s the kind of bravura shot rarely seen in this series , a Touch of Evil inspired long steadicam take that follows a disguised 007 and his fetching plus one through a Day of the Dead parade in Mexico City . ( That he doffs his skeleton costume for an impeccable Tom Ford suit before springing into action has nothing to do with tactics and everything to do with optics . ) A melee in a helicopter careening dangerously above the bystander packed Z calo leaves Bond in a possession of a laughably conspicuous jewelry clue ( one that must have seemed pretty dumb even in Thunderball , the 50 year old Bond picture that spawned it ) .
