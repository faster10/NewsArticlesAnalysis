QUESTION THAT NEEDS ANSWERING : Will team president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer go big in free agency ? The Cubs are close . They ' ve acknowledged they need another starting pitcher , perhaps two , to fill out the rotation . We saw how that lack of depth hurt them in the NLCS , and there are big names to be had . We ' ve also heard of interest in outfielder Jason Heyward , which would be interesting . The Cubs have some trade chips as well on the big league roster and in the minors . Seemingly every option they could possibly want to explore will be available .
