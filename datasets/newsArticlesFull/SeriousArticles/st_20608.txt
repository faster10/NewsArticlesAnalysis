Kevin Durant : " I did idolize Kobe Bryant . I studied him , wanted to be like him . He was our Michael Jordan . I watched Michael toward the end of his career with the Wizards and I seen that ' s what Kobe emerged as the guy for us . I ' ve been disappointed this year because you guys ( media ) treated him like s . He ' s a legend and all I hear is about how bad he ' s playing , how bad he ' s shooting , time for him to hang it up . You guys treated one of our legends like s and I didn ' t really like it . Hopefully now you can start being nice to him now that he decided to retire after this year . It was sad the way he was getting treated . He had just an amazing career , a guy who changed the game for me as a player mentally and physically . Means so much to the game of basketball . Someone I ' m always gonna look to advice for anything . Just a brilliant , brilliant , intelligent man . Sad to see him go . He put his mark on the game . "
