Sen . Christopher Dodd : Well , I ' m not sure it is at this point . That ' s why we ' re having this hearing this morning . We ' ll have Secretary Paulson and Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , before the banking committee to explain this plan , why it ' s necessary and where we go from here . They basically have asked for a blank check of 700 billion for the next several years here to buy a lot of bad instruments out there in these institutions . See what power Paulson would have if the bailout is approved
