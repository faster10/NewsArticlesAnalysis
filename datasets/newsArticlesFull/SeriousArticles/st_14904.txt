The reason the FG is a bad idea is because the Jets can win in regulation with two scores . At 10 points , the Jets have incentive to play for OT if they stall , which still gives the Giants an opportunity to win . At 17 points , the Jets likely can t get 3 trips down the field . As porous as the Giants defense is , Coughlin didn t want to take the chance with 13 , and he was right . On the subsequent drive after the interception , the Jets went right down the field without a third down the entire drive . Both Jets drives resulted in 1st and goal positioning , and the Jets took the 3 on the first one because they knew the Giants couldn t run the ball to eat time and the Jets could drive again on that defense .
