Manning has a foot injury , and an injury to his ribs . Maybe he needs some time to get healthy and can come back and play better in a little while . His 340 yard game against the Green Bay Packers a couple weeks ago brought some optimism . Maybe it was just that he didn t feel comfortable in Kubiak s offense and was finally turning the corner . And he made a couple big plays against the Indianapolis Colts last week . But Sunday s game erased much of the optimism . He ' s a liability for the Broncos at the moment , and the only hope is that he can be better with some time off to get healthy .
