JUDD : Learn the difference between pity and empathy , charity and self efficacy . Abandon the former , which is patronizing , practice the latter , which builds capacity . Accept your will , in spite of your most noble intentions and earnest aspirations , bring unconscious biases and prejudices with you . It is impossible not to . Have the humility to spot , admit , and correct your own thinking . Live your amends . Take care of your mental health . Any unhealthy coping mechanism you have , or ism ( compulsion obsession addiction ) , will be triggered and amplified . You are not the exception , no matter how strong your faith and will . Consider therapy , a 12 step program , or other healing modality before you go , and continue to seek help and support . Remember : denial stands for " Don ' t Even Know I Am Lying . " The work may be rewarding , but it is also intensely grueling . You will pay high costs for not taking care of yourself . Rejoice in your opportunity . Practice an attitude of gratitude in everything you do . The world , even in the most desperate places , is full of wonder and miracles .
