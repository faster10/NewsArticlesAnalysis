Google crows that it's got everything (but the Apple Watch)
Google -- or as it prefers to be known these days, the People's Republic Of Google -- is feeling a little twitchy at the moment. On the one hand, it's peddling the idea that you should "Be Together, Not The Same," a veritable poem to human individuality and community. On the other hand, it's being accused of fiddling its search results in a frightfully undemocratic manner. And then the blighters in Cupertino go and launch their Apple Watch.Lumme, what's to be done? Well, release an ad that says there are already so many wonderful, beautiful Android Wear watches, even if the people haven't got around to buying many of them.So here are lots of young, hippy, happy people dancing around with their (borrowed) Android Wear watches. It's almost as cheery a dancing scene as Microsoft's now legendary Surface ads, which graced the firmament at the product's launch and then drifted off like a startup with a 14-year-old CEO that ran out of funding. Will this ad put a dent into Apple's horological ambitions? Will it clock Apple where it hurts? Or are Android manufacturers gleefully waiting to see if Apple can make the market for them?
