Vladimir Putin was a slight child with an indulgent mother . He tended to be undisciplined in his early school years to a point where he was initially rejected from the Pioneers youth group that is basically akin to being blackballed by the Cub Scouts . However , when he embraced something , he would do so with the single minded discipline that would mark his career in later life such was the case with judo . Once he found his footing in martial arts , young Putin was accepted into the Pioneers and became a group leader and an acceptable student .
