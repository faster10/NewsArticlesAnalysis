The " dahei " campaign is led by Bo Xilai . 60 , the city ' s party chief who also sits on China ' s ruling politburo . Son of a revolutionary veteran , Bo had served as Dalian city mayor , Liaoning provincial governor and China ' s minister of commerce . An outsider in Chongqing , Bo has had to bring in his trusted prot g , Wang Lijun , to replace Wen Qiang as chief of police and clean up the city . Wang made his name as a tough , upright police commissioner in Liaoning province , Bo ' s former turf . In response , the gangs have reportedly put a 12 million yuan bounty on Wang ' s head . " It not us who took the initiative to fight the underworld , " Bo Xilai told the Chongqing media . " It ' s the underworld who has compelled us to do so . The public has been gathering at the gate of our government building , holding blood stained pictures , deeply distressed . The underworld has killed innocent people with machetes , like butchers killing pigs too horrible to see . " Bo said the campaign is aimed at restoring economic order and winning people ' s trust .
