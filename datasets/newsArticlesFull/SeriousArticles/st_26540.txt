The few images of El Chapo that have been released of his capture suggest he knows this time that everything is different . He looks a broken man , showing little of the calm defiance of previous occasions . He must genuinely fear that the Mexican government will swallow its pride this time and extradite him . There will be many on both sides of the US Mexican border fearing the information that El Chapo might offer up to the justice department to make life in a US prison a little more comfortable .
