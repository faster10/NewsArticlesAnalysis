10 . Ben Johnson , 100 meters Having taken gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and slicing four hundredths of a second off the world record , Canada ' s 100m sprint champion took to the mic : " I ' d like to say my name is Benjamin Sinclair Johnson Jnr and this world record will last 50 years , maybe 100 . " Only hours after the race had ended , a urine sample belonging to the sprinter was found to contain the anabolic steroid stanozolal resulting in the time being scrapped from the record books . Johnson protested his innocence but , after a two year suspension , he was banned in 1993 for testing positive again and this time it was for life .
