To start with the second one , because it is the sexier issue : For months now , there s been a sense in the pundit class that Trump is going to cross a line one day , saying something that will wake his supporters up to the fact that he s not ready to win a general election , causing them to give up their love affair with the Orange One and move , however reluctantly , to a Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush . This assumption underestimates how enraged these voters are . These are people that often feel that they are losing their identity . ? This group is animated by the idea that white Christian conservatives are the dominant class by rights , and that any attempt to share power is capitulation . The Bushes and Rubios of the world are seen as squishes , people who think conservatism can somehow be separated from this white Christian identity .
