The Republican Party has clearly lost its direction , and I dare say its soul .

Trump and Cruz have won support specifically because of the antipathy of the party establishment to both of them . The party dominates nationally with the exception of the presidency , yet is in danger of suffering an implosion and a possible ( though not certain ) historically large national loss .
