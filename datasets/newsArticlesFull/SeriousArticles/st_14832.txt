Asked at an Oct . 22 congressional hearing about why the consumer alert was withdrawn , FBI Director James Comey said the first version was " a miss on our part " because the bureau didn ' t realize that few stores or cards are equipped to handle the use of PINs . " We withdrew because our worry was we ' re going to confuse a whole lot of people who are going to roll into places saying , ' Where is the chip and PIN ? ' " he told the House Judiciary Committee . " And it isn ' t widely available . "
