" In a 2 1 decision , the 5th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld a Texas based judge ' s injunction blocking the Obama administration ' s immigration initiative . " As NBC ' s Pete Williams said on " Today " this morning , it ' s likely the Obama administration will appeal to the Supreme Court . And guess what : That means we could be headed for a late June 2016 ruling just days before the Republican convention in Cleveland . Who knows where the GOP race is . But we will know that how this ruling goes will impact the fight for Latino support .
