Sure , as with any profession , pilots have isolated cases of stress related troubles . But we have mechanisms to deal with such problems . One mechanism is very simple : Don ' t fly . It is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty . As a matter of fact , on every trip , I have to confirm that status before I electronically sign the flight plan . Whether it ' s as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce , airline pilots can just say " no " to flying .
