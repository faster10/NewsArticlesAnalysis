" Alan was my friend and so this is hard to write because I have just kissed him goodbye . What I remember most in this moment of painful leave taking is his humor , intelligence , wisdom and kindness . His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word . The intransigence which made him the great artist he was his ineffable and cynical wit , the clarity with which he saw most things , including me , and the fact that he never spared me the view . I learned a lot from him . He was the finest of actors and directors . I couldn ' t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next . I consider myself hugely privileged to have worked with him so many times and to have been directed by him . He was the ultimate ally . In life , art and politics . I trusted him absolutely . He was , above all things , a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again . "
