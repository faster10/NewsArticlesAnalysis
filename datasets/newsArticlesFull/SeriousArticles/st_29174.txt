" We know that our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness , " Obama said in his inaugural address ? Jan . 21 , 2009 . " We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus , and nonbelievers . ? We are shaped by every language and culture , drawn from every end of this Earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation , and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united , we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller , our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace .
