Johnson : It seems like it with the book sales . The crowds at book signings are larger . For me , it ' s all about the exposure for the books . I live in Ucross , Wyoming . I have a little ranch there . That ' s where I was when Hollywood found me , and that ' s where I ' ll be when Hollywood leaves me . To be honest , I don ' t have any great want or need to move to L . A . or anything like that . I like my life , and I really love writing the books . If someone had asked me if I would have had as much fun writing the eighth or ninth book in the series as I did the first one , I wouldn ' t have thought that was possible , but it is . I ' m having more fun now , because I feel like I ' ve written enough to think I kind of know what I ' m doing . At least , I hope so .
