Note the communique s defiant , triumphal tone ? the tone of victors . ? Note , concomitantly , the absence of all the factors to which Islamist apologists have ascribed as contributing to Islamist violence committed by French citizens of mostly North African descent in the past nary a word about discrimination , racism , lack of opportunity , youth unemployment , police brutality , or poverty in Parisian suburbs . ? This is not to say that these factors had no role to play in disposing the French born assailants to play their role in the attacks ? they may have . ? But the primum mobile for ISIS transpires as unmistakably politico religious ( natural , given that ? Islam blends faith and politics ) , buttressed , to be sure , by the virulent excoriations of infidels found in the Quran . ? France is attacking ISIS in the Middle East ( and thus acting as crusaders ) and thwarting the unhindered observance of Islam in France . ? France is , thus , impeding the advance of Islam , the True Religion , and thus must incur God s wrath .
