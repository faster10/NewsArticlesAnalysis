Pittsburgh Steelers : If you ' re worried about Antonio Brown struggling without Ben Roethlisberger this week , don ' t be . Brown always saves something special for the Browns , who have given up 27 catches for 413 yards and two touchdowns to Brown in their four matchups against him , and that ' s with a healthy Joe Haden , who ' s out this week . And just like Roethlisberger , Landry Jones throws to Brown early and often . Of Jones ' 456 passing yards in spot duty , 224 have gone to Brown . Ten of Jones ' 28 completions have gone to Brown . And the two haven ' t connected on a score yet , so that could finally happen this week . Worst case , Brown puts up a healthy dose of yards and receptions . Jeremy Fowler
