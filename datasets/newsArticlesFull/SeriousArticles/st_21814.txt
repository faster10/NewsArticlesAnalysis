The lessons learned during those tragic attacks are true today . Our government and our political leaders have failed . They failed to learn from their errors or to propose any meaningful answers . Over the past weekend Marine Le Pen , the leader of the Front National , has gained millions of followers on Facebook and Twitter . Her views are still the same the DNA of her party has not changed . Hatred , stigmatisation and the dream of preserving the " purity " of Frenchness is still her stock in trade . It is thought that the primary victims and targets of Le Pen ' s discourse of hatred are first and foremost immigrants , Muslims and Islam , but this is wrong . The greatest enemy of Le Pen is not me , as a French Muslim woman it is our democracy .
