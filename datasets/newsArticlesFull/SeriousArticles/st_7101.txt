The study says : ' The frequentist notion states that the probability of a given event relates to the frequency at which such event is repeated . Additionally , as predicted by the Law of Large Numbers , when an event is repeated many times , the average of the results from all events should be close to the expected result . Thus , games of all kinds in which many repetitions occur ( such as lotteries ) are ideal labs for the study of probabilities . Now a new study shows that not all combinations of numbers have the same probability of occurring in a lottery draw .
