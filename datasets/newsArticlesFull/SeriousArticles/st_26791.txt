As a fan of Carolina , I am often disappointed with the home crowd . Lots of people seem almost offended when I m screaming my head off at the game , they are slow to get in their seats , and there are boatloads of people in Charlotte who cheer for opposing teams and despise the Panthers . But as an earlier poster noted , it s a generational thing . The team is only 20 years old , the more panther fans we raise and the more seasons like this one , the better off the fan base will become . Keep pounding guys !
