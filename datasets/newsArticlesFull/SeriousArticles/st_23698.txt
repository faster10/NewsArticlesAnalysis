" So I grabbed him with my left arm , and he falls into me , and I ' ve still got my gun in the other hand , " he continues . " He ' s covered with blood , and I immediately notice that the guy ' s got a ton of gold on a necklace and other jewelry and all of the gold is covered in blood . That has always left an image in my mind . . . After I pulled him out , Suge starts yelling at him , ' Pac ! Pac ! ' And he just keeps yelling it . And the guy I ' m holding is trying to yell back at him . He ' s sitting up and he ' s struggling to get the words out , but he can ' t really do it . And as Suge is yelling ' Pac ! , ' I look down and I realize that this is Tupac Shakur . "
