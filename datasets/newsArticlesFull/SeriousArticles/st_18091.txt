I will say this : We must gulp and acknowledge that some of our own city leaders dropped the ball on making renovations to the dome , like the Rams lease said must happen . Would that have saved the Rams ? Or delayed the inevitable ? We don t know . But there are lessons there , lessons for the next time . The only way we can grow from this divorce , and ascend from this divorce , is to acknowledge missteps and then step forward . They won t botch a potential Major League Soccer lease , I ll tell you that .
