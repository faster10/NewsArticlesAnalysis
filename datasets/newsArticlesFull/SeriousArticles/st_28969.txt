A state court judge ruled in November that Missouri ' s 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal . Attorney General Chris Koster appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court . But that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the U . S . Supreme Court decision . Just a few days after that state court ruling , a U . S . District Court judge struck down the state ' s marriage ban , but that decision has been stayed pending appeals . While the state ban is in effect , officials in the St . Louis area have issued marriage licenses to same sex couples .
