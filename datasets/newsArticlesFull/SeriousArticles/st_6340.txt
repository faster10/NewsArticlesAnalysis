This is hardly the only matter about which Carson says all the scientists are wrong . He thinks that the theory of evolution was born when Satan encouraged Charles Darwin to devise it all the copious evidence for evolution is meaningless . Carson also says that he once stumped a well known physicist by asking him how the organization of the solar system could be compatible with the second law of thermodynamics , which states that systems tend to move toward entropy . Carson is either lying about this or wildly misinterpreted the conversation he had , because there s no contradiction between the two , and there isn t a physicist on earth who would tell you that the solar system proves that God s hand was at work . But people who learn only a tiny bit about certain scientific ideas often become convinced that they ve happened upon a striking new revelation that all the so called experts have never considered before .
