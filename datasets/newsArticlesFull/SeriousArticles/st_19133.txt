The problem for the president is that the war he is waging feels like a long term strategy without benefit of the short term . If not ground troops , then what ? There is no good answer . This is a new kind of war requiring fresh approaches . The old templates don ' t apply because they actually work against us . As soon as we put boots on the ground , the Islamic State is rewarded with the war it wants , with the propaganda machine it can ' t otherwise replicate , and with the martyrdom its members welcome . Are Americans really ready to watch their military men and women beheaded and burned alive ?
