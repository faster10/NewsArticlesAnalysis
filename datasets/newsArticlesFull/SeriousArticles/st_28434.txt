First of all , Islamist terrorism is a fairly minor threat . Yes , the Paris attacks ( like 9 11 , Madrid , Mumbai , and countless atrocities in Iraq and Syria ) were a terrible tragedy . But we need to be realistic about how strong ISIS really is . It ' s true that decently organized young men with simple explosives and cheap automatic weapons can easily massacre hundreds of civilians and terrorize millions . But that is not even close to a " an organized attempt to destroy Western civilization , " as Jeb Bush ludicrously claimed . Compared to Nazi Germany , or the Soviets with their hundreds of long range nukes , ISIS is pathetically weak .
