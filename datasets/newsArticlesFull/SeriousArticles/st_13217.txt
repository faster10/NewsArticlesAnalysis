" I told Brady the same thing , previously to telling Belichick . I understand there are people out there . But I understand this really could be it and I wanted to tell both of them I really have enjoyed these games , " Manning said . " It ' s been a part of my football life . It ' s been good for me and not so good for me . Hey , Brady ' s going to play until he ' s 70 . Belichick ' s going to coach until he ' s 90 . Maybe I ' ll hit the fountain of youth sometime in the month and we ' ll play 10 more championships against each other .
