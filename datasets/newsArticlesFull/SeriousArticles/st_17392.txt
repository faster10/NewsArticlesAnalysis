However , it is important not to forget that the ECB did ease policy materially yesterday , and that this easing is taking place against the backdrop of a highly likely upcoming tightening of monetary policy in the US ( an expectation again supported by comments from Fed Chair Yellen yesterday ) . That is , while the theme of policy divergence suffered a blow yesterday , we do not regard that blow as fatal . We continue to think that Eur USD is likely to come under some modest renewed downward pressure in the period ahead , and we continue to target sub 1 . 05 in the weeks and months ahead . However , yesterday s developments leave us even more sceptical that the pair will see a sustained move below parity on that time horizon .
