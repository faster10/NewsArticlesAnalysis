We host clinics and camps to teach them how to use their wheelchairs so they can get out of their house . We use able and disabled volunteers to encourage them and give them hope . The Mexican government is trying to help , but doesn ' t have the financial resources or connections in remote areas to contact or help everyone . Many people in tiny pueblos have no electricity , dirt floors and cook using a wood stove . For a person with a disability to have a wheelchair is an unthought of luxury .
