While the Carolina Panthers finished the season with 15 wins and two more wins than the next best team , the Denver Broncos finished with the same record ( 12 4 ) as the New England Patriots and Cincinnati Bengals , and ended up with the No . 1 seed based on the tiebreakers . Both No . 1 seeds made it to the Super Bowl , but Denver has proven to be beatable , losing to Indianapolis , Kansas City , Oakland and Pittsburgh during the season . Carolina and Denver have only played four times in the teams histories , with Denver winning three times , including their last meeting in 2012 .
