Record label logic once ran that fame and celebrity helped to promote music releases . Nowadays , with conventional music revenue collapsing , music is frequently the byproduct of fame and the endorsement deals that come with it . While some artists have taken this as carte blanche to release any old nonsense and put a tour on sale ? a rather optimistic , if not short termist view , of the cycle of celebrity ? it is hard not to listen to Anti and deduce that Rihanna has taken a rather more productive view and decided , rather splendidly : I don t need anybody to buy this . I m going to do exactly what I want .
