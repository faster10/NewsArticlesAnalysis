Kimberling : I don ' t know when I began writing . I won a national award in high school for a short story about a character named Maudlin Lackey who commits suicide . I have since learned some restraint . I had been writing regularly for a couple of years already at the time . It ' s always been important to me , though , to do other things besides write to be something other than or in addition to a writer . So I ' ve worked as a Web developer and an English teacher and an editor and a frozen pizza stacker and so on , in the Czech Republic and Mexico and Turkey and England .
