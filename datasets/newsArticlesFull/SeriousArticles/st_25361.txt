All that changed under Obama . Evidence suggests that this is not a man who has ever doubted that the abortion rights position is both constitutional and ethical . As a state senator he voted " present " on a bill that would have compelled doctors to provide life support to fetuses that survived a termination procedure and were not expected to live . Obama argued that the language of the bill extended the legal protection to a " pre viable " infant and so would not be constitutional . ( PolitiFact notes that Illinois " already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus meaning able to survive outside of the mother ' s body then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion .
