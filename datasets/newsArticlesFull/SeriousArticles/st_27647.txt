As William Harkness ( 1837 1903 ) , then director of the U . S . Naval Observatory , said on the eve of the 1882 transit : " There will be no other transits of Venus ' til the 21st century of our era has dawned upon the Earth . When the last transit occurred the intellectual world was awakening from the slumber of ages , and that wondrous scientific activity , which has led to our present advanced knowledge , was just beginning . What will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives God only knows . Not even our children ' s children will live to take part in the astronomy of that day . "
