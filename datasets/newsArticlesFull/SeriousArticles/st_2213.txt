Prosecutors on Monday morning said the remains of a suicide bomber found at the Stade de France , north of Paris , matched the fingerprints of a person registered by Greek authorities as an asylum seeker in October . A Syrian passport in the name of Ahmad Al Mohammad , a 25 year old born in Idlib , Syria , was found with the body , though the authenticity of the passport must still be verified , they said . Another attacker , French born Samy Amimour , 28 , had been investigated for links to terror groups in 2012 and stopped from traveling to Yemen .
