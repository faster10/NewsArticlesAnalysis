? Out route catch and run to Kyle Rudolph for 24 yards : This late completion appeared to be essentially the game winner for the Vikings . Had the last field goal been made , criticism would have been directed at Kam Chancellor , the defender nearest Rudolph . Yes , the Seahawks were in their base Cover 3 ? with four shallow defenders in zone coverage ? but it was Cover 3 Buzz . This version on the defense s left side places Chancellor inside in the hook zone with K . J . Wright outside in the curl flat zone . When Vikings halfback Matt Asiata ran a short route to the inside ( in what most teams term a Texas route but the Vikings term an angle route ) , Wright from his wide zone jumped inside to cover Asiata . That left tight end Rudolph , running an out route , with advantageous outside leverage on Chancellor covering from his inside zone . Chancellor erred in playing the ball instead of the man , but this was a breakdown in zone coverage which will need to be adjusted against Carolina s savvy tight end , Greg Olsen .
