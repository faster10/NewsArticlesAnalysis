And maybe that is true ! ( From a pure " this is the way NBA basketball is most successfully played now " standpoint , I ' m pretty sure it is . ) But while some players get that , and while the number who do may be increasing , a great many just don ' t see the game that way . To them , maybe the breathless pointing to Effective Field Goal percentages , SportVU contested uncontested shooting data , clutch points produced per possession numbers and the like , alongside Zapruder film breakdowns of bad miss after bad miss and a steady stream of social media commentary about just how trash and washed and done AF Bryant is feels like piling on . Maybe it feels like unduly burying both a respected peer and a revered hero . Maybe it feels like an unwelcome preview of a worst case scenario for their own last days that they ' d really rather not think about , thank you very much .
