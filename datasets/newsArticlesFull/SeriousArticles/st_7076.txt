" I didn ' t expect it all , and I don ' t remember a standing ovation . I ' m shocked , was there really ? You ' re kidding me . I have to get a Tivo , " he said . " I did not expect to win at all so , I made a promise to myself that I would be very aware the whole time ? it proves I ' m not aware . I got really caught up in emotion . Thank you very much . Just the mere fact that these incredible people applauding , it makes me realize that in life , it ' s really never over ' til it ' s over , and it indicates that people should never give up trying , so I think it was a very , very positive message for everybody .
