" That grade puts him in the bottom 10 of all current Republican members of Congress , according to the group ' s executive director , Roy Beck . And , conversely , it puts him in the top 10 , as far as many Latinos are concerned . You see , it only helps build Ryan ' s " street cred " that he ' s not popular with groups that attract so many anti Latino nativists .
