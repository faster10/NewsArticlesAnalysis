What about injuries ? Well , this team hasn ' t just avoided them , they ' ve been pretty much blessed with a Super Mario Bros . invincibility star when it comes to injuries , as LeBron James pointed out . The Warriors also keep a close eye on their players , not just by asking them how they feel , but tracking them with biometric devices . Curry sat the entire fourth quarter vs . Denver , and while he would have returned if the win was ever in doubt , he still picked up rest . The team is good enough to win without a starter or two , if they stagger the rest .
