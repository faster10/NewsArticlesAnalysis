Ms Pauline Hagen , Principal of New College Pontefract has asked us to make clear that the kind of scholarship described is well established within many universities , schools and colleges and likely numbers eligible will be less than ten . The scholarship will be means tested and therefore arguably not " unethical " as the article suggests . The College will not give the scholarship to everyone that gets high grades . Students will have to meet socio economic and academic eligibility criteria . If and when the application is approved the eligibility criteria will be available on the website . The scholarships may be awarded in the form of financial support , resources and equipment , not simply cash , as the word ' bribe ' may suggest .
