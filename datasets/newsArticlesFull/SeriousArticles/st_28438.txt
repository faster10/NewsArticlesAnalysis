Does that mean it ' s totally impossible for some ISIS killer to sneak in with the refugees ? Of course not . But tourist , student , and business visas are far easier to get than refugee status , if you ' ve got the cash . That ' s how every single one of the 9 11 hijackers got into the country . If we were really concerned about ISIS infiltration , that would be the first route to worry about . ( Even more important would be sorting out the outrageous disaster zone that is the American security apparatus , but that ' s another story . )
