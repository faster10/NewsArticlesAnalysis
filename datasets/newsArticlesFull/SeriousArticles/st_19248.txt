There ' s a pattern here . Before the Newtown shootings , the Obama administration had not made enforcement of existing guns laws a political or policy priority as the Clinton administration did , which got it repeatedly butting heads with the NRA in the process . This may in part be connected to a political strategy implemented by then Rep . Rahm Emanuel in 2006 , when he courted pro gun Democrats as part of a successful effort to retake control of Congress , an experience he carried with him to his role as Obama ' s first White House chief of staff before being elected mayor of Chicago .
