KH : I train with Harley Pasternak . I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5 Factor diet . I first said , " I ' m never going to be nor do I want to be an uber athletic girl . " It ' s just not me and I don ' t have that kind of discipline . He said , " I just want you to be healthy . " A lot of what we focus on is posture . I slump into myself when I get stressed . If I were going to play an action hero , I ' d have to get that look . But I ' d never maintain it . For me it ' s never about achieving a look that ' s impossible . E mail to a friend
