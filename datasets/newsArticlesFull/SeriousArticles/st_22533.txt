Online shopping also has served to narrow the distinction between Black Friday and Cyber Monday . Retailers for the most part now offer the same deals online as they do in their stores . Plus , most large retailers like Best Buy and Target are willing to match lower online prices . All customers have to do is pull out their smartphones , see if Amazon or some other retailer has a better deal , then ask a cashier for the lower price . With technology making it easier than ever to compare prices and find the best deal , the exclusivity that defined both shopping days has diminished .
