Yusuf : That ' s true , and that ' s why we gave a sprinkling of those songs . When I want to see Paul McCartney , I ' d expect to hear " Eleanor Rigby " something from the past because there ' s something about that that we connect with , and a person becomes part of our life . And I am a part of a lot of people ' s lives , and my words have resounded in a lot of people ' s philosophies and the way they look at things , and that ' s great . Somehow , that ' s one of the reasons I took life and songwriting very seriously .
