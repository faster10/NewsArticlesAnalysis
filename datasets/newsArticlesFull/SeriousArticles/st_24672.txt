Note , however , that this process occurred selectively , provision by provision , and over seven decades . The first Bill of Rights protection to be applied to the states was in 1897 , when the Fifth Amendment ' s guarantee that private property was not to be taken for public use " without just compensation " was incorporated . Following that , the court incorporated free speech in 1925 , press freedom in 1931 , free exercise of religion in 1934 , and so on until 1969 , when it applied the protection against double jeopardy ( being tried for the same crime twice ) to the states .
