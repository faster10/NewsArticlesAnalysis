6 . When an ego less guy like Patriots director of pro scouting Bob Quinn works 16 years behind the scenes with his hometown team and then is hired as Lions general manager , as he was late Friday night , that s a feel good local story any way you look at it . At the same time , one can t overlook that this is a major jump from his role with the Patriots . To make a comparison , I view it as hiring a position coach with no coordinator experience as a head coach . That doesn t mean it won t work , but based on this dynamic , it might behoove the 39 year old Quinn to hire a trusted assistant who has been around the block a while .
