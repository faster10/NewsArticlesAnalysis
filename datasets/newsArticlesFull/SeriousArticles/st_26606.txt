On one internal estimate a third of Mr Modi s vote share in the Lok Sabha election of 2014 came from RSS supporters . Out of roughly 31 per cent vote share of BJP , 10 per cent are hardcore RSS supporters , said K . N . Govindacharya in an interview given to CatchNews in June this year . But if true , this also shows that support was more widely spread than the traditional bastions of Hindutva supporters . Narendra Modi rode the wave of revulsion against what voters were persuaded to believe was a manifestly corrupt and failing government on the back of a social bloc drawn from very different classes of Indian society . Large scale industrial capital was an early and strong pro Modi constituency , since it saw in him an extreme and authoritarian version of neo liberalism . Big business wanted him to scrap the rural resistance to industrial expansion and resolve the squeeze on resources by cutting subsidies to the poor . No less enthused was a sprawling middle class moulded by the consumerism of the nineties . Their nationalism , both strident and vacuous , lay in a different galaxy from the great vision of a struggling India depicted in Rossellini s documentary of 1959 Matri Bhumi . The post 90s middle class lacked solidarity with the vast mass of its own people . Just as crucially , it had grown up with a deference to all forms of authority and was easy prey to media manipulation . Also enlisted in Mr Modi s bloc was the vast army of deracinated jobless youth in villages , towns and cities who looked on the new superman as some messiah of employment , convinced there really was something like a Gujarat model that would generate millions of jobs . All of these diverse interests melded in the redemptive figure created by the TV anchors of a national hero who had moved beyond the circles of Gujarati chauvinism and beyond his tainted past to achieve national stature and perform miracles on a much bigger stage .
