Konnikova : Holmes is really a mindful detective , someone who knows the true value of observation , which means being mindful and in the present moment , really taking in your surroundings , really taking in everything . That type of approach permeates all of his thinking . He ' s not just aware of his environment he ' s aware of himself he ' s aware of the contents of his own mind . He has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks , what mistakes he is likely to make . Holmes puts it best when he says it ' s the difference between seeing and observing .
