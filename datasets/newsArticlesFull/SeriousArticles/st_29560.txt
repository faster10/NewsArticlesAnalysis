PH : I am not sure . There is still some dispute of whether Ammon Bundy actually made that statement or this is made by the attorney which I believe is a public defender . And it is not actually being retained by the family . So , there is still some controversy that the family is altogether confident that Ammon Bundy made that statement . And simply you have to remember some of these people are very committed . This isn t like the Occupy Wall Street this is a generational confrontation and conflict where the federal government has to do with the generations of family farmers , not just throughout the western states but all across the US . They are really shrinking , becoming an endangered species in part of society . So , this is a seriously committed issue for a lot of these people . And I think that the media underestimates this . One of their own the ranger LaVoy Finicum has been killed possibly unarmed , definitely with his hands in the air ? according to this one witness . That s huge in terms of people will rally behind that . It will harden the resolve in some cases . Let s hope though that this is not another armed confrontation and that no one gets hurt . That would be unfortunate . But in this case the federal government has escalated the violence . Because it has been twenty days , no injuries , no one has been killed . All of a sudden , days after the governor of Oregon Kate Brown said the federal government must do something to stop these trouble makers then this happens . So , clearly the federal government has been the one who has escalated the violence according to the reports that we have right now . ?
