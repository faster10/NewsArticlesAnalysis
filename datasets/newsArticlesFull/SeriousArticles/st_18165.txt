The Thind and Ozawa cases were not legal curiosities or mere exercises in obscure questions of jurisprudence . They denied and stripped away legal protections for entire groups , destroyed lives , the ability for a person to earn a fair wage , and to protect their property . Takao Ozawa killed himself after he suffered the ignominy of being denied by the United States Supreme Court and rejected by the country he loved . His suicide is a testament to the power of those legal decisions that ? tried to keep America a country that was white by law .
