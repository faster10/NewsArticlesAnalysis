When my husband was first in jail , the children were very young , she went on . We struggled to survive as a family , it was a very tough for us , but it s not surprising for people in political struggle . Now I look back and I am very proud of our family . We made every effort for the benefit of the people . And we got a lot of support from our neighbours . I have no particular hopes for my family but I hope things will improve for the township , and that they will get better education and health care .
