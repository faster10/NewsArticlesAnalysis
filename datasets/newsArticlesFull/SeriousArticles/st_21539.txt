The Redskins run defense showed improvement against the rush in the final stretch of the season , but on Sunday they looked much like the team that struggled against opposing running backs most of the season . Green Bay rushed for 141 yards on 31 carries and two touchdowns . The Packers relied on a steady balance of Eddie Lacy and James Starks , who each carried the ball 12 times for a combined 116 yards . The duo of Lacy and Starks provided good balance for the Packers offense . Combined with the Packers no huddle approach , it was a difficult day for the Redskins defense .
