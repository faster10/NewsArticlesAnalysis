If anything , it was Curry who looked like he was disrespected by James recently suggesting that Irving was on his level , sharing the title as the best point guard in the game . Not only did Curry overwhelmingly settle that debate , if you could even call it one , by outscoring Irving 35 8 , but he also scored as many points in the first quarter ( 16 ) as James did for the game , creating more supporting evidence for those who contend Curry already has wrestled best player in the world status away from The King .
