Of course , that s not what happens . The ghost of Vesper hangs over Madeleine and Bond s subsequent adventures , but Spectre doesn t really grapple with the idea that Bond was once genuinely in love . What is it ? Madeleine wants to know , when Bond discovers and lingers over a VHS tape labeled Vesper Lynd ? Interrogation . Nothing , Bond tells her flatly . After Vesper died in Casino Royale , Bond told M that The job s done , the b ? is dead , a line that tried and failed to use malice to disguise the depth of Bond s feelings . Bond s reaction to Vesper s name here has no such depth either in the scene s writing or Craig s acting . Over dinner on a very fancy train , we see Bond drinking dirty martinis rather than the cocktail he named after Vesper in Casino Royale , ? but that seems more like a sign that he s fickle in his drink orders than that he s actually found a new love .
