It is also because women today , so very articulate , poised , and educated , are not trained to enter the fray . Work can turn personal , raw , aggressive , and unfair , with little promise of applause or proof of performance for the tasks ahead . But handling all of this is synonymous with leadership . These are the terms of engagement , of relationships that go beyond great work skills and flawless logic . Great work skills , by the way , are something at which women excel , but they are too often tempted to hide behind their great work , rather than step out and be counted when situations turn messy and difficult and leadership is needed .
