" Greg Hardy practices hard , he plays hard and he plays well in games . Greg Hardy , just like every one of us , is a work in progress . I ' m a work in progress , our coaching staff is a work in progress , every player on our team is a work in progress . And I would probably make an argument that everybody in this room is a work in progress , " Garrett said . " So what we ' re trying to do is develop Greg as a person and develop him as a player , just like we ' re trying to do with 52 other players on our active roster , 10 players on our practice roster and every coach and everybody else who is connected with our team . We ' re going to try to do that each and every day to be the best versions of ourselves . "
