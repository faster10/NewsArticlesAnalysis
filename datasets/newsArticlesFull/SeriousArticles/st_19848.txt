Dudley Dudley is as surprised as anyone by her support for Sanders . The 79 year old broke barriers in New Hampshire as one of few female lawmakers in the 1970s , and most of her friends are backing Clinton . I expected to support her , until I heard Bernie Sanders speak , she says over popovers at a caf in Portsmouth , N . H . I will work very hard for her if she gets the nomination , but I m hoping that Bernie Sanders becomes President . Dudley , who made headlines in New Hampshire when she prevented shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis from building an oil refinery off the coast in the 1970s , is from the generation that made the first push to get women elected to office in large numbers . Her unusual name ? her first name plus her married last name ? became her political tagline when she ran for Congress with the slogan Dudley Dudley , Congress Congress ( she lost ) .
