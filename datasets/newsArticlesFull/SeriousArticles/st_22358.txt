Great architecture isn ' t just a building . Adenowo explains that to build a great building , you have to have an omniscient outlook . " You have to know history , you have to understand culture , sociology , anthropology . You need to know physics , you have to understand chemistry to a point . You have to understand art and the history of art to be a really good architect , " she says . " Good architecture is about the spirit of the age . If you look at a pyramid , it talks about one man ' s quest to be immortal . . . It ' s 4 , 500 years old and we still see them . We can no longer forget those pharaohs because of architecture . "
