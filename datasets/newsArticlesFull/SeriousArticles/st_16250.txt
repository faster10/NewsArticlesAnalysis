After that , everything I did was toward that end . I wrote songs constantly , pushing through the terrible ones to get to the merely bad , knowing experience was the only way to improvement . I went to underground rock clubs and made friends with the musicians . I did my first gig at 15 ? and recorded my first album at 17 . On that album , I covered an obscure Bowie tune called When I m Five , a song he d written in the late 1960s , sung from the perspective of a 4 year old boy . Despite being a seventh generation Texan , I sang that song and all the others on that album with a hint of a British accent . I kept going . Through poverty and squalor . Past obstacles and heartbreak . I kept going . I saw my path . I followed my North Star , Bowie .
