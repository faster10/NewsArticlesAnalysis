That Perry is swinging Democratic is no surprise : She was a staunch Obama supporter , both vocally and sartorially . And she s not the only prominent entertainer who s come out in support of Hillary : So have Lena Dunham , Kate McKinnon , Jennifer Lopez , America Ferrera , Ariana Grande and Ellie Goulding , to name a few . However , the specificity and confidence of Perry s political support ? her Instagram note specifically mentioned issues such as gun control , birth control , health care and equal pay ? is impressive . Fans aren t always thrilled when musicians get political , even in the abstract . For Perry to drill down and take a stance on pivotal , crucial issues is even braver , because it puts her squarely on the hook for resistance and criticism .
