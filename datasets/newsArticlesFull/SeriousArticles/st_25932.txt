One way would be to keep up what he has been doing over the past three weeks , when Newton has been among the best passers in football . Over Carolina ' s past three games , Newton has thrown a league high nine TD passes and put up an NFL best 83 . 4 QBR . He also has chipped in with 22 carries for 94 rushing yards and two touchdowns , throwing in 12 first downs as a runner . If Cam keeps that up , his numbers are going to get close enough to Brady ' s to start stealing away votes , especially if Brady ' s numbers decline without Lewis and Edelman in the lineup .
