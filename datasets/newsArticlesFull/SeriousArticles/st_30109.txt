" We take a calculated risk when spending time in nature ' s fold it ' s the wildlife ' s terrain , " Emily Mitchell ' s statement continued . " When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes , I clearly heard Taylor ' s voice say , ' please don ' t , this is their space . ' She wouldn ' t have wanted their demise , especially as a result of her own . She was passionate about animals , was an environmentalist , and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months . "
