Although police eventually shut down these demonstrations , the social and Internet infrastructure of the movement remained intact . People met one another over the course of the demonstrations , forged relationships online and continued working in their own ways . Different members in different places have chosen to concern themselves with particular problems . Those that resonate with others in the loose collective end up getting support from the various websites and Facebook pages already associated with the Occupy movement . While there is no " official " Occupy movement , when an effort gains support from enough of the trusted Occupy networks , it can be considered a de facto Occupy action .
