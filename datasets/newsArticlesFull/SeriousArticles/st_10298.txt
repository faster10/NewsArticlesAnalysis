First , we must recognize that there are no quick fixes . The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades . Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house . To subvert that culture will require vigorous , targeted and consistent training . That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias , encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de escalate encounters with members of the community , especially young people . Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles .
