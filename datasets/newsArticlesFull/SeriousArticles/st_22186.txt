US President Barack Obama has called for faster research on the quick moving Zika virus , which is spread by mosquitoes and has been linked to a rise in birth defects in Brazil . Obama yesterday urged better diagnostic tests and the development of vaccines and treatments against the virus , which the World Health Organization has said is likely to spread throughout the Americas . As of now , there is no vaccine or medicine to treat Zika virus , and no way to prevent it other than by trying to avoid mosquito bites .
