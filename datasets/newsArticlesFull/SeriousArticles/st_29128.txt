It all started around the turn of the century , when a girlfriend introduced me to Parachutes , the band s first album . Sure , there were some cliches in the lyrics , and my mom said the singer sounded like he was getting over a cold . But the melancholy songs and their spare arrangements worked their charms on me . I liked the way Chris Martin s gravelly , unconventional voice lent a sense of intimacy to the record . This was long before Coldplay songs became stadium anthems Parachutes was an album best listened to privately on one s Discman ( unless , of course , you were one of the lucky few who already owned an mp3 player ) .
