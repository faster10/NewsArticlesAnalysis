At least some of the credit for Cardboard s early success belongs to Googler Clay Bavor , who recently marked his tenth anniversary with the Mountain View , Calif . firm . Bavor has been leading the Cardboard team since close to the beginning , while running the product and design teams responsible for some of Google s most well known software , like Gmail and Google Docs . Bavor describes Cardboard s early difficulties , such as figuring how to interact with a smartphone that s stuck inside a paper box . Smartphones have so called magnetometers , which measure the strength and direction of magnetic fields . They re meant to help phones figure out which direction they re pointed in and make features like working compasses possible . So the team added metal magnets to Cardboard s hardware , then created software to interpret shifts in their magnetic field as a user s click .
