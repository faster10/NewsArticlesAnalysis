Hopkins : 6 1 , 218 pounds . As he s improved , Hopkins has also added weight to his lanky frame . It was part of the transition to becoming a football player rather than a basketball player , which he wanted to be for a time growing up . What s probably a more important measurement for his style , though , is his hand size . His high school had to special order receiver gloves in his size . From thumb to pinky , his hands measured at 10 inches at the NFL scouting combine . That , and the strength work he puts in on his hands help him make the one handed catches for which he s become known .
