All of these films have their place . Many are exceptional , moving and award winning pieces of work , but of those that I have seen , none pack the visceral , emotional and artistic wallop that Danfung Dennis ' documentary " Hell and Back Again " delivers , and all without any politics whatsoever . There ' s nothing , not one word of whether the United States should be fighting these wars , why we ' re there or who ' s to blame . This is an intimate film about then 25 year old Marine Sgt . Nathan Harris , his wife ( and high school sweetheart ) Ashley and the personal cost of war .
