Williams , after all , is widely considered the greatest women ' s champion in tennis history and is unquestionably the best player on the WTA tour right now . If you had to choose Williams or Sharapova to play for your life in this match , you ' d be wise to choose Williams . But even the all time greats lose once in a while . And a fit , confident Sharapova , despite those 17 straight losses to her non rival , is as good a bet as any to beat Williams at this Australian Open .
