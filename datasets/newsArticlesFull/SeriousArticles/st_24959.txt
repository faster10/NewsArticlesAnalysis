Many audiologists use the rule of thumb that your headphones are too loud if you can ' t hear someone talking loudly to you . For example , Robert Fifer , an associate professor of audiology and speech pathology at the University of Miami Leonard M . Miller School of Medicine , says : " If you can still hear what people are saying around you , you are at a safe level . If the volume is turned so loudly that you can no longer hear conversation around you , or if someone has to shout at you at a distance of about 2 or 3 feet to get your attention , then you are up in the hazardous noise range .
