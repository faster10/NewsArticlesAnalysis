Former U . S . President George W . Bush : " His strong voice for human liberty changed the course of his country and crossed continents . In the days of Communist rule over Czechoslovakia , he was viewed as an enemy of the state for ridiculing the pretensions of an oppressive government . The most subversive act of the playwright from Prague was telling the truth about tyranny . And when that truth finally triumphed , the people elected this dignified , charming , humble , determined man to lead their country . Unintimidated by threats , unchanged by political power , Vaclav Havel suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes . "
