Serving to stay in his last match of the year , Federer begins the game badly , going for broke with a forehand and flashing it wide . You can smell danger , you can hear danger , you can see danger , you can feel danger , and Federer then ends a lengthy rally with a tired slice into the net to make it 0 30 . Djokovic looked like he could trade blows from the baseline all day . Djokovic then pulls a forehand wide , but he earns two match points , the pressure telling , Federer netting a backhand volley . The shot that got him from Djokovic was a beauty . It s not quite over yet , Djokovic missing a forehand off a second serve , an odd lapse of concentration , but it s followed by a double fault from Federer ! Djokovic has won his fourth successive title here and that he s done so without much of a fight tells you how brilliant he is .
