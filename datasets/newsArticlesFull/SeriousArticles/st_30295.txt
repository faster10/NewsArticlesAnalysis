The choice is between " stakeholder capitalism " and " shareholder capitalism . " According to the theory of stakeholder capitalism , corporations are and should be quasi public entities with responsibilities to the nation state and to the communities in which they are embedded .

At the same time , workers who contribute their labor to the company have a legitimate interest in it as well as investors who provide capital . Managers serve the company and the country , not merely the investors .
