For Michigan State , the strength of their team has been quarterback Connor Cook , who is back at full health after injuring his shoulder and missing the Ohio State game . Cook has thrown 24 touchdowns and just four interceptions . The Spartans rank No . 4 in the Big Ten with 239 . 8 passing yards per game and tied for first with 26 passing touchdowns altogether . It seems that if Michigan State is going to hand the Hawkeyes their first loss , it will come at the hands of Cook and the Spartan passing attack .
