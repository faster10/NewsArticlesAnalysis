Lee : I think as country artists , it ' s really important to preserve the things that we grew up with . We ' re naturally outdoors men because of where we grew up , and keeping the rivers and streams clean is part of being country , and we ' re really proud of that . And Keep America Beautiful and their efforts in recycling and litter cleanup was really fitting for us , so it was a natural place to reach out not to mention , at our shows , there tends to be a few bottles and cans that build up .
