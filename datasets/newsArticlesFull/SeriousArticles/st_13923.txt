Couldn ' t gun software be hacked ? Perhaps , but the risk can be reduced by open sourcing code , requiring software patch downloads , and notifying gun makers or law enforcement if software is disabled . Open sourcing code is not foolproof , but it will build a community of lawful gun owners and code writers who value safety and Second Amendment rights . Enabling two way communication between guns and their original makers will help guns to be tracked beyond the initial sale , putting greater long term responsibility on gun makers .
