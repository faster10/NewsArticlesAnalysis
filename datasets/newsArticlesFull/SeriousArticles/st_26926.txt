The two clubs would trade zeroes until the 12th inning . In the 12th , Mets reliever ? Addison Reed ? allowed a leadoff single to Perez . The speedy ? Jarrod Dyson ? entered the game as a pinch runner for Perez and stole second base , the Royals fourth stolen base of the game . Alex Gordon ? hit a ground out to first base , which allowed Dyson to move to third . The next batter , Christian Colon , hit a line drive single to left field , plating Dyson to break the 2 2 tie . It didn t stop there . ? Paulo Orlando ? appeared to hit an inning ending double play to second baseman ? Daniel Murphy , but Murphy ? as he did in Game 4 ? booted the ball and no outs were recorded .
