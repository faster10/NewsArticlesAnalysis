Yes , modern presidents oversee a vast 21st century machinery of state whose operations touch almost every corner of American life . But they share executive authority with 50 governors and many government entities , such as the Federal Reserve system , are formally independent of presidential control .

He can nominate federal judges and Supreme Court justices , but they must receive Senate confirmation , and in any case serve for life in a proudly independent judiciary . He is the commander in chief , but the Constitution reserves to Congress the right to declare war .
