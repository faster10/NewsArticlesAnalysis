Going into the nominations , one of the biggest questions was whether the Academy would be willing to die historic on Fury Road , George Miller s relentless thrill ride starring Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy . And the answer was yes ! Mad Max : Fury Road took home 10 nominations , second only to The Revenant s 12 . So now that Fury Road has its foot in the door , can it translate that success into Oscar gold ? Or are the nominations themselves the reward for realizing such an uncompromising vision , 36 years after Miller s original cult classic with Mel Gibson . Don t be so sure : some prognosticators thought Miller and Ridley Scott would hinder each other s chances in the race for Best Director , splitting a bloc ? of like minded voters . But with Scott out , the road might be clear for Miller to win Best Director . And if Miller wins for Best Director , then Best Picture might be within reach , too . ? ?
