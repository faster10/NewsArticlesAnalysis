The president and his Department of Education deserve credit for keeping the heat on student loan and college cost issues , and not just at campaign time . Their most important move was probably the government takeover of the student loan market . As of July 1 , 2010 , all federally subsidized student loans about 80 of the total have been originated by the Department of Education . The deal ended billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies to lenders like Sallie Mae and , in theory at least , empowered the government to set repayment terms friendlier to student lenders .
