" If I asked you , ' What did President Grover Cleveland do with his budget ? What did President Benjamin Harrison do with his budget ? What was President Taft ' s budget ? ' you wouldn ' t know . Because 100 years from now , people won ' t think about budget fights so much . But they ' re going to know , 100 years from now , that America pushed through civil rights acts in ' 64 and ' 65 , America created Medicaid and Medicare . . . NASA sent a man to the moon . Big stuff that happens in history is being done by the federal government , not by people just carping about it all the time . "
