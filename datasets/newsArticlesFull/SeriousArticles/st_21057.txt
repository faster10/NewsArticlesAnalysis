No longer can the politicians ' race be conducted as if the populists ' race doesn ' t exist . If today ' s Iowa and New Hampshire poll numbers look anything like the future results of those states ' presidential contests , the bubbled existence of the politicians ' race will be the greatest self delusion in modern American politics . If they want to win , the leaders of the politicians ' race need to actively push Trump and Carson out of their way and find a way to attract their supporters . If the politicians don ' t fight for their party , someone else might just wreck it for them .
