" In some sense it even feels like you ' ve moved up for two reasons . Instead of having Pataki there , you have Chris Christie there , " Brabender said .

Chris Christie , because you don ' t know what he ' s going to say . Who would the news media rather cover ? Chris Christie or George Pataki ? It ' s like the class has improved . It ' s a better game to watch . "
