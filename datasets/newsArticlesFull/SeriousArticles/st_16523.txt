Means : We now have physicians who , five or six years ago , came through as students to learn about our program . And now , they ' ve graduated . They ' ve become doctors . And they remember what it was like to work in these shelters with us . And when we are looking to place a woman with a primary care doctor who understands what these women are living with , we can call up one of these former students and say : " Remember when you did your rotation at Rosie ' s Place ( a Boston Shelter ) ? Well , we ' ve got a woman here who really needs to have someone who knows her issues . And we ' d like you to take her on . " And they will . It ' s great .
