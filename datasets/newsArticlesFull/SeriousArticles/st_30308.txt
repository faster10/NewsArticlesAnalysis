To preserve the freedom of movement within its borders , to prevent a wave of far right governments from taking power ? to preserve , in other words , the EU itself ? Europe needs emergency measures . It must re assert control over its outer borders , create refugee processing centers at entry points , patrol its coasts . ? Compassion is vital , the victims of ? Syria s brutal war cannot be forgotten , and it may eventually be possible to resettle many of them inside the EU . But if Europe ? itself becomes dysfunctional , that will not happen , because Europe will be incapable of extending compassion to anyone else .
