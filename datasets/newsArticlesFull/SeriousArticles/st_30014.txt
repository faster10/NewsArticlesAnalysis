When you ' re a gay dad , you get the question , " Which one of you is the mom ? " I used to get offended by it , but now I just answer : I am . If you ' re asking me in the way that I ' m using the term " mom " loosely , then yes , I have fallen into those more mommyish kinds of roles . Don has fallen more into the daddyish roles , but that doesn ' t mean that he doesn ' t do bath time . But straight parents , too , any modern dad now is doing the same kinds of things . It doesn ' t really have to do with gay or straight anymore .
