We ve seen time and time again that Draghi has been able to surprise the market , and if he s able to do that today then yes , I think the euro can continue to go lower , Stannard said . But if he s unable to do that , because expectations have just moved so far , there is the potential for a short term rebound . Some market players think that there is a chance of short covering in the near term as selling the euro has been such an obvious strategy for investors . The market has been discussing this for more than a month so I would think any easing steps it may take today are already priced in and the euro could rise , said Masafumi Yamamoto , chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo .
