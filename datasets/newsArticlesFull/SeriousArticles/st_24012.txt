We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution . Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century , tempered by war , disciplined by a hard and bitter peace , proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed , and to which we are committed today at home and around the world .
