Brandon McManus kicked another 24 yard field goal in what s been his breakout season but overall this was one of Denver s weaker special teams efforts . Omar Bolden almost had a very costly mistake when he let the ball bounce out of the front of the end zone in the second quarter and punter Britton Colquitt had a rough game with a 39 . 6 yard average on seven punts , including a 25 yard shank late in the fourth quarter . Denver s special teams have been a strength all season but on Sunday , the offense and defense were both put in trying situations due to their mistakes .
