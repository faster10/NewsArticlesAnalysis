Married heterosexual couples can maximize their Social Security retirement benefits by taking advantage of the highest earner ' s benefit . When both spouses are alive , the lower earner can opt to collect a monthly benefit check that is equal to 50 of his or her spouse ' s benefit . For many married couples , that 50 spousal benefit is often much higher than what the lower wage earning spouse could collect based on his or her own earnings record . Most important , when the high earner dies , the surviving spouse is allowed to collect 100 of the deceased ' s higher benefit .
