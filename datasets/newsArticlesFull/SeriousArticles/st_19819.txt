The truth is that Spain is probably too broad a category here . Since 1997 only two winners of the Ballon d Or ? Pavel Nedved and Andriy Shevchenko ? have not either been playing in Spain or ended up playing there . In every case , their club was Real Madrid or Barcelona . And over the past seven years , the category could be reduced again . Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have finished first and second every year for four years and in six of the past seven years , albeit in 2008 Ronaldo was still at Manchester United .
