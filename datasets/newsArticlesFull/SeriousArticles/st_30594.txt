It happened again Sunday . Another crushing playoff loss , 10 9 at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks in an NFC Wild Card game . After teasing us all with a dominant defense that held the Seahawks scoreless for three quarters and two minutes , after building a tenuous 9 0 lead on the strength of three oh so solid , oh so straight Blair Walsh field goals , after Bud Grant came out onto the field in a short sleeve shirt , for crying out loud , the Vikings once again had their fans hooked . The script had been flipped there would be no repeat of Seattle ' s 38 7 rout a month ago .
