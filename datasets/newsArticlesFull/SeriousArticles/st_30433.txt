But if the guns are equipped with a bullet button , as the Wall Street Journal reports the San Bernardino shooters were , they re perfectly legal to sell . Instead of removing a magazine by hand , the shooter must press a recessed button that is only accessible using the tip of a bullet or another small tool . Technically , this does not classify as a detachable magazine , so the guns are allowed . In practice , the method still allows users to swap out magazines within seconds . Gunmakers began making bullet buttons after California passed its harsher gun laws , according to the Associated Press .
