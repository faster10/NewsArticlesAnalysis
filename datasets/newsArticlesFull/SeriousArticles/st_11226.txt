The driver , dubbed an " unpostman , " visits Outbox subscribers ' homes three times a week , flipping through a thick ring of keys to open the wide variety of entryways and mailboxes . He collects the letters , bills , magazines and advertisements that were deposited there by official postal workers and delivers them to a warehouse . There they are opened and photographed , and the resulting digital files are sent electronically to the recipient through the Outbox website or iPad or iPhone apps .
