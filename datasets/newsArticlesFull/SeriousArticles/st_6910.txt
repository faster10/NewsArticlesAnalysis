" Spectre , " the 24th James Bond movie , hits the ground running with a terrific tracking shot in Mexico City ' s Day of the Dead parade , but where it really runs is back into the steely arms of its predecessors . No other Bond movie embraces the traditions and tropes of the franchise the way this one does or so self consciously recycles characters , scenes and plotlines from the past . It ' s as if Bond was presiding over his own Day of the Dead , raising the ghosts of Sean Connery , George Lazenby ( a key figure , it turns out ) and Roger Moore and sending them into action with Daniel Craig against the ghosts of Dr No , Oddjob , Le Chiffre , Oddjob , Mr White and Ernst Stavro Blofeld ( and his evil white cat ) .
