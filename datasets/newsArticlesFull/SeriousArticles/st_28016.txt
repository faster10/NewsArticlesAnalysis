The clear winner last night , however , was Megyn Kelly . She wielded control over the candidates and her introduction to the immigration debate with a video of Cruz and Rubio supporting some pathway to legalization for undocumented immigrants was golden . Both Cruz and Rubio have tried to have it both ways on the immigration issue , supporting some pathway to legalization , while at the same time making hardline statements against " amnesty " . Of course , the two stances are different , but both candidates have relied on slights of hand depending on their audience to get away from taking a solid stance . Kelly ' s video laid it out for them and neither Cruz nor Rubio were able to wiggle out of their clear history of flip flopping on the issue . Kudos to Megyn Kelly .
