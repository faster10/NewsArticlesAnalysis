Precise lists of dozens of the materials used in centrifuge operation that should be sanctioned are already recorded for the Council in the reports of their Panel of Experts for the DPRK . Lists of related materials have also been developed by the Nuclear Supplies Group . To date the permanent five have sanctioned only a very few of the materials on either list . The Council also needs member states to strengthen export , customs and financial controls on dual use items that are " below grade " of those newly sanctioned items . This will stifle the North ' s ability to upgrade or jerry rig these hitherto unsanctioned items as a way of maintaining their program .
