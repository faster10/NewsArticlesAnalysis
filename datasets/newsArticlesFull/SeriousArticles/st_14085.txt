Play of the year : Chiefs rookie cornerback Marcus Peters , a native of Oakland and lifelong Raiders fan , may have been a little too fired up for the Chiefs game in Oakland on Dec . 6 . Peters , assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after Oakland took a 20 14 lead with a touchdown late in the third quarter , atoned for the penalty midway through the fourth quarters . With the score tied at 20 , Peters , playing in front of friends and family , intercepted a Derek Carr pass and returned it 58 yards to the Oakland 13 , setting up the go ahead touchdown in the Chiefs 34 20 win that extended Kansas City s winning streak to eight straight .
