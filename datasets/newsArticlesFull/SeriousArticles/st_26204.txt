This season the Eastern Conference has been deeper and a little better than the West ? and that was on display Monday night when the Bulls beat the Spurs , and the Hawks beat the Thunder . Two wins showing the East is for real . Pistons fans told me on Twitter they should be in the Monday night big win mix also , and while I like Detroit ( check out our discussion of them in the latest PBT podcast ) beating Houston is no longer impressive . Our man Dan Feldman was at that game in Detroit and wrote this first takeaway from that game ? what is wrong with Houston s energy level ?
