About the Patriots : ? After a 10 0 start , they dropped four of their final six games . QB Tom Brady was sacked 16 times in that stretch behind a depleted offensive line and suffered an ankle injury in the regular season finale . With his wide receivers also banged up , Brady surpassed 300 passing yards just once in the final seven weeks of the season . However the offense should get a boost if WR Julian Edelman ( foot surgery ) and LT Sebastian Vollmer ( knee ) make their way back to the lineup . Since RB LeGarrette Blount joined Dion Lewis on IR after Week 14 , New England ' s 30th ranked run game has averaged 75 . 3 yards per week . The Patriots ' 49 sacks trailed only the Denver Broncos ( 52 ) .
