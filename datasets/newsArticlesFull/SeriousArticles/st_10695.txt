Kathy woke to a thump upstairs , coming from one of the kids ' rooms . She listened closely , praying silently for rest . Each morning there was a delicate period , between six and six thirty , when there was a chance , however remote , that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep . But now there was another thump , and the dog barked , and another thump followed . What was happening in this house ? Kathy looked to her husband . He was staring at the ceiling . The day had roared to life .
