Darren Rovell , ESPN : Los Angeles was valuable because the threat of going there allowed teams to leverage their cities to the max . But . . . is it really the golden opportunity it has been made out to be ? . . . The Rams aren t exactly putting the best product on the field right now , having endured nine losing seasons in a row . That could be a tough sell in L . A . , whose residents are all about being at the in place . . . . Kroenke . . . had burned his bridges in St . Louis and was dead set on not returning . But what lies ahead is not , by any means , a guaranteed touchdown .
