I spent last weekend at the Le Mans MotoGP which was really cool . It was the first time that I have been to a MotoGP event and it is very exciting to watch . The racing is spectacular and the machines are unbelievable they are so fast ! But it is not something I would ever like to have a go at . The risk , for me , is just one step beyond what I would be willing to take to have fun , so I think I ' ll stick to my race car . It was amazing to meet Valentino Rossi and some other drivers and to watch their starting procedure .
