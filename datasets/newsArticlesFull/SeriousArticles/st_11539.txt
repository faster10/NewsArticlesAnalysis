This is far more relevant than Manning vs . Brady in determining Sunday s outcome . Just like most opposing coaches , the Broncos defensive coordinator doesn t have a good track record against New England s star quarterback he s 2 5 as a head coach and coordinator . Phillips , though , has arguably the most talented unit in his 30 plus years running NFL defenses to work with . Brady threw for three touchdowns without an interception against Denver earlier this season , but the Patriots converted only 2 of 13 third downs playing without top wide receiver Julian Edelman ( foot ) and while losing tight end Rob Gronkowski to a fourth quarter knee injury . Trying to stop Brady this time will be much harder for Phillips if Pro Bowl cornerback Chris Harris Jr . ( shoulder ) can t play with Edelman and Gronkowski both good to go .
