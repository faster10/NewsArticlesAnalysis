My decision to live at home was not one of absolute necessity . As a physician assistant , I make a good salary and would be able to live on my own comfortably if I needed to do so . By the time I finished graduate school , I had amassed a 150 , 000 debt from both undergraduate and graduate tuition . With several of these loans earning a 7 . 9 interest rate , my father calculated that my loans were increasing by 15 a day in interest alone . I was astounded . At this rate , it would take me 30 years to pay off my student loans , with much of it going straight to interest .
