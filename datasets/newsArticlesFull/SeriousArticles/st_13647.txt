It is tragic that two teenage girls perished in the Asiana crash . But given the conflagration that left the plane a charred hulk , it is remarkable that 99 of the passengers survived the accident .

During that period , more 3 billion passengers flew with no fatalities in the United States or on U . S . airlines . Two in 3 billion is a very small number .
