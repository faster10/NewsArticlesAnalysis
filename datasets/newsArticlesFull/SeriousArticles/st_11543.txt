Surprisingly , the state has not seriously invested in sinkhole science . Although the Florida Geological Survey does provide some key information , there is no clear coordinated research effort on Florida karst landscapes , the landscapes that foster sinkholes . A well funded sinkhole research institute at the University of Central Florida was founded after a huge sinkhole opened in Winter Park in 1981 , but it was defunded a decade later . The state has not reinvested in comprehensive sinkhole or karst research in any thoughtful or meaningful way since then .
