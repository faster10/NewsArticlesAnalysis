Republican complaints about the media are nothing new , of course . They ' ve been whining about the media for decades , in fact . But the CNBC debate seems to have been some sort of final straw , and now the candidates are determined to somehow stack the deck in their favor . However , their biggest complaint wasn ' t actually about the substance of the questions but rather the disrespectful tone of the questioners . Ted Cruz made lots of headlines for berating the moderators , but the question he was asked which set him off was actually a softball question or it could have been , if Cruz had just answered it . Cruz was asked ( admittedly , in a snarky way ) about his opposition to the budget deal that John Boehner had just worked out with the other congressional leaders and the White House . This should have been a moment for Ted Cruz to shine , since his entire political persona has been built on strenuous opposition to such bills in the Senate . It ' s not a stretch to say that the fame he has achieved by his filibusters and obstructionism is the main reason why he ' s even a viable presidential candidate in the first place . And yet he chose to completely ignore the question and just rip into the moderators .
