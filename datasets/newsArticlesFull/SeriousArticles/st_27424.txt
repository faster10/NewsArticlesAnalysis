LOOKING FOR THREE : Two time Australian champion Victoria Azarenka takes on Barbora Strycova among four women ' s matches in the bottom half of the draw . Azarenka won the Brisbane International and was one of the few leading players coming into the Australian Open without injuries . She ' s been helped by first round losses to No . 2 Simona Halep and No . 8 Venus Williams and No . 3 Garbine Muguruza ' s third round defeat . Azarenka has only dropped five games in three matches . " I ' m pretty happy with the way I ' m playing , " Azarenka said . " I want to still keep improving from match to match , because it ' s only getting harder from here . " A win for Azarenka would advance her to a potential quarterfinal against the highest seeded player left in the bottom half of the draw ? No . 7 Angelique Kerber , who plays fellow German Annika Beck .
