There ' s change on the top steps in Washington D . C . , Seattle and San Diego , and more ' s coming in L . A . , and the Mets , of all people , should know that baseball , like everything , doesn ' t always play to the script ( except in Miami ) . After all , it ' s why they , and not the Nationals , won the NL East . Why they , and not the Dodgers or Cubs , are here , two games into a World Series that hasn ' t gone at all as they planned . Why their leading men ? general manager Sandy Alderson and manager Terry Collins ? could hardly do anything right in their public ' s eyes for years , then rode around on the fans ' shoulders for a few weeks , and now have to do something to fix this !
