You can see the results here : the outsiders first Trump , then Carson ) rise , while the insiders fall ( note that Fiorina s rise and fall looks typical of insider ) . No news there , really .

What we re seeing here is not a tale of one or two candidates , although that s what it looks like What we re seeing is shift in perception of what it means to be an outsider .
