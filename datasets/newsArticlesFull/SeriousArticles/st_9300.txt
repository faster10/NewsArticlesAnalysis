That was then and this is now . We Americans of every stripe , gender and race are brothers and sisters in that great and ever changing experiment of democracy . We are not enemies . If someone has a better plan he or she should ascend to our presidency . If they have lied we should know it . If they are corrupt it must come out . But we cannot allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of fear and hatred . This election is about us working together to implement our brightest potentials , not our basest natures .
