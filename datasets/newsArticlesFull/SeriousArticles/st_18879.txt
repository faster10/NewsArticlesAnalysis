The only time the issue of violence against women does capture the world ' s attention is when it is related to active war zones , such as ISIS kidnapping Yazidi women or Bosnian women being raped during the Yugoslav war . Yet violence against women and girls goes on every day in every country , including those officially at peace . Complacency towards gender based violence is equivalent to accepting that sexual and physical violence is merely a way of life for girls and women . But allowing it to continue is as unthinkable as allowing ISIS to rampage and kill wherever it pleases .
