Cheney: Obama is "the worst president of my lifetime"
When former Vice President Dick Cheney looks at President Obama, he sees "the worst president in my lifetime, without question."Cheney, who spoke to Fox News' James Rosen in an interview published in Playboy, continued, "I used to have significant criticism of Jimmy Carter, but compared to Barack Obama and the damage he is doing to the nation--it's a tragedy, a real tragedy, and we are going to pay a hell of a price just trying to dig out from under his presidency."As tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to rise, Cheney told Rosen that the only way to change Russian President Vladimir Putin's behavior is "to rebuild the military. You're not going to be able to do anything long-term if your diplomacy's not credible, and your diplomacy's not going to be credible if you don't restore U.S. military capability - and we are going in exactly the opposite direction."Cheney also blamed Mr. Obama for the global spread of "Al Qaeda-type organizations," across the Middle East and North Africa, saying, "I think the threat is growing steadily, and I think our capacity to deal with it is rapidly diminishing." President Obama, for his part, pins the responsibility for the rise ISIS on the Bush administration, telling Vice recently, "ISIL is a direct outgrowth of Al Qaeda in Iraq that grew out of our invasion, which is an example of unintended consequences which is why we should generally aim before we shoot."
