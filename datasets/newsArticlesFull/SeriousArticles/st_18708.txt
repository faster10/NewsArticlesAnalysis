Universities often have on campus dormitories for fraternities or own the land under fraternity houses , allowing them to evict fraternities that don ' t follow school rules . But at U . Va . , the houses are off campus and privately owned . The university affiliation is tangential , with each fraternity signing an agreement that repeatedly states the university doesn ' t supervise them . In return , the fraternities get to use a student activity center and university server space , and , more important , adopt a formal relationship with the school required by most national Greek organizations .
