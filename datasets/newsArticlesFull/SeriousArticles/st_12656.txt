In the latest probe , it s difficult to determine what potential crime is being investigated , according to Bill Marler , a Seattle lawyer who has worked on food safety cases for more than 20 years and is representing about a dozen customers who got sick after eating at the Simi Valley restaurant . He also was unsure why federal authorities have jurisdiction over a case that appears to involve a single restaurant in California . There have only been a handful of criminal investigations into these kinds of food safety problems , and they typically involve products shipped across state lines , he said .
