As Wohlstetter explains , " It is much easier after the event to sort the relevant signals from the irrelevant signals . After the event , of course , a signal is always crystal clear we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has now occurred . But before the event it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting meanings . It comes to the observer embedded in an atmosphere of ' noise ' , i . e . in all sorts of information that is useless and irrelevant for predicting the disaster . "
