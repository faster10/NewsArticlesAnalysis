JL : Well , depends on what you ' re trying to do . Obviously , they re trying not to kill Syrians , they re very worried about collateral damage , and that this will hurt their reputation . What the U . S . is trying to do , really , is not destroy ISIS . They try to contain ISIS , keep it weak enough , so that it doesn t hurt Americans . I think President Obama has largely abandoned the notion that he s going to destroy ISIS and is pursing a very narrow counter terrorism campaign so that s what he is doing . Now , of course , many people expect them to destroy ISIS , because he said he would destroy it but immediately after saying those words , he began to say well , it s going to take many years , some people said almost 15 years . So , this is the problem , I think , of expectations . America is not trying to destroy ISIS within Obama s , you know , his administration .
