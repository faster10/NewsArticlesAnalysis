The ad is a distillation of the Trump pitch . It s a bouillon cube of Trump , the one message he wants voters to have in their minds when they go into the voting booth . Campaigns are about creating a need that only one candidate can fulfill . In this case Trump is the protector . Polls show that on the issue of terrorism , GOP voters trust Trump above all others . The ad is not about his ability to make great trade deals or increase wages . He s going to keep you safe . And if that wasn t already your concern ? terrorism is the top worry for GOP voters ? it might very well be after watching the ad .
