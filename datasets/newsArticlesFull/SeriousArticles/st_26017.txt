Through my job I was meeting and befriending a lot of amazing people . Talented artists , but also semi legal bands , dissident bands or dissidents themselves . I felt that the mood in the society was changing . There had been occasional small anti government demonstrations since 1988 . More and more people were speaking out against the regime . A lot of banned bands performed illegally in private garages , summer cottages and even publically under false names . Still , I could not imagine the communists losing power .
