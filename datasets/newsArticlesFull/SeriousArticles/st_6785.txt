" Politics is dangerous because people identify so closely with their beliefs . For my father in law , it wasn ' t just who he would vote for but a part of who he was , and if you disagreed with his political beliefs , it was like it was a rejection of him , " Smith said . " For some people , political beliefs become too much a part of their personality , who they are , and they can ' t separate them from a person . That ' s where we ran into trouble , because I truly wanted to get along with this man , even though I didn ' t agree with him on most fronts . I still wanted to have a loving relationship for the sake of our family . "
