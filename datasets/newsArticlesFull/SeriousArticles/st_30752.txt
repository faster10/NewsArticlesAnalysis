It should be a league so easy to discard . It just spent eight months trying to suspend one of its best players , Tom Brady , for allegedly putting too little ? air in the football . The process that culminated with the NFL getting its reputation stomped on in ? federal court for the third time in a calendar year . The episode was farce , but also tame in comparison to the league s other sins . In some cases , the game literally kills its players . Former players still have to pull teeth for fair health insurance .
