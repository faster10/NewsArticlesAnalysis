The notable outlier in the crowd on Wednesday was Michael Collings , a local tennis diehard who has worn an Australian flag cape , top hat and face paint to a number matches involving his countrymen this year and was happy to adopt Konta for the day . The face paint was the idea of his younger siblings , who he d brought along with him throughout the tournament . They loved it and so I just decided to keep doing it , he told Guardian Australia . With two non seeded players it was pretty interesting , he said moments after Konta had secured her win , but it was a really good match . Australians will definitely get behind her now that she s in the semis .
