To explain : In the early 1950 ' s , scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies , now called our " microbiome " help in fending off invading bacteria . They fed mice a species of a typical invader , disease causing salmonella . It took about 100 , 000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice . But when they first gave mice an antibiotic , which kills both good and bad bacteria , and then several days later gave them salmonella , it took only three organisms to infect them . This isn ' t a 10 or 20 difference it ' s a 30 , 000 fold difference .
