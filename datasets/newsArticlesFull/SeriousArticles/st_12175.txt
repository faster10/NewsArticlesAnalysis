Instead , what we saw was a very steady piece of sport telly . No longer pitchside , but still stood al fresco amongst the crowd dressed like an am dram production of ' On The Town ' ( Sinatra fans will understand ) , this new line up absolutely hit the stands running . Indeed , so seamless was it , the only mild controversy was the fact that Roy described it all as ' if anything , pretty boring ' . Which is fair enough . That can be how these games are sometimes . But you could certainly argue that at least what Pougatch did as a result was not choose to try and wring blood out of a stone . Taking his pundits through the procedure with no fuss or histrionics , this was very much a steady start for the new ITV line up .
