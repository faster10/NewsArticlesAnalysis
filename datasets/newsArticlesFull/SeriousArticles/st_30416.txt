Even Murray s clothing at this tournament taps into cooling technology favoured by Nasa for its astronauts . A voracious student of sporting excellence , he has studied the example of Djokovic , who made the final of every event he entered in 2015 bar one , and recognised that even his arduous off season conditioning work needed to be ratcheted up a level . Out went his annual Miami boot camp , with its emphasis on bikram yoga , and in came 10 focused days of pumping iron in Dubai . The season finished late for me , because of the Davis Cup , and I was lifting much heavier weights . I take inspiration from those around me , especially from what Novak is doing . It has been hard playing in an era alongside him , Roger and Rafa , so to catch up with them has been a huge challenge .
