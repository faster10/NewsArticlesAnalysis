This was the week that was in the NFL , a mild crisis when measured against the recent alternatives and yet one that inspired some legitimate questions , some more serious than others . What should be allowed when one man wants to party over six points scored at the expense of another ? Why do people seem to get more upset when quarterbacks celebrate than they do when wide receivers and pass rushers engage in similar stunts ? And why does it seem black quarterbacks get more grief for emotional in game responses than their white counterparts ?
