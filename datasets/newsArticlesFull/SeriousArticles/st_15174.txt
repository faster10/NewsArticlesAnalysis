Math was never my strongest subject , so maybe I m just not crunching the numbers right . But the more I stare at them , the less sense Marco Rubio makes According to odds makers and predication markets , he s the best bet . According to many commentators , too . But Iowa s less than a month away , and in two recent polls of Republican voters there , he s a distant third , far behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . So he s killing it in New Hampshire , right ? Wrong . A survey from two weeks ago had him second to Trump there , but another , just days earlier , put him in third place ? after Trump and Cruz , again . Chris Christie s inching up on him And as of Thursday , the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls in South Carolina showed Rubio to be more than six points behind Cruz and 21 behind Trump among that state s Republicans . There s no inkling of a surge , and it s not as if pro Rubio forces have been holding off on advertising that will turn the tide . Plenty of ads have already run .
