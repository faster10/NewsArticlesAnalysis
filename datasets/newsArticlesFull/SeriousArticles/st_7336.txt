Polls go up and down and most aren ' t worth the paper they are reported on . But if you gleefully report the bad ones then at least try to be fair when reporting the good ones . Instead Andrea Mitchell reported good news for Hillary in one poll and then added with apparent glee some bad news that Clinton was only tied or losing to Ben Carson in a national race . Never explaining to voters what she clearly knows , if national polling on hypothetical match ups was accurate before each Party actually nominated their candidate , Mitt Romney would be president today . These hypothetical general election polls are a total waste of time .
