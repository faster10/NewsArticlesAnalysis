The second bone of contention is the need to cap the rate of tax at 18 in the Constitution Amendment Bill . While it is important to ensure that we levy the tax with a broad base , low rate and less differentiated rates , to put a ceiling rate in the Constitutional Amendment is both undesirable and impractical . It is undesirable because it does not allow the Union and states to vary the rates as and when needed . This will erode the autonomy of the states further , and even the states ruled by the Congress party will not agree to this . It is impractical because if the revenue neutral rate is higher than the ceiling rate , then both the Union and states will lose revenue . With total tax GDP ratio of just about 16 . 5 , under recovery on account of this reform will either aggravate fiscal imbalance or will eat into the capital expenditure , which is clearly undesirable .
