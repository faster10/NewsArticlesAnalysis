Storm : Every burn has its own personality . It goes in its own direction . This hand got swollen and got infected . Infection is your No . 1 enemy with burns . . . . This then got a fungal infection . So this hand really went through the wringer and was pretty . . . double the size and really , you know , monstrous looking . Every burn on my body has had its own different personality . And all of them needed different things . So I got this cream ( that ) went here , and this hand needed this , and this hand needed that . My youngest daughter , Riley , because there were so many different lotions and types of bandages and wraps . . . she actually took sticky notes and organized everything . Just taking care of that and taking care of the wounds was pretty much all I could do . It was so time consuming .
