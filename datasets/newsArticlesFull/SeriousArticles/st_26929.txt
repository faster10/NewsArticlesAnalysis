The mayor ' s press shop did send out word that Emanuel stopped by a Sunday afternoon ribbon cutting at Washington Park , but only after the event had concluded . And on Thanksgiving , the mayor ' s press operation let reporters know that Emanuel had taken part in a 5k turkey trot , including how he finished in his age group , gender group and overall . That information , too , was released after the event was over , so journalists did not get a chance to attend and try to ask Emanuel questions about the city ' s pressing issues .
