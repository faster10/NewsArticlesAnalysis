We definitely fought back , Brook Lopez ( 18 points , 8 boards ) said . We ve got to make those glimpses , turn them into consistencies in our identity . We turned the ball over a couple of times during that stretch as well . Center Marc Gasol led the team with 22 points . Curry came through in the fourth quarter with two three pointers after Toronto took a 98 95 lead and started believing an upset was in the making . Stephen Curry s one handed runner off the glass in transition evened the score at 76 with 2 : 10 left in the third . Plus he has a great team . He doesn t have to go out there and do it all the time .
