Donald Trump ' s attempt to woo black voters was fundamentally flawed from the start because he assumed that the black community is monolithic . However , there is no monolithic black community or black church . Notwithstanding attempts to portray blacks as a single race , ethnic group or culture , the black community is full of divergence and difference . Our community is full of the prophetic , the pathetic and many shades of grey . There has never been and won ' t be a single black leader . There have always been and will be multiple leaders . The idea that a single black personality can speak for and organize all blacks is a persistent myth perpetrated by both liberal and conservative whites .
