Putin has argued , and he may have a point here , that Assad s military is the most capable force for fighting IS or any other extremist group that has carved out strongholds and territory in Syria and Iraq , and therefore needs to be strengthened .

If there is oil beneath that land it will be a dark day in hell before it can be siphoned up for sale for any monetary gains .
