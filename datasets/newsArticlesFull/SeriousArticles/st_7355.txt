The countries that are party to the agreement ? including ? Australia , Brunei , Chile , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Canada , Peru , Singapore , ? Vietnam , ? most critically Japan ( and , potentially , South Korea ) ? are some of the United States ' biggest and fastest growing commercial partners , accounting for 1 . 5 trillion worth of trade in goods in 2012 and 242 billion worth of services in 2011 . They are responsible for 40 percent of the world ' s GDP and 26 percent of the world ' s trade . That makes it roughly the same size as the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , another ? huge trade agreement that got rolling ? this past summer . The hope is that more countries in the region will join down the line .
