5 . We will come to miss Newt Gingrich . One of the real joys of the 2012 race was covering the campaign of " The Newtster , " a man with a chin for every insult he delivered . He jumped to the front of the nomination pack in early 2012 partly because GOP conservatives had few other options ( one South Carolina operative described him to me as " an imperfect vehicle " ) but also because of the sheer strength of his personality . And while the rest of the party limited itself to discussing petty matters such as health care or the federal budget , Newt ' s plans ranged from getting school kids to work as janitors to building mines on the moon . He seemed genuinely surprised that the cash strapped voters didn ' t buy his idea of conquering the galaxy , but a prophet in his own land is always without honor . In a hundred years time , when the American colonists of Sirius 3 are still debating gun control , don ' t be surprised if Newt isn ' t revisited as a man before his time . Perhaps he ' ll make the back of the 10 , 000 bill .
