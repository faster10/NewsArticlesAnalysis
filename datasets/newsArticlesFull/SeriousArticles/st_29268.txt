Remember , the outcome of these games are a two sided affair and Kelly s 280 yards passing , 81 yards rushing , and 4 total touchdowns were a few of the main reasons Ole Miss was able to keep the Tigers at arm s length the entire afternoon . The only reason Tyron Johnson scored from 39 yards out was because the Ole Miss secondary had a breakdown and left him free to walk into the end zone . If not , appoint Ed Orgeron the interim head coach for the game . It s a battle of two of the best players . I wanted that challenge , followed him the whole game . It s going to happen when you re going against one of the best .
