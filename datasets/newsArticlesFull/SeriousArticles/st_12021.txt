In " Spectre " there ' s a scene in which Bond needs information about the Italian mobster he has killed in the Mexico City prologue . Monica Bellucci plays the imperious widow . She cannot resist Bond ' s advances because the script says so , and he gets what he needs by way of a stone faced bout of contempt copulation . No double entendres . No smirks . No blow up dolls disguised as pin ups , masquerading as human females . On the other hand , there ' s not much of anything going on in this scene . It ' s nasty , brutish and short .
