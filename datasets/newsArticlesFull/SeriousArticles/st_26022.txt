Chris Paul ' s mastery of the point guard position , his patience , his will to win ( the closest thing to Kobe ' s in the game ) , his passing , his shooting , his control , his awareness , it ' s all special . Blake Griffin continues to be underappreciated for how versatile and smart his game is . His mid range jumper is a legit weapon after years of refinement , his passing is a gift few notice , and he ' s an ox . The Clippers have playmakers and shot makers and savvy legends like Paul Pierce and surprising young guys like Austin Rivers ( who really is decent now ) and screwballs making the best of their years .
