Call it what it is . Your kids should know the video depicts domestic violence . Many kids won ' t know what this means . Explain that it is when people in an intimate relationship become physically violent or emotionally cruel to their partner . There are any number of potential reasons : Ray Rice and Janay Palmer appeared to be involved in a heated argument maybe he has a short fuse maybe it was some other reason altogether . None of this matters . There is nothing a person can say or do that would make it OK to hit that person . Hitting a spouse , a partner , is unacceptable it ' s never justified . It ' s assault and is against the law .
