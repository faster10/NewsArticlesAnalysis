Our tradition is eating plum pudding and hard sauce , which is a topping made of butter , sugar , and alcohol . While my sisters and I were growing up , my Irish mother always bought a particular brand of pudding . When the company stopped making it , we tried other versions , but nothing tasted right to us . Mom experimented until she came up with a recipe that was reminiscent of the original . Nowadays , we live far apart from one another , but one thing we all do during the holidays is whip up her matchless holiday treat . Maura Diehl , Orefield , Pennsylvania
