THINK YOU KNOW ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ? YOU HAVEN T MET THE LESSER KNOWNS . The debate calendar has included as many as 22 candidates in the 2016 cycle . But on Tuesday night , another 23 got their moment in the spotlight , debating each other at the Lesser Known Candidate Forum at St . Anselm College in Manchester . The debate , which was carried live by C SPAN , has been in place since 1972 , serving to highlight the dozens of fringe candidates that run alongside more well known politicians , according to ABC s BRAD MIELKE . In New Hampshire alone , where it only takes a 1 , 000 and a few signatures to enter a party s primary , the ballot will include 28 Democrats and 30 Republicans . http : abcn . ws 1RyRlkC
