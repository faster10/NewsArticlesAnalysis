Once I was invited to lunch by former Prime Minister Edward Heath . Thatcher had defeated Heath to become head of the Conservative Party in 1975 . Heath hated Thatcher . He never referred to her by name during lunch . Instead he referred to her as " that woman . " He had invited seven of us as guests , including pop singer Bob Geldof . It was a sunny summer afternoon . We ate lunch out on the terrace of Heath ' s garden at his beautiful Georgian house in the country town of Salisbury , Wiltshire . Conversation ranged over Northern Ireland , European politics and music .
