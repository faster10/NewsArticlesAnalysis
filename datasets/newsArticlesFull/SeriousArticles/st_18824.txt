POLITICO SETS ITSELF ON FIRE IN ULTIMATE ATTEMPT TO WIN MORNING Michael Calderone , Sam Stein and Grim : " Politico CEO Jim VandeHei and chief White House correspondent Mike Allen will leave the news organization they helped launch nine years ago and built into a politics and policy juggernaut . VandeHei told staff Thursday that he was departing after the election and that Allen , chief operating officer Kim Kingsley , chief revenue officer Roy Schwartz and executive vice president Danielle Jones would also be ' seeking their own new adventures ' late this year , confirming an earlier HuffPost report on the shake up . . . VandeHei , meanwhile , has expressed interest in moving back to Wisconsin and running for office , a well placed source said . . . But rumors of tumult have been rampant for some time , mainly centered on Susan Glasser , whose tenure as top editor began in fall 2014 with significant turnover and who has been expected to leave the top newsroom job and move to Israel after the election . Her husband , New York Times reporter Peter Baker , is in line to become the paper s next Jerusalem bureau chief . In a separate memo , Allbritton wrote that Glasser would continue to run the newsroom through the year before joining her husband in the Middle East . He said Glasser will become director of editorial innovation and continue to play a key role in the newsroom from abroad . " HuffPost
