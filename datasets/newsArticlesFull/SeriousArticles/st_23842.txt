Point guard : It ' s likely smart to add Marcus Smart at some point soon . Even as the Celtics ' deep rotation limits the scoring ceiling for Smart , only four players averaged more than 1 . 9 steals last season , the rate Boston ' s combo guard is currently enjoying . . . . If you have any inside info on why Mario Chalmers is NBA Jam " on fire " of late , please do let us know . But really , Chalmers isn ' t likely to sustain worthy production , but is worth a flier in deeper leagues until he cools off . . . . It ' s about time to stash Tony Wroten and Brandon Jennings , as they return from respective injuries . We like Wroten more given the huge minutes and exposure ( Wroten was top 15 in the NBA in usage rate last season ) we can expect from a thin Philly backcourt .
