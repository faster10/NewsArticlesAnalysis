These are not the kind of people we traditionally think of as heroes in sports , technology , and politics . Compare Jeremy Lin , Mark Zuckerberg , and Barack Obama to , say , Michael Jordan , Steve Jobs , and Bill Clinton . Jordan , Jobs , and Clinton were stars in their own right . Their campaigns and their victories were about themselves . It was Jordan who made the dunks , Jobs who showed us the iPhone , and Clinton who made his presidency about himself . Lin , Zuckerberg , and Obama , on the other hand , are rather underwhelming as tribal leaders . They are leaders of the Net generation , who owe their power to the networks they can catalyze .
