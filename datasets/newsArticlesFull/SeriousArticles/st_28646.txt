Cruz and Trump are , reasonably , lumped together ? as the ? outsider candidates , yet it s difficult to imagine two more different human beings . Whereas Trump embraces his wacked out opulence , Cruz is dorky in a believable way . His light blue sweater is rumpled and doesn t quite fit right his blue jeans are a little too wide and a little too high his pant cuffs hang sloppily over work boots . ( Cruz looks like one of Trump s accountants , albeit the one who is secretly orchestrating his boss downfall behind the scenes . ) The contrast between Cruz and Rick Perry , who gave Cruz his introduction at the Ottumwa town hall was jarring , Perry with his bomber jacket and his Joe Maddon glasses and his haunched swagger , Cruz with his wonkish inability to quite look normal . He s not charming in the way Perry is , and his attempts to come across as a regular person are the one flaw in his matrix . He has a bad habit , his tell : Right after delivering a line he believe has scored ? which is generally every one of them ? he bites his bottom lip and emits a silent click of a giggle , with a little hop that seems to be his internal voice saying , Nailed it ! It sometimes makes him look like a Muppet Babies version of a supervillain .
