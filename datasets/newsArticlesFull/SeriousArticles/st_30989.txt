In Game 7 , Herzog opted to start Tudor , who had held the Royals to one run over 15 2 3 innings to that point , on three days ' rest rather than the unpredictable Andujar , who had been roughed up in Game 3 , on four . The move backfired , as Tudor surrendered a total of five runs in the second and third innings . Two came via a homer by Darryl Motley , one when Tudor walked Sundberg with the bases loaded ( his third walk allowed that inning ) and the last two when Balboni greeted reliever Bill Campbell with a single . The game was all over but the shouting , almost literally after Jeff Lahti surrendered four more runs in the fifth , Herzog put Andujar into the game , and all hell broke loose :
