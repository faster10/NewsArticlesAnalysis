At this point , it is worth rehearsing the FN ' s history . The anti semitic and racist outbursts , and general extremism , of its founder and president Jean Marie Le Pen had put a ceiling on the party ' s support . Marine Le Pen sought to break that ceiling by moving away from racist rhetoric and social issues ( except immigration and crime , of course ) and embracing a populist , anti globalization , pro government message on economics . This strategy came to a Shakespearean height when Le Pen p re gave interviews to fringe far right magazines with outspokenly racist comments , and Le Pen fille decided to not only remove him from his honorary chairmanship , but have him expelled outright from the party he founded . ( " It is never pleasant to be murdered by one ' s own daughter , " Jean Marie dryly commented at one point . )
