As long as I managed to avoid the house catching on fire , and the girls didn ' t come down with malaria , at the end of the weekend , my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps , like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one hour dramas ( you know , after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame ) . Then my family and friends would have declared that I had done my best , and nobody would have cared that the bar had been set so low that a chipmunk could have done as well .
