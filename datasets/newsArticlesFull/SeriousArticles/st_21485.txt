Dr Tariq Hasoon , national medical director for International Medical Corps Iraq , said of his involvement in this mission : " Today , I look back at the Iraqi health system and compare it to what I knew a decade ago , and I am amazed at the progress we have made . The most remarkable advances have come in the strategy and planning and the skills of the people running the system . International Medical Corps has played a vital role in that transformation . For example , we introduced a nationwide emergency medicine strategy , which has significantly improved the survival rates of injured people in need of paramedic and emergency room care . "
