( JA ) : Yes . But you can tweak your training to be more stunt focused . The real difference between martial arts or real combat and screen fighting is that real fights are shorter . But in on screen fighting you want to extend everything so the audience can see the extension of your techniques . So , a lot of moves are exaggerated . And then there are reactions . In action you have to be able to deliver good technique and give good reactions , because reactions make your opponents ' actions look more powerful .
