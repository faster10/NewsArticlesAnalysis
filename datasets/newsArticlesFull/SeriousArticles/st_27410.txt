As a cub reporter , I had the privilege of watching Steve Jobs pitch the Pixar movie " Monsters , Inc . " to a handful of journalists in a small room . It was the best sales presentation I ' ve ever seen . While it was happening , I wanted to do anything Jobs asked , because he was able to seem like he didn ' t care what we thought of him . He was unshaven , wearing his cat burglar ensemble . He never tried to kiss up to any of us , like movie people often did . There were no visual aids , no refreshments . He just fulminated about what a good movie it was , how major its advances in animation technology , almost as if we weren ' t there .
