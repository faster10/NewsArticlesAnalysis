Last year , with 20 opportunities the Oscars still couldn ' t come up with a single black , Hispanic or Asian performer to honor . And although critics remarked on how hard that must have been to do , this year voters did it again . True , only idealists were really expecting nominations for the cast of " Tangerine " or " Chi Raq . " But Idris Elba certainly deserved a supporting actor nod for " Beasts of No Nation " just as much as Tom Hardy did for " Revenant , " and the success of " Concussion " relies just as much on star Will Smith as " The Martian " does on star Matt Damon . How could there be a sentimental salute to Sylvester Stallone for " Creed " but no acknowledgement of ? Newark ' s Michael B . Jordan as the title character ? No room in the supporting category for Samuel L . Jackson in " The Hateful Eight " or Benicio Del Toro in " Sicario " ? Thanks , voters . You just gave Chris Rock his opening monologue .
