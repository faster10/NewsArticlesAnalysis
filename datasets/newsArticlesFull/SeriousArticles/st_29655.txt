The highly anticipated November 8 in Myanmar is less than a week away , and election watchers are keenly interested to see if pro democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi ' s National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party wins in a landslide as it did in 1990 , or if the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) , populated with retired military officers and former junta officials , maintain power . The election represents another critical milestone in Myanmar ' s transition toward democracy , but the day itself will not be the ultimate determinant of whether Myanmar will progress ahead democratically or slide back into a more militaristic or " disciplined " governing structure . The real test for those who win seats in November will be to ensure that all stakeholders including the military are empowered to work within the system and cooperate , despite differing views and skepticism of one another , to maintain the country ' s political and economic trajectory . With more than 90 parties and thousands of candidates contesting the election , that may be a difficult task .
