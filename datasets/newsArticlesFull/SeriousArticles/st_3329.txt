Key player : Von Miller didn ' t have a huge divisional round game , but he ' s still the key to the Broncos defense . Miller , who had a sack against the Patriots in the first meeting but didn ' t have a huge impact overall , will be a focal point of New England ' s protection on Sunday . Miller had 11 sacks this season , has 60 in his five year career , and a big AFC title game wouldn ' t be bad for him before he ' s slated to hit free agency . The Patriots ' offensive line has had protection issues , especially late in the season , although Brady was not sacked against the Chiefs and rarely touched . Miller is the kind of player who can take over a game .
