" Lincoln " brilliantly dramatizes the delicacy of politics , along with the raw brutality of it . All that ' s pushing the amendment forward is Abe Lincoln ' s will , his ability to do anything even flirt with impeachable deceptions to fulfill his vision of justice . And that ' s why he spends the movie alone in spirit . When he bangs his hand on the table , roaring at his lobbyists to procure him the votes he needs because he ' s ' ' clothed in immense power , ' ' we ' re seeing the birth of the presidency as we know it a force that can shape the consciousness of the world . Lincoln is a stirring paradox , a dream of history as it might truly have happened .
