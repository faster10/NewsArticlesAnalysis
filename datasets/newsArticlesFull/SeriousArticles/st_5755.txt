Best individual matchup : Alabama wide receiver Calvin Ridley vs . Clemson cornerback Mackensie Alexander . Ridley has helped fill the massive void left by All American Amari Cooper , leading the Tide in receptions ( 83 ) , receiving yards ( 1 , 031 ) and receiving touchdowns ( seven ) while breaking Cooper ' s freshman receiving yards record . Since Alabama ' s Week 3 loss to Ole Miss , Ridley has led the team in targets in 10 of 11 games . He faces one of the nation ' s most complete cornerbacks in Alexander , a master tactician ( and smack talker ) who contained Sterling Shepard in the semifinal after being assigned to the Oklahoma star wide receiver . There ' s no doubt Ridley will be Alexander ' s top priority in the title game .
