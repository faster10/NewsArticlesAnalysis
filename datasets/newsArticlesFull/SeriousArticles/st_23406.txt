CC : I think it ' s becoming harder and harder . So many designers are coming out of schools trying to launch their own brands , and it ' s hard for them to stand out from the crowd . Once they have found their brand identity it isn ' t over , they have to be able to keep it fresh and renew it for every collection almost four times a year . This is why I am so impressed with designers that have been in fashion for decades , and have managed to reinvent themselves without losing what identifies them .
