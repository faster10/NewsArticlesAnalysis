Several GOP candidates had some , er , odd ways of speaking to influential members of the GOP Jewish community yesterday at the Republican Jewish Coalition forum . Donald Trump told the crowd I m a negotiator like you folks and Is there anyone in this room who doesn t negotiate deals ? Probably more than any room I ve ever spoken . And he suggested : You re not going to support me because I don t want your money . ( The ? Times of Israel ? even offered the headline : Trump Courts Republican Jews With Offensive Stereotypes . ) Then there was John Kasich , who proclaimed , When I was a very young man , my mother said , Johnny , if you want to look for a really good friend , get somebody who s Jewish . And Jim Gilmore , who thought it prudent to tell the crowd : Last night I was watching Schindler s List . Everybody here has seen Schindler s List . It s one thing to pander , but to make sweeping and even in some cases offensive stereotypes about an entire room full of people whose vote you re courting ? Huh ?
