You wanna know my problem with Donald Trump ? It ' s not that he ' s angry ? I ' m angry . It ' s not that he ' s politically incorrect ? I kinda like that . It ' s not that he ' s a billionaire , or that he ' s not an elected politician ? whatever . It ' s that he ' s a fraud . This is a guy who inherited 40 million from his father and presents himself as a self made man . This is a guy who used government to kick a widow out of her house to build a limousine parking lot . This is a guy who ' s dealing with multiple lawsuits about him opening an online university that made 40 million fleecing people out of tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for no degrees . This is a guy whose multiple corporate bankruptcies no doubt left thousands of everyday Americans without jobs , but left him rich . And this is a guy who says he doesn ' t have to ask God for forgiveness ? for anything . And you want me to believe he cares about everyday people , that he cares about the issues he talks about ? that I care about ? That he cares about people who live paycheck to paycheck , like my parents , like I grew up ? I ' m not buying it . I ' m angry too , and I ' m running because I want to fight every day for hard working Americans who have been screwed by our incompetent government ? and by rich , pathetic con artists like Trump . I ' m Marco Rubio , and you better believe I approve this message .
