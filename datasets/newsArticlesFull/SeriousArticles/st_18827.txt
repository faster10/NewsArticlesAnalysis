NO RICK SNYDER ON THE HILL Weird . It ' s not like Snyder hasn ' t been talking about Flint every day . Kate Sheppard : " The House Oversight Committee will hold a hearing on the water crisis in Flint , Michigan , on Feb . 3 . But the list of witnesses does not include Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder ( R ) , an omission that some are calling inexcusable . The oversight committee has called a hearing for next Wednesday at 9 a . m . focusing on violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act in Flint . The Flint water crisis came as a result of officials in the Snyder administration telling city officials not to use corrosion treatment after the city began pulling drinking water from the Flint River . The water then corroded the city ' s pipes , causing lead contamination . State officials dismissed complaints from Flint residents about the water quality for over a year . " HuffPost
