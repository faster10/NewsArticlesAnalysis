None of this means that any particular outcome is guaranteed . But it ' s time to discard the idea that Trump can ' t be the nominee because there ' s some portion of the Republican electorate that will never , ever support him . That may even be true of the " establishment " figures who have been racking their brains trying to figure out how to stop him . If the race really does come down to a choice between Trump and Ted Cruz , more than a few will conclude that for all his weaknesses , Trump has a better chance of winning the general election than an ideological warrior who would probably do as well as Barry Goldwater did in 1964 at least Trump might stand a chance of pulling over some Democrats . Then you ' ll hear them making that case , and lots of Republicans could conclude that Trump ' s nomination is their best option .
