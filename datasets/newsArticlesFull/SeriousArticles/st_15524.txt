An independent panel appointed by Gov . Rick Snyder determined that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality was primarily responsible for the water contamination because it failed to require Flint to treat its water for corrosion after switching from Detroit ' s system to the Flint River . A final report is expected early this year . The task force last week recommended that the state ask the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help assess an outbreak of Legionnaires ' disease in Genesee County that some experts suspect is linked to the water . At least 87 cases , including nine deaths , were confirmed during a 17 month period .
