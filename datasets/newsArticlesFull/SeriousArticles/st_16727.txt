Analysts say a bailout is not likely to affect Irish citizens directly but will have beneficial effects nonetheless . " All it ' s going to do is keep the banks going , " said Peter Morici of the University of Maryland . " It ' s not going to change the objective conditions for the average Irish people . " But Allan Timmermann , who holds an endowed chair of finance at the University of California San Diego , says a bailout will make life easier for ordinary folks because the aid might lessen the severity of service cuts the government will need to make . " If you imagine that there ' s no bailout , the measures that Ireland would have to take in terms of cutbacks would have to be much more drastic . "
