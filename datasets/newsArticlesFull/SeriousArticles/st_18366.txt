The " EQ " Factor . Hillary is no Bill Clinton , and Jeb is no George W . Bush . Both the 42nd president and the 43rd had a special gift of being able to relate to voters . They were likable , and both genuinely seemed to enjoy being around people . They were polarizing figures , but the half of America that liked them did so intensely . They connected emotionally with voters by sharing stories , memories and values . You either have that ability , or you don ' t . Neither Hillary nor Jeb has it . Either one would make a great president . But presidents are not appointed . They ' re elected . Americans elect people to whom they can relate . And we ' ll never know if we relate to you , if you don ' t open up .
