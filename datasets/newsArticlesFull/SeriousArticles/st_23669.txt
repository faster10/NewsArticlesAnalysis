Bob confirmed that the Vail Resort is pot free and smoking on their magnificent mountain is illegal . It ' s federal land and lighting up outside is a big no no . They take it seriously in Vail I get it . No one wants stoned skiers near themselves or their kids . But I would argue that boozing boarders are just as scary and there ' s no shortage of alcohol at ski resorts in America . So while weed wasn ' t for sale anywhere in Eagle County , a quick Google search and a click on the Best Buds app turned up a half dozen dispensaries within an hour ' s drive .
