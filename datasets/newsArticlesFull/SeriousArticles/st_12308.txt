Among the declassified documents was a Union Cabinet note of February 6 , 1995 , signed by then Home Secretary K Padmanabaiah , which said , " There seems to be no scope for doubt that he died in the air crash of 18th August 1945 at Taihoku . Government of India has already accepted this position . There is no evidence whatsoever to the contrary . " The note further said , " If a few individuals organisations have a different view , they seem to be more guided by sentimentality rather than by any rational consideration . " " The belief of these people that Netaji was alive and out of contact with any individual , but would appear when found necessary , has also lost relevance by now . " The cabinet note was prepared for the government to take a stand on bringing the " mortal remains " of Netaji from Japan to India , kept in the Bose Academy in Tokyo .
