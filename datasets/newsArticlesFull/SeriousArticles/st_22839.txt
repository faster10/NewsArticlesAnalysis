Yes , the Mets hit home runs , but they actually led the NL in doubles this season . As an offense they hit a lot of fly balls . For the games in Kansas City , it ' s worth noting that Kauffman significantly increases the rates of doubles and triples by both left and right handed batters . It ' s not a good home run park , though . Thus , Lorenzo Cain and Alex Gordon and the right fielder of the moment ( almost certainly Alex Rios ) will be tested . Lucky for the Royals , they have one of the best outfield defenses around , especially when Jarrod Dyson is in there .
