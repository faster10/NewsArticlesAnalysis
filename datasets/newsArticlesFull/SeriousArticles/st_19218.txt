The winners of this competition for the past two years are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup after a low pressure , ultimately quite comfortable 3 1 defeat of Sunderland at the Emirates Stadium . A slightly weakened Arsenal team took their moments to strike , sealing the tie with second half goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud , both created by the excellent H ctor Beller n . Alex Iwobi made a promising first start in the competition , earning praise from his manager for the timing of his passes and his willingness , aged 19 , to run with the ball . For now Arsenal s attempt to become the first team since Blackburn Rovers 130 years ago to win the Cup three times in a row remains on course .
