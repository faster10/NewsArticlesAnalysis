WHY GO THIS WEEKEND While most beach seasons are just beginning , Memorial Day marks the end of bearable temps in the desert , so hotels and operators are running specials for the holiday . Though other parts of California will be in the midst of " May Gray " and " June Gloom , " Palm Springs still has nonstop sunshine plus dozens of vintage shops , acclaimed restaurants such as Copley ' s on Palm Canyon ( where celebrity chef Andrew Copley whips up So Cal comfort food like lobster pot pie ) and an enduring love for all things mid century ( its hotels and private homes offer some of the best examples of 1950s modern architecture in the country ) . It also makes a great base camp for exploring the striking desert landscape of Joshua Tree National Park through hikes , mountain biking , or rock climbing .
