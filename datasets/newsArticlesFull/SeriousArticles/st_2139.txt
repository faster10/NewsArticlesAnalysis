" The small cars with marginal or poor ratings had some of the same structural and restraint system issues as other models we ' ve tested , " Zuby said . " In the worst cases , safety cages collapsed , driver airbags moved sideways with unstable steering columns and the ( test ) dummy ' s head hit the instrument panel . Side curtain airbags didn ' t deploy or didn ' t provide enough forward coverage to make a difference . All of this adds up to marginal or poor protection in a small overlap crash . "
