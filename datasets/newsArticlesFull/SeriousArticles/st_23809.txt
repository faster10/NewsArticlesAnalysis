Former Bills coach Doug Marrone , who interviewed Saturday , would have been the shake things up choice . Marrone likely would have swaggered in with a new sheriff in town vibe and a goal of making everyone uneasy in the intense pursuit of success . Word on Marrone is that he ' s a good coach with a strong , assertive personality that looks great when things are going well but might tend to rub people the wrong way when the losing starts . Might not have been the easiest dude with which to work , and that matters to the people who run the Giants .
