Let ' s start by recognizing that the women ' s movement never told anybody that they could " have it all . " That concept was the brainchild of advertising executives , not feminist activists . Feminism insists on women ' s right to make choices about whether to marry , whether to have children , whether to combine work and family or to focus on one over the other . It also urges men and women to share the joys and burdens of family life and calls on society to place a higher priority on supporting caregiving work .
