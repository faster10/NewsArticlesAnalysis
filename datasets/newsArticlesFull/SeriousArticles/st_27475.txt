So much of the world is going to be living in cities in the next 10 to 15 years . We have got to understand the designing of them , where people are in close proximity to each other but in a way that provides health and well being to everybody . The density allows for safety , allows for people to get to know each other , the density allows people to walk and bike and get healthier as a result . That could be the kind of city that people will want to live in . Those are the kind of cities we need to re imagine so that we are building them for people and not just for cars .
