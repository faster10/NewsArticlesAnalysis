' The study is based on mathematics and probabilities theories applied to lottery drawings . It adopts a coloured template that determines all the possible combinations of numbers , as established by Pascal ' s rule . The adoption of this coloured template provides an easier understanding , and correct identification , of the combinations of numbers with highest probabilities to win . Through experimentation , the method shows that it is possible to detect that the results of a lottery draw follow the same behaviour pattern as predicted by the Law of Large Numbers .
