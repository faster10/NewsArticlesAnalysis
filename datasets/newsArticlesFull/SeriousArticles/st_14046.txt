42 , a sports drama about how Jackie Robinson broke the color line in professional baseball , is in some ways a film that could have been made 30 years ago , or 50 years ago . ( In fact , it was made 63 years ago : 1950 ' s The Jackie Robinson Story starred the legendary second baseman himself . ) The film depicts Robinson , played by the dazzling , little known actor Chadwick Boseman , as a fearless , noble athlete crusader which , of course , is just what he was , though 42 scarcely spends three minutes trying to find any flaws in him ( surely he must have had one ) , or even giving him a sprinkle of idiosyncrasy . Is the writer director , Brian Helgeland ( who wrote L . A . Confidential and directed A Knight ' s Tale ) , worried that we wouldn ' t admire Robinson enough ? Helgeland works in what I think of as a conservative or maybe it ' s just really , really basic neoclassical Hollywood style , spelling everything out , letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion , with a big , wide , open pictorial camera eye . It ' s like the latter day Clint Eastwood style , applied to material that ' s as traditional as can be .
