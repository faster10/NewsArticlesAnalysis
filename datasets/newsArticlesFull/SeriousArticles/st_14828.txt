Again , that should be an easy showing to make here if in fact there was an exchange of promises , Cosby " detrimentally relied " on the prosecutor ' s promise by answering deposition questions when he could have remained silent . But the detrimental reliance concept could affect the remedy the judge imposes if he does find that some agreement was reached . In detrimental reliance situations , judges will sometimes enforce the promise only to the extent necessary to remove the harm from the reliance . Here , that could mean that even if the judge finds there was an agreement not to bring charges , the " enforcement " of that agreement could be limited to preventing the prosecutors from using Cosby ' s deposition testimony against him .
