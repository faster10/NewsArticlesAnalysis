I realized that I feel like a child who was once desperately thirsty , who was given enough water to survive and shake her thirst , and now feels compelled to go out and give water to anyone who ' s parched . " Look ! Water ! I know , isn ' t it good ? ! Drink up ! ! " When I see people drink the water , I can ' t even describe the feeling it ' s as if I ' m experiencing the first sip all over again . It brings me incredible joy , even healing . It ' s an act of alchemy . It allows me to make light of some of the darkest days of my life .
