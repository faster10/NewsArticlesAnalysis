I won ' t go over all the winners as you can easily find them online or in your newspaper , except to indicate the surprises , such as Mozart in the Jungle , an Amazon series , which may well be deserving but I ' m sure there aren ' t too many who ' ve seen it . The series also won Best Actor in a Comedy series for Gael Garcia Bernal . And Lady Gaga winning the Best Actress in a Limited Series was a stunner . She really seemed surprised and her speech told it all . I like American Horror Story : Hotel , but was she better than Felicity Huffman in American Crime or Kirsten Dunst in Fargo ?
