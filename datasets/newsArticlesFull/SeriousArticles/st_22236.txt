House Republicans are proposing changes to the refugee vetting process that would include more background checks from the FBI . The proposed legislation , which could be voted on as early as Thursday , would halt refugee processing while the new protocol is established . The bill would require that the heads of the FBI , Homeland Security Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence certify that each refugee being admitted would not pose a threat . It could have the practical effect of keeping refugees out of the United States entirely .
