SVdR : My first interest was really in what we called Post Occupancy Evaluation ( POE ) . I was interested in the social side of architecture , because it seemed to me that you read architectural criticism and , you know , there was no criteria other than subjective , especially when you consider how a building works for people . I helped found POE which never really went very far . Later on I was the Chief Architect for the State of California and I had money to do that POE but none of my client agencies wanted to do that .
