EB : ? You know it tells me that it ' s pretty typical to run on the right when you ' re running in a situation where you ' ve had a Democratic Presidency to say here ' s all the things this Democratic President has done wrong and we The Republicans are going to fix it in sort of classically Republican ways . And then on the left , if you look at Hilary , she ' s sort of the heir apparent to Obama . And she ' s basically saying I ' m going to protect and continue what Obama has done . But neither narrative is really inclusive of the worldview of a population that ' s been through the recession that we ' ve been through . And that has seen the declines that we ' ve seen in terms of manufacturing jobs and the rise of white , working class alienation especially among men . We ' ve seen studies that have shown suicide going up among white working class men . So ? there ' s a real alienation and bitterness there that comes out of the recession and in part just out of the way that the economy has changed over the past 8 years . And I think that Bernie and Donald have tapped into that anxiety in a way that ' s not common for Presidential campaigns . ?
