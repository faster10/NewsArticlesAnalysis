Rousseff is not on the brink . Yes , the charges against her breaking the Fiscal Responsibility Law by essentially cooking the government ' s books are serious . But impeachment is political warfare ( " the nuclear option , " in the words of former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso ) , which promises to bring months of partisan tsuris in an already fractious legislature . To send Rousseff off , her foes need the votes of two thirds of the lower house , where pork and privilege can buy indulgences , even for an enfeebled leader . The fact that Cunha , a political poker player , was willing to take such an extreme gamble suggests he was driven more by desperation than by strength . Tellingly , Rousseff ' s allies are pushing to accelerate the impeachment vote , betting that Cunha has overplayed his hand . Just in case , they also asked the Supreme Court to overrule the impeachment drive .
