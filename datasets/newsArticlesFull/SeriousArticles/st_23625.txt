Trump didn t bring anything special on his last big evening before voters ? those Iowa voters , the ones who are always insisting they take this process more seriously than the rest of us , the ones claiming they are who can be most trusted with this sacred task of filtering through the men and women who most want to become the most powerful person in the world and discarding the unworthy ? at last make their voices heard . He stood up a couple of times , spoke briefly , then got on his plane and went home . Maybe he didn t need to . The world is different because of what he ? has accomplished in the last five months . His work may already be done . ? Or maybe he s just getting started .
