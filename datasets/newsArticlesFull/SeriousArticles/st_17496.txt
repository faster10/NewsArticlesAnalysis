Eddie Redmayne ( who won the Academy award for Best Actor last year ) and Leonardo DiCaprio ( who famously doesn ' t yet have an Academy Award , despite turning in a number of heavyweight performances across the years ) will go head to head in the Best Actor : Motion Picture category at this year s Golden Globes . Redmayne is nominated for The Danish Girl , in which he puts in a sensitive , heartbreaking performance as Lili Elbe , the first ever person to undergo a sex change operation . Meanwhile , in The Revenant , poor Leo gets mauled ( yes , just mauled ) by a bear , and eats raw liver . It s a close call . . .
