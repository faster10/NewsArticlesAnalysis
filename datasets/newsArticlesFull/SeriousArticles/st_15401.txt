Sanders and Clinton have been involved in a days long back and forth over debates after MSNBC offered last week to host an unsanctioned debate ahead of the New Hampshire primary . Sanders said he would participate only if Clinton agreed to three future debates . The Clinton campaign agreed in principle , and said they ' d show up in New Hampshire no matter what , leading Sanders to say on Wednesday morning he ' d attend the debate that had been tentatively scheduled for Thursday of this week . The DNC , after indicating they would sanction the debate once both candidates signed on , officially sanctioned the debate only on Wednesday .
