When I was traveling with the first film , I went to 287 universities . At each one . . . somebody would stand up and say , " Wow , we really like your film , but you didn ' t deal with the dieting industry . Why not ? " So I go on the computer one night just researching dieting , and I come across this website that has the BMI , body mass index , of celebrities . So according to this website , the BMI of Tom Cruise , Will Smith , Mel Gibson , The Rock , Christian Bale , LeBron James all these celebrities make them either overweight or obese . And I ' m like , " This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard . "
