Justice Elena Kagan , to Chemerinsky : " Your argument is sort of a ' use it or lose it ' argument , is that correct ? That the government has this commanding authority , and unless it uses it to its full extent , every day of the week , it loses it ? One of the arguments that the government makes is , look , what the military wants to do here is something very sensible . It keeps tight what it needs to keep tight , but it allows to be more open areas that it doesn ' t have an interest in securing entirely . And that ' s for the convenience of military personnel and for other people who live around the base . What ' s wrong with that ? "
