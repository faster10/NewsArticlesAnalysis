Bono ' s Red initiative is emblematic of this new Pro Logo age . He announced a new branded product range at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland last year called Product Red . American Express , Converse , Armani and Gap were initial partners , joined later by Apple and Motorola . The corporations sell Red branded products , with a percentage of profits going to Bono approved causes . In this Pro Logo world there is an irony of consuming to end poverty . Perhaps an even bigger irony : through initiatives like the Red card , consumer culture and branding is buying a stake in anti globalization and alleviating poverty movement .
