The value wager now is that Bevin will find some way to weasel his way out of closing the Kynect program once he manages to wrap his brain around the implications and costs of doing so .

Throughout the campaign , Bevin appeared uninformed and unclear on how his proposals would impact budgets and lives , so he had better get educated pretty damned quick . Once he does , the weaseling will begin .
