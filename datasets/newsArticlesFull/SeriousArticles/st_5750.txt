They score a lot of points on offense , Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said last week on a conference call , and I think having all of those weapons available to ( Manning ) makes it difficult for a defense to try to defend all of those players . . . . They really have a good combination of a short passing game mixed in with the vertical passing game where they create big plays either by the plays downfield or the throws downfield or just the ability for them to get the ball out quick and allow those guys to catch and run and make plays with the ball in their hand .
