Wilson ' s targets in the final five weeks of the year : Doug Baldwin 39 Tyler Lockett 32 Jermaine Kearse 25 Cooper Helfet 19 Fred Jackson 18 Luke Willson 8 Chase Coffman 4 . . . . Baldwin is a top six wideout play on a receiver rich Wild Card slate , but there are reasons to believe Lockett might give Minnesota more problems . Whereas Baldwin will often match up with stingy Vikings slot corner Captain Munnerlyn , Lockett will get more work against 37 year old LCB Terence Newman . Baldwin ' s usage could also take a hit if Lynch is as healthy and ready for a big workload as Seahawks coaches insist , specifically in the red zone . The primary reason for Baldwin ' s late season surge was touchdown scoring . When Seattle and Minnesota played in Week 13 , Baldwin still emerged with a 5 94 2 receiving line and Lockett went 7 90 . While Baldwin remains the favorite to lead Seattle in Week 18 receptions , 4 . 4 flat speedster Lockett provides better odds of ripping off a big play or three . . . . Whereas Baldwin and Lockett both had big games in the Week 13 meeting , Kearse was the odd man out against fast finishing RCB Xavier Rhodes , goose egging on one target . Kearse is the weakest bet for box score production in Seattle ' s offense this week .
