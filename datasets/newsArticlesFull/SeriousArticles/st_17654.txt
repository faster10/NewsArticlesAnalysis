" Nordhausen was liberated by the 104th U . S . Infantry Division on April 12th , 1945 . When the first American G . I . ' s arrived in the camp , they discovered a gruesome scene . More than 3 , 000 corpses were scattered , helter skelter on the grounds . In several hangars there were no survivors and in others they found only 2 or 3 living inmates lying amongst dozens of corpses . The situation was so calamitous that the medic unit of the 104th Infantry Division had to request urgent medical reinforcements and supplies . More than 400 German civilians living in the direct vicinity of the camp were forced by the G . I . ' s to evacuate the corpses . The medic units of the 104th Division did the best they could to save as many prisoners as possible , but even with the excellent care they received , numerous inmates died in the hours and days following the liberation of the camps .
