? Cleveland is said to be trying to dump veteran offensive linemen Alex Mack and Joe Thomas . But each makes a lot of money ? Thomas with a cap number of 10 . 2 million this year and Mack 8 million ? and that won t be easy for anyone to get done . As La Confora notes , the Browns would likely have to take on lots of someone else s big salaries to make it work . Seattle doesn t really have any big money players that would seem logical to trade now . But Seattle undoubtedly will do its due diligence to see if it can get something done .
