A recent study by Robock , Oman and Stenchikov ( PDF ) showed that a nuclear war , even with the reduced numbers Obama has proposed , would cause catastrophic global climate disruption ( PDF ) . The firestorms started by these nuclear explosions would loft 50 million to 100 million tons of soot into the upper atmosphere , blocking out the sun . In a matter of days , temperatures around the world would plummet by as much as 20 degrees centigrade 36 degrees Fahrenheit in the agricultural regions in the interior of continents . The result would be a catastrophic failure of crops throughout the world and a global famine that could claim a majority of the human population .
