Granted , Streep ' s last win was 13 nominations ago ( 1983 , " Sophie ' s Choice " ) . But given that Octavia Spencer took home the Best Supporting Actress award for " The Help , " and got a standing ovation from the Oscar crowd besides , it makes you wonder . It could be that voters thought Davis ' screen time was insufficient for the Best Actress prize , or that she wasn ' t the center of the story ( Emma Stone was , arguably ) . But that ' s probably giving the Academy more credit than it deserves .
