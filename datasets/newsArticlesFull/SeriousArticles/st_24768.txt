Ron A . Y . Rich , ? Canada Free Press : ISIL recruits people from all over to kill as many innocent civilians as possible throughout the world as well as in the United States . The Japanese did not recruit people from all over the world to murder innocent people all over the world . Franklin Roosevelt and his fellow liberals did not allow many Jews into the United States who were escaping the Holocaust , even when they were on ships , such as the St . Louis , that reached the American shores . There is no evidence that Jews ever made threats to massacre people at random in the United States . . . . All Jews were targeted for extermination by the Nazis not all Arabs are targeted for extermination by ISIL .
