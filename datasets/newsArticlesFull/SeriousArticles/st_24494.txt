" I sit in my room , for a good 1 2 hours and dad comes in my room and goes off on me , calling me bastard , nogood , mistake , and telling me I ' m inconciderate ( sic ) and just care about my self , and slaps me , then goes back to his room . As I sat on my bed , tears of rage flowing , remembering my childhood , my anger kept building and building , and I went to my car , got the 9mm , and walked to his room , peeked in , and he was asleep . I walked about two steps in the door , and screamed , and shut my eyes , when I heard him move , I started firing . When I opened my eyes again , I freaked ! I grabbed what casings I saw , and threw them into the bushes , grabbed the gun , and went to town . "
