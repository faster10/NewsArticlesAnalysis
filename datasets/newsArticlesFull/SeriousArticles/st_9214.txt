After meeting John Kerry in Riyadh last Saturday , Hijab noted : There is retreat in the position of some friendly countries that have abandoned their ( earlier ) remarks about Bashar s loss of legitimacy and they have abandoned their calls for him to step down immediately . He was referring to the United States , of course , after Kerry made it clear that the Syrian opposition was headed to Moscow to negotiate their participation in the governance of Syria and not to take over power in Damascus . He added that Al Assad was entitled to run for elections when early elections take place in the summer of 2017 , emphasising that there was no timetable for his departure . According to sources in the Syrian opposition , the ( Kerry Hijab ) meeting was not positive and we weren t comfortable with it . Kerry added : You will lose your friends if you insist on not going to Geneva . This , he added , means withdrawing military and political support to the opposition . When Hijab tried cornering him into committing that there would be no role for Al Assad in the future of Syria , Kerry refused to answer , saying that it was up to the Syrian people to decide . Kerry also refused to pressure Damascus for any confidence building measures , saying that this should take place on the negotiating table .
