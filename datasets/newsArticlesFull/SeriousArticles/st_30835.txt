But you d think it would be a good idea for Democrats to try to make this happen . The RNC is claiming there will be another debate scheduled to replace the cancelled one on NBC and Telemundo . But RNC chair Reince Priebus has declined to say whether Telemundo would be included in the replacement debate . Obviously the RNC did not cancel this debate because of the Spanish language network s participation it had many other reasons for doing so . But one consequence of this decision could be that Republicans end up holding no debate aired on a Spanish language network . If Democrats do add a second such gathering , they would then be able to argue that they are far more interested in communicating with Latino voters than Republicans are , which is a good message for the general election .
