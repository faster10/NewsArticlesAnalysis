What s really lacking is an overview grasp of the race , which isn t surprising , given how things are falling apart . Ordinarily , elections are primarily determined by fundamentals ( as seen in the Bread and Peace model of Douglas Hibbs ) , with campaigns ? however brilliant or inept ? influencing outcomes only on the margins . Primary elections are more determined by how dominant factions on each side define the issue landscape , while most candidates try to show how well they fit that landscape , with occasional outsiders , mavericks or innovators who do more or less to try to reshape the issue landscape to their advantage . Ordinarily this gives rise to political races that are relatively simple to understand . Issue landscapes are relatively stable and well defined , and although there are surprises along the way , they take on familiar forms that commentators are well equipped to analyze and discuss .
