' It was a really tough call , but I just decided at the 11th hour to play Martin Kaymer and break up that dynamic of Poulter and Justin Rose in the foursomes , ' said McGinley . ' The way Ian accepted that decision . . . I mean he came out on the golf course in the afternoon , he put his arm around my shoulder and said : ' ' You ' re the captain , you make the calls and I ' ll be ready tomorrow ' ' . That told me more about Ian Poulter than the banging on the heart or what he did at Medinah . '
