Advantage Alabama limiting Florida ' s ability to score : Alabama ' s defense is so good because of the way the Tide can break the spirit of an offense looking to get into rhythm . A lot of that starts up front and early in drives with the Tide forcing a three and out on 41 . 3 percent of opponents drives ( ranking second nationally with 5 . 75 three and outs per game ) and then maintaining that high level of play when teams do move it down the field with a FBS best 0 . 96 points per drive allowed . The defensive line is so good the Tide are able to pressure the quarterback without even bringing extra rushers and there is an overwhelming about of speed and power on display when a sea of Crimson clad players swarm to bring down a ball carrier .
