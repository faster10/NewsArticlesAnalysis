Danny Woodhead at Chiefs : Woodhead hasn t scored in three weeks and has seen his touches dialed back considerably with the Chargers season in the tank . They understandably want to get a better look at Melvin Gordon . Over the past five games , Gordon is averaging 17 touches compared to 13 . 4 for Woodhead . Woodhead obviously does the bulk of his damage as a pass catcher out of the backfield . Through 12 weeks , only the Titans have allowed fewer catches to running backs than the Chiefs . Week 11 against this same defense , Woodhead caught 1 of 2 targets for nine yards and rushed six times for seven yards . He s borderline unusable this week . Theoretically , as 10 point underdogs , Woodhead would be used more in catch up mode . But the Chargers have been giving more looks to Gordon as a pass catcher as well .
