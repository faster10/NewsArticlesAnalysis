One reason to panic : Score a touchdown , please . The outcome is probably different if the Bears find a way to score six points instead of three . The worst moment on offense occurred in the fourth quarter , when the Bears failed to score on fourth and goal from the 4 yard line . That pretty much summed up the day . Earlier in the game , the Bears began a drive at Denver s 49 yard line and promptly went three and out . The Broncos are too good to beat with only field goals . The Bears paid the price for their inefficiency on Denver s side of the field .
