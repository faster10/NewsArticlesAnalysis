Here , for example , is Charles Wheelan in U . S . News and World Report telling us that the national political scene is screaming out for adult leadership and practically drooling over the possibility of Bloomberg dedicat ing his money and clout to reshaping American politics by giving form to a new political movement of the center . Wheelan s post is a fantasia backed up by exactly zero evidence that Bloomberg could somehow build the apparatus to forge centrist independents into a political movement that would immediately begin pushing both parties to the political margins . He builds his entire case on the premise that at some point , this political realignment making centrism , well , front and center has to happen . So we might as well let Michael Bloomberg be the man to bring about this radical change , despite the complete lack of reasons to believe this is possible or even desirable .
