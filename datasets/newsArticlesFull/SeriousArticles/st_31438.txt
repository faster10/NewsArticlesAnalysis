You saw this again when John Harwood asked Rubio about his tax plan and its benefits for middle class families . The Tax Foundation , which was alluded to earlier , scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale , he said . Since you re the champion of Americans living paycheck to paycheck , don t you have that backward ? This is true , and less favorable analyses find huge benefits for the rich and comparatively small ones for everyone else . Rubio , however , didn t answer the question . Instead , he made a different point entirely ? In fact , the largest after tax gains is for the people at the lower end of the tax spectrum under my plan . And conservatives ? taking Rubio s side ? accused Harwood of lying .
