TR : Senator Sanders seems to be defying all the expectations . It seems that even in Iowa right now the vast majority of Iowa voters under the age of 35 ? are now identifying themselves more as socialists than capitalists , according to a recent ? poll . And Bernie Sanders seems to be benefiting from that . Right now if I was a betting man I d put my money on Bernie Sanders to win the Iowa caucus and certainly , New Hampshire as a primary . South Carolina could go either way . But there is now a credible path to the democratic nomination for Bernie Sanders
