This is not about me , but about the devastation from domestic violence that this country inexplicably tolerates and the millions of women and children it still fails to protect . My only hope is ? that the series will bring to the forefront the horrible domestic abuse that millions of women continue to experience every year and that , ? instead of opening painful wounds for many people , ? or becoming a pointless media circus , it serves as another opportunity to remind the American public that domestic abuse remains a lethal problem , even 22 years after this nightmare . ?
