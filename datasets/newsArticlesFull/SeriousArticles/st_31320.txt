Established in 1752 as a Spanish presidio , the town of Tubac ( now in Arizona ) was once a stop on the road from Mexico to the Spanish settlements in California . Tubac Presidio State Historic Park preserves the site of the Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac , the oldest fort in what would become the state of Arizona . Now it ' s an artist colony and home to many galleries . When you ' re finished gallery hopping , head to Elvira ' s restaurant , which was established in 1927 in Nogales , Mexico , and reopened in Tubac .
