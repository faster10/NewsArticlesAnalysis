Determined not to let that excitement wane , Clinton is taking a different tack toward the historic nature of her campaign than she did in 2008 . In that race , she largely avoided talking about her gender until victory was slipping away . This time , she s making it a key calling card of her candidacy ? a way to rally supporters , to separate herself from Obama , and to paint herself as something other than a political insider during a year when populist disaffection is rewarding outsiders . She has called for a country in which there are no ceilings for anyone , and where a father can tell his daughter , You can be anything you want to be , including the President of the United States of America . She routinely mentions her mother and granddaughter in campaign appearances , and images of little girls dressed up as Madame President litter her Instagram feed .
