Simon Critchley : I think Bowie s relationship to politics has often been oblique and hard to work out . I remember him being interviewed and him saying about Live Aid in 1985 , which he raised huge amounts of money for famine in Africa for , We always knew that pop music had a huge capacity for change , but no one had really believed that . The 87 Berlin Wall concert should be seen in that light : We aren t being directly political , but it opens a space where people can begin to articulate different political demands and questions which they weren t able to before .
