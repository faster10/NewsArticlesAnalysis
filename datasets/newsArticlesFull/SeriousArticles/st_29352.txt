We thrilled to the adventures of Luke Skywalker ( originally Starkiller ) ? a peasant farmer boy with a hidden destiny , played by the self deprecating Mark Hamill ? the scene stealing presence of a no good space smuggler in the form of Harrison Ford s Han Solo , Carrie Fisher s sarcastic princess , exciting space battles , and a truly evil villain in Darth Vader . The space fantasy boasted new age mysticism in the shape of The Force , explained and personified by the venerable Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi . It also boasted a spectacular soundtrack from composer John Williams ? not that you d know it from the original trailer , which was put together before the score was recorded .
