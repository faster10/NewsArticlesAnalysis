Will Thomas , the youngest vet on the show , faced a more exotic challenge in Laos when he treated Tom Kun , an elephant with a bullet in its leg . He wanted to X ray the infected leg , and had borrowed a valuable radiography machine from a nearby hospital . But the elephant wouldn ' t stand still and the doctors feared he ' d crush the 40 , 000 X ray device . Tom Kun ' s keeper saved the day by leaping onto the elephant ' s back and covering the animal ' s eyes while crooning a lullaby . Briefly bemused , Tom Kun stayed still long enough for Will to get the X ray .
