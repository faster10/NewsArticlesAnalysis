The difference between gutsy and gritty Putin and a weak , inert Obama is apparent from their response in both Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts . It is a mark of Putin s military genius that he kept on warning that the US interference would add fuel to fire in the Syrian situation . Another proof of Putin s shrewdness is that Russian forces have completely entered in Syrian war by firing missiles from warships standing in the Caspian waters and using SU 34 aircraft for bombing over the Syrian rebels , but the Russian army is neither a threat to the US NATO allies nor to the US interests in Israel or the Gulf States .
