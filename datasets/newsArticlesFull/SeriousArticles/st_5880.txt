In the new millennium , almost every single major city of the world has witnessed heinous attacks on humanity at the hands of misguided and brainwashed extremists and while there is no denying that a handful of radicals don t represent an entire religion , shouldn t one question the repeated misinterpretation of Islam across many such attacks ? If the world had taken cognisance of the manner in which Pakistan based outfits sent 10 men including Ajmal Kasab to wreak havoc in Mumbai perhaps the Paris attacks could have been averted . In his recorded statement , ? Kasab said that his mission was to kill as many Indians as possible because by doing this one will become famous and will also make God proud . But at the same time , when Indian authorities further interrogated him they found that he barely knew anything about the Quran . The likes of Kasabs are brainwashed a dime a dozen and their families promised money by sponsors of terror . The fact that Islam or the Quran , the name in which terrorists are indoctrinated might be misinterpreted is still the second step of the argument . The first which many won t like to discuss is that the holy text of a religion followed by 23 of humanity or 1 . 57 billion people is somewhere being used to spill innocent blood .
