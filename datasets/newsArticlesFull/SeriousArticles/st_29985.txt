Seven years ago , a group of young women and girls started meeting in my apartment where we began to explore how we could form a movement to challenge discrimination and isolation suffered by this group . Even health services meant to provide women treatment to prevent them from infecting their babies with HIV , young women were utterly marginalized . They had to deal with two issues that society regarded as tragedies . First was the pregnancy , which in itself stigmatizes girls . Then HIV . Double stigma . We called the movement Lean on Me . Though we are still battling on , there is still much that remains unaccomplished . Movements that support young women have in the past not received much support . Meantime , the epidemic rages on in this group .
