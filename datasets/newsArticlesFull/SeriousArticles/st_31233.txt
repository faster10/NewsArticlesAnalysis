The campaigns and their consiglieres put together a list of demands to which future debate hosts must agree to ensure the candidates participation . The finalized version , as obtained by the Washington Post , is hilarious in its granularity . Not once but twice does the document inveigh against lightening sic rounds , which must be banned because of their frivolousness or gotcha nature , or in some cases both . The letter also implores networks to agree not to ask the candidates to raise their hands to answer a question , allow candidate to candidate questioning , allow props or pledges by the candidates , show an empty podium after a break ( describe how far away the bathrooms are ) , or leaves microphones on after breaks . What about allowing hot mics in the distant bathrooms ? There s no clear rule on that , though it would certainly violate the spirit of the letter .
