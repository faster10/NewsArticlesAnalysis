Daniel Craig , Bond s most recent avatar , will be seen again in Spectre , playing the iconic agent 007 ? a role first defined by a magnificent Sean Connery in Dr No in 1962 . Since then , much water has flowed down the River Thames . And Bond , too , has evolved with the changing times . From the rugged Sean Connery to questionable experiments with George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton , to the suave and witty Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan , and , for the last three Bond films , the gritty , manly and modern , Daniel Craig . He has said that this may be his last Bond movie . But then again , Never say never is also a Bond motto .
