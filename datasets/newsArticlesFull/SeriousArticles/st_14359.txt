TS : While working on the project , I read an article which talked about how in the future we would be much more limited in the way that we can physically travel . It will be a luxury to have a car or travel across countries and continents . It also mentioned that virtuality and Internet communication will be much more enhanced and will be even more importance . I think with the Cocoon and the technology that we propose in there , to travel to places , to work remotely , to have enhanced communication for remote shopping , will be even more important .
