As great as Manning has been in his career , there s little question he s the second best QB right now in this game . Cam Newton capped what could be an MVP campaign with another scorching performance in the NFC title game by dicing up a good Arizona Cardinals defense . This has been Newton s breakout season without doubt , and he reaches this game at a clear flashpoint in his career . Is he a star ? Without a doubt . But has he convinced all of his former naysayers ? Doubtful . A Super Bowl win over Manning and an excellent Broncos defense might just do that , especially if Newton turns in a Super Bowl MVP performance . If this indeed is Manning s swan song , it s perhaps fitting that this stage could be a torch passing of sorts from Manning s generation to that of Newton , who was 8 years old when Manning was drafted . Wilson already has played in two Super Bowls , winning one , as he and Newton appear to be in the early stages of their own Brady Manning like rivalry .
