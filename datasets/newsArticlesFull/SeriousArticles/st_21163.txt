That was the end of an era for the Democratic Party , but not for the Democratic Party itself . So that may be a sign for us when we look at the GOP . The Trump insurgency is the Pentagon levitation test of the Republican Party . Out of this may come a reinvention on par with what happened to the Democrats after 68 , where outsiders ( like Jimmy Carter ) take center stage , and a new generation of politicians willing to take on the sacred cows of party dogma ( like Bill Clinton and the New Democrats ) bring the party back to the White House .
