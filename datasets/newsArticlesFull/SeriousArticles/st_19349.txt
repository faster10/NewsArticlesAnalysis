Rand Paul : It seems hard to remember now , but when Paul declared for president last year , he had already been on the cover of Time magazine several times since his first Senate election in 2010 . He was , as Time put it , the new face of the Grand Old Party . Paul was , at first , regarded as a first tier contender , yet by year ' s end he had been dropped from the main stage debate and had refused to participate in the undercard . Last year , Paul persuaded legislators to change Kentucky law to allow him to seek the White House and re election to the Senate . The latter race will need his immediate attention after Iowa and New Hampshire .
