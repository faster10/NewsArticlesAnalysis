Collins ' s World Series experience shows the limits of having a people manager rather than a baseball one in the dugout . He used Familia in Game 3 in part because Familia wanted to pitch , even though using his closer for that meaningless inning would affect his availability in subsequent games . He let Cespedes bat with the bases loaded in the sixth inning of Game 5 after Cespedes fouled a ball off his knee so hard that he had to leave the game after popping out . He let Harvey talk him into starting the ninth even though he ' d already made the decision to take his starter out . Individually , maybe you give any of these a pass . Collectively , they ' re the pattern of someone who is more concerned with keeping his players happy than with making hard decisions .
