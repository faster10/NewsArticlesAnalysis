The University of Rochester has turned research about predicting the spread of diseases with social media into a web application called Germ Tracker . The colorful interactive map pulls up geo tagged Tweets that contain keywords related to illness . If you find a tweet that ' s clearly mislabeled ( like someone bragging that their new car is " sick " ) , click a button to let the app know they ' re not actually sick . It also allows self reporting with a slider you can set to Awful , Sick , Yuck , Meh or Good and options to share specific symptoms .
