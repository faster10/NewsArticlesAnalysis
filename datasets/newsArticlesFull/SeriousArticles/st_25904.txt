According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation , more than half of the total uninsured population qualified for Medicaid since they earn less than 138 of the federal poverty level in the states that have expanded Medicaid . Since income grows with education and experience , the younger these uninsured are , the more likely they are to qualify for Medicaid because they are also poorer . And since Medicaid is free for these young people , that means no premiums are going to the insurance companies to subsidize the older enrollees .
