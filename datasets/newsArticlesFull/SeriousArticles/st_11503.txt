Remember , these people live in a land of make believe , where it ' s normal for the inhabitants to be injected with silicone . Oscar snubbings could come from a thousand superficial reasons , like someone sleeping with or not sleeping with the right person at the right time . In a town full of gay men , the heart wrenching " Brokeback Mountain " somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre " Crash . " Leonardo DiCaprio ' s trophy case continues to sit empty . And I will never understand how " Shakespeare in Love " beat " Saving Private Ryan " for best picture . Truth be told . my favorite film of 2014 was " The Drop " and I don ' t think that was nominated for anything by anyone .
