In Gibson , the superstar who once turned Jesus Christ into a box office sensation , we have a man apparently able to tap miracles beyond those of the Bible . He turned 60 last Sunday . A week later he is about to turn another page forward from a disgrace laden decade of living dangerously , taken back into the movie star fold as a presenter at Sunday ' s Golden Globes ( airing on Monday , Australian ? time ) . As he takes the stage many viewers will be asking why ? even as Hollywood , land of the second chance no matter how badly you blew your first one , shrugs and says : why not ?
