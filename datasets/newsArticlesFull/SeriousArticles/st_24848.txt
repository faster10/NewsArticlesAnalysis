Hardly . This year , the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just 85 billion , from an expected , pre sequester budget of 3 . 64 trillion less than a 2 . 3 reduction . To put that in perspective , the federal government borrows 85 billion every 28 days . In fact , this actually overstates the size of this year ' s cuts . Because of ongoing contracts and the Byzantine labyrinth of federal budgeting , only 44 billion of that 85 billion will actually be cut from this year ' s budget . The rest will be cut in future years , but attributed to this year ' s budget . So , the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1 . 2 . If the federal government can ' t reduce spending by less than a penny and a half on the dollar without throwing us into the dark ages , something is truly wrong .
