I get angry when I hear other teams ' fans make a compelling case to be the most aggrieved in the league because I want this team to be best at ? something , ? and it isn ' t winning Super Bowls . The Vikings seem to have a unique ability to bounce between periods of utter futility and periods of great teams that find gut wrenching ways to lose in the playoffs , skillfully avoiding Super Bowl wins at every step of the way while also sprinkling in ? one of the worst trades in NFL history , a fantastically embarrassing boat party and plenty of other off field lunacy .
