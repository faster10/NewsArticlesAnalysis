Of Saban s four national titles in Tuscaloosa , this featured the most competitive championship game . With 10 : 34 remaining in the fourth quarter and Alabama having just tied the score at 24 , Saban called for an unconventional onside kick that will be immortalized as one of the gutsiest gambles in the sport s history . Crimson Tide junior kicker Adam Griffith popped up a chip shot that traveled about 14 yards and caught Clemson completely off guard . Bama redshirt freshman defensive back Marlon Humphrey ? the son of Tide legend Bobby Humphrey ? ran under it to give his team possession . The play so stunned the Tigers that Humphrey would have had enough time to signal for a fair catch .
