In order to use so called " red card , " or the veto power , at least 55 percent of the EU s 28 national parliaments would have to come together , the BBC reported . At present , parliaments of member states can issue a yellow card , which forces the European Commission to reconsider a law , or an orange card , which forces a law to be reviewed if more than half the parliaments object to it . The red card mechanism would be the first that allows parliaments of member states to entirely block EU legislation .
