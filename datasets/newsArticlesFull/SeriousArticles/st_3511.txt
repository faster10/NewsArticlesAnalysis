I own a property in Fort Pierre , South Dakota , called the Bad River Ranch . It is a beautiful place , where we have worked very hard to restore the landscape , reintroduce native wildlife species and raise bison sustainably . But it sits about 15 miles downstream of the point where TransCanada ' s proposed Keystone XL pipeline would cross the Bad River , and being that close has led me to examine more closely the potential risks and benefits of a project about which I have been highly skeptical from the beginning . After careful scrutiny , I believe it is not in our national interest to pursue it .
