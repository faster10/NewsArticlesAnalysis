They should continue until the Castros are dead , and then we should make it very clear that if you want mountains of aid , if you want normal relationships , if you want to improve your economy , if you want to have the opportunity for freedom , that the United States stands ready now to embrace you now that you ' ve gotten rid of these tyrants who who have controlled you for these 50 plus years . That ' s why the sanctions have to stay in place , because we need to have a a very solid offer to come forward and help the Cuban people . "
