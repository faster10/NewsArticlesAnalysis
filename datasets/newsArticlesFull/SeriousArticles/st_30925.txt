The Mets : The Amazins have a pitching rotation that throws the ball harder than any assemblage of pitchers ever has before . Matt Harvey , Jacob deGrom , and Noah Syndergaard have collectively thrown 38 percent of their pitches at 95 mph or faster . No one else is even close .

It ' s led by Daniel Murphy , a journeyman and sometimes ditzy second baseman who is on a Barry Bonds like tear ( . 421 with a 1 . 462 OPS , and seven home runs ) , and followed by Curtis Granderson ( . 300 avg with 7 RBI ) . If Lucas Duda , Travis d ' Arnaud , or Yoenis Cespedes gets hot as well , watch out .
