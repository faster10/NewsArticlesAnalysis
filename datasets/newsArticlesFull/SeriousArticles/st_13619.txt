The last time we saw Undertaker , he and Kane destroyed all four members of the Wyatt Family at Survivor Series . So to follow that up with just a regular one on one match between Undertaker and Braun Strowman is pretty nonsensical . But other than Kevin Owens , who will likely be wrestling AJ Styles at the event , there really isn t anyone else available to face Undertaker on WWE s grandest stage , so the decision to have Undertaker take on Strowman may just be a result of a lack of manpower on the main roster due to injury .
