The conventional wisdom is that Trump will not be able to recover from this latest controversy . It will follow him everywhere he goes . He ' ll be asked relentlessly to explain how he was the only witness in America to " thousands and thousands " of Muslims celebrating in the streets of Jersey City . It ' ll dominate his rallies , upcoming debates , tv and radio interviews and press conferences . He will be forced to defend himself from charges of lying . Of not being trustworthy . Of not being worthy of the Office of the United States Presidency .
