While the film did score a solid " B " CinemaScore grade , reviews were even harsher this time around and much has been made of the fact that Taken 2 ' s storyline adheres so closely to the original . ( Of course , this didn ' t exactly crush The Hangover Part II . ) Thanks to up front excitement , Taken 2 will almost certainly fall hard in the weeks to come , but considering Fox spent just 42 million to make the film , that won ' t matter . This is already a huge winner for everyone involved .
