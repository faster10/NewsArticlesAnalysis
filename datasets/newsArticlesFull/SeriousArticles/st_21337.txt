I think that Iran has proven now , particularly during the government of Dr Rouhani , that it has good intentions for all of its neighbours and is working to promote peace and security , she said . There are attempts that are being made to create a sense of Iranophobia . There is nothing to fear about Iran , which is an independent state in the region . While it is fully prepared to defend itself it is also fully prepared to work with its neighbours for peace , for prosperity and improving relations .
