The mutual affection didn t end there , however . The day of the Iowa appearance , Perry took over Clinton s Instagram , posting snaps of her Hillary in 2016 decorated nails , her custom made Hillary themed dresses , her niece coloring a photo of Hillary and ( naturally ! ) a selfie of them together . The pop star also gave the candidate ( a fellow Scorpio ) an Etsy worthy gold necklace featuring the acronym POTUS . If that wasn t enough , Perry celebrated her birthday with a lengthy , heartfelt Instagram note about meeting with Hillary and educating herself about for what she stands . The conversation was apparently convincing : Next year s election is one of the most important ones in decades , and the choices we make will have a profound effect on women for years to come , Perry wrote . So , I stand with her for my daughters and their daughters , and beyond what time gives me . Get informed , get involved and become empowered !
