' My name is Kristen Patterson . I am writing to ask a question . You see my husband is a HUGE fan , and when I say HUGE I mean it . He is currently serving our country in the United States Army and has deployed twice to Afghanistan . He would set alarms to wake up at odd hours in the night just to listen to your football games . We recently had to move across the country for the Army and he tried to get us stationed in Colorado just so he could ensure that he would never miss your games , ' reads the touching letter sent months ago .
