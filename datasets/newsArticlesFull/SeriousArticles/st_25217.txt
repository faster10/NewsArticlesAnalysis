Of course , Hardy is one of the real leaders on this team and he earns it with respect from all of his teammates , and that s the kind of thing that inspires . I don t know if you watched him warm up out there , but he was almost he was inspiration in his method of warming up . He was ready to play and he was just getting the guys ready to play , in my view . I don t have any issue with him being involved in motivating or pushing any part of the football team because he plays and walks the walk .
