Josh Norman will likely be blanketing Dez Bryant in one of the better matchups of the week , but Charles Tillman will miss another game . ? That means the Panthers will be going back to Bene Benwikiere on the outside and , more significantly , Colin Jones in a nickel role . ? Jones was the victim on DeSean Jackson s long touchdown pass last week but was otherwise solid . ? The Panthers just need to ensure that Jones doesn t get into too many physical mismatches , and the secondary should be alright against Dallas .
