Thanks to a slew of homey white cottages , wide green lawns , and huge blue sky views , this low key escape has loads of repeat guests . Located in southern Maine on the Ogunquit River , the 12 acre Dunes has 17 rooms , each with a pair of Adirondack chairs , as well as 19 cottages that up the ante with their own screened in porches . The beach is just across the river , which , depending on the tide , is either a short walk or rowboat ride away . The inn also has direct access to trails , fishing from the docks , and a trolley that will take you into town . Doubles from 175 dunesonthewaterfront . com .
