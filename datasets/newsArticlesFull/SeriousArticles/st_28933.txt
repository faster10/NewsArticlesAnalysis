JUSTIN HASTINGS : They may agree to pass through sanctions , but they never said , for instance , that they were going to actually stop trade between North Korea and China , which is really where China can sort of crack down on North Korea . The sanctions are not working unless China enforces them at the North Korean border and in the ports that send goods to North Korea . So far they haven ' t done that for any long period of time . They ' ve had inspections , they cracked down for a short period of time to send a signal to North Korea , but they ' ve never actually stopped trade between China and North Korea entirely .
