Snyder ? in an eerie parallel to that other Midwestern villain , Rahm Emanuel ? has gone from overseeing this orgy of cruelty to emotionally promising to stick around and fix the mess . In a recent speech , he floridly apologized for letting Flint down and assured everyone that he understood the gravity of their predicament . However true that may be , he surely understands the gravity of his own predicament far more . Snyder is not the first rich , racist man to oversee a government that favors other rich , racist people and leaves everyone else to drown , but he is the one in the driver s seat right now . It s hard to see how he can stick around . With any luck , he ll be bounced from his office soon enough . Ensuring that the people of Flint are treated as human beings and not the detritus of Michigan s lost glory years is a more difficult task .
