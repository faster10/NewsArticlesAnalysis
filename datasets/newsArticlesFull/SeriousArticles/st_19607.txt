Escobar ' s drive landed about 30 feet from Alex Gordon ' s hit in the ninth inning of Game 7 last year against San Francisco ' s Madison Bumgarner , a single that skipped by center fielder Gregor Blanco for an error . Jirschele held up Gordon , who probably would have been thrown out easily by shortstop Brandon Crawford , who was in shallow left when he took the throw from left fielder Juan Perez . With the potential tying run 90 feet from home plate , Salvador Perez fouled out to third , ending the Royals ' season .
