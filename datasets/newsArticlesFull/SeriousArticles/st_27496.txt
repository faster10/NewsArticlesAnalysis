The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing . Two of them , " War Horse " and " We Bought A Zoo , " are performing respectably , though . The films earned 8 . 6 and 8 . 5 million , respectively , this weekend , and they have nearly identical totals of 56 . 8 million and 56 . 6 million . Still , there seems to be a common understanding in the blogosphere that " War Horse " ( which cost 66 million ) is performing admirably , while " We Bought A Zoo " ( which cost 50 million ) kind of fizzled , to which I say : Huh ? !

" The Adventures of Tintin , " Steven Spielberg ' s expensive motion capture animation , dropped 42 percent this weekend to 6 . 6 million and 61 . 9 million total .
