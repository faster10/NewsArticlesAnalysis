I ll believe it s official when it s official . These blog stories feel planted because spanos didn t a butt kissing from the mayors office today . Really the Chargers get the first option over the raiders ? ? ? Please someone explain why ? Tell us why that makes sense ? The raiders have a fanbase in la . A big one . It could be argued the Chargers are not liked and actually viewed in the lowest esteem possible by Los Angeles . Nothing about this part of owners decision makes sense . Nothing ! ! ! Unless it was done to give chargers leverage to get a deal done in San Diego and raiders know spanos will never exercise his option . If San Diego goes to la to play second fiddle to Rams they deserve the all the growing pains and lack of a fanbase that will stick with them for what could be decades . THIS DOES NOT PASS THE SMELL TEST
