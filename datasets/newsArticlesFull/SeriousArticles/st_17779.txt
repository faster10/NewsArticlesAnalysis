Claudia Marengo of the local CTA branch said of the decision to ban beauty pageants : ' It ' s a very important achievement . It has an enormous symbolic value . The municipal state made the decision , within the framework of this bill , to stop subjecting the women of Chivilcoy to the exhibition , objectification , and selection that beauty pageants imply , with the added bonus that instead they will promote other values that aim to encourage the construction of citizenship with a gender equality .
