If that sounds like a straightforward update on Aristophanes " Girlz in the Hood " or something " Chi Raq " is nothing like that . There ' s lots of dance numbers ( a Lee favorite since " School Daze " ) , lots of silly jokes , a hilarious appearance by Dave Chappelle as a strip club owner , a slow jam where everyone stops and sings " Oh Girl " and a white cop drops some knowledge about the Chi Lites . Samuel L . Jackson plays a high falutin ' narrator who addresses the audience and comments on the proceedings , just like the Greeks used to do it .
