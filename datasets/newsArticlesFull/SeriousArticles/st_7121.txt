To stand a chance against Alabama , an opponent must first believe it belongs on the same field . Not many opponents do . ( They hope , but hope isn ' t belief . ) Only once since Dec . 9 , 2009 , has Bama not been favored . That came Oct . 3 , 2015 , in Athens , and even before the game you could tell Georgia didn ' t believe . It tried pregame bluster , which the visitors ignored . The Crimson Tide scored touchdowns on offense , on defense and on special teams . Georgia ' s one touchdown cut the lead to 38 10 .
