WHAT TRUMP MAY LOSE BY SKIPPING FOX NEWS DEBATE : Once again , Donald Trump is proving that when it comes to his 2016 campaign playbook , there are no rules . But could Trump s decision to bow out of the final GOP debate before the Iowa caucuses be his riskiest move yet ? For the loyal supporters who have cheered Trump s brazen style , the candidate s planned absence from the debate stage tonight will not likely affect their caucus night choice , Matt Strawn , the former chairman of the Iowa ? Republican Party , said in an interview with ABC s MERIDITH MCGRAW . Most Trump supporters are set on supporting him so perhaps it s not as crucial for him to be on stage . But for Cruz , Rubio , the other candidates , there is no audience that is just as large , Strawn said . It s invaluable to get that kind of exposure . But Trump risks alienating undecided and first time caucus goers , according to David Yepsen , a former long time Des Moines Register political reporter . I think it s a mistake and I say that because there are a lot of caucus goers who have not made up their mind , said Yepsen . http : abcn . ws 1KbvIEC
