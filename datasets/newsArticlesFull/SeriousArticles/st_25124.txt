There are immediate problems here . There are no scholarships to West Point ? all costs are covered for all students . And the only way to get an offer is to apply , but the school has no record of Carson s application . When pressed by Politico , Carson s campaign conceded he never applied . He was introduced to folks from West Point by his ROTC Supervisors , explained his campaign manager , Barry Bennett . They told him they could help him get an appointment based on his grades and performance in ROTC . He considered it but in the end did not seek admission .
