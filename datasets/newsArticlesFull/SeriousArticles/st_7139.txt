Sheikh Nimr was a Saudi that was respected by many Shias and Sunnis alike he called for equal rights for persecuted Shias in Saudi while condemning atrocities committed by the Alawite " Shia " regime of Syria . Nimr ' s cry against injustice was not divided along sectarian lines . His platform included a distancing from Iranian influence and a strict condemnation of violence as a means to enact change . Thus , Nimr ' s execution despite a tireless campaign to " free Nimr " has been viewed as a means to scare the Saudi Shia minority into silence and to fuel the fans of sectarianism that are validating wars in Syria , Iraq , and Yemen .
