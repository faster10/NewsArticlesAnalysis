In general , the Bernie Sanders campaign has been overwhelmingly positive for American politics . It has , however , unleashed a minor plague of progressive white men confidently explaining feminism to the rest of us . Some of them rail against identity politics , while others use the language of intersectionality , a great boon to white men who want to inveigh against white feminism without losing their left wing street cred . Some just sound like surly conservatives complaining that affirmative action is racist . All are united in outrage that anyone could ever see a hint of sexism at work in the intense hatred that Hillary inspires among their ilk .
