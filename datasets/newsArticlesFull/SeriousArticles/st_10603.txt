In January , President Barack Obama declared a federal emergency in Flint , sending 5 million in federal aid . Days later , Michigan Governor Rick Snyder apologized to Flint residents for how he handled the disaster . " Your families face a crisis ? a crisis you did not create and could not have prevented , " he said . " To you , the people of Flint , I say tonight as I have before : I am sorry and will fix it . " On Jan . 20 , Snyder released more than 200 pages of emails regarding the crisis , which show that it took months of receiving complaints from the public before state officials acknowledged that Flint was facing a major public health emergency .
