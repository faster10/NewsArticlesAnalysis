The announced implementation of the Iranian nuclear deal on Saturday came with an important bonus : Tehran ' s release of four U . S . citizens it had imprisoned , including The Post ' s Jason Rezaian . The Americans were exchanged for seven people charged or convicted of crimes in the United States , and the dropping of U . S . cases against 14 others whose arrest was sought . Rezaian , who was held for 544 days , committed no crime and should have never been arrested . He was not a convict but a political hostage . His freeing and that of the other Americans ends a gross injustice .
