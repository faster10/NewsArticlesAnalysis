This is what is stressing her right now . During the last couple of seasons it ' s like , " Do I want to run away with the kids ? Do I turn him into the police ? What do I do ? " It ' s a constant wheel that turns in her head . When she realizes that he was responsible for Gus Fring ' s death , that ' s the bottom falling out of her life . When she walks out and she sees Junior watching Scarface and they ' re quoting the movie together , in light of everything else that ' s happened , it ' s so quietly horrifying to her that all she can do is turn around and walk back to her room . She knows that there ' s no saying , " Walt , please don ' t do that . " They ' re past that . She ' s also in a state of depression at this point , a sinking into yourself where the feeling is , " I don ' t really want to try . Why bother ? Why bother doing anything ? "
