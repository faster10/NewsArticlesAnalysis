Why To Watch : So we finally get to see how the Broncos handle a little adversity . The ball has generally bounced their way and they have been lucky to survive any host of games since Week 1 ( Baltimore , Kansas City , Cleveland and these very same Chiefs the first time around ) . Last week they were inept for the most part against the Colts and played one of their worst halves of football of the season on offense ( which is saying something for this group ) and defense as well ( they were not going to play at a historic rate all season ) . So how do they bounce back against a Kansas City outfit that has steadied itself in recent weeks ? And can the Chiefs continue to climb out of their huge hole and hang around the periphery of the playoff chase ? A KC win here could make for at least a smidge of mystery in the AFC West and the Chiefs seem to be playing with house money after the brutal start .
