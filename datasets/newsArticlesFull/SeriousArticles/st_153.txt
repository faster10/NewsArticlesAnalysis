Italy Only local traffic is permitted during certain hours in the historic centers of many Italian cities . White signs with an open red circle and the times that traffic is restricted mark the entrances to the zones . If your hotel is in one of these areas , ask the concierge to register your license plate number with the local authorities . Cameras take pictures of the plates when cars enter the zones , and a computer system tracks down vehicles that aren ' t registered . Violators are fined .
