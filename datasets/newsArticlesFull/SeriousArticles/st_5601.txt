Here ' s what ' ll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched : Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two , with boxes of text , photos , videos and even maps of your favorite locations . Rather than just displaying your most recent activities , your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to your birth . Facebook will become a record of your existence : All your memories , your victories and your defeats , your loves , your losses and everything in between .
