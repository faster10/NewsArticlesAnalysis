In the talk I gave at this year ' s TED conference , I made a passing reference to fast food . Let me elaborate briefly . In the catering business , there are two main methods of quality assurance . The first is standardizing . If you have a favorite fast food brand , you can go to any outlet anywhere and know exactly what you will find : same burger , fries , cola , d cor , and attitudes . Everything is standardized and guaranteed . By the way , this " cheap " food is also contributing to the most costly epidemic of diabetes and obesity in human history . But at least the standards are guaranteed .
