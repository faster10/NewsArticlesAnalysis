So what ' s next ? Wimbledon ? No . 1 ? How will everything change for Kerber now ? " It ' s tough to say what it means for the future , but I think now lots of things are going to happen , " Beltz ? said . " I think she has the game to stay there for a long time , I think she has the game to win more titles , yes . But I also think it ' s good to settle down now and get some rest and then try to work hard again , play hard again , because the next one is coming and it ' s not going to be easy . "
