The public and local governments have a critical role to play . No matter what warnings are issued by forecasters , every adult ' s safety is ultimately in his or her own hands .

Communities need to enforce the most basic and inexpensive good building practices so that roofs are attached securely to walls , which are anchored to foundations , so that buildings are more resistant to tornadoes .
