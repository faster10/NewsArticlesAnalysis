Don Mattingly was said to have had a nice meeting with Marlins higher ups Monday . The managing job is his to lose . . . Outgoing manager Dan Jennings still isn ' t quite back in the front office fold , and he hasn ' t been part of the managerial interview process to this point ( that would be a bit weird anyway , since the person they hire will be replacing Jennings ) . Club owner Jeffrey Loria actually tried to hire Jennings to manage years ago , but Jennings resisted . Even this time , friends say he warned Loria that he was concerned it would affect their relationship . And it obviously has . It isn ' t known exactly what happened , but Jennings was protective of the players , who ended up loving him . Even though things obviously aren ' t wonderful there right now , it ' s hard to imagine a departure for Jennings since he does have about 6 million left over three years on his contract , as Ken Rosenthal of FOXSports . com first reported .
