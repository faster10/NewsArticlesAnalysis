Manning has just the one ring , which makes him even with Brett Favre and gives him one more than Dan Marino . But Brad Johnson , Trent Dilfer , Doug Williams , Jim McMahon and Mark Rypien also have one and that s not a sentence that should include Manning . Two is better than one and although Manning still would have underachieved with two rings ? his Colts won at least 12 games seven years in a row from 2003 09 but won only one title ? at least he would take his ring count to a higher level .
