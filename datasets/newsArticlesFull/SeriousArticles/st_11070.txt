In the final movie the truth comes out : Snape is one of the good guys , and has been for years . In a sequence of flashbacks , we discover the truth about his background and his great love for Harry s mother ? which , we see in the book , is more complicated than a case of unrequited adoration but a friendship slowly destroyed by Snape s own ties to the Dark Arts and a tendency towards anti Muggle slurs . On screen , though , it is pure : after seven instalments of keeping his cool , Snape s emotions break through and we see why an actor of great range was needed for this role . A sobbing Snape cradling the body of his dead childhood friend , his lost love , moves us . A desperate Snape furious with Dumbledore for letting this happen , as he sees it , and reconciling himself a lifetime of secrecy , moves us .
