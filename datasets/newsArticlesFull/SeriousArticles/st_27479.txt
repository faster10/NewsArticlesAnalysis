Using our Gogobot app to find a spot out of the rain , we had no idea we were stepping into the fanciest vegetarian experience of our lives . I ' m talking palate cleansers , hand towels and a suggestion to allow at least an hour and a half for the full experience . What a treat : vegan caviar served up in vintage tins , followed by mouth watering combinations of carefully sculpted vegetables . Finally , our dessert featured perhaps the most succulent brownie I ' ve ever tasted . Donna had strawberry dumplings that were almost too beautiful to eat . Almost . We devoured every last bite .
