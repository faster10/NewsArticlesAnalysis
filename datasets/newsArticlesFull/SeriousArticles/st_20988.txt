Navarrette also thinks that Mexican Americans are " the orphans of the Southwest too Mexican for the Americans , too American for the Mexicans . " I have heard this before . Maybe it ' s just me , but I wouldn ' t need to see a therapist to accept being a second generation Mexican American and embrace the culture of my grandparents . I am bilingual , bicultural and have two addresses : Dallas , Texas , and Mexico City . I have affinity for both the United States and Mexico , and that ' s perfectly fine .
