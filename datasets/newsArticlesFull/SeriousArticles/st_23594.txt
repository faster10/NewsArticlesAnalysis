A passport was found near the site of one of the bombings belonging to a Syrian man named Ahmed Almohamed ( 25 ) , who is considered a suspect in the attack . The Serbian newspaper Blic said he had crossed into the country on October 7th , having arrived four days earlier in Leros , Greece . The paper also reported that French security officials had asked their Serbian counterparts for help as the man had been registered in the southern Serbian town of Presevo . A Greek newspaper , Protothema , said he was travelling with a second man , Mohammed Almuhamed , and published pictures purporting to show their travel documents . As ever , such details are hard to verify . It cannot be ruled out that the men were travelling under false documents ? the Guardian has previously reported on the burgeoning trade in fake and stolen passports .
