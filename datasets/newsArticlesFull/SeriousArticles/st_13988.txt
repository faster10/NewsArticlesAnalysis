DELANEY DOWNER Tom Cotton sees a link between Social Security Disability Insurance and societal collapse . " It s hard to say what came first or caused the other : population decline or increased disability usage . Or maybe economic stagnation caused both . Regardless , there seems to be , at least at the county and regional level , something like a Disability Tipping Point , " Cotton said today in a speech at the Heritage Foundation . " After a certain point , when disability keeps climbing and becomes endemic , employers will struggle to find employees or begin or continue to move out of the area . Population continues to fall , and a downward spiral kicks in , driving once thriving communities into further decline . Not only that , but once this kind of spiral begins , communities could begin to suffer other social of plagues as well , such as heroin or meth addiction and associated crime . " Yikes !
