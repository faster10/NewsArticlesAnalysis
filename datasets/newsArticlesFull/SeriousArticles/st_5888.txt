Fitts : There were real substantial differences from the 1940s even through the early 1990s . . . . The Japanese would sacrifice bunt far more than the Americans ( they still do but less than they used to ) . Players didn ' t go first to third on singles often . They would play line drives on hops rather than trying to make a shoestring catch and risk giving up more bases . It was a very conservative brand of baseball . Since the ties have become closer , Japan ' s baseball has become more aggressive , more exciting , in my opinion .
