I like to joke that the difference between other places I ' ve lived and Indiana is that seeing a goat or a chicken used to be a field trip now it ' s my commute . Humor aside , though , one of the perks of living much closer to farmland is the access that we have to amazingly fresh food . I haven ' t always been the healthiest of eaters , but in recent years that has changed . Two summers ago , we participated in a " farm share , " where every week we would get a box of organically raised produce .
