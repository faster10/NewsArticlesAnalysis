Pat Forde , Yahoo ! Sports : " This ' Bama team came into the College Football Playoff championship game leading the nation in scoring defense and built offensively around the Heisman Trophy winner . The defense was shredded , running back Derrick Henry was largely silenced in the second half . ' Bama was backed against the wall by a Clemson team that kept coming , confidence flourishing , belief blooming ? for a while in the third quarter the Tigers were one big play away from taking control . And still Alabama won . Too many weapons , too many ways to beat even the best opponents . "
