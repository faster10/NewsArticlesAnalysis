When I meet Bellucci , she s dressed in a Max Mara black pencil skirt and shirt , her hair is long and her makeup is flawless . She harks back to an old world glamour of her Italian predecessor , Sophia Loren . In fact , the costume designer on the set of Spectre said with a hint of amusement , I always give actresses UGG boots to go from their trailer to the set , but when I presented the UGG boots to Monica , she refused and instead walked with the 12cm Louboutins from her trailer to the set . She believes in femininity . You ll never see her in a pair of track pants .
