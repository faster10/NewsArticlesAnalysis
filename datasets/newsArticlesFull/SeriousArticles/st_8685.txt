This entire situation reads like Scott is desperate to secure meaningless wins in an effort to save his job , no matter what the cost to the franchise , and the irony is that the last thing the Lakers should be evaluating when it comes to Scott ' s coaching performance is wins and losses . But still , even if you want to get crazy and say the Lakers have a chance to make a run this year and win some games and crawl into the hunt for a playoff spot ( you should have your head examined if you believe this , but still . . . ) , wouldn ' t you still be wise to manage Bryant ' s minutes early on so as to limit his chance of injury and enhance his long term availibility ?
