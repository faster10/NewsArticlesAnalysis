The prime minister was in fine form on Friday . In the morning , he issued an invitation to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to talk about the stalled legislation on the goods and services tax , over tea . That same evening , he delivered an address to Parliament , bringing the Constitution Day debate in Lok Sabha to a close , in which the binding theme was the acknowledgement of a shared commitment to the rules of the game . That morning gesture is a heartening first .
