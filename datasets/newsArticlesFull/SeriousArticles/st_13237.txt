Fury celebrated taking Wladimir Klitschko s WBA , IBF and WBO titles , by serenading the 50 , 000 crowd at Dusseldorf s Esprit Arena with Aerosmith s I Don t Want To Miss A Thing and he was no less unorthodox on his first day as champion , as he said goodbye to his camp shortly after midday to catch the overnight ferry to Hull with his pregnant wife , Paris . There was no sore head , from bottle or fist . Fury , who has long given up booze , celebrated with the soft stuff and while he agreed that Klitschko had caught him flush a few times , the Ukrainian s punches had not shaken him and had left only minor bruises over his eyes .
