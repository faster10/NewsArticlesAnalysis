In this sense , Rushkoff is right to talk about how , in a networked and wired world , politics is different . It is now much cheaper to get your message out . Where 20 years ago a candidate would have to raise hundreds or thousands of dollars to fund a mass mailing , voters are now just a mouse click away . Not enough money to buy traditional advertising ? There is the Internet Facebook and Twitter , for example . Ron Paul , hardly a favorite of corporate America , has managed to use this new technology to raise several million dollars in just a day .
