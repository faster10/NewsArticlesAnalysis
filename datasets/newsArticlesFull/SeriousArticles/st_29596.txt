Most of the meteorologists I know who were out in the field that day are represented by the dots south and east of the storm circulation . Many of them contributed useful information to the National Weather Service in the form of eyewitness accounts of the tornado formation , that were not able to be detected by the weather service radars in the Oklahoma City area . Some of them were on instrumented vehicles that included mobile Doppler Radar that also contributed to the excellent warnings issued for that tornado .
