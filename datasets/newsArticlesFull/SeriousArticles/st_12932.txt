Which doesn ' t mean that " Tropic Thunder " which was written by Stiller , Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen isn ' t funny . It can be scattershot , even with its fairly safe targets , but when it hits it hits dead on . ( It ' s not wildly original and outrageous , though , to anyone who ' s seen Coogan in " Tristram Shandy : A Cock and Bull Story " or watched the Ricky Gervais series " Extras , " in which Stiller played himself in one episode . ) iReport . com : Share your thoughts on ' Tropic Thunder '
