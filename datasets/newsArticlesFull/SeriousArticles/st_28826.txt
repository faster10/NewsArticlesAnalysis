But Allertova cringed every time she came out of her service action onto that left leg , and was even more ineffective in her return games . Lacking the explosive movement required to get to Konta s well aimed serves , she never even brought up break point . I hurt my leg in the opening round , a disconsolate Allertova said after the match , which was played under the HiSense Arena roof after a damp and drizzly morning in Melbourne . Today it was just not me on the court . It was hard to play every point the way I ? wanted . But Jo is going up and up since the French Open . If she plays the way the way she is playing right now , she can win her next match .
