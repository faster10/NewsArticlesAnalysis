Kelce , by the way , had a big game in the season opener , catching six passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns . So did Jamaal Charles , who had five catches for 46 yards and a touchdown . Charles is out for the year , but it makes sense to see if the Texans linebackers and secondary can adequately cover Kelce and , say , Charcandrick West out of the backfield this time around . Some screens should be run , too . It will also be interesting to see if the Texans can contain Smith s running ability again he rushed nine times for only 15 yards in that game .
