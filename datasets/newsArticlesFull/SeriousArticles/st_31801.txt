Miller : I actually push that , to be honest . We just did the cover of Spin magazine . When I saw that it ' s just a beautiful portrait of her , I was like , yes ! Thank God ! I ' m not self loathing or particularly insecure in my day to day , but I really hate being photographed . I hate looking at pictures of myself . I immediately just start tearing it apart . It ' s a lot like the creative process as well . I ' m just really , really hard on myself . I like having her be the face of the band . She loves performing and she loves being photographed and she loves making videos . She looks great and she ' s confident . I ' m the polar opposite . Even live , I ' m never front lit . I prefer to have the music speak for me .
