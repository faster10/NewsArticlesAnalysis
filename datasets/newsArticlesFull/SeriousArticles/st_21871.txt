On the trip to drop my sister off at medical school , we were kicked out of the hotel by the manager . I ' m not sure if he was a racist but my father was convinced of that . In my memory , he was a Vietnamese War Vet who was suffering from PTSD , but childhood memory is tricky and I can ' t trust its reliability . I just remember the feelings of anger , of fury , of turbulence as we stood in the parking lot with our hastily packed bags . The crazy manager guy screamed at us to leave the premises and he didn ' t mistake us for Chinese . He got the nomenclature right . He called us " gooks . "
