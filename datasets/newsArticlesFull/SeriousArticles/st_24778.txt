No communities have been spared war has decimated entire families , leaving behind agony and terrible memories filled with fire , fearful screams and the smell of burning flesh . War cannot be measured by the structural damages it causes war , burns in the heart of men long after the canons have been made quiet . Yemenis though have risen time and time again from the pyres lit by Saudi Arabia with grace and generosity , pulling together to resist together . We owe such bravery to be told , Dr Karim told me in an interview .
