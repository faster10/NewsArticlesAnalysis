McLaughlin : I agree to all of that and I think , additionally , it was interesting for me to discover the moments I ' ve had of : ' I should just be doing this I should just be parenting ' have not come ever from not wanting to be working or a lack of passion to be working . It comes from moments where there aren ' t enough hours in the day . It ' s wishing I had more time to do both . I feel really blessed to be able to go to work every day . I have no question that it makes me a better parent . It fulfills me so much that I am able to be so much more present with my son .
