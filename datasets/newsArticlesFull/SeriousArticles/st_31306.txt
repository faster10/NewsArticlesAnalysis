This week Salon writer Daniel Denvir wrote about how Hillary Clinton sold out working women by supporting welfare reform during her husband s administration .

What s interesting about Denvir s article , however , isn t its central argument . It is his blithe dismissal of any claims that sexism shapes perceptions of Clinton and his unwillingness to acknowledge that breaking men s 226 year lock on the presidency could be a goal with any value at all .
