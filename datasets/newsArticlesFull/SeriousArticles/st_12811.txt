This list is mostly unsurprising . The emphasis on foreign policy stands out , though . It s often assumed Clinton s experience as a senator and secretary of state gives her a comparative advantage over Sanders , especially in a climate of heightened national security concerns . But the Democratic base is justifiably suspicious of Clinton on this front , given her hawkish history . So long as the economy and foreign policy are central issues , Democrats are not going to flock to Clinton with the kind of enthusiasm she needs ? if that wasn t evident already , it is now .
