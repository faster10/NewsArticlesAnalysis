Remember one of my cardinal rules of saving grocery dollars : Wasted food is the most expensive food you buy , no matter how cheap it was at the store . So , be sure to check your refrigerator for lurking ingredients on their last legs so that you can leverage all your leftovers instead of tossing them . Use that leftover heavy cream you bought for mashed potatoes to make a quick homemade spicy butterscotch pudding . Use half a sour cream container to make your mom ' s crazy Jell o salad . Find a way to use up the other half ( those taquitos bail us out yet again ! ) .
