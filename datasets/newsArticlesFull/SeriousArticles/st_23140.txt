Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola didn t play in the first meeting , an overtime ? win by the Broncos . The Denver secondary lacks depth and corner ? Chris Harris Jr . played the Steeler game with basically one arm due to a shoulder injury . If Brady has time , watch out . As for the Broncos , C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman ran for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the first meeting against New England , ? and there s no reason why they shouldn t try to duplicate that effort against a linebacker crew that is banged up and minus Jerod Mayo ( placed on IR earlier this week ) . Patrick Chung could be key for the Pats .
