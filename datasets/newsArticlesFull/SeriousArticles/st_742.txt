In terms of looking ahead to the 2017 ballot , those four names above are the big ones . Of those , Rodriguez and maybe Guerrero have first ballot potential . Ramirez has undeniable Hall of Fame numbers , but his two PED related suspensions late in his career will no doubt exact a cost in votes . As for Posada , his case will likely be one that develops over multiple years . Others ? Mike Cameron , Javier Vazquez , J . D . Drew , Magglio Ordonez , Derrek Lee , Edgar Renteria , Melvin Mora , Carlos Guillen , Jason Varitek , Orlando Cabrera , Aaron Rowand , Pat Burrell , Freddy Sanchez , Arthur Rhodes , Julio Lugo , and Danys Baez will also be on the ballot for the first time .
