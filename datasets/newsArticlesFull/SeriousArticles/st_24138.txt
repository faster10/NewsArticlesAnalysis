But trust me , lenders would much rather have an empty house than a trashed one . Unfortunately , they ' re starting to get both . Some homeowners , distraught over an imminent foreclosure , are destroying their homes before abandoning them . One Oregon man went so far as to lock three live pigs inside his house last year , making it unlivable , let alone sellable . You can think of it as a " reverse housewarming gift " to his bank . Unfortunately , such behavior is leaving banks across the country stuck with empty , trashed homes , along with mortgages that will never be repaid .
