This is why peer to peer finance systems are a welcome innovation . They enable people to take control of a portion on their savings and lend or invest it directly into ventures that they feel personally attracted to . One of my favorites is Abundance Generation , which allows people to invest directly in wind farms . It gives an active role to someone who might otherwise passively deposit savings in unaccountable , non transparent banks . Other sites like Zidisha enable peer to peer microlending in developing countries .
