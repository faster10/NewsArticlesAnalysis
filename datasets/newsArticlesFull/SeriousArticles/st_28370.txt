In writing about parenting over the years , and talking about it with other parents , I ' ve become convinced that a lot of parents with young children worry more that they ' re giving their kids too much rather than too little . The concern is that in trying to keep their kids from struggling , they ' re making their lives too comfy . At the very least , most of us are probably giving our kids much more than what we were given by our parents when we were growing up . We need to ask : What harm is this doing ?
