Rape is a crime of power and dominance , and social media provide new ways of asserting that power to hurt victims over and over again . Gang rape takes on a whole new meaning when images and slurs are posted and forwarded and spread endlessly . Adolescent sexual assaults are particularly likely to go viral ( more so than instances of adult rape ) because of the " everyone knows everything about everyone " culture of middle and high school . The ubiquity of cell phones with cameras and the power of the Internet make for faster , farther reaching gossip , name calling , character assassination and ultimately despair for the victim .
