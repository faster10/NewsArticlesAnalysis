The core etiology of today ' s Flint problems goes back 18 years , to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ' s decision not to enforce the installation of corrosion control systems in accordance with the Federal Lead and Copper Rule of 1998 . This set the stage for severe corrosion in the water pipes . That problem was compounded by a subsequent financial crisis that led Flint to stop paying the Detroit Water and Sewerage board for water from Lake Huron and convert to a different supply line . In April 2014 , Flint started to source water from the Flint River as a temporary measure . Soon after , residents started to complain about the taste , smell and appearance of the water and voiced health concerns , such as skin rashes .
