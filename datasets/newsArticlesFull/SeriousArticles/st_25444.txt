After what seemed like interminable negotiations , the UAE agreed to join Saudi Arabia and the other eight coalition members to launch airstrikes against Al Houthi rebels , because it concluded that the Emirates s own security was at risk . At first , the UAE deployed a few dozen warplanes , though it also put boots on the ground when the battle required it . It took serious casualties under both Operation Decisive Storm ( March 26 April 21 , 2015 ) and Operation Restoring Hope ( April 22 , 2015 present ) , as a total of 70 Emirati soldiers were martyred . This fact alone sealed the UAE s resolve that would deny Iran , which carried the banner of Al Houthis , any kind of victory .
