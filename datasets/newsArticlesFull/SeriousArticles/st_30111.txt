Ballack : Experience is always important . I played in 2002 and 2006 , once I finished second , once I finished third , so one place improvement maybe . When we get into a tournament it ' s always step by step , we have to think from round to round . Obviously it ' s the last one I will play so it gives me big , big motivation to play a good tournament this year . I think it ' s a bit similar to the past that when we go in the tournament we have a good team . We played a good qualification , but we are not one of the top favorites so maybe it plays a little into our hands . We have quite a young team , and if there is not too much pressure on the team maybe it will help the team a little bit .
