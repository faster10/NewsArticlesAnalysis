Rabbi Maurice Eisendrath is seen to the right of Dr King , holding the torah during a silent prayer protest against the Vietnam War . Dr King was a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War , believing that U . S . presence in Southeast Asia smacked of imperialism and diverted money and resources away from the black poor . In a letter to King about Vietnam , Eisendrath wrote : You have not only my unswerving admiration , my fondest wishes , and my prayers . You have my whole hearted support and deeply felt pledge of cooperation and assistance in this painful but imperative task of seeking peace and justice for all the creatures of God .
