Langewiesche : There ' s no quarrel at all . The book elevates legitimately and correctly what Mr Sullenberger and Mr Skiles did as pilots . . . . Without those two pilots in the cockpit , doing the job they did , people would not have survived . Clearly , they were flying a fly by wire airplane , and that ' s part of the story . I never imply that , had they been flying a 737 , things would have been worse . That would be highly speculative and silly . I ' m writing about what did happen . There ' s no argument here from my side .
