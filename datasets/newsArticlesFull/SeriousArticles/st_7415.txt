Biskupic : I would not sell her short on anything . She learned to be effective setting herself apart both as a public figure and on the bench . I believe that she will continue to be more prominent because of what she represents to the nation that believes in this American Dream for people who came up from essentially nothing , as she did in the Bronx . But I think that we ' ll also see her not just out there as a public figure , but as someone who wants to be an advocate in prisoner cases and also in racially charged cases . We ' ll see more of that as she becomes more comfortable , not just off the bench , but in the black robes right there on the bench .
