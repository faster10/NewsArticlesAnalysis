Still , ? bringing in the fence sitters ? is what will separate the winners from the losers on Caucus Day . In 2008 , 137 , 000 Iowans caucused for the first time to push Barack Obama to a big win .

These are the things that we talk about endlessly amongst ourselves , which may be part of the reason we never get invites to New Year s parties anymore .
