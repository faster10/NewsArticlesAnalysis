Still , it does seem unlikely that we could end up with another billionaire in the race . After all , Citizens United ? anticipated they would simply finance politicians to do their bidding , not take the reins themselves . And Bloomberg has threatened to run for president for many years and never did it ? but then so did Donald Trump and look where he is now . It s entirely possible that rather than being worried about the alleged extremists in both parties and feeling that he needs to offer the country his special brand of moderate centrism , Bloomberg is simply feeling competitive with his fellow New York fat cat . ? He probably always assumed that he would be the historic first billionaire president in American history . Is he going to let the clownish Donald Trump be the first to crack the gold ceiling ?
