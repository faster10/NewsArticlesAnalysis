The dogs weren t a piece of equipment to us . I think I can speak for around 95 percent of the dog handlers that I have talked with since the war , and everybody said , I loved that dog , Rick Clagget , a Vietnam veteran who went on to work for the Vietnam Dog Handlers Association , told Vice . It wasn t a piece of equipment like a gun or something like that . It was a living , breathing thing that had emotions and played and did all kinds of dog things . You just fall in love with that dog . ?
