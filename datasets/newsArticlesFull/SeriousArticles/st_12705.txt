Undoubtedly , one must be a genius and a highly articulate person to manage to receive a red carpet reception in a country within hours of delivering a fierce speech against the same country just in its neighbourhood . On the other hand , India has constantly been fooling Pakistan in the name of dialogue for the last four decades . Therefore , now it is only our good luck that Google has yet not thought of displaying a list of world s most stupid nations . Thank God ! And thanks to Google indeed !
