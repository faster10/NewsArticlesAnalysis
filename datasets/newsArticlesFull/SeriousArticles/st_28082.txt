Zakaria : In the past the protests were always the street against the state , and the clerics all sided with the state . When the reformist president , Mohammed Khatami , was in power , he entertained the possibility of siding with the street , but eventually stuck with the establishment . The street and state are at odds again but this time the clerics are divided . Khatami has openly sided with the challenger , Mir Hossein Moussavi , as has the reformist Grand Ayatollah Montazeri . So has Ali Larijani , the speaker of the parliament and a man with strong family connections to the highest levels of the religious hierarchy . Behind the scenes , the former president , Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , now head of the Assembly of Experts , another important constitutional body , is waging a campaign against Ahmadinejad and even the supreme leader himself . If senior clerics dispute Khamenei ' s divine assessment and argue that the Guardian Council is wrong , it is a death blow to the basic premise behind the Islamic Republic of Iran . It is as if a senior Soviet leader had said in 1980 that Karl Marx was not the right guide to economic policy .
