I don t want to shock you . It s going to be a rough afternoon for you here . I have been in politics and elected official for 25 years in Congress and eight years before that as a mayor of the largest city in the state of Vermont . So I do know something about what elected officials are supposed to do . These issues are not new to me . I presided over city for eight years , house for 16 and the Senate for nine , so I think I can handle all the ex officio duties that come with being President of the United States .
