" I think in the NFL , when you talk about great quarterbacks , they don ' t really compare great quarterbacks . They say , ' Oh , Joe Montana is great . ' You know , ' Tom Brady is great . Aaron Rodgers is great . Steve Young is great . ' Terry Bradshaw , all those great quarterbacks , they never compare them as much . But when it comes to our sport , we ' re so eager to say , ' Who is better : Oscar or Michael Jordan ? ' or ' Jordan or LeBron or Kobe Bryant or these guys ? ' instead of just accepting greatness . And if you understand the history of the sport , then there is no way you could ever forget Oscar Robertson . This guy , he averaged a triple double for like , forever . "
