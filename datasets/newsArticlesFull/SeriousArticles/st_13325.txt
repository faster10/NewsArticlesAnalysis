As an American I plead with you that we are running out of time . It is critical that we dislodge ourselves from political distractions . We must return to the task of looking for the right man or woman who can answer the bloodcurdling cry of a nation that is in search of a leader with a courageous effective plan for the war in Iraq , and the medical , moral , economic and security issues that are being ignored by these distractions . If we do not , we will have done a terrible disservice to our coming generations .
