Don ' t believe me ? You must then have missed , last night , when Donald Trump masterfully " played the 9 11 card . " Seriously , Trump was better at it than even Rudy Giuliani ever was and that ' s really saying something ( please remember that Giuliani ' s campaign was famously described as : " a noun , a verb , and 9 11 " ) . Trump was much better at playing the 9 11 card than Hillary Clinton ' s earlier fumbling attempt ( while explaining why she loved Wall Street so much ) . There ' s just no denying it : Donald Trump is getting better at campaigning .
