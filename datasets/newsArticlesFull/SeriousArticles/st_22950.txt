In response , thousands of women and men marched Tuesday in Cairo ' s Tahrir Square . Observers say it was the largest demonstration of women in Egypt in decades . Not since 1919 , when women mobilized under the leadership of feminist Hoda Sha ' rawi in anti colonial demonstrations against the British have so many Egyptian women taken to the streets . ( After representing Egyptian women at the International Women Suffrage Alliance in Rome in 1923 , Sha ' rawi returned to Cairo and very publicly removed her veil . )
