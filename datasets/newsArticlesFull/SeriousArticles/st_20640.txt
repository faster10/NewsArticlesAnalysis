There is no doubt in my mind that ( the old system ) suited my driving style . The reason I was able to win at so many different tracks was the consistency that our team had and that I had at all the different tracks . . . . ? That paid off when you were trying to win the championship under a 36 race schedule . I didn ' t want to see it come down to that final 10 , because some of those final 10 were not all tracks that suited me . It actually suited others pretty well and so I felt like it was not benefiting me .
