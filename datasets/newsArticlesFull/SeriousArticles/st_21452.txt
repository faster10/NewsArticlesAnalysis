A couple of days ago , I was on the bus at 5 : 41am as I had an early lecture to attend . A white middle aged man came on to the bus and asked to buy a weekly ticket costing ? 34 . He paid ? 30 and began to rummage in his bag for the remaining ? 4 . The driver took the money , and waited for the man . In the minutes that follow the man is unable to find the correct change and panics if he doesn t get on this bus he has to wait at least 45 minutes in a leaky bus shelter for the next one . I rummage through my own bag and find ? 4 . I proceed to give the change to the driver . Both the man and the driver look at me in awe , like they didn t expect me to do what I did . The most beautiful thing about it all wasn t my charitable act , but that through this I had broken the stigma that they held about me .
