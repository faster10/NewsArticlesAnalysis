Litvinenko had worked for the KGB during the final years of the Soviet Union , and after the Soviet Union collapsed he worked for its Russian successor , the Federal Counterintelligence Service ( FSK ) which was eventually reorganized into the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) . His work largely involved investigations into criminal organizations , though he also moonlighted in security for the oligarch Boris Berezovsky . He would later claim that the FSB ordered him to kill Berezovsky and after he went public with allegations about the FSB in November 1998 , he was dismissed from the agency .
