Well , I believe that public policy should follow the science and follow the data . I am the son of two mathematicians and computer programmers and scientists . In the debate over global warming , far too often politicians in Washington ? and for that matter , a number of scientists receiving large government grants ? disregard the science and data and instead push political ideology The scientific evidence doesn t support global warming . For the last 18 years , the satellite data ? we have satellites that monitor the atmosphere . The satellites that actually measure the temperature showed no significant warming whatsoever Climate change is the perfect pseudoscientific theory for a big government politician who wants more power . Why ? Because it is a theory that can never be disproven .
