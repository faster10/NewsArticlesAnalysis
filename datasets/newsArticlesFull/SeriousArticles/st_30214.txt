The Martian . ? So much of the talk has been about the science , rare for a movie of this big budget kind . And of course the spectacle , which really did draw from , and look , like , Mars . All well and good . But that wasn t the greatest innovation . The greatest innovation was to make a movie this grand out of stakes so low . One person ? one botanist ? ? is what s on the line throughout this movie . At least Gravity had two people . Every Marvel movie seems to have a planet or two in peril . Yet the more lives at stake , the less we seem to care about what happens to them . And The Martian , about one guy we got to know really well , made us care a lot .
