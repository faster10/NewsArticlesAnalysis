McKay ' s writing credits include Anchorman 2 , The Other Guys , and Marvel hit Ant Man which he co wrote with the star of the movie Paul Rudd . One thing a keen observer should know is that underneath the cloak of comedy all these movies have explored something that has gone wrong with the system . McKay ' s satire doesn ' t sting , but it sure as hell makes you think . Be it with Anchorman where he satirised news channels or The Other Guys where he showed bureaucrats ' connection with Wall Street .
