For the drivers this means that apart from having to deliver during the race , they also have to attend corporate events of their sponsors and appear in their adverts . Hence we see Alonso and Hamilton looking implausibly chummy in commercials for Spanish bank Santander . While seen as distracting by some , it is something the top drivers cannot afford to do without . Without sponsorship revenue a driver is worthless to his team , as Christijan Albers found to his cost when he failed to bring in the promised sponsorship to Spyker .
