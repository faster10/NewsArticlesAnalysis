This has been the key to understanding why Carson has defied the political odds , stumped the skeptics , and is on the verge of outmuscling Trump on the one issue that Trump has had a field day with , and that ' s an unfettered willingness to let fly with what angry , disenchanted , disillusioned , borderline nihilistic , political establishment loathing conservatives want to hear . Carson tops Trump on this because while he lets fly with his eye and media attention zingers on everything from the Mt . Vesuvius eruption a millennium ago to equating homosexuality with bestiality . He does it with a quiet almost child like sincerity and belief in what he ' s actually saying . It may sound dumb and silly , but the way he says it never sounds stage y and rehearsed . This pushes him even higher up on the honesty scale among voters who think and just know that every other word out of a traditional politician ' s mouth is a lie or double talk .
