Just two days before the Paris rally , my friend Raif Badawi was removed , in shackles , from a mini bus outside the Al Jafali mosque in Jeddah as a large crowd gathered around him after Friday prayers . According to eyewitnesses , he closed his eyes and raised his head skyward as a security officer approached him from behind with a large cane and started to beat him . Witnesses say Raif was lashed 50 times . Afterwards , he was taken back to prison where he is serving a 10 year sentence for blogging .
