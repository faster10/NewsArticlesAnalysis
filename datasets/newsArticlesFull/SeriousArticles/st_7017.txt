Those 30 , 000 e mails initially described by sources as " flirtatious " ? Unnamed defense officials put out the word the next day that there were far fewer maybe a few hundred , one told The Washington Post and that there was " no affair " between Allen and Jill Kelley , the Tampa activist . Or perhaps they were " overly flirtatious , " anonymous Pentagon officials told The New York Times , and there were 30 , 000 pages but some just contained a single sentence . And Allen may have called Kelley " sweetheart " in the e mails , reports The Wall Street Journal .
