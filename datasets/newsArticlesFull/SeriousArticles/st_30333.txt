Kramer ' s collision was one of many that this tournament saw . Argentina ' s Javier Mascherano cracked his head in the semifinal against the Dutch and continued to play , while Uruguay ' s lvaro Pereira went down unconscious after a knee to the head during his team ' s first round match against England .
