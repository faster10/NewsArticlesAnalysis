The glitch is that FBI records often fail to report the final outcomes of arrests . The case might have been dismissed or the charges reduced , but a prospective employer might not know it from the FBI background check . Roughly one third of all felony arrests don ' t result in conviction , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , and many more are reduced to misdemeanors . By the Justice Department ' s own count , roughly 50 of FBI background records are incomplete and don ' t include the final outcome of an arrest .
