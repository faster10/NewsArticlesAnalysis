The bigger issue here is what to do or say about those who don t believe there is a problem in ignoring actors of color and literally dismissing them in the way that Michael Caine did . Caine s comments came right on the heels of Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling , who said the Oscar boycott is racist to whites . As if those affected by the constant disregard for their talent should just be quiet and go away . Or maybe they should be patient and wait forever for something to change , as Michael Caine suggested , rather than speaking out and doing something about it .
