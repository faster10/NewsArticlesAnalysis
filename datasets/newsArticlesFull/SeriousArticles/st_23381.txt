Polls and polls and polls ! With the holidays firmly in the rearview mirror , the nation ' s pollsters are in full gear , flashing data aplenty about who ' s up and who ' s down in Iowa , New Hampshire and nationwide . Our new polls from over the weekend showed very tight races on both sides of the aisle for both of the first two nominating contests ( with the exception of the GOP race in New Hampshire , where Trump is dominating thanks to a four way pileup on establishment side . ) Here are our two words of caution on all the polls out there . 1 ) Consider whether or not you ' re dealing with LIKELY voters or the larger GOP electorate . Our NBC WSJ Marist polls looked at both sets of data including our first look to date at a likely voter model and we found some interesting differences , particularly for the Cruz v . Trump matchup in Iowa . Cruz is narrowly ahead of Trump in the state under a likely voter model , but Trump has a two point advantage when the universe of potential GOP caucus goers is considered . Our second word of caution : Hypothetical head to head matchups are plenty fun , but keep in mind that one reason that Bernie Sanders is likely performing so much better than Clinton is that he ' s been the target of ( at least to date ) so much less negative advertising and opposition research than the Democratic frontrunner has . Does he have a great talking point in saying that right now , he looks " more electable " than Clinton ? Sure . Are those numbers very , very fluid ? Absolutely .
