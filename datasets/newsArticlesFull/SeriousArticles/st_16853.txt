ICANN has set up a detailed system for handling issues for each disputed top level domain , which includes four types of objection processes , review panels and third party arbitrators . The full process and resulting applicant guidebook has taken about five years to develop and includes various advisory committees to help represent third party interests , such as the the Governmental Advisory Committee ( GAC ) , which advises ICANN on international and local laws . Saudi Arabia does not currently have a representative on the GAC .
