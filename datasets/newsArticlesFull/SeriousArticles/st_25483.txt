Dennis Dodd , CBSSports . com : " Now it ' s time to reconsider what it means to be the greatest coach not only in college football , but perhaps in team sports . Red Auerbach ( NBA ) , Scotty Bowman ( NHL ) and John Wooden ( college basketball ) come to mind . But even they didn ' t have to count on 18 year olds to build a dynasty not without compensating them . They didn ' t do it in an era when the strongest conference ( SEC ) is in its golden age . Maybe the best comparison is Bill Belichick , Saban ' s mentor . Who wouldn ' t want to be in on their next telephone conversation ? "
