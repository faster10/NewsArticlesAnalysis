Nepali leaders , including the Maoists and Oli , have asked India at various levels to stop interfering in Nepal . They hesitate to admit that it was the India brokered deal in November 2005 that brought about the key political changes in the country in early 2006 that catapulted them to power . While politicians were debating how to involve people in settling the issue of monarchy vs republicanism , Nepal s leaders faced enormous pressure from their Maoist friends and the Indian embassy in Kathmandu ( all closely working with the government of India ) to settle the issue immediately . In their haste , Nepal s leaders chose not to involve the people . They even decided to forego the normal parliamentary process followed by any debate in deciding why Nepal should be republican and secular . India was in a hurry to recognise and welcome these changes .
