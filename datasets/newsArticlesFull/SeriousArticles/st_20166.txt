The real irony is that now , on the issue that most illuminates the differences between the major candidates for the Republican nomination , Cruz is especially flimsy , switching between an isolationist and hawkish bent depending on the day and whom he s talking to . This makes him even worse than Rubio and Trump , because at least with those candidates , we know what we re getting . Rubio is a trigger happy neocon , and Trump is someone who thinks he ll be able to deal or strong arm his way out of any potential conflict . Cruz is something much worse : an bergrifter positioning himself as an acceptable , nuanced alternative while still trying to figure out how to make a policy proposal that doesn t sound like a YouTube comment . Cruz will never convince the national electorate that this is enough , but luckily for the rest of us , he has no chance of getting Republicans to buy it , either .
