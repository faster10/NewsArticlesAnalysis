What about Lovie Smith ? He was fired after a 10 6 season in Chicago in 2012 and last week after a 6 10 season in Tampa , a four game improvement from his first season . Neither firing was fair , but I ve never been impressed with him as a head coach . His teams have always struggled to score . The Giants interviewed him and liked him before hiring Coughlin , so he could get another look . If they do hire Smith , then he surely has to keep McAdoo . Smith had the Bucs in the playoff race at 6 6 with rookie QB Jameis Winston , but they folded down the stretch and lost their last four . That s a bad look . Biggest plus : He made it to a Super Bowl with Rex Grossman at QB .
