Interestingly enough , Sanders and Clinton both have a case that they were short changed by the caucus process itself . As I explained on Tuesday , Sanders may have been hurt by the fact that the number of delegates assigned at each precinct is based on turnout during the past two general elections , not on how many people show up on caucus night . A precinct with seven county delegates , awards seven county delegates regardless of whether seven people show up to caucus or 700 do . Given Bernie s support appeared to be more concentrated around college campuses ? while Hillary s appeared more evenly spread out across the state ? it s possible that he didn t feel the full benefit of his passionate young fans as a result . FiveThirtyEight , meanwhile , found some evidence to suggest that Clinton was doing better relative to Sanders before the resorting process that occurred in all the precincts where Martin O Malley failed to reach the minimum support .
