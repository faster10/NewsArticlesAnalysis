Officer Gildardo Sierra shot Flint Farmer 16 times in June 2011 in a West Englewood neighborhood , his third shooting that year . Sierra told investigators he thought Farmer had a gun ? Farmer had only a cellphone . Despite having video footage of the shooting , the Chicago Police Department ruled the death justified , as it had Sierra ' s other two shootings that year . " He shouldn ' t have been where he was . We should ' ve had him off the street so that he was not in that particular environment and that problematic type of scenario , " McCarthy said during a meeting with the Tribune Editorial Board . McCarthy stripped Sierra of police powers and had him placed on paid desk duty . The Cook County state attorney ' s office didn ' t file criminal charges against Sierra , saying the video offered only a partial glimpse into what happened .
