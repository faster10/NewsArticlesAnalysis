I ' ve been saying it all week : we are officially through the looking glass . Donald Trump is the sole frontrunner of the Republican nomination race . He shows no signs whatsoever of fading . He insults audiences to their faces , and his numbers go up . In fact , while I was writing this article ( I ' ve since been informed ) , Trump said something completely outrageous today but I bet it won ' t hurt him in the polls , no matter how crazy . Choose your metaphor : bulletproof , Teflon , water off a duck ' s back . Unless the race gets more competitive as Republican voters start flocking to Carson , Rubio , or Cruz ( and , crucially , also start ignoring the other two ) , Trump may be untouchable . For now , at least , he is the only person worthy of the label of " frontrunner . "
