When I served on the board of Stop It Now , which is focused on the prevention of sexual abuse of children , I learned that more than 90 of abused children know their attacker . Once again , this defies our misguided belief that predators are like lions in the tall grass waiting to attack . The overwhelming reality is that they are individuals who manipulate trust and positions of power to gain access to their victims and control them . It is this reality that has led to such terms as " intimate partner violence " and " interpersonal violence " and " acquaintance rape . " Trust , access and familiarity are the tools of sustained abuse .
