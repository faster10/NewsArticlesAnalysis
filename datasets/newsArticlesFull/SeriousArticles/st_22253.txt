Germany plans to " significantly lower the hurdles " to deporting criminal foreigners following New Year ' s Eve assaults by crowds of mostly North African and Middle Eastern immigrants in Cologne , Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Tuesday . So far , 553 criminal complaints have been filed over the incidents . About 45 percent involve sexual offenses . The response came as Cologne officials said a group of Pakistanis and a Syrian were attacked , and as angry protesters in Leipzig waved signs saying " RAPEfugees " were not welcome .
