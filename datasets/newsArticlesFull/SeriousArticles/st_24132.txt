This victory comes after an odd campaign on both sides . Sarkozy started off courting the center by emphasizing his record of reforms and his role in solving the eurozone crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel . But in March , he decided to take a page from his own 2007 campaign and raid the extreme right electorate of Marine Le Pen instead . He emphasized themes like immigration , Islam and the necessity for a more protective , even protectionist , Europe . This time , however , the strategy backfired . Le Pen got a historic score in the first round , while Sarkozy sowed confusion in his own camp and lost .
