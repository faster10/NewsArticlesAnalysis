Let s start by setting the outsiders aside for the moment ? not because they re irrelevant , but because they ve been so dominant it s been hard to see beyond them ? and looking at the remaining group , those who the pundits are more accustomed to dealing with . Within this the outsiders removed , a Huffington Post customized polling average overview shows that Jeb Bush has held a lead almost continuously for most of the past year and a half , albeit not a very impressive one . Rubio has moved past him since late September , but he s slumping along with Bush the last few weeks , a pattern seen when Scott Walker ( remember him ? ) eclipsed Bush from early April to late May . Recalling how many times Romney saw others surge into the lead ahead of him , one can t help realize that Bush doesn t look so bad comparatively , if only the race had remained limited to elected politicians ? as it has for almost all of our history . Sure , his percentage of the total vote was always historically low , but that could be attributed to an unusually overcrowded race . So , take out the outsiders , and this race doesn t look very unusual at all .
