It includes nearly 40 feature films , many of them more than three hours long , largely preoccupied with examining the apparatus of social institutions : hospitals , high schools , parks and zoos . All of them are framed according to Wiseman ' s own rigorous observational style , which involves sustained scrutiny , no voice over and no interviews . He ' s into process , not personality . With a Wiseman film , it ' s up to the viewer to supply the commentary .
