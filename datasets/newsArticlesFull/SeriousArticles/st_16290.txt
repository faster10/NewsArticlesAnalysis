Clinton put the Vermont senator on the defensive at the first debate this month in Las Vegas , challenging his mixed record on gun control and implying that his brand of democratic socialism might work in Denmark but not here . Sanders essentially offered his rebuttal , pointing to a litany of issues ? trade deals , the Keystone XL pipeline , the Iraq War and gay rights ? where he took a principled stand and Clinton shifted her positions . At one point , Sanders borrowed an argument that Obama used successfully in his 2008 primary campaign against Clinton , declaring , I promise you tonight , as your president I will govern based on principle , not poll numbers . His cheering section roared in approval .
