" The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion , the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution , and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C . Byrd . Senator Byrd ' s story was uniquely American . He was born into wrenching poverty , but educated himself to become an authoritative scholar , respected leader , and unparalleled champion of our Constitution . He scaled the summit of power , but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved West Virginia . He had the courage to stand firm in his principles , but also the courage to change over time . "
