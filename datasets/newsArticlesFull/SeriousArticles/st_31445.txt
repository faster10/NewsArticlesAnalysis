He first met with Lohan about the project last December but cameras didn ' t roll until June . " When we first met with her , she had two probations , and when we finally closed the deal with her , there was only one probation , " Thompson says . " If we couldn ' t have gotten insurance , there would have been no movie . We wound up having to go to Lloyd ' s of London to get what we called incarceration insurance . . . . We had to protect ourselves that if she were to have violated her probation during production , we wouldn ' t have had to close down and lose our movie . "
