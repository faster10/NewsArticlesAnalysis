Game playing programs such as Deep Blue work by constructing search trees over all possible positions . If you tried to do this with go you would be looking at computing times in the millions , if not billions , of years . The DeepMind approach involved combining tree search ( enabled by Google s massive cloud computing power ) with deep neural networks , programs in which connections between layers of simulated neurons are strengthened through examples and experience ( as in the human brain ) .
