We respect Liz and Dick so much that we wanted to give them the last word , meaning that fourth wall interview of them speaking to camera throughout the film is the two of them speaking from the grave . We decided to dress them in the ultimate thespian outfit . They ' re sitting in a director ' s chair , in all black . It ' s almost like Hollywood heaven . And what they ' re saying is , " Listen , we were this , we were that . The paparazzi said this , the paparazzi said that . All these things written about us " let us tell you what they said about us , what was really going on , and how we really felt about each other . " That device , which was my homage to Elizabeth and Richard , has allowed them the last word on themselves as icons and on what the media and the celebrity crazed world can do with a couple . Maybe if we hadn ' t had all this attention paid to us , we could have kept it together , but there were too many balls we were trying to keep in the air . That ' s what Elizabeth ' s saying . That ' s what makes it tragic .
