Things got better , of course . Palmer finished 25 of 41 for 349 yards , three touchdowns and two interceptions . That s part of why this season feels different ? at least it does now after that heart stopping overtime win . The Cardinals have looked like a legitimate contender all season . Palmer ( 4 , 671 yards , 35 touchdowns , only 11 interceptions ) has played like an MVP . The only team better has been the Panthers , and the only better quarterback has been Cam Newton ? whom Palmer and the Cardinals must beat on Sunday with a trip to Super Bowl 50 on the line .
