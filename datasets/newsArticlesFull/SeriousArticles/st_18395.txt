Since economic freedom is inconsequential for Bernie , why would he defend it and its corollary , political freedom ? For Bernie , a secular progressive socialist , there just isn ' t much in America to defend . And down deep , Bernie is a Jew in denial , if not self hating . His father , like mine , was a Jewish immigrant from Poland whose family was killed in the Holocaust . But is Bernie consequently for limited , constitutional government as a bulwark against tyranny ? Does he necessarily favor the Second Amendment to assure citizens of the right to protect themself ? Does he clearly support Israel and Bibi Netanyahu over the Arabs and their Jew hating leaders ? No , no , and no .
