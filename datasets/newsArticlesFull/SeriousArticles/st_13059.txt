With the end of the war in Iraq , and the drawdown in Afghanistan , our military is getting smaller . Over the next year , more than a quarter million service members will transition from the military . In order for veterans to transition successfully , more communities across America must recognize the service they still have to give . We believe that when the story of this generation of veterans is written , it will not only be a story of the wars they have fought overseas , it will also be a story of the homes built , the parks restored , and the young minds engaged by veterans whose mission continues in communities here at home .
