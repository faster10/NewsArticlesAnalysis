NR : No . It ' s just now interesting to hear from you , Lewis , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front , and necessarily that was compromising my race . Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit stop to try and jump me . And then I had to cover him . So , first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer . So I ' m unhappy about that , of course , today . Other than that , not much to say .
