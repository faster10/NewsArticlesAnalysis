ISIS is under unprecedented military pressure in Iraq and Syria , but this does not mean it is going to implode . It can fight defensively as well as offensively . It looks as if it will not fight to the finish in battles in which enemy ground troops are supported by the US or Russian air forces . ISIS commanders are reported to believe that they made a mistake in fighting for so long at Kobani , where they may have lost more than 2 , 000 fighters to US air strikes . Instead , they will rely more on guerrilla tactics in Syria and Iraq and expand the zone of conflict by carrying out terrorist attacks abroad like those we have just seen in Paris .
