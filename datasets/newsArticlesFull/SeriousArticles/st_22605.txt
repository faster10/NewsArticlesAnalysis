That was not exactly the play , Aaron Rodgers said with a laugh . I threw the first pass to James Jones and I was kind of trailing the play looking for what was going to happen . I saw Richard get it and turn back to me and I was thinking , No , no , no , no , no ! I m the last line of defense here . As I caught it , I knew I was going to have to try and make somebody miss to keep this thing alive because nobody s behind me . I was going to have to run for some yards in order to throw it . I had my fast Adidas on as I showed off on that touchdown earlier in the game but I wasn t able to get away from those guys . But luckily , my face mask was grabbed .
