Turkey , a NATO ally , hosts over 2 . 5 million refugees . It is referring refugee cases to UNHCR , which is then referring eligible and vulnerable cases to the United States or other countries for resettlement consideration . Around 600 , 000 refugees are registered in Jordan , though the government estimates that there are over one million living in the country . These large numbers are straining Jordan ' s infrastructure including water , education , and healthcare and could impact the stability of this key U . S . ally . A significant portion of the Syrian refugees slated to be resettled to the United States this year will come from Jordan .
