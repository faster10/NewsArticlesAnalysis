There have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism the murder of a British soldier , Lee Rigby , in the spring of 2013 comes to mind , or the vicious attacks in London of July 7 , 2005 , which left 52 dead and over 700 injured . The British have had to confront terror , and they ' ve done so without vilifying large parts of their own population . Indeed , they ' ve been forced to come to terms with what I would call British Exceptionalism the old imperial feeling that nobody who is not British can possibly lead a civilized way of life . ( As Americans , of course , we struggle with our own feelings of exceptionalism , preferring to think that our ways are always the best and truest ways . )
