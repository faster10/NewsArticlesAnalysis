Chlumsky : It definitely makes you start to see the world in a different way in the sense you start to weigh who your friends were before and who your friends were after . As far as adults groveling , my mom was really wonderful about that on set . Anytime somebody would ask what I wanted and I didn ' t ask her first I would get into trouble , and that was absolutely right . She was very sensitive to people treating me differently than anyone else on the crew , and I ' m so grateful she made a point of that .
