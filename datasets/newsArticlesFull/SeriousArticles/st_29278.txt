Konta s back up to a 58 success rate with her first serve now but it certainly hasn t been the weapon it was earlier in the tournament . Kerber s all business and working her opponent around the court to precipitate the errors and soon finds herself at 0 30 with a bit more of an opening . Kerber is presented two break points and needs to play half a dozen desperate , defensive strokes before Konta crunches a big backhand winner to save the first and equally stern stuff from Konta takes care of the second too . It s a case of third time lucky in the end as Konta nets to hand the German another crucial break . It s not looking good for Johanna Konta in Melbourne .
