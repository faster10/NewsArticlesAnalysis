The same warning applies to the Western businessmen lining up at the borders to enter Iran . No doubt there will be many Iranians willing to help them get rich , if it s mutually beneficial . No doubt some will make money , though it might be hard to hold on to it in a country whose courts are politicized and whose judges are selected by an arbitrary and opaque process . But either way , there isn t much point in wishfully hoping that foreign investment will open up Iran either : In the current circumstances , it s far more likely to enrich the existing elite . If so , the result will be greater repression , more effective disinformation , and of course more money for the export of the ideology of the Iranian revolution to Syria , Lebanon , and Iraq .
