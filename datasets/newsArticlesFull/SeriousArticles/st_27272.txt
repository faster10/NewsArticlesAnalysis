John Zeller ? another Gateway Market regular ? sat at the next table , studying Italian . Oh yes , he said , I love to caucus . It s fun . At least the Democratic ones . At the Democratic caucus , voters gather according to who they support , but if their candidate fails to reach 15 of attendees , they have to disband and support another candidate . This is when the Iowa caucus gets wild , because supporters , say , of Sanders and Clinton will attempt to convince ? Martin O Malley supporters , in real time , to come to their side . For Zeller , the fun is in forcing others to convince him .
