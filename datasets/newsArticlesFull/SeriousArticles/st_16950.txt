If Davante Adams can play , and that seems doubtful , just how healthy and effective can he be ? Without Adams , who had a nice game against Washington before getting hurt , who will Aaron Rodgers throw to ? James Jones has received the most targets lately he had 11 in last week ' s playoff game , 13 in the regular season finale vs . Minnesota and 11 in the last matchup against Arizona . But if Adams is out , would he get more attention ? Randall Cobb hasn ' t done much lately one game of over 80 yards since mid November ( 81 vs . Dallas ) and no touchdowns since Nov . 22 . ?
