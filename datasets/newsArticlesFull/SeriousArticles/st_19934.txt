No way you can hold the ultimate showman down . Jerry Jones could have shut down Romo once he knew there was no reasonable chance to make the playoffs . But this snake oil salesman loves to roll the dice and he did . It s all up in smoke now and Jones has an audience to please ( aside from his own ego ) . The wheels are turning inside Jerry s World as I write this piece . The showman , the snake oil salesman , the circus barker will work a trade with the Browns for the guy he wanted all along . Johnny Football . Manziel has burned his bridges in Cleveland so it won t take a lot to pry him away . Yes , Jerry Jones , the ultimate showman , always gets his way . But , as most of us already know , Jerry Jones will never find his way to the winning way because he always finds himself in the way .
