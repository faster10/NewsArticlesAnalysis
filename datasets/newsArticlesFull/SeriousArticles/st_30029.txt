There is no doubt that if it were not for the federal government s repeated bailouts , PIA would have never survived , but it should also be without doubt that , without the political interference of the political parties into the management , of what was until late 1980s a fairly decent carrier , PIA would have never become the airline in crises that it is now . It is time to get rid of both the bailouts and the political interference , and the only way to do both is to hand over the management of the national flag carrier to a private party , so for once PIA gets to learn to play by the rules of economics .
