Mirzad , of Belgarde , writes : " In a dark , dark Serbia , just a few years after the war , I received a call from my cousin in France telling me about a movie I ought to see . I tried downloading it with my dial up internet , but it didn ' t work . I waited months to see it in a cinema . That was the best decision of my childhood Harry Potter and the Philosopher ' s Stone ! Snape taught me back then that things are usually not what they seem , that great causes demand great sacrifices and , finally , that the good ones will love you to the very end , after all that time . Always . "
