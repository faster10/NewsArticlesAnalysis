Waveland , Mississippi Tommy Longo has had a rough year : both hips , a femur and a knee replaced . When he hobbles out of his truck to see how the new City Hall construction is going , he looks with every step like he just needs to sit down . His face is covered with perspiration in the afternoon heat , and he always seems to be headed to the next appointment . You might think the mayor of a town that disappeared would have little to do , and yet Longo seems to never stop . " We lost our residential structures , lost our commercial structures , lost our governmental structures , " he says . " Every city building was gone . Our town was obliterated . We were wiped off the face of the earth . " For all the attention focused on New Orleans each time the anniversary of Katrina rolls around , it would be easy to forget that the epicenter of the storm was over on the Mississippi Gulf Coast . And no town was hit harder than Waveland . Ninety five percent of its homes were taken by the storm 100 percent of the town ' s businesses . With virtually every road either broken up or piled with mountains of debris , it was difficult for recovery teams to find a starting place .
