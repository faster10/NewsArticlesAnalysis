Compare that to the final two games of the regular season , when Brady was knocked down a combined 13 times by the Dolphins and Jets in losses . The Patriots don ' t turn to mush when Brady ' s under pressure , but it does slow them significantly . Of the five games in which Brady was pressured most frequently this season , the Patriots lost three , including their 30 24 setback against the Broncos in Week 12 . The two games they won were against the Bills ( in their second meeting ) and the Giants , which they won by a combined eight points . And all of these games came during the second half of the season , as New England ' s line struggled because of injuries .
