" Any place that uses robotics today , you could use materials and have the same capabilities , " says Skylar Tibbits , a computational architect who leads the Lab and the movement . " With planes , we have done a great job of making articulated wings to have lift , to change aerodynamics and make the plane functional . But the weight , energy and control mechanisms involved are pretty excessive at this point . Trying to find more elegant solutions seems an obvious target , and what we ' re proposing is a single material with the same actuation capability , the same sensing , the same range of movement , if not more .
