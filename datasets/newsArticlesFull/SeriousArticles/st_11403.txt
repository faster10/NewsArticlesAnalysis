How much has he gained ? The latest NBC WSJ Marist poll in Iowa shows Rubio in third place with 18 percent a 5 percentage point improvement over the last NBC WSJ Marist poll in early January . The poll also shows evidence that measurements of Rubio s support could be influenced by pollsters assumptions about turnout : Marist samples using random digit dial methods , but then matches the sample to a voter list . Random digit dialing involves calling randomly selected telephone numbers to reach a random sample of Americans , but some pollsters sample from lists of registered voters instead for pre election polls . Voter lists have been found to be more accurate for polling elections , since they allow pollsters to check who ' s actually registered to vote , and often how they do so . Among those respondents who could be matched to the voter list in the newest NBC WSJ Marist poll , Rubio took second place with 22 percent . His support dropped to 14 percent among those who couldn t be matched to the list . On the other hand , Rubio s numbers have remained stable in the latest Monmouth University poll , which samples from a voter list . Monmouth actually reported the horserace numbers for several different levels of turnout varying from low to high , but in these calculations Rubio s support levels are mostly unaffected turnout he stays around 16 percent . ?
