The Panthers lost their only franchise appearance , falling 32 29 to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII 12 years ago . The Broncos made it two years ago but were blasted by Wilson s Seattle Seahawks , 43 8 . Prior to that , the Broncos won their only two Super Bowl titles in back to back years after the 1997 and 1998 seasons . Panthers owner Jerry Richardson , 79 , famously promised that the Panthers would win a championship in the franchise s first decade . This has been the team s 21st season ? and by far their finest so far at 17 1 , counting playoffs . Broncos majority owner Pat Bowlen , 71 , is seldom heard from these days as he battles Alzheimer ' s Disease . Both Richardson and Bowlen are giants in league circles . Richardson , the first former player to own an NFL team , was a member of the 1959 NFL title winning Baltimore Colts , so winning the Super Bowl would represent a nearly 50 year championship circle . When the Broncos won their first Super Bowl , Bowlen honored quarterback John Elway by saying , This one s for John . Now Elway , if the Broncos win , can return the favor and honor the man who has owned the franchise for more than 30 years .
