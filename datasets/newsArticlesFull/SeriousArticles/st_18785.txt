It s a lot of swagger and bluster from a candidate who often speaks derisively of other politicians who ? constantly seek to prove their machismo through bellicose rhetoric . But for Cruz , a more hawkish edge makes some political sense . Again , he s under sustained attack from uber hawk Marco Rubio on national security and clearly sees a need to blunt some of those criticisms . And he has a good reason for wanting to head off the weak on national security stigma ? he doesn t want to be the next Rand Paul .
