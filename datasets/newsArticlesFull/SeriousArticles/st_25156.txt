No one ( apart from Boko Haram ' s leaders ) believes the group can overthrow the Nigerian state . It has no presence in the oil rich south ( even if Shekau threatens to attack oil refineries there ) , and its fighters probably number in the hundreds at most . But it can drain the federal government of resources , damage Nigeria ' s international reputation and turn swathes of northern Nigeria into no go zones . ( The governor of Borno state admitted it was too dangerous for him to travel to the Sambisa area . )
