For example : On the Democratic side , there are far more white liberals among Iowa and New Hampshire voters than in the nation as a whole . It therefore makes sense to set expectations higher for Democratic candidates who depend on the support of white liberals ( this year , Bernie Sanders ) , and lower for those who do better with black and Hispanic voters ( this year , Hillary Clinton ) . It may also be reasonable to expect candidates from nearby states , such as Vermont ' s Sanders in New Hampshire , to have an advantage .
