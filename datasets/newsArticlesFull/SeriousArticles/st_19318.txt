Just as Edelman s week was all over the place , so too was the receiver all over the field on Saturday . First downs , third downs , hitch routes , slant routes , wheel routes , option routes , back shoulder fades , even taking ? handoffs ? in the backfield . It seemed that on every drive Edelman was doing something different to breathe life into what had recently been a moribund Patriots attack . He caught balls when he was wide open ? burning Kansas City corner Marcus Peters with his patented blink and he s gone cuts ? and he caught balls when there were four Chiefs defenders around him , crowded closely inside his personal bubble .
