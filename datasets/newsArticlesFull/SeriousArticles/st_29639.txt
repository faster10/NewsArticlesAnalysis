When asked at a campaign rally Tuesday if he thought Clinton had foreign policy experience , Sanders replied , No one can deny that Secretary Clinton has a lot of foreign policy experience . But experience does not necessarily equate to judgment . Dick Cheney had a hell of a lot of experience . It s a harsh pot shot but an entirely fair and accurate one . Experience simply means one has been in politics enough to keep busy and not get involved in a meaningful scandal . Washington doesn t punish being wrong , it punishes being bad at politics and public relations . Valuing experience without a critical examination of what one did to get that experience is like giving the NBA MVP award to the player who took the most shots . What matters , or at least what ought to matter to voters , is judgment ? how often someone is right . And on this Clinton has been consistently wanting . On Iraq , on Libya , on proxy wars in Syria , on her support of Saudi and Egyptian tyrants , Clinton has frequently been on the disastrous and disabling side of history . Experience , Oscar Wilde once quipped , is the name everyone gives to their mistakes , and it s increasingly clear that too many people have suffered from Clinton s experience for us to consider it anything other than a downside .
