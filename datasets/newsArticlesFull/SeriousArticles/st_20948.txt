On Tuesday , at the Republican presidential debate , Texas Sen . Ted Cruz took his first steps toward hitting his chief establishment rival , Florida Sen . Marco Rubio , on immigration . For those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally and we should enforce the law , we re tired of being told it is anti immigrant , said Cruz . Every sovereign nation secures its borders , and it is not compassionate to say we re not going to enforce the laws and we re going to drive down the wages for millions of hard working men and women .
