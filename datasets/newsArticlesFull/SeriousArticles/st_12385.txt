To understand why , you need to know how doctors now think about cancer : in terms of turtles , rabbits and birds . The goal is not to let any of the animals escape the barnyard pen to become deadly . But the turtles aren ' t going anywhere anyway . They are the indolent , nonlethal cancers . The rabbits are ready to hop out at any time . They are the potentially lethal cancers , cancers that might be stopped by early detection and treatment . Then there are the birds . Quite simply , they are already gone . They are the most aggressive cancers , the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable , the ones that are beyond cure .
