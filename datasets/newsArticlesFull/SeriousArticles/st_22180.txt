The political manoeuvres this time around have only succeeded in bringing the leaders on two sides together for government formation . But the failure on this count is miserable on two fronts Firstly , the political message did not affectively percolate down to the cadres of the two political parties with different and diverse constituencies . Secondly , state leaders in both the parties miserably failed in convincing the masses about their real intent behind the government formation as the PDP supporters in the Valley and BJP supporters in Jammu regions were disinclined towards such a political arrangement .
