There are two main objections to the U . S . ratcheting up its military involvement . One is that it will be too incremental to make much difference in the war zone . That ' s true of any limited use of U . S . power , yet it ' s not a persuasive argument for the U . S . waging another ground war in the Middle East . A related concern is that , if these steps do fall short , Obama and his military advisors will eventually be tempted to escalate further . This is the familiar " quagmire " argument , and it can ' t be blithely dismissed . But it ' s also a rationale for taking no action , ever . A better safeguard against that kind of escalation would be for Congress to belatedly adopt an Authorization for Use of Military Force against Islamic State that would hold Obama to his promise that he won ' t deploy combat troops in the region .
