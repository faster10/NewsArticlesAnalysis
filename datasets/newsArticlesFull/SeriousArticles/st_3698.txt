If Zuckerberg was already the essential figure of our age ? unironic , ruthlessly competitive , post private ? he could now be seen as its Superman , too . Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have made similarly lavish gestures , but they are relatively old men , disposing of what they have accrued before it s too late . Zuckerberg is 31 . He presumably has many years ahead of him leading Facebook . He has reimagined social behaviour for his generation now , via this small contribution , he has set them their most inescapable altruistic example . His contemporaries may find it a bit weird that he hasn t starting flying yet .
