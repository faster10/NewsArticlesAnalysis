Once I ' d limped through my media duties I rejoined the team for our session . It was a pretty surreal day . I remember being briefed on what being an All Black entailed , but I just became numb , hearing about my new responsibilities and opportunities . One thing which made me laugh was being told I could go to the local dealer and pick out a Ford . For free . Only a couple of weeks earlier I ' d finally gotten tired of driving around Mum and Dad ' s old Pulsar , which was returned to my folks ( it was retired only very recently , with 375 , 000km on the clock ) . I ' d gone down to my local Subaru dealer and bought an Impreza WRX , which was the hottest car around at the time . Scribe bought one not long after it was just something Canterbury boys did when they got their first big cheque .
