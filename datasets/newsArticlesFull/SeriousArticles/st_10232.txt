MERS , like 70 of all emerging infectious diseases , including influenza , SARS , HIV AIDS and ebola , originates in wildlife . With MERS , both bats and camels may be implicated . Studies of camels in Saudi Arabia indicate that the majority have a history of MERS coronavirus infection . Infection appears to occur in early life and then clears . Up to a third of young camels carry this infectious virus . Because camels are born in the spring , there may be an increased amount of virus circulating in camels in spring and summer months . This may contribute to a seasonal spike in the reported number of MERS cases .
