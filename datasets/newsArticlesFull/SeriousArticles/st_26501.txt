The presence of Miller is apparently driven by commercial considerations . He and O ' Reilly now have a lecture circuit act that is selling out in such venues as Houston and Las Vegas . The closest I ' ve heard Miller come to elegant public policy analysis was to call Obama a " crap president " earlier this week . As a nod to factuality , O ' Reilly does call Miller a " satirist " and , less plausibly , an NFL expert , due to his badly reviewed stint on Monday Night Football . In any event , it ' s hard to imagine anyone with a master ' s in public policy from Harvard , which O ' Reilly has , consulting Miller on an important national election unless there ' s money in it .
