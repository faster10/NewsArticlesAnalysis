The movie is a remake of the 1976 ersatz Supremes Hollywood fable that starred Irene Cara , and the earlier film ' s setting the late ' 50s and early ' 60s made sense . Transplanting the material ahead nearly a decade , to the era of race riots and black power ( when the classic Motown sound was , in fact , already starting to fade ) , hurts the movie ' s credibility , since it is now all the harder to believe that three feisty grown women are still living in their puritanical mother ' s house because they ' re too cowed to go out on their own . From its opening scene , set inside a hopping Detroit nightclub , Sparkle is charged with a synthetically corny high tension . ( Cee Lo Green shows up in that scene , and does a fine job of playing a conk haired funk soul relic who loves the ladies , but then he completely vanishes from the movie . )
