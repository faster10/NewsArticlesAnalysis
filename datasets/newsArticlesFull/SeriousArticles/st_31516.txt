" Mr Chapo : Wouldn ' t it be cool if you started to traffic in goodness ? With cures for diseases , with food for children in the street , with alcohol for nursing homes . . . . trafficking with corrupt politicians instead of with women and children that end up as slaves ? With burning all the pimps that treat a woman like she ' s worth no more than a pack of cigarettes ? " she writes . " With no supply there is no demand . Do it , sir , and you would be the hero of heroes . Let ' s traffic with love . You know how . "
