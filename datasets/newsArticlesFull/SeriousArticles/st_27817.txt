This is the postseason where the Mets have made the World Series and get to play a great ballclub in the Kansas City Royals , he said . I think Jacob deGrom is 3 0 in this postseason if I m not mistaken . Matt Harvey came out and had a great start to get us off on the right foot . Noah Syndergaard has been borderline unhittable , whether you start him or relieve him . And has Jeurys Familia had a guy get past second base ? I don t think so . Everybody has gotten a piece of this . I thought Lucas Duda had a huge swing in Game 4 of the Chicago Cubs series to get us off and rolling . So I don t really think of it that way . I think of it as this has been a great team accomplishment with some work to be done .
