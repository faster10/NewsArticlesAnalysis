Community land trusts are nonprofit organizations , with a board composed of representatives of the public , the local government , and the tenants , that obtain land and either develop it themselves or lease it to developers . The trust then removes its holdings from the private market , usually through 99 year ground leases and pre emptive purchase requirements that limit how much the house can be sold for . Community land trust boosters argue that this not only ensures permanent affordability , but allows the organization to intercede in the case of , say , a foreclosure . An oft cited study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy showed that , as of 2010 , homeowners within a land trust were 10 times less likely to default on their homes than their private market counterparts .
