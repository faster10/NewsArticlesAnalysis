Last year , John McCain ' s independence and character helped change history . The Democrats had taken control of Congress and were threatening to cut off funds for our troops . In the face of calls for retreat , I ordered a surge of forces into Iraq . Many in Congress said it had no chance of working . Yet one senator above all had faith in our troops and the importance of their mission , and that was John McCain . Some told him that his early and consistent call for more troops would put his presidential campaign at risk . He told them he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war . That is the kind of courage and vision we need in our next commander in chief .
