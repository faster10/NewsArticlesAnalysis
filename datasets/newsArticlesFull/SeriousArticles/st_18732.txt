Note : We didn ' t even get into all the classic Andy Reid clock management fiascos in this section . They included : burning two timeouts on their first drive of the game to avoid delay of game penalties on third downs taking a delay of game penalty with under 30 seconds left in the first half and the ball inside the 10 yard line not getting off a second play before the two minute warning after Alex Smith , down by 14 , completed a pass to Albert Wilson to get to the 1 yard line and then Charcandrick West was stopped in the backfield on first and goal and taking a full 30 seconds to get off a third down play and HUDDLING ! after Smith completed another pass on second and goal after the two minute warning . I mean , what are you doing here ?
