As 3 . 5 point home dogs versus Kansas City , the Texans ' point total is a tick above 18 points . Only the Vikings have a lower team total in the Wild Card Round . . . . Houston ' s biggest offensive concern is the year ending loss of All Pro LT Duane Brown ( torn quad ) combined with the return of Chiefs OLB Justin Houston from a knee injury that shelved last year ' s NFL sack leader for the last six games . In response , the Texans ' most sensible approach would be a short passing game designed to get the ball out of Brian Hoyer ' s hands quickly , feeding the Texans ' playmakers and mitigating Kansas City ' s pass rush . While this might bode well for the box score outlook of DeAndre Hopkins , I ' m skeptical Hoyer will put together an efficient game . The Chiefs ' pass defense has been even stingier than Houston ' s , ranking fifth in DVOA after stymieing Matthew Stafford ( QB23 ) , Philip Rivers twice ( QB28 , QB27 ) , and Derek Carr twice ( QB18 , QB23 ) from Week 8 on . Without Brown to protect his blind side , I think there ' s a fair chance Hoyer simply looks overwhelmed in this game . . . . The Chiefs have also played tough run defense , ranking 11th in DVOA and holding opposing running backs to 248 yards and one touchdown on 68 carries ( 3 . 65 YPC ) in the last month . A sustained rushing attack seems unlikely for the Texans , who leaned on grinder back Alfred Blue as a workhorse down the stretch , with committee partners Chris Polk , Jonathan Grimes , and Akeem Hunt taking backseats . If Houston does resort to a high volume passing game , passing down specialist Grimes could conceivably end up leading the unit in touches . Grimes was second in the rotation behind Blue in Weeks 16 and 17 .
