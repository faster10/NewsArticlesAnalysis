The Clippers are playing a more conservative style of pick and roll defense this season in which the big man usually DeAndre Jordan or Blake Griffin drops back near the free throw line instead of ' showing ' high and or trapping the ball handler . The downside is that , if the ball handler is a deadeye shooter , he has enough room to get a quick 3 pointer off while his defender navigates the screen . The Clips tried defending Stephen Curry this way a couple weeks ago and he torched them . They adjusted back to last season ' s coverage which has worked decently against Curry and , well , he torched them again . Go figure . There ' s simply no stopping him right now .
