Second , the Paris agreement will likely be a hybrid one containing bottom up elements comprising nationally determined contributions to climate action ( mitigation , adaptation , and supportive actions such as finance ) , and some top down elements such as how these contributions are reviewed and updated . India needs to argue for a more , not less , effective review and update process . A process that includes regular , five year updates based on a global aggregate stocktaking of country contributions is in India s interest as a highly vulnerable country . This stocktaking process should include consideration , albeit in principle , of equity and fairness in the assessment of aggregate progress towards the objective of the agreement ? in particular , its temperature goal . It should also include consideration of the implementation not just of mitigation but also of financial and other support obligations . If India were to put its weight behind such a robust review and update process , it would open the door to a broad range of useful alliances with other vulnerable nations , such as the Small Island States and African countries . A progressive stance on the review , update and stocktaking process , given its crucial relevance to the effectiveness of the Paris agreement , should be a key component of India s position .
