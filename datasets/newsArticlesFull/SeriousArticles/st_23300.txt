Well , in Iowa he is leading , Trump said on ABC . Not everywhere else , because everywhere else I see they re all different people all over the lot , all scattered all over the place . New Hampshire is totally different . In New Hampshire I have a massive lead and we have different seconds . You look at different states , it seems to be a lot of different people . But certainly in Iowa , he got a lot of PR by going a little bit ahead of me in Iowa . But we ll see what happens because I find it hard to believe .
