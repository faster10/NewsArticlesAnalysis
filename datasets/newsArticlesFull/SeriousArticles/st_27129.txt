Nobody knows exactly what Kelly wants to do after this season or what the Eagles ownership is thinking ( Les Bowen of Philly . com summed these points up very well ) . People have been in a frenzy to chase Kelly back to college , mostly because the NFL and a lot of people who cover it hate any change and immediately reject any new ideas . Kelly is having a truly miserable season , but there wouldn ' t be many coaches left if they got run out of town for one bad season out of every three . Maybe Kelly will want to leave after this season or the Eagles will give in to pressure and fire him , but it ' s hard to argue he ' s an NFL failure if you look at the totality of his first three seasons .
