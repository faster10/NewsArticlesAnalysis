Unfortunately , the contradictions or differences between Arab and Iran date back 1 , 400 years , and both sides believe in the righteousness of their cause . They use every opportunity to put the other on the mat . In 1990 , after Saddam Hussain invaded Kuwait , the US , other western powers and Arab countries were united against him . Earlier , they had fuelled the sectarian fracas by supporting Iraq in its war against Iran and , in the process , strengthened Iraq . The US and the west looked for an opportunity to weaken Iraq , as it would have posed a palpable threat to Israel . As if they were not satisfied , they attacked Iraq once again on the pretext that it had weapons of mass destruction . Their next target was Syria where they played the sectarian card and provided arms to Syrian Sunni rebels , and Arab countries actively supported these rebels to overthrow the Bashar al Assad government .
