Smith : Yeah , yeah , yeah , no doubt . We ' re raising our kid in a household where people curse , as an experiment . And I think our experiment is working , because I don ' t tame my language around the kid . I don ' t run up to her and yell expletive in her face , but I don ' t go out of my way to like not curse in front of her . And honestly , ironically , she doesn ' t curse . And I ' ve tried to get her to curse for like friends and family , because it ' s always entertaining to hear a child curse , and she doesn ' t do it .
