Ms Bhutto ' s only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head . The UK experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot . The only X ray records , taken after her death , were of Ms Bhutto ' s head . However , the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded . This is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack , and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her .
