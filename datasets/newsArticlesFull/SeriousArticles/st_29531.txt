To go back to the question I think we should legalize marijuana . I think Barack Obama should bring the brothers and sisters home the soldiers . If I was to see him , I would go , " Listen to Marvin Gaye ' s ' What ' s Going On ' and John Coltrane , and bring the boys home from the war now , like we did with Vietnam . " They ' re not going to come here . People in Vietnam did not come here to attack us after we left them alone . So let ' s get rid of that fear , that fantasy , that stuff . Let ' s get rid of the bogeyman , because the bogeyman is us looking in the mirror of each other .
