Kelly Olynyk had his coming out party . The seven footer had big games before , but they had all seemingly come against inferior opposition , such as his career high 31 points against the Philadelphia 76ers last season . On Friday night against the Warriors , Olynyk stepped up his game under the brightest lights . The third year big man scored a season high 28 points , stabilizing a Celtics offense that struggled to keep pace with Golden State after Avery Bradley s hot first quarter . It was the third 21 point performance out of Boston s last five games , an impressive sign of consistency for a guy who struggled over the first month of the season . Olynyk won t score 20 every night , but his improved aggressiveness is an encouraging sign for this team long term .
