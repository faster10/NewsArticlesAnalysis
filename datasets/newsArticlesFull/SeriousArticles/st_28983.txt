They backed their skill set and continued doing what they did best in league , effectively forcing opponents to adapt to them not the other way round . England already have a physical midfield . They have been playing big guys like Brad Barritt , Billy Twelvetrees and Manu Tuilagi but no one comes bigger or more ferocious than Burgess . He ' s not going to turn out like Mike Catt or Will Greenwood both natural playmakers who relied on vision more than physicality but he has the ability to draw in three or four players at a time . Burgess playing alongside Tuilagi would be interesting to watch !
