A review of polls of presidential scholars since 1948 , but especially since 1962 , reveals that all of the top great or near great presidents , except for Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt , were involved in war during their presidencies . Six of them James Polk , Lincoln , Woodrow Wilson , FDR , Truman , and Dwight D . Eisenhower were wartime presidents . LBJ , Richard Nixon , George H . W . Bush , and George W . Bush have not secured great or near great status in these polls because of the failed Vietnam War , the successful but forgotten First Gulf War , and the misguided invasion of Iraq based on false intelligence .
