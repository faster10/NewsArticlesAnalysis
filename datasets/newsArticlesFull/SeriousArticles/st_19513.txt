Set up like a giant clock , perhaps this could be the " game " aspect of the park . In groups , you enter the arena and must be the last person standing . Every , say , 10 minutes some kind of bad thing happens like rain or smoke machines and you would lose a member of your team ( to an exit sign . We ' re not monsters here ! ) . Instruct people to dive to a bottom of a pool or strap on a harness and climb a tree for various points , and you ' ve got a thrilling adventure that doesn ' t end with everyone ' s deaths .
