I am humbled and thrilled by the Academy s nomination , and for the recognition of the work of so many of my Carol collaborators . It s the stuff of dreams , for sure , and I certainly never imagined this happening when I began this journey 18 years ago . I am so proud that Patricia Highsmith s groundbreaking novel has also been saluted . I know my friend Pat is knocking back a few neat scotches in writer s heaven . ? The Weinstein Company , Liz Karlsen , Stephen Woolley , Christine Vachon , Film 4 and Todd Haynes allowed all of this to happen , and I am profoundly grateful to them .
