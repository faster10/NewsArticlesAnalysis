I was sitting around watching my film one day and it occurred to me it just hit me all these three things : plastic surgery , cosmetics and eating disorders , are things that primarily affect women . And we still have an archaic appreciation for women in our country because if things primarily affect women , nobody does anything about it . But when it affects men , they do something about it right away . . . . It ' s like we ' re in 1910 . Everything looks really sophisticated because you have computers , you have iPads , you have smartphones and tablets , and everything you see looks so developed , but underneath it , I don ' t believe we value women the way that we should in this country .
