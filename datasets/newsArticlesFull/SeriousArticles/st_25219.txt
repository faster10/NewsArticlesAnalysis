They ' re looking for the sort of artistic perfection which , as we have all learned , is not necessarily a presidential trait . They like Cain ' s 9 9 9 tax plan , but he ' s too unreliable on the abortion issue .

And what about Bachmann claiming , without any proof , that the HPV vaccine can cause mental retardation ? Not exactly a presidential move .
