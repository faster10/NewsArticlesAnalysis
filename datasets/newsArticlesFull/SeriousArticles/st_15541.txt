The first thing that stands out about Smith in the postseason is that he s never thrown an interception in a playoff game . Meanwhile , he s tossed nine touchdown passes in three games against the New Orleans Saints at home , the New York Giants at home and the Indianapolis Colts on the road . The home games came with the 49ers in 2011 , as San Francisco lost the NFC Championship Game to Eli Manning and the Giants in overtime after punt returner Kyle Williams fumbled a kick deep in his own territory . Otherwise , Smith might already have a Super Bowl win on his record .
