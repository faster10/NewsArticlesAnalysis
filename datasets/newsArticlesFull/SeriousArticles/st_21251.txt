An SEC Title Game between Alabama and Florida wasn ' t even a consideration at the beginning of the college football season . It ' s fine for now , but the Florida Atlantic game needs to be all about how to get Harris sharper with the passing game before dealing with Florida State . " To me they played great red zone defense and got the big plays " . But Henry impressed news with 210 yards rushing , 38 carries , and three touchdown runs . Graves drilled a 39 yard field goal to cut it to 24 6 in the third . Prescott was ready for an ice bath as soon as the final gun went off . Through three quarters , Alabama sacked Prescott nine times .
