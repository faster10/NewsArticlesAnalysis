According to the sources in the room , Diaz did not say much . He did not chime in when other campaigns shot down the idea of splitting the debates into two randomly selected contests of seven candidates each , and he did not interrupt as others agreed that Fox Business , the next debate host , could do as it liked .

The debate partner was supposed to be Telemundo , and Republicans could not stiff the only Spanish language network allowed into the cycle .
