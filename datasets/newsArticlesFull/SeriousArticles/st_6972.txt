Hillary Clinton does not have the same cultural connection to good old boys in Congress . And it is she , not her husband , who has always been more reflexively likely to name Republicans as the enemy . A " vast right wing conspiracy " was behind the revelation that her husband had had sexual relations in the White House with a young intern , then lied about it . Asked at the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month to name the enemies she was proudest of , Hillary Clinton cited Iran , the National Rifle Association , health insurance companies , drug companies , and Republicans ? ? four of the five domestic foes . It was a good answer to a Democratic primary audience , not so good for a would be President ' s ability to unite a divided country with terrorists vowing for the destruction of the United States .
