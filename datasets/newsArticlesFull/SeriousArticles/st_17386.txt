It has been observed that mainstream cinema is becoming more sexist , with less use for anything other than the decorative female , and the erudite heroines of the 1930s and 1940s as alien to us now as mime artists or smoking babies . The root cause is the same ? a cultural form this profit driven will always cleave to the norm . Even as the wider culture changes , begins to accommodate arguments , recognises its flaws , these advances cannot percolate when the commercial interest is so fixed . This is not to say challenging expectations could never make a profit . The idea that a black actor could be more bankable than a white one , or an intelligent heroine may actually attract audiences is simply not tested : Challenge is a risk and , as such , a needless cost .
