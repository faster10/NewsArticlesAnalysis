Opening with a distant synth pulse , the lovelorn Kiss It Better soon reveals its futuristic rock ballad intentions with a guitar riff ( from former Extreme guitarist Nuno Bettencourt ) . From there it unfurls into a typical mid paced Rihanna album track in the verses before the incredible chorus takes it to a whole other level , making it an obvious highlight . As with most of the album there are lovely little production touches throughout , such as the zipping synth noises that flash across the song like shooting stars . A definite future live favourite .
