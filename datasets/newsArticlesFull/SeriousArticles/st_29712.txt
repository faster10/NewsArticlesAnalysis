Aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with SFRA restrictions . Air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing . As a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the SFRA airspace is already built into the system . Why do I carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? I have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan .
