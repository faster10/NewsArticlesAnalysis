Here s why that fight is so important : U . S . public lands ? that s land that you and I own , remember ? are responsible for hundreds of times more carbon dioxide emissions each year than would have traveled through Keystone . Recent estimates showed the Keystone XL would have been potentially responsible for tens of millions of tons of CO2 each year ? but fossil fuel extraction on public lands already produces more than 1 billion tons annually ? and holds the potential for an unfathomable hundreds of billions more . The difference in importance is barely even comparable ? halting future public lands production would truly be a game changer .
