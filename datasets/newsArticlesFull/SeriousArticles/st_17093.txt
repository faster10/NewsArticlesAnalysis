Atwan met bin Laden in his cave . It was small , 13 by 20 feet in Atwan ' s estimation , and as the new photos show , it was lined with shelves of books about the Koran and the Prophet Mohammed .

The cave not only offered bin Laden a hiding place but also street credibility in the Muslim world , as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the Koran while camped in his own mountain cave .
