Van Gaal knows he needs a right back , central defender , holding midfielder and a centre forward . That is probably about 150million right there . The Dutch coach also knows , however , that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen . Van Gaal has to make decisions about Mata , Falcao , Robin van Persie and Rafael da Silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as Jones , Smalling and Jonny Evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help United back to the top of the Premier League .
