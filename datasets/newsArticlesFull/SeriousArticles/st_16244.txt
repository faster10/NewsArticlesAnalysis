My first love was Joan Jett . When , as a 10 year old , I spent most of the spring trapped in a hospital bed with a mysterious inner ear imbalance , she was there boasting about her bad reputation from the little flip top turntable on my window ledge . That summer , after my equally mysterious recovery , I was listening to the radio in my own bedroom when KZEW played an episode of the King Biscuit Flower Hour that featured a Joan Jett concert . I cocked my head as Eric Roscoe Ambel broke into the opening riff of Rebel Rebel . What was this ? This wasn t a Joan Jett song . It brimmed with drama , wrapped its power chords in layers of meaning . Text and subtext . Disenfranchisement and desire . The sound of dirty fingernails . The next day I rode my bike to Half Price Books and Records on McKinney Avenue and paid 3 . 99 for a battered copy of Changes One Bowie .
