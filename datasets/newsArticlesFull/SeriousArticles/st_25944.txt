Scafaria : I ' m not , but I have them anyway . I try not to dwell . I feel very much like ( Knightley ' s character ) Penny in that sense , where I try to live my life to the fullest . But by doing that , you still end up missing out and spreading yourself very thin . I ' ve spent holidays with ex boyfriends and felt like I missed out on Christmas Eve with my family . Those were huge regrets . I ' m a person that thinks time is very precious and our only commodity . . . . It ' s so upsetting when I feel like something has wasted my time .
