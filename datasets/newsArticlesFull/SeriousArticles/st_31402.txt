? Defensive end Derek Wolfe on the Pats : I hate everything about them . They are always in my way ( laughs ) . They are always in my way to get what I want so it is naturally going to create hate . ? and he went on to add : I have a ton of respect for the whole organization . They have great players . Tom Brady is a great player . Bill Belichick is a great coach . They have a great staff over there . I have a ton of respect for them . Easy to see that the Patriots are the Yankees , Canadiens , Lakers , Celtics , etc . all of the great teams that were hated because of how consistently great they were during a stretch of time . .
