Amazingly , Disney ' s animated musical Frozen also broke Harry Potter ' s records during its opening weekend , though it wasn ' t quite as gigantic as Catching Fire . Frozen grossed 93 million over five days and 66 . 7 million from Friday to Sunday . That number easily trumped Disney ' s last animated princess film , Tangled , which grossed 68 . 1 million over its five day Thanksgiving debut . Frozen scored with audiences , earning an " A " CinemaScore , which will help it earn back its 150 million budget ( and much , much more ) in no time . It ' s not common that two films ever play as well simultaneously as Frozen and Catching Fire did this weekend . Who said women aren ' t box office draws ?
