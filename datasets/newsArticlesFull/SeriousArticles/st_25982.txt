Clarke : Yes , I ' m all for schmaltz , but that ' s not why I watched " The Wire . " In previous seasons , the show has had me sobbing ( Bodie ' s killing ) , screaming blue murder ( Bubbles ' suicide attempt ) and spiraling downward as I awaited the really bad things that had to happen ( the parting of the ways between Stringer and Avon was never going to go well ) . This time , I had the familiar sinking feeling about some characters and plot lines as they played out , but this time , the writing didn ' t have the same killer instinct .
