It ' s a privilege to do what I do it ' s a privilege to be able to have the tools to create worlds that people can engage both psychologically , emotionally and subconsciously . There ' s a responsibility behind that . I worked in advertising as a director of commercials for eight years , I understand what the power of image and sound does to a human being . Because of that , there ' s a responsibility I have however crazy or questioning or whatever my stories are , I have a responsibility for every single person who watches my film that even if I shake their very core , I must not violate them . That ' s my own rule .
