I know from experience how the lack of tangible evidence gnaws at an accident investigator . Eventually , the passion driving efforts to find answers is replaced with a feeling of futility and hopelessness . For the investigator in charge , valuable time that could be spent on the search and investigation will be spent justifying the cost of the search to the bureaucracy . But as the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumes after a four month hiatus , investigators must realize the question here is not how much it will cost to find the airplane and determine the cause to ensure it won ' t happen again . Instead , the question should be this : How much will it cost if they don ' t ?
