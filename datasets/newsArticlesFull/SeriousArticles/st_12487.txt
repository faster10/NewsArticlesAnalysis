Spielberg : All during the picture I called him Mr President , but that was my idea . I also wore a suit every day , which I don ' t usually do when I ' m directing . Everybody was dressed up in their period wardrobe . I did not wear 19th century wardrobe . I wore pretty good clothes from this era . I just wanted to blend in . We knew we were in the 21st century at all times . But once you stepped onto the stages of the White House , everybody really felt that they were making a contribution to remembering this critical moment in our shared history .
