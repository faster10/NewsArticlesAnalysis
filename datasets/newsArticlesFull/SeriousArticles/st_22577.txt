True . In a speech made to the Stop the War Coalition in 2009 , Mr Corbyn called representatives from both groups friends after inviting them to Parliament . He later told Channel 4 he wanted both groups , who have factions designated as international terror organisations , to be part of the debate for the Middle East peace process . I use ( the word friends ) in a collective way , saying our friends are prepared to talk , he added . Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does ? No . Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do ? No .
