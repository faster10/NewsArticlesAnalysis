" Really all the big shots are coming when he breaks outside , Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said . He breaks outside , a lot of time people leave their coverages , and he throws . He ' s got an unbelievable arm . He ' s got a cannon . And he can throw those things a mile . And of course the worst thing with him is if you don ' t front him with a rush and you open windows , now he starts climbing , gives him time to throw with vision . Or he ' ll take off . So you ' ve got to take away the vision . I always call it , ' Keep him in the well . ' Keep him in the well and then just keep coming . And we ' ve got to close it and got to get the deal down there . "
