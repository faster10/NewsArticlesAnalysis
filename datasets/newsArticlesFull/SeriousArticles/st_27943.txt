Mike Tanier , Bleacher Report : " If you interpret ( Andy ) Dalton ' s performance in ? Sunday ? night ' s 34 31 thriller as ' choking , ' you probably said some pretty awful things about Romo back in the day . Dalton battled hard against the Cardinals , leading a late game comeback despite the fact his pass protection basically ceased to exist . He finished with 315 passing yards , two touchdowns and one critical fumble deep in Bengals territory when the pocket crumpled around him for the umpteenth time . Dalton was what he has always been ? Sunday ? night : A limited deep passer who can shred you with short to intermediate ball distribution if given a few microseconds to throw and some reasonable teammate support . He helped the Bengals take an excellent team playing a very good game to the wall in its home stadium . That said , the Bengals weren ' t quite good enough against a top opponent , and that cannot be shrugged off . They lacked lots of little " somethings " : one or two fewer penalties , some tighter defense in the secondary , more north south and less east west from the running backs , maybe better efforts on catchable balls by A . J . Green and Marvin Jones , certainly better blitz pickup . "
