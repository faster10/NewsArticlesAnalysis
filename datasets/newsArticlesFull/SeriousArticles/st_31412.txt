How did Peyton handle sitting out for nearly two months ? I truly probably left him alone more than I would have otherwise , Cooper said . He kind of kept his head down . I don t think he was enjoying that . It s as tough a couple of weeks as he s had in a season . Peyton adores practice , he adores the routine , he adores being around the guys and trying to get better every day . All things that sound clich ish , but that s what he just lives for . . . . Time heals and fortunately he got better in time to help the team .
