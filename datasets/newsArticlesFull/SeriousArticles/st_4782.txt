With no Martin Skrtel , Olivier Giroud will be licking his lips . Kolo Toure and Mamadou Sakho are both solid enough but they are nervous in possession and they will miss the experience and physicality of Skrtel . If Dejan Lovren is fit , I expect him to play , but if not , don ' t be surprised if Giroud gets on the scoresheet . The Frenchman is in excellent form this season but the only question mark against him was does he score enough in the big games ? So far in this campaign , he has scored against Manchester United , City and Liverpool . He will want to continue that run on Saturday .
