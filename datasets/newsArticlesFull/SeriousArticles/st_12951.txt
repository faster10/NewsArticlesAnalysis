That s not to say there are no stories of intrigue . Tony Romo , still in a sling , still not throwing much after getting his clavicle cracked , is trying to work his way back by mid November ? just in time for a still very much in play stretch run to the playoffs . The former unheralded unknown from Eastern Illinois has become a bit of a sympathetic hero ? a snake bitten tale of a talented , entertaining protagonist entering the twilight of his roller coaster career . Brandon Weeden has filled in at quarterback and done Brandon Weeden things . Matt Cassel has come on in relief of Weeded and been appropriately Casselian . A season teeters on the brink unless Dallas can prove it can win with a cannon arm tied behind its back .
