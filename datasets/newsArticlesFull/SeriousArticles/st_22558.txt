A robot doesn ' t have the moral agency to be held accountable . Some would argue that the commander who sends a robot on a mission would be responsible ( last point of contact ) . But that could be unfair since it could be the fault of the mission programmer , the manufacturer or one of dozens of little companies providing components . Maybe it should be the senior staff or policy makers who had the idea to use robots . Or the device could have been tampered with in the industrial supply chain or even damaged in action . Forensics are extremely difficult with such complex devices .
