Defense does take the biggest cut under sequester , nearly 13 of planned spending . In fact , defense spending would really be cut , in the sense of actually spending less , over the next two years . Still , it would never fall below the level of spending we had as recently as 2007 , a year we managed to survive without al Qaeda wading ashore in Long Beach . Beginning in 2015 , defense spending would start rising again , in real terms , and would exceed current levels by 2019 . Keeping all this in perspective , over the entire 10 year period covered by the sequester , defense spending would average roughly 100 billion more each year ( after adjusting for inflation ) than we spent at the height of the cold war .
