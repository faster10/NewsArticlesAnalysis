Tom Hanks ' Bridge of Spies was the classic idea of a solid movie . With Hanks at the lead giving audiences his best suave self , Bridge of Spies was enjoyable . But was it awards worthy ? But Mark Rylance playing the role of the Russian spy changed all of our minds . We went into that movie thinking it would be a solid film , but we didn ' t expect to be blown away by Rylance ' s performance . His inclusion in the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture category was a very pleasant and welcomed surprise .
