Truth is , Guy Mann was so well realized ? he threatened to upstage both Mulder and Scully as the story progressed . The episode also did that thing where the show separates Mulder and Scully for long stretches to investigate different aspects of the mystery , a maneuver that denies us the pleasure of their shared company and defies the expectation of anyone who thought the revival ( now half over ! ) would be scratching the ship itch nonstop . Oh , for an epic sequence that would strand the pair on a rock in the middle of a lake and make them connect with each other , just as the show did in the season 3 gem Quagmire ( which this episode flicked at ? in various ways see : Queequeg ) . Toss in a choice or two worthy of a critical headshake , like the dubious inclusion of a crack addicted transgender prostitute played for laughs and murky thematics , and there s an ? argument to be made that this fable about estrangement from society , nature , other , and self was itself slightly out of step with the audience , with the revival s ? narrative flow , and with the times .
