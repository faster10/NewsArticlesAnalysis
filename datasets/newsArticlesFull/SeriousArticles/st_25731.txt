One of the things I like is that young people in the audience have found it easy to connect to their lives . It doesn ' t feel like a period piece . I worried that this is a story which ends in 1977 and might feel to a lot of people like ancient history . But I just think that there is something about the way in which small individual lives are impacted by the great events of history which is easy for us to connect to now when the great events of history , almost on a daily basis , assault our individual lives .
