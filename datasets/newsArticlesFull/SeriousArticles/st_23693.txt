' The club has come on in terms of the squad , the management , the facilities , the training pitches . All aspects of the club are a lot better than two and half years ago . There are only four or five lads left from that time and there has been a big turnaround . There is a good togetherness . The lads all get on now . Rio Ferdinand has come and he has been impressed at how the lads are together . He was at Manchester United a long time and he can ' t believe the togetherness of the lads and the spirit . '
