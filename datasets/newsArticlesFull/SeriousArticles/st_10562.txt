The reality is that Ukraine ' s military does not need Western made military equipment it operates Russian or Soviet made one . So the chances are high that , once Western governments and especially the U . S . one decide to supply Ukraine with lethal military equipment , the supplies will come from the stocks of Soviet made weapons which are in Poland and Romania , eastern Europe ' s biggest nations . Both border Ukraine , which makes the delivery of such weapons easy and unobtrusive , something U . S . President Barack Obama may prefer , in order not to foreclose any opportunity for a future diplomatic dialogue with Moscow . Although details of such planning are being kept under wraps , Polish Defense Minister Tomasz Siemoniak has already acknowledged the possibility that his country ' s military stocks may be used for this purpose .
