And it ' s also to scare the bejesus out of these kids . I hope when they watch my film they ' re like , ' I ' m not going anywhere near some old man who ' s offering me a cell phone and some pocket money . ' And I want to scare the parents . I want to say , ' I know you have busy lives , and have to earn an income , but just take the time and really screen the people you hand your kids over to . ' These people , these custodians of society , the teacher , whether it ' s the priest down the road , whoever . The people that come of good report . Screen them a little bit . You don ' t know who they are . They could be the big bad wolf . That ' s what it ' s about .
