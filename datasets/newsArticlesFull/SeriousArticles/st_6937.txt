Against this backdrop , the rise of Islamic State ( IS ) has created opportunities as well as pitfalls for the government . The opportunities lie in an increasingly bloody confrontation between IS and the Kurds , spread across Turkey , Iraq and Syria , that might weaken the Kurds . But as the Kurds are taking the fight on the ground against IS , they have won the admiration and support of the US , which is helping them with weapons and aerial support . This has not found favour with Turkey , as it might help to strengthen the Kurdish position to eventually carve out a homeland for themselves . Turkey s first response to the US led military coalition against IS was not only to keep out of it but also to deny them the use of Turkish bases for bombing raids . The US , a long time Turkish ally , was unhappy with this . Later , Turkey changed its position by joining the US led coalition , as well as allowing the use of its bases for bombing raids on IS . However , simultaneously , it turned on the Kurds by attacking and bombing PKK targets in northern Iraq and in southeast Turkey .
