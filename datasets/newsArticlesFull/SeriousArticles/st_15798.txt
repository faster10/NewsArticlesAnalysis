President Vladimir Putin , a former KGB officer , has avoided open public praise or criticism of Stalin , but he has restored Soviet era symbols and tried to soften public perceptions of the dictator . Kremlin critics have seen attempts to whitewash Stalin ' s image as part of Putin ' s rollback on democracy . In recent years , many in Russia were outraged by government sponsored school textbooks that painted Stalin in a largely positive light and the reconstruction of a Moscow subway station that restored old Soviet national anthem lyrics praising Stalin as part of its interior decoration . In addition to the Volgograd legislature ' s move to restore the old name of the city , authorities in Volgograd , St . Petersburg and the Siberian city of Chita ordered images of Stalin to be put on city buses on February 2 to commemorate the historic battle . Yan Raczynski of Memorial , a leading Russia ' s human rights group , was quoted as saying by Interfax that the authorities ' moves highlighted the nation ' s failure to ' legally and politically recognize the crimes committed by the Bolshevik regime , particularly Stalin and his inner circle ' . In turn , communists said the decision to restore the name of Stalingrad for just a few days each year is just a half step . Communist lawmakers met with World War II veterans and sent a letter to Putin urging the government to fully rename the city , the party said in a statement . But Sergei Zheleznyak , a top lawmaker with United Russia , the main Kremlin party dominating parliament , said there were no plans to fully restore the old name . Tomorrow Russia plans extensive ceremonies to mark the 70th anniversary of the battle , which raged for half a year in 1942 43 with the Red Army resisting the Nazi onslaught in fierce street fighting and then encircling and capturing more than 100 , 000 Nazi soldiers .
