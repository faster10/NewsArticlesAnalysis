For the second time in 30 months the United States is attempting , in its Syria diplomacy , a " Hail Mary pass " a last second attempt from a very unfavorable field position to snatch victory from near certain defeat . In 2013 , Washington hoped that a conference in Geneva would somehow ease the Assad regime toward the exits in spite of effective Hezbollah military intervention on the regime ' s behalf . The result was a fumble rather than a forward pass . Now Washington hopes that conference room chatter can neutralize another round of Assad regime military gains , this time bought by Russian aircraft and Iranian assembled militiamen . What would it take this time for a desperate maneuver to succeed ? What are the criteria for success ? What is the definition of failure ? What alternative exists if the long pass from the ten yard line falls short ?
