In 2006 Glass hired Dayton Moore away from the Braves and , at Moore s instance , began to rebuild the organization rather than just operate it . It took some time , but Moore s efforts ? and Glass seemingly hands off approach ? paid dividends . Those scouting and international operations were restored and , over time , Glass has bumped the payroll up to a more respectable level . While , as I noted above , winning makes people forget what s bothering them , it s worth noting that Glass hire of Moore is specifically what led to the winning . These days , ? Royals fans have stopped complaining about Glass for the most part . He s now like most other owners : easy to dislike if you fixate on any one thing , but easy to forget if the team is doing well . And it s doing very , very well .
