The issues that will dominate the 2016 election are issues that Clinton has been a leader on for years . She has been a champion for middle class families and for those working hard to get into the middle class . She voted time and again to raise the minimum wage so people working full time would not find themselves still in poverty . She wrote the Student Borrower Bill of Rights and fought for lowering student loan rates by ending giveaways to the big banks . And of course she has fought tirelessly to give all Americans , especially children , the security of quality , affordable health care .
