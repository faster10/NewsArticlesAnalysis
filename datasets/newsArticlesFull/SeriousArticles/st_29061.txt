With the crust perfected , I got to work on getting rid of those unsightly cracks in the filling . Cracking is supposedly caused by over baking , but I found that the cracks formed even when I under baked my pies or cooked them perfectly . After much experimentation and many sad looking pumpkin pies I discovered that adding a little flour to the filling and replacing some of the whole eggs with egg yolks stabilized the pie . Reducing the oven temperature helped too . Finally , no more cracking even if I accidentally left the pie in the oven a few minutes too long .
