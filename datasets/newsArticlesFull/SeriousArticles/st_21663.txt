San Francisco 49ers : The Niners are in full rebuild mode with a starting offensive backfield likely comprised of Blaine Gabbert at quarterback and Shaun Draughn at running back while the two time NFC champion Seahawks are in full panic mode , sitting at just 4 5 . What s that they say about a wounded animal being the most dangerous animal , again ? Gabbert has never won back to back starts in his career ( going 0 5 after a victory ) , Seattle has won five of the past six meetings and after Sunday , it will be six of seven . The Niners ' defense , which sacked Russell Wilson five times last month , will make it interesting for a bit . Seahawks 24 , 49ers 13 . Paul Gutierrez
