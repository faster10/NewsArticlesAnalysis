Trump takes the Republican war on courtesy to new heights . Some say he s toned it down since the long ago days ( of last summer ) when he mocked John McCain s valor and suggested Megyn Kelly might have been menstruating during the first GOP debate . But last week he mocked Jeb Bush for asking Mommy and Daddy to help him out and sneered at Ben Carson s religion . After Trump , Chris Christie may be the second rudest man in America . Videos of his bullying are all over the Web . Ted Cruz compared Republicans wary of shutting down the government to Neville Chamberlain . Ben Carson compared the IRS to the Nazis themselves , and Obamacare to slavery .
