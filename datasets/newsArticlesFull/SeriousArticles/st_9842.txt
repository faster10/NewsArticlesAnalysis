In contrast to other categories , this one yields the least number of nominees I am enthused about . ( Which is worth a post of its own : How did sitcoms become so dominated by women as their central characters ? ) But I like the opportunity to give a nod to a very good actor in a mediocre series ( that would be Jim Parsons " Big Bang Theory " ) , as well as the chance to remind readers that Rob McElhenney has been doing excellently buffoonish work on " It ' s Always Sunny in Philadelphia . " And of course I ' m really pulling for Louis CK .
