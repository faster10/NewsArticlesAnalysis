You mark it down , Smith told co host Skip Bayless , Cam Newton is gonna be a villain . Don t get in the way of ( Broncos QB ) Peyton ( Manning ) and a perfect ending now . We can t have Peyton Manning losing three Super Bowls in a row : losing to New Orleans , losing to Seattle and getting ram rodded . Cam will have his time . . . You mark it down and remember I said this . . . . there will be people who will find every little thing to complain about with Cam because they don t want him to win because it ll get in the way of the storybook ending . I ll bet my check Cam Newton is the villain over the next two weeks .
