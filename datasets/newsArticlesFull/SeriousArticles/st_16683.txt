Because the Republican Party and black voters typically disagree on education , health care , jobs , war , and other issues , many black voters automatically dismiss Republican candidates . In fact , University of Cincinnati researchers recently confirmed that the Republican label can hurt black candidates . Voters in 28 all black Ohio precincts were mailed postcards with the photos of black candidates . But some cards included the words Endorsed by the Republican Party . The researchers found that black voters who got a card without the Republican identifier were nearly three times more likely to vote for the candidate .
