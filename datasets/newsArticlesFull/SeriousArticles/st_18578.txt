That Hollande and Obama choose to avoid such blunt causal attribution makes ( short sighted ) political sense . ? France s population may be , by now , 10 percent Muslim . ? Obama does not want to alienate Muslim communities in the United States , whose cooperation he needs to track radicalized youths , nor does he wish to endanger American interests abroad by demonizing , as we are so often inclined to say now , Islam as a whole . ? We get all that . ? The underlying assumption , however ? that Muslims must be placated or they may explode into violence ? may be less obvious . ? In any case , by avoiding the issue ? the jihadist problems the generally accepted Islamic canon presents us with ? our leaders hinder our having conversations we need to have , our asking questions we simply must ask .
