A ) The PKK , or Kurdistan Workers Party , was founded in 1978 in Turkey as a Marxist , pan Kurdish nationalist movement . In 1984 , it started armed combat against the Turkish state with the goal of establishing a broader Kurdistan in the Middle East , which would unite Kurdish minorities divided between Turkey , Iran , Iraq and Syria . That goal has been largely dropped over the last decade certainly since Turkish authorities arrested Ocalan in 1999 . Now the PKK appears to have much more limited goals : battling for Kurdish " cultural freedoms " in Turkey as well as some degree of autonomy for the Kurds , who are predominantly settled in south eastern Turkey .
