It s exciting to have a company like GE pick Boston and pick Massachusetts and they said they did it because we have this great business culture and tech savvy people , but its a bad deal to be giving them about 150 million of taxpayer money in order to do it , Falchuk , a 2014 gubernatorial candidate , said . I think it s pretty clear they probably would have picked Boston anyway based on what the CEO has been saying and what they did is asked the government , will you help us pay for this ? and they managed to get us to give them 150 million bucks .
