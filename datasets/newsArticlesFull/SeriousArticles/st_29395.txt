A third video has emerged showing a different angle of the confrontation between a school resource officer and female student on Monday in a South Carolina high school . Authorities say that in this video , the student can be seen hitting the officer in the head after he touches her . On Monday , two videos shot by other students in the Spring Valley High School classroom were released , showing Richland County Senior Sheriff Deputy Ben Fields flipping the student over in her desk and then dragging her away . Sheriff Leon Lott said when he first saw the videos , " I wanted to throw up . This makes you sick to your stomach when you see that initial video . But that ' s just a snapshot . " Lott said the girl was in math class , sending text messages on her phone instead of doing classwork . The teacher notified an administrator , and the student refused to leave class . Ultimately , Fields was called in to handle the situation . Lott said the department ' s internal investigation into whether Fields violated policy should be finished by Wednesday .
