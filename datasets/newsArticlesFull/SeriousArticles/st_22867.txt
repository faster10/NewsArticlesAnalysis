OK , so this guy is an extremist . But there are thousands , maybe millions , of gun owners out there whose sentiments are only a notch or two more restrained . These people talk a lot about liberty and freedom and love to call themselves patriots , but they seem to have a real problem with democracy . In a democracy , if people are proposing a law you don ' t like , you criticize it , you argue against it , you campaign against it , you vote against the politicians who support it . But if you believe in democracy , you don ' t threaten to start killing people if it passes . You don ' t say that if you don ' t like a new law , you ' ll start an insurrection to overthrow the government .
