The 43 states that sell lottery tickets happily take money from their residents knowing full well the income levels of those who are buying the tickets and the grotesquely miniscule odds of winning . I ' m not saying that we should ban the lottery , but states should not just tout the pipe dream of winning the jackpot . They should also encourage their citizens to use their hard earned money in a way that can make them into true " winners " by saving for an education or investing their salaries in things that can actually provide a return .
