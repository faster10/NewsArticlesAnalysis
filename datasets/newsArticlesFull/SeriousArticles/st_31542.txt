Unlike regular Indian TV , Netflix is not yet censoring its content . Of course , we don t wish to flout any local laws . But we plan to take on this on case by case basis . For now all the content is uncensored on Netflix . We also do have a rating system for our content and that s clearly visible when you re watching a movie or show . So we will warn a user if a content has strong language , violence etc , said Chris Jaffe Product Lead for Netflix . This rating system has been developed in house by the company based on global ratings .
