But my hybrid identity as a Muslim American born and raised in New Jersey serves as the foundation for my commitment to dialogue facilitation , conflict resolution , and peacebuilding . As an American , I know the sheer terror that 9 11 instilled in our individual and collective psyche . I understand the desire to regain a sense of security and comfort in our everyday lives and to defend against any group or ideology that appears even remotely threatening . As a Muslim , I know the exasperation of having our religion hijacked and used for something that was never its purpose . I understand the outrage of being held responsible for what we did not do ? in the form of discrimination , prejudice , and warfare against home countries .
