Liberals have not forgotten that Hillary voted to authorise the Iraq war . Trump reminded them of her husband s shady sexual past the press kept mentioning a complex email scandal that confirms suspicions that she s dishonest . And on caucus night , Sanders supporters cried things like : At least he doesn t take money from Goldman Sachs ! The Hillary show has been running too long . It is kept going by the sheer will of Hillary ? her determination to make it to the White House at any cost . The American people are just characters in her giant psychodrama , extras in the crowd scenes .
