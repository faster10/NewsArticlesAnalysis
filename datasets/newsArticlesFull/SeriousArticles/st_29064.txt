This isn ' t a debate over Davis ' values , but rather a reminder that she is a woman , and that a woman ' s place is at home . The digs here aren ' t about her character or her politics . They ' re about her gender , and the fact that voters continue to want their female candidates smarter , sharper and more unimpeachable than their male ones and to have stayed home with the kids , too . This is a prejudice that ' s not even rooted in truth , since a number of studies have found that children raised in single father homes fare just as well as those in single mother homes .
