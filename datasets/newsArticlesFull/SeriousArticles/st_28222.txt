6 . How important is it to have contiguous territory and coherent fighting forces trying to overthrow governments ? ISIS is stalled in Iraq and under attack from several sides in Syria . It ' s not expanding its contiguous territory and if core Islamic State is not expanding it is failing . How significant are pledges of allegiance of far away jihadist groups ( Libya , Khorason , the new groupuscule set up in Bahrain , unreliable Boko Haram ) ? In Afghanistan , ISIS seems to have attracted some Taliban fighters but the organizations still fight each other as well as the Kabul regime supported by the U . S . It remains to be seen if holding some territory in Afghanistan or elsewhere would enhance the core Islamic State in Syria Iraq . A transnational Islamist caliphate would have to cohere . A confederation or even a federal structure wouldn ' t work because it would always be under attack somewhere . A weak international structure would be even more fragile than the Ottoman Empire . ISIS may in fact be declining from a threat to regimes into a beleaguered core area whose successes are terrorist bombings abroad .
