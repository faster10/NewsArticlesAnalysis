Spread : The Alabama that showed up on New Year s Eve won t be beat by Clemson , but the chances that same effort can be replicated just over a week later is not likely . Clemson looked great in their semifinal game and do pose a problem that has long plagued Nick Saban and the Tide . There are keys on both sides of the ball which will help give a clue as to which way this game should be bet . When Bama s offense is on the field , the Tigers absolutely must slow down Derrick Henry and the Alabama rushing game . On the other side the key will be how often Crimson Tide players touch DeShaun Watson . If there is pressure on Watson the Clemson offense will not look anything like it has , but if they don t they can certainly spread out Alabama and put points up in bunches . The game should be close , because there s not a high probability that both of the keys go totally to Alabama . If you think they will , don t follow this pick . ? Pick : Clemson 6 . 5
