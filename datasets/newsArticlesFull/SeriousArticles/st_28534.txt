There are obviously a different number of pitches between the two images , but the NLDS and NLCS image has far more pitches out of the zone , especially low and away to right handed hitters . This makes sense : in 0 2 and 1 2 counts , a pitcher wants to throw pitches out of the zone . They want to get hitters to chase , and they can waste pitches trying to do that because the count is in their favor . The World Series image , however , has a lot of red ( meaning a higher frequency of pitches in that location ) on pitches up and over the heart of the plate . This , theoretically , is not want a pitcher wants to be doing in 0 2 and 1 2 counts .
