Golden State center Festus Ezeli was feeling a bit philosophical , so he turned to a presidential quotation ? originally from Harry Truman , but co opted by late UCLA coach John Wooden and subsequently by Warriors general manager Bob Myers . It goes like this , Ezeli said . It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit . That is perfectly applicable to this team , because everyone is genuinely happy for each other when we succeed or when someone is down , everybody picks him up .
