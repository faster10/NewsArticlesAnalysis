To understand this , it ' s important to remember how conservatives felt about Bill Clinton when he was president . It wasn ' t just that they disliked him personally and disagreed with his policies . Many political opponents also found Clinton infuriating , exasperating , maddening . With that easy charm and that ready smile and that silver tongue , they thought he was as phony as could be . It wasn ' t just that they found him dishonest , or that he always played it close to the ethical line . It was that again and again , he got away with it . Every time they thought they had him in their clutches , he ' d manage to slip free .
