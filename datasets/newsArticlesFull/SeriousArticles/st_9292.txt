The Commons on Wednesday was often a hall of mirrors . Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of a Labour party whose support for Britain in Europe is now pretty deep rooted , chose to question the prime minister not about the EU deal but about cancer treatment in the NHS . On one level Mr Corbyn was right . The state of the NHS is a larger concern for more people than the EU and cancer waiting lists are getting worse . On another level , the Labour leader was wrong . Although Europe is not the people s priority , and although Mr Corbyn can claim he was up for a debate on Tuesday while Mr Cameron preferred to make a speech in Chippenham , Europe is beyond question an existential issue of economic and international security for Britain . We have now finally reached the moment at which pro Europeans have to win the big argument . As in War and Peace , the comet is in the sky . So speak for Britain , Jeremy .
