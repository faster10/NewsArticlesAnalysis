We expect the Pac 12 to miss the playoff entirely , but a loss by Clemson or Alabama could change things . If Stanford beats USC this weekend , can you dismiss a conference champion that played the 16th toughest schedule in the country , per Sagarin Ratings ? The Cardinal have two losses , but they came against currently ranked teams ( No . 14 Northwestern and No . 16 Oregon ) . Meanwhile , Stanford would have three ranked wins in No . 6 Notre Dame and No . 20 USC ( twice ) along with a conference title . That ' s a better resume than , say , Ohio State or North Carolina .
