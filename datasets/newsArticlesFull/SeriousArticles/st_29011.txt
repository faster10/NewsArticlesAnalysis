The Redskins built an 11 0 early lead while the Packers got in their own way . J . C . Tretter , the second left tackle to fill in since David Bakhtiari got hurt in December , got manhandled for a first quarter safety . Packers running backs rushed four times for five yards in the first quarter . Receivers failed to get separation and failed to make contested catches . The Packers would have fallen hopelessly behind if not for some Redskins miscues : a missed extra point , a touchdown turned field goal when DeSean Jackson didn ' t try hard enough to definitively cross the plane of the goal line on a catch and run .
