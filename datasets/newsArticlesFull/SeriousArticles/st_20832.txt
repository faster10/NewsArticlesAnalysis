Trade analysts say that even as the collection of Hollywood movies in India has jumped in the last few years , there is a clear distinction between the films the Indian audience prefers to watch , and the films that win at the Academy Awards . Tinku Singh , group president and chief strategy officer , SRS cinemas , says , " The screening of Academy Award winning and nominated films is a market gimmick . " " These films are released around the time of the award ceremony to cash in on the Oscar hype . But the truth is that apart from a few exceptions , these films don ' t do well in India because they are for a niche audience and hence , only select releases can work , " says Tinku Singh .
