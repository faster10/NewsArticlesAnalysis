Contract law has been slow to acknowledge this reality . Courts have upheld these online " agreements " based on the contract principles that consumers should read every page of an agreement before they sign it . That advice is still sound today but is it reasonable ? Is the only other option to wander the Earth as the lone Luddite , disconnected from progress and civilization ? Perhaps contract law should intervene to prevent the mega corporation from sneaking or forcing contract terms upon an unsuspecting public .
