2 . McCoy tries to organize females only party . Days before Bills players reported to training camp in July , McCoy ' s official Instagram page posted a photo inviting women to a females only party in Philadelphia , in which women attending would need to sign a confidentiality agreement . The invitation , which used the Bills ' logo , was later removed and the party was canceled . In explaining the bizarre situation to reporters upon reporting to camp , McCoy said the invitation was taken out of context , adding , " It got too wild . I should never have posted it , and I take blame for it . . . . But for the record , it was no weird orgy thing going on . "
