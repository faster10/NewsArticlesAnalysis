The other option , my preference , is for Facebook to build its own search engine . Remember , they re building some powerful artificial intelligence in Facebook s labs that could be used to power a more heuristic search machine . As Zuckerberg said on Wednesday , their visual AI can see a new image and answer questions about it . That kind of intelligence can intuit a lot of information from graphical and text information indexed from the Web . If Facebook is smart , though , it will build a search engine that does not try to organize the world s information , but instead triangulates with existing interests on Facebook . At least that s how it could quickly build a search engine to start .
