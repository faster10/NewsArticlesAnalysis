The San Joaquin Valley , California ' s other pollution center , is largely a rural area and home to the state ' s agricultural industry . The wide , flat valley , like Los Angeles , is surrounded by mountains that trap air . Since the valley ' s population is growing , there are also more cars and trucks . And two major north south truck routes , I 5 and U . S . 99 , bisect the valley . Off road vehicles used in agriculture as well as agricultural practices such as burning off fields also contribute to particulate matter overload . I drove through the valley on my way to Yosemite National Park last October , but the smog was so thick I couldn ' t see the Sierra Nevada range until I was there .
