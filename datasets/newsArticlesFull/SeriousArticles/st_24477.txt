5 Phil Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie collapse 2006 Australia ' s Geoff Ogilvy was handed the U . S . Open trophy when two of his rivals for the title pressed the self destruct button . Ogilvy had earlier chipped in at the 17th and holed a brave putt at the 18th to set the target at five over par for victory . Montgomerie dropped two shots on the 18th hole when a first major title seemed to be within his grasp and moments later Mickelson , who needed only a par to secure the title , also suffered a case of the last hole jitters and double bogeyed to completed the double collapse .
