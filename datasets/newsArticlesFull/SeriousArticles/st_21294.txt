I thought that was really clever . Despite the humorous side of their relationship well , humorous to the audience where Marie nitpicks and pokes at her sister all the time , I don ' t think Marie means to do that . They both really love each other . Betsy Brandt and Vince Gilligan and I have discussed this : " Where ' s their family ? " You never hear about the rest of the family , the mom and dad , at all . We made the assumption that we did not have a particularly happy or easy childhood , and that led to the two of us sticking together , because they ' re very close . For actors , you ' ve gotta sometimes fill in your backstory . At least that ' s what I did , very specifically that I needed Marie , and I love her , and I know she doesn ' t mean ill .
