While the Democratic race has gotten A LOT more interesting and A LOT more heated over the past week , there ' s a big difference between what ' s going on in that contest versus the GOP one . If the Dem race was following the same Tarantino like script , then Hillary Clinton would be directly calling Bernie Sanders a communist ( on the campaign trail and in paid advertising ) Sanders would be calling Clinton a liar and seizing on the email issue and The Nation would publish an entire issue devoted to taking down Hillary . But that isn ' t happening at least not yet . ( But David Brock is definitely being David Brock . ) If the GOP contest is a Tarantino flick , then the Dem contest is straight out of Wes Anderson maybe a little tense and edgy , but mostly ironic and retro ( with even Simon Garfunkel playing a role ) .
