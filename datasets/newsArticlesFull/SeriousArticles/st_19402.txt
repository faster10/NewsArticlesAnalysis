It could be really interesting to see how Phillips is going to make it difficult for Brady to complete a lot of those short to intermediate passes because that s where their offense predominantly functions , Esiason said . If he tries to do it this week the way he did it last week against Ben Roethlisberger , he s going to get ripped to pieces . Because Brady gets rid of the ball so quickly and has all his weapons at his disposal now with all the receivers , and of course Rob Gronkowski , you gotta pick your poison . The way I would do it , I would rush three and make it a very crowded secondary .
