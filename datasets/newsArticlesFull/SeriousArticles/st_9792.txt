If the Queen asks to visit this property again , it shouldn t be in this state . We must save it . Tourists are disgusted at how we treat our heritage . The government of Malta said it had begun the process of buying the villa a long time ago and believes that the property is one of historical heritage . During their time at Villa Guardamangia ( Italian for look and eat ) , the future Queen would drive around the island unescorted in her open topped car , or pop to the cinema to watch a film , holding hands with the Duke , who was based on the island as commander of HMS Magpie in the Mediterranean Fleet .
