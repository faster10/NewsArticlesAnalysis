Unsung hero : Here s a tip of the cap to the Ole Miss defense . The Rebels were coming off a rocky game against Arkansas , in which they surrendered 53 points and lost in overtime , but the defense played a key role as Ole Miss pulled away in the second half . They picked off two Harris passes ( one each by Christian Russell and Woods ) , recovered a fumble ( Marquis Haynes ) , made a goal line stand in the fourth quarter and notched seven tackles for loss . LSU star Leonard Fournette ( 108 rushing yards , 72 receiving ) still had a big night , and LSU totaled 508 yards on offense , but the Rebels made more than enough big plays to win comfortably .
