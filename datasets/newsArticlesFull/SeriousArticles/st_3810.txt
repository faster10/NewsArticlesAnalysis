Frank Gore at Jaguars : The Jaguars are permitting just 3 . 57 YPC and the eighth fewest fantasy points to running backs over the past three weeks . Coach Chuck Pagano said ahead of the Colts Week 13 game against the Steelers that Gore was beat to crap , and the 32 year old went out there and averaged a measly 3 . 46 YPC on 13 totes . The way to beat the Jaguars is through the air . They re 31st in Football Outsiders pass defense DVOA , but ninth against the run . Gore is able to buoy his floor by being more involved in the pass game with Ahmad Bradshaw ( wrist ) out for the season , but it s not enough to make him anything more than a low upside RB2 3 against a run defense that is playing much better of late .
