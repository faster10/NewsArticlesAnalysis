The Ravens offense was hard to watch on Sunday , this is especially true for the passing game . Matt Schaub looked uncomfortable for most of the game that has a lot to do with the play of the offensive line . The Dolphins were able to get pressure on the Ravens QB largely due to the play of James Hurst and Rick Wagner . Both struggled to consistently keep Schaub clean in the pocket and it led to some disastrous results . Schaub threw another patented pick 6 that ended up being the difference in the game . When a team such as Baltimore is without so much talent due to injury , it s hard to recover from plays like that .
