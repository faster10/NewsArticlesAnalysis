SF : The TIU will make a big song and dance about sanctions handed out ? to a dozen players and one official . Ask any casual fan of the sport ? if they have ever heard of ANY of those players banned . I follow the ? sport closely on a daily basis , and deeper than just the top tours , ? and I hadn ' t even heard of most of those players scapegoats . Do we ? really believe that nobody ever ranked inside the top 150 has ever ? manipulated a match ? The one exception is Daniel Koellerer , a much despised player on the tour that most of the circuit would have ? happily thrown him under a bus . . .
