It s huge for us , it really is , said Rodgers , who survived a shaky start and wound up leading Green Bay to four touchdowns and a field goal on five drives that spanned from the early in the second quarter to early in the fourth . I talked a lot the last couple weeks about being able to turn it on . A lot of you the media probably thought it was lip service . But we just needed a game like this to get our mojo back and our confidence going . I said this week it just takes one , it just takes one performance to get us going back in the right direction and believing we can make a run .
