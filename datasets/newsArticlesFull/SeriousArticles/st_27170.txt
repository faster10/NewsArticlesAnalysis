Johnson : It ' s been a real surprise . Generally , what happens is , Hollywood writes you a check and says , " See you later . " My situation has been a little bit different . I was asked to be an executive creative consultant on the show . I bounced back and forth with the writers on ideas for the show . Then they sent me the first screenplay for the pilot episode . I went through it , and I made something like 57 changes and sent it back to them , and out of the 57 changes , they made 55 of them . So it ' s been very hands on and very responsive . They ' ve kept me in the loop the whole time . I was on set for three weeks while they were filming the pilot . I was very lucky and have been working with really good people . It ' s been an amazing process .
