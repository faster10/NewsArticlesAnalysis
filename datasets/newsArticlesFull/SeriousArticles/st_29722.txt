Adding to the woes of those trying to master Go is the fact that , unlike chess , it s very difficult to look at the board and mathematically determine who is winning . In chess , a player with their queen will probably beat a player whose queen has been taken , and so on : it s possible to assign values to those pieces , and come up with a running score that roughly ranks each player s prospects . In Go , by contrast , counters are rarely removed from the board , and there s no simple mathematical way to determine who is in the stronger position until the game is very far progressed .
