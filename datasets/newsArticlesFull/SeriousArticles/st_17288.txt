Most presidential candidates over promise , of course , which is something I discussed with my colleague Andrew O Hehir in our dialogue over this . Clinton does it , too , and you d be a fool to claim otherwise . ? But her over promising is relatively mild , considering most of what she has on offer could be accomplished if she got a Democratic majority in Congress at some point during her presidency , which is far from impossible , albeit improbable . What Sanders is offering ? single payer healthcare , free college at public universities ? is never going to happen not even with a 65 percent Democratic majority in both houses of Congress .
