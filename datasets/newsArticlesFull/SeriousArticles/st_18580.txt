If we refuse to address these issues , terrorist attacks will likely multiply and push our politics ever further to the right . ? We may well then end up in police states , with security organs even more pervasive and intrusive than they are now . ? Or even more perniciously , confused about what is at stake , we may continue our slide into craven accommodationism , into accepting illiberal beliefs ( and resulting behavior ) as the off limits patrimony of various religious and national groups , thereby consigning to the dust bin of history once lauded ideals of universal human rights . ? ( This is just what Islamophobia denouncers are after . ) ? We should always bear in mind that there is only one Universal Declaration on Human Rights , and it grants no exceptions on the basis of religion or culture . ? That one or another faith happens to boast a majority of nonwhite adherents does not make criticism of that faith racist . ? Islam in particular has universalist pretensions and so must be liable to criticism by all . ? We need to junk , finally , the preposterous claim , advanced by the religion s apologists , that Islam cannot motivate violence .
