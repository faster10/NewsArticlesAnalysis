Of necessity we must scale this back . The way you do this is just to make it not as accessible for folks going forward . There s re enrollment for Medicaid , just as there is for any number of other programs , etc . So we would not allow people to re enroll , going forward , at 138 of the federal poverty level . Is that done immediately ? That will be done in a uniform fashion because you can t just simply end it on day one . You have to of necessity start to do this as people enroll anyhow . So we are going to scale it back . We cannot afford to do otherwise .
