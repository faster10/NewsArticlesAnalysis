I first tackled climate science as a graduate student in theoretical physics , looking around for a topic that would be worthy of a lifetime ' s work . Attacked both professionally and personally , I became a reluctant public figure in the climate wars . And now , as the father of a 6 year old girl , I want to make sure the planet we leave her is at least as beautiful and healthy as the one we grew up on . At the very least , our nation ' s political and business leaders deserve to have a debate about her future that is grounded in reality .
