For almost two years , a relative calm in the village of Ter Ma aleh had made it a refuge for thousands of people displaced by the war from other towns , residents said . A woman who asked to be identified as Umm Suleiman , or the mother of Suleiman , said her family decided to flee Ter Ma aleh a week ago , after a bomb fell near her house and killed a relative . They found a car to drive them out of the area but ran into snipers and more shelling on the road . The family rented a hut on a farm and were waiting there , dreading the arrival of government troops .
