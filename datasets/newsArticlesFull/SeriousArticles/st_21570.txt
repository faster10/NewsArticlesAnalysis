Arguably the worst thing you can do against the Warriors besides leaving Curry unattended behind the 3 point line is turn the ball over and ignite their lethal transition game . The Dubs have at least three players capable of leading a fast break on the floor at all times , and the threat of their shooting opens up either lanes to the rim or high percentage 3 pointers . Neither is ideal . While the Warriors can still effortlessly create transition opportunities off of stops and even off of makes they re first in fast break points they re especially dangerous when you turn it over ( they rank fifth in points off turnovers ) . Don t do that .
