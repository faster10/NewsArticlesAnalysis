In April of 2014 , Flint ' s emergency town manager decided that rather than renew a contract with Detroit to continue receiving drinking water from Detroit ' s system , Flint would instead draw water from the Flint River , a measure that it was thought would save the town 5 million . Not long afterward , residents began noticing their water looked , smelled , and tasted funny . People were getting rashes , and they were concerned about bacteria . The city government had to issue periodic " boil water " advisories to residents because of the bacteria . The water was treated to eliminate the bacteria , but the larger problem remained undetected .
