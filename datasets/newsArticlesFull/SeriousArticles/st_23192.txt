Two kinds of corporations keep track of what you buy , read , visit , drink whom you call , e mail , and date and lots more . Some merely track your activity on their site as part of their regular business , to help them sell you stuff . This is true from Amazon to Zappos . Other corporations make shadowing you and keeping very detailed dossiers on you their main line of business . They sell this information to all comers . Just one such company , Choicepoint , has records on more than 220 million people .
