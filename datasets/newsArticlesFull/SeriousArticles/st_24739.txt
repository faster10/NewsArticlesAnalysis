According to the complaint , Muse fired his gun at the Maersk ' s captain , Richard Phillips , and then took 30 , 000 from the ship ' s safe after he forced Phillips to open it . A Maersk crew member managed to tackle Muse and tie his hands , leading to a deal with the pirates : They would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them and if they got a life boat , the complaint said . Phillips boarded the life boat with them and the ship ' s crew freed Muse , who then boarded the life boat , according to the criminal complaint . Over the next three days , the life boat floated near the Maersk with the U . S . Navy ' s USS Bainbridge nearby .
