" I have never ever ever been able to attach myself to the word ' heavy metal ' it has no musical connotations , " Osbourne says . " If it was heavy rock I could get that but the 70s was kind of like a bluesy thing , the 80s was kind of bubblegum frosted hair , multicolored clothes and the 90s was kind of grungy . People come up to me and say ' your Sabbath work was a big influence on me . ' I could go ' Oh yeah I can see that ' but other bands . . . what part of that is inspired by us ? Some of it is just angry people screaming down a microphone ! "
