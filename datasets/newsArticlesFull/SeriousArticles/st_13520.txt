While that ' s an exceptional percentage , it ' s comparable to ten years ago when the Canadian shot ? Brokeback Mountain and ? Capote made up 40 per cent ? of the best picture nominees ( and ? lost to Crash , which was oddly enough directed by London , Ont . born Paul Haggis ) . But none of those films ? ? despite Canadian talent being involved ? ? were actually Canadian productions . ? Brooklyn ? and Room , ? however , are ( in both cases co productions with Ireland ) . Today they became only the second and third Canadian films , ? even if neither is actually set here . Their sole predecessor ? ? 1980 ' s Canada France co production Atlantic City . ? As the title suggests , that film wasn ' t exactly full of Canada playing itself either . ? But we ' ll take what we can get .
