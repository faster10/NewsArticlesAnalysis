Cherry ' s solution to the issue is to have gun lockers installed in the stadium so that cops can securely disarm before entering the stadium and get their gun back once they leave . The NFL expressed their appreciation for law enforcement officials but believes that limiting the number of weapons in the stadium benefits everyone ' s safety . There are already assigned and armed officers in the stadium who have been briefed on the safety protocols designed for each stadium . Cherry is still pushing for the NFL to change their rule . ' You have many officers who do have season tickets , will show up at a Ravens game because they are in the city and they work for Baltimore City Police they are required to be suitably armed . Now the NFL says well you can ' t bring your weapon into our stadium , ' said Cherry .
