? ? Steve Politi , columnist ( 6 5 against the spread , 8 3 straight up on Jets picks ? 4 6 1 against the spread on Giants picks ) : ? I like it when the two local teams play ? I can only get the pick wrong once ! As much as the Jets are concerned about covering Beckham , I think the Giants should be just as concerned about trying to protect Manning behind that ever shifting offensive line . Look for the Jets defense to have a big day and for the Tom Coughlin Watch to officially begin . ? Jets 27 , Giants 20 ?
