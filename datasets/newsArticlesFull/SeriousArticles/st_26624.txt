The anti hate group hacker said he worked to verify the names before he released them . I got the information from several KKK websites when I hacked them and was able to dump their database , he told Tech Crunch , while remaining nameless . I went through many emails that was signed up with these sites and a few of the emails that sparked my interest was the ones of the politicians in question there would be no reason for them to be signed up on any KKK website unless they supported it or was involved in it .
