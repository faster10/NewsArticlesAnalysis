Dale : We ' re talking about some of the most selfless , really true professional public servants the world will ever know . These are folks who aren ' t in it for medals , they aren ' t in it for glamor , they aren ' t in it for prestige , they aren ' t in it for notoriety . They ' re in it because they believe it ' s the right thing to do , because they think it ' s an important and vital mission . That was our mission when we started out writing the graphic novel , to reflect some light , some glory , without ripping away the veil of secrecy , but reflect some light and glory on truly professional , dedicated , patriotic men and women .
