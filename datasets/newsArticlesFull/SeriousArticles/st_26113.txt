You hate to disengage when that s your job . You hate to not be on the field . You don t want to ever disarm unilaterally . But it is still a farce , so Becerra said , trailing off . Benghazi makes it clear what you are looking at . For those who wish to be responsible with our government , who believe our government is supposed to be doing oversight under the Constitution and really try to fulfill our role , it is tough to say that we are just going to distance ourselves because we know it is a political show .
