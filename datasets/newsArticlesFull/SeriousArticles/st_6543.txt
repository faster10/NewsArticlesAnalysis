I go back and forth on this in my own mind , says Loewenstein , but I think Saudi Arabia is more important to the Americans than Israel . Not just because of oil , although that s a big part of it . But because Saudi Arabia is the dominant , ascendant power among Arab states . America has been closely allied with the Saudi monarchy since it was established in the 1930s , when Franklin D . Roosevelt was in the White House . First the Saudi regime was indispensable for economic reasons , Loewenstein says , once it became clear that America s domestic oil supply was drying up . Then the Saudis became important for political and strategic reasons , after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 . Access and control to Saudi Arabia s bottomless petroleum reserves , and the freedom to use the kingdom as the center of American military power in the Middle East , trumped all considerations of human rights , democracy and ideology .
