It ' s Ejiofor ' s extraordinary performance that holds 12 Years a Slave together . He gives Solomon a deep inner strength , yet he never softens the nightmare of his existence . His ultimate pain isn ' t the beatings or the humiliation . It ' s being ripped from his family , blockaded away from all he is . 12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes , and at moments it ' s hard to watch , yet it ' s a film of such emotion that in telling the story of a life that gets taken away , it lets us touch what life is . Grade : A
