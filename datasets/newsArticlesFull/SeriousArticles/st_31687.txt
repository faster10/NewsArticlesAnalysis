Jennifer Lawrence continues to be a blue chip award winner , picking up best actress ( musical comedy ) for her intriguingly controlled but for me somewhat opaque performance in David O Russell s Joy . She is a very charismatic screen presence , a real star , though I have Martian type reservations about this as a musical comedy performance ( unlike her appearance in Russell s American Hustle ) . However marvellous Lawrence is , I found myself wondering if she shouldn t have been made to duke it out in the serious section and that each of her competitiors here ( Amy Schumer , Melissa McCarthy , Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin ) were more qualified in this category .
