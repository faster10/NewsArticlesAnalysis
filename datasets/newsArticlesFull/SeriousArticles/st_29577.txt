Alvarez added that the gun recovered on the scene had Johnson s DNA on it and matched a live cartridge casing that was found in the car in which Johnson had been a passenger shortly before his confrontation with Hernandez . She also said her investigation had found that , though Johnson was running from Hernandez when he was killed , he was simultaneously running toward other officers , and could have turned around at any moment to fire his gun . In light of that , Alvarez said , it was reasonable for Hernandez to believe that Johnson represented a threat of death or serious bodily harm to him and his fellow officers , making him legally justified in his decision to use deadly force .
