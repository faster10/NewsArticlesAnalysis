" This event took place in 2010 and has been in existence going back to 2002 , " the agency said . " Today , under the new GSA leadership , this event and type of spending is not tolerated . As of April 2012 all spending for events , including training conferences , leadership events , team building exercises , award ceremonies , were suspended . These events indicate an already recognized pattern of misjudgment which spans several years and administrations . It must stop , and is why Acting Administrator Tangherlini has instituted several stringent new policies on spending to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars . "
