There will be those who call such killing extrajudicial . But that is not correct . Although the British Parliament has not voted to conduct air strikes from the air above Syria , we are , nevertheless , a part of a multi state coalition , many of whose members , including the United States , have sanctioned such air operations . To be working in close partnership with the military forces of other coalition members is exactly how such a coalition is designed to operate . To those who might argue that a pre emptive strike against Emwazi was unjustified , on the grounds that he may not have posed a clear and present danger at the time of the attack , is to ignore Emwazi s actions in the past .
