I m in the awkward position of having to introduce him again . Listen , I m sure it s embarrassing for both of us . I blame NBC for this terrible situation . Mel blames we know who Mel blames . Listen , I still feel a bit bad for it . Mel s forgotten all about it apparently , that s what drinking does . I want to say something nice about Mel before he comes out . So : I d rather have a drink with him in his hotel room tonight than with Bill Cosby . Then , as bleeped by NBC : What the f ck does sugar t ts even mean ?
