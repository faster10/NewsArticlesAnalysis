In a November interview on Entertainment Weekly Radio , Jordan recalled how Stallone put him at ease as he joined the Rocky saga . The first time I met him , I was almost expecting to meet Rocky , but it s not Rocky , it s Sly , and I was like , Oh snap , this guy was acting the whole time ! He s a person ! This is crazy ! That s a testament to his acting skills , Jordan said . But there wasn t any pressure , because he kind of took the pressure off me . He was like , You shouldn t compare yourself to what I did 40 years ago , because this is your movie . ? Just hearing him say that took that weight off my shoulders from the beginning . If anybody else put pressure on me , I didn t feel it . How can I let that affect me if Sly himself is telling me not to worry about it ? If he s cool with it , I m cool with it . ?
