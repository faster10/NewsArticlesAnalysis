ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : Presidential campaigns reveal things about the nation , even if we don ' t and won ' t always like what we see . So it is that Donald Trump ' s unserious , unworkable , and probably unconstitutional proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US is drawing swift , bipartisan condemnation even while there ' s little suggestion it will hurt him in the polls . It ' s more than possible that a third of Republican primary voters agree with him , or at least would excuse him in the context of the spirit with which they think the proposal was offered . Cue the statements rare public breaks from House Speaker Paul Ryan , the national Republican Party , and state party chairs in New Hampshire , South Carolina , and Iowa Jeb Bush is calling Trump " unhinged , " and Chris Christie is labeling it " ridiculous . " ( Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are breaking less completely , of course . ) Trump may not be the GOP nominee , though this doesn ' t look like it would be the reason his supporters dump him . It could , however , serve as a unifying and clarifying moment for a Republican Party grappling with the real possibility that he could be the nominee . Dumping Trump is looking more like a process than a single event . But a united Republican Party holds the hope of turning the hope that Trump will fade into an actual strategy .
