Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . That ' s because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter , you ' re going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on Facebook live in their moms ' basements and are " between jobs , " these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place .
