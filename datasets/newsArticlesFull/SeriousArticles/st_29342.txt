Martin O Malley . O Malley was the big surprise of the evening , sounding smart and confident on this issue , which has not been anything close to the focus of his campaign . He pulled a slightly sleazy move , claiming , I would disagree with ? with Secretary Clinton , respectfully , on this score , before going forward and saying exactly the same thing she did , which is that he thinks that we have to deal with ISIS , but we have to do it in a collaborative way with other nations . ( All three candidates said this . )
