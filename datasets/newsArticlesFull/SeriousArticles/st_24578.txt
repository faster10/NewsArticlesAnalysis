Who s the offensive coordinator ? The Chiefs will lose Doug Pederson to the Philadelphia Eagles , where he will become the head coach . Andy Reid has no shortage of candidates to replace Pederson if he stays within his current staff . An obvious choice is special offensive assistant Brad Childress , but Childress didn t get the job when Reid joined the Chiefs in 2013 . A better choice could be quarterbacks coach Matt Nagy , who joined the Chiefs when Reid was hired and has worked with Alex Smith since arriving in a trade with the 49ers a couple of months later . Reid could also turn to wide receivers coach David Culley or running backs coach Eric Bieniemy . In any case , Reid will probably continue to call the offensive plays .
