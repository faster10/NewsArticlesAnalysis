Attribution of such a statement to Rajnath by implication means that he is not just a blind Modi bhakt but also an irrational , irresponsible , rabid and highly regressive Hindutavadi mainstream leader who did not accept any of Indian ruler before and after Independence as Hindu , not even Atal Bihari Vajapyee during whose tenure he held various ministries at the Centre and was also Uttar Pradesh chief minister . He is bent on setting the record right , more so because he holds the high post of Home minister and is the designated Number Two in the Modi government .
