Rickman s precision and poise is extraordinary , and the whole scene is beautifully underplayed . From the background of the shot , while sitting on a bench and doing nothing much more than narrowing his eyes and furrowing his brow , he conveys the king s stunned disbelief at Sabine s impertinence , then wry comprehension as he understands her error , followed by his carefully masked feelings of delight as he realises this encounter , free from the airs and graces of courtly life , is something precious and to be savoured .
