What is needed for PIA now is massive investment and tough but fair decisions that can turn the airline into a sustainable and globally competitive carrier . This sort of investment is unwise for the government to make because at the end of the day its political motives will outweigh sensible economic decisions ? take the 2010 164 page comprehensive restructuring plan that recommended the elimination of 4 , 300 staff positions but , like almost all other plans for the airline , was never implemented . If PIA has any hope of survival it is time to privatise it so a culture of compliance and a structure of meritocracy can be built . The only way forward for the government is to maintain its position of a pathway privatisation that allows for a majority of its employees to retain their jobs and all of them to retain their dignity while turning the airline into a profit making entity . Simply put , business is not the government s business . It is time Pakistan woke up to this reality .
