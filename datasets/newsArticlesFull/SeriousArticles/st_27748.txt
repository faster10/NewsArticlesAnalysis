" This is a question I am asked often , specifically by my female friends and family members . To be perfectly honest , I do not have an exact answer . I just have a bad feeling that marriage isn ' t something Keith and I should do . I can ' t really explain it , but the feeling is there , and it gets stronger and stronger every time someone asks me why I do not want to get married . In the end , I will continue to go with my gut and just stay the way we are now . " Amanda W . , San Diego , California
