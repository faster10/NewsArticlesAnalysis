In 2012 , Joshua Woods , 22 , was killed in Houston , Texas shortly after buying a pair of newly released Air Jordans by four men who followed him from the mall . His mother , Dazie Williams , has launched a campaign called Life Over Fashion which aims to change the way Nike distributes its sought after sneakers . ' Nike nor Michael Jordan didn ' t pull the trigger that killed my son , but with great power comes great responsibility . It ' s product liability . If your name is on a product , you have to stand up . The first person that got killed for Jordans was in 1989 , and here we are in 2013 , ' she said .
