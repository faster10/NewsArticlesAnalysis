A museum where vacuum cleaners are out of the closet . Stark ' s Vacuum Cleaner Museum where you won ' t find crumbs , cobwebs or a single dust bunny will sweep you off your feet . More than 100 vintage vacuums from the late 1800s up to the 1960s are on display in a 10 foot by 40 foot wing of Stark ' s Vacuums in downtown Portland . Other than during the summer of 2012 , when the Vacuum Cleaner Collectors Club convened at this Smithsonian of Sucking Machines , the little museum averages about a dozen visitors a month who come to ogle rare pre electricity hand pumped vacs , a cardboard model from the penny pinching 1930s , an Electrolux on runners and a Duntley Pneumatic that attaches to the ceiling . Needless to say , the museum ' s carpet is spotless .
