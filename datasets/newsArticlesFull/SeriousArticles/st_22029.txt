The prime minister has already hinted at this when Mr Cameron suggested that there would be a need for compromise between the previous western insistence that Assad has to go now and the Russian refusal to contemplate his departure at all . There have been some signs of a reciprocating shift in the Kremlin , one influenced by the confirmation that an Isis affiliated group planted the bomb that destroyed the Russian airbus over the Sinai . This new position will tolerate Assad staying in power , at least for a transitional period , and selling that idea will require some dexterity from Mr Cameron . When he sought , and failed to secure , parliamentary approval for air strikes in 2013 , the stated purpose then was to punish the Syrian dictator for his use of chemical weapons . It now looks almost certain that the prime minister will go back to the Commons to ask the question again , but this time for a different purpose . He will be asking MPs to sanction the extension of British military action against the principal combatant against the Syrian dictator . This is quite a volte face and he will be told so by his critics , including the small but important minority on the Tory benches still opposed to air strikes in Syria . I guess he could give them the reply of John Maynard Keynes when he was taunted for being inconsistent and say that when the facts change , it is sensible to change your mind .
