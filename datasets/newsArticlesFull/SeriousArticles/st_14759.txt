Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two biggest economies in the region . Iran , battered by sanctions , had been faring poorly according to all economic indicators till 2014 when Rouhani changed its policies of confrontation practiced by Ahmadinejad to those of collaboration . The impact of this renewed dialogue resulted in a much better economic dividend than in the previous many decades . The economy expanded by three percentin 2014 , on the heels of annual economic contractions of 6 . 6 percent and 1 . 9 percent in 2012 and 2013 , respectively . As of August 2015 , the official and parallel market rates were trading at 29 , 797 Iranian rials per dollar and 33 , 400 Iranian rials per dollar , respectively , thereby representing a difference of about 13 percent , down from roughly 190 percent in the second quarter of 2012 when sanctions were tightened . The inflation rate declined from a year on year peak of 45 . 1 percent in 2012 to 15 . 6 percent in June 2015 in line with the lifting of sanctions and the tightening of the monetary policy by the Central Bank of Iran .
