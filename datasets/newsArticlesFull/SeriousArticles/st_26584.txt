As I said , this isn ' t exactly an inspirational message . In a year where a large portion of the electorate on both sides of the aisle is calling for fundamental change in Washington , Clinton is making the case that for all that lofty talk of revolutionary change , when the next president is sworn in , Congress will still remain . Even if the Democrats win the White House again and provide some strong down ballot coattails , it ' s more than likely that Republicans will still control the House of Representatives . This means that Paul Ryan ( or his successor ) is likely going to have to be a party to any negotiations over new legislation . So hoping for fundamental change means , almost inevitably , that you ' re going to be disappointed with the actual results .
