Tampa Bay Buccaneers : The Bucs have doubled their win total from a year ago , but they still haven t claimed consecutive victories under coach Lovie Smith . Tampa Bay has to see more from its offense to claim that elusive second consecutive win after totaling just one touchdown in each of the past two games . The Bucs defense should play well enough to keep Tampa Bay close throughout . But until the Bucs show the ability to string wins together , there s reason to doubt them . Eagles 24 , Bucs 20 .
