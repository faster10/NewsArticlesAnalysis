At the secret CIA post , Prince met with a handful of his men who had come to greet him . Several of them looked as if they had walked out of an X Files convention : long hair , plaid flannel shirts and baggy pants worn much further down than pants were meant to be worn .

Prince ' s men had apparently made the CIA happy , providing static security and performing unknown other tasks .
