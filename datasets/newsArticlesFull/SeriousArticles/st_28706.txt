GOLD ( EN ) STATE : Nearly 60 percent of the deals inked by the California Public Employees ' Retirement System ( CalPERS ) with private equity firms allow the firms to reduce their tax bills , Reuters reported . CalPERS , the largest public retirement fund in the country , often agrees to waive management fees , which are subject to ordinary income tax rates . Instead , that money is treated as a capital contribution and taxed at lower capital gains rates . This is basically a tax avoidance strategy from the GPs firms general partners . It is a controversial practice but one that does persist in the industry , CalPERS senior staff counsel Marte Castanos told Reuters . http : reut . rs 1O6q6vC
