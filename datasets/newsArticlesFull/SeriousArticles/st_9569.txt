On the first of those assertions , Kessler looks at a number of Clinton s public statements just after the attacks and concludes that in fact , it is clear she was very careful to keep the attacks separate from the video . In other words , Rubio exaggerated at best . ( Then U . N . ambassador Susan Rice s statements are another matter they clearly cross that line , but Rice subsequently retracted them , saying they were based on wrong real time intelligence . ) It s true that the victims families have said she privately told them this , and to my knowledge the Clinton camp hasn t denied it publicly , but we still have no direct proof of this . Clinton should be asked about it .
