Mann is the principal author of the " hockey stick curve " a graph that boldly illustrates the dramatic rise in average global temperatures over the past 50 years , a rise unlike anything in the previous 1 , 000 years . Because the hockey stick curve is visually compelling , it ' s been reproduced many times , and in 2001 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change featured it in their third assessment report . It ' s also made Mann a target for those who don ' t want to admit that global warming is a real problem .
