The official release said the two sides mutually agreed that Richt would step down following a meeting with athletics director Greg McGarity on Sunday . But make no mistake , Richt had spent the last month fighting to keep his job and coach in 2016 .

He won close games against Auburn , Georgia Southern and Georgia Tech to finish 9 3 this season , following a 10 3 record last year .
