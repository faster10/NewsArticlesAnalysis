In a Godfather esque gathering of rival political concerns , representatives of the Republican presidential campaigns gathered in an Alexandria , Virginia Hilton on Sunday evening to draw up a list of conditions for their participation in future presidential debates . The campaigns still are all het up about the completely unfair questioning that business Republican network CNBC subjected them to last week , such as , Marco Rubio , your tax plan is really good for the wealthy , no ? or , Ben Carson , why were you in bed with this snake oil company for so many years ? If the moderators had asked fair questions , see , the candidates wouldn t have been forced to lie . What s so complicated about that ?
