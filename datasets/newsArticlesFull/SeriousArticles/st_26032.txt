The rally was supposed to start at 9 p . m . , ? but was running late . So I turned on Fox to see if Trump had pulled a fast one and shown up on the debate stage after all . Jeb Bush was in the middle of one of his trademark babbles , sounding a bit more forceful than he has when he has shared a stage with Trump , though no more coherent . Still , even two or three minutes of watching was enough to see that the whole exercise felt bloodless , just a bunch of middle aged guys in suits and terrible ties competing to paint the most apocalyptic , charred hellscape vision of America under President Obama that they could . To listen to these candidates , you d think the debate was taking place in Immortan Joe s skull bedecked redoubt from Mad Max : Fury Road , while outside in the Iowa winter several thousand rag clad , one toothed desert refugees looked hopefully skyward and prayed for mercy .
