Kony Ealy : The defensive end really is tied to what was said above about Gettleman and McDermott . Gettleman selected the former Missouri star in the second round of the 2014 draft . He had a first round grade on Ealy , even though some of the so called draft experts thought the second round might be too high . McDermott had to break Ealy down early and patiently build him into the player he has become . Ealy has a sack in each of the past four games . His ability to play end and tackle is beginning to draw comparisons to Hardy , although he ' s not there yet . But Ealy is playing so well that he deserves serious consideration to remain a starter with Johnson returning , although odds are Johnson and Allen will get the nod .
