Crais : It ' s pretty simple . You know the old saying , if it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it ? I ' m concerned that if there ' s a film of Elvis and Joe , that somehow it will interfere with the collaboration I have with my readers . I ' m the first to admit this is probably a knuckleheaded fear on my part , but I have it nevertheless . Books are a collaborative art . Elvis and Joe don ' t exist until someone picks up one of the books and reads it . In the act of reading , you and I collaborate , and Elvis and Joe come to life inside your head .
