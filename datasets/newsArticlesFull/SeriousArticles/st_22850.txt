The Vienna process launched in October 2015 aims to have the transitional governing body in place by mid 2016 . If it is not installed by the end of June it should absent compelling reasons to believe that a brief extension would achieve the objective be abandoned . Indeed , the process should not even extend through June unless sieges and attacks on civilian neighborhoods overwhelmingly the work of the regime and its external enablers are substantially ended , and political prisoners released . Civilian protection is table ante for the process : even before ceasefire arrangements between combatants . Without it , good faith negotiations are impossible . Without it , ISIL will harvest many more recruits : in Syria and around the world .
