As a NATO member , patrolling aircraft are not generally authorized to open fire at will . Instead , they report to base and await instructions . After having confirmed sighting , the SU24 , the Turkish pilot would then have had to report to his controller on the ground . Someone at a Turkish Military base then had to make a decision and issue the order to engage and destroy . The pilot then has to lock the target into his weapons system and push the button to launch his air to air missiles . Thus , all of that had to have happened before the Russian actually penetrated Turkish air space .
