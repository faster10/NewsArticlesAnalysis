Maybe Hue Jackson would have had something to prove , if the Giants could have gotten to the plate with him . But it ought to tell you something about the standing that the Giants personnel have in the league right now if they couldn t get to the plate with Jackson . It reminds you of Greg Monroe , NBA free agent , passing on the Knicks during the basketball summer and going with the Milwaukee Bucks instead . Maybe it is because he was sure the Giants were going to give their job to McAdoo all along . But he went with the lost boy Cleveland Browns instead .
