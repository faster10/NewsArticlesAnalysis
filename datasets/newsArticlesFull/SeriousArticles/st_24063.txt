Nobody attaches notes to quarterbacks ' Super Bowl victories , that John Elway had 123 yards in his first Super Bowl win or that Ben Roethlisberger completed nine passes and had two interceptions the first time he won it all . If the Broncos can string together two more wins ? and make no mistake , they ' ll need to play a lot better next week to beat the New England Patriots ? Manning ' s legacy will take a huge leap forward . After the season he has had , if Manning wins a Super Bowl and walks away on that note , it would be a story unlike any other we ' ve seen in professional sports .
