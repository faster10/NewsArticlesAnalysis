The White House worries that the military , hellbent upon victory , will accidentally drop bombs on too many innocents , inflaming opinion and making it harder to keep a coalition together . They point to what has happened in Afghanistan and Pakistan . In Syria , they worry an imprecise approach could further drag the United States into the chaotic civil war . Presumably , these are adults on both sides who can work things out but if suspicions and rifts grow , that will definitely handicap prosecution of the war and risk a national security debacle .
