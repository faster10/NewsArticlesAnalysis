Jackman ' s spokesperson dismissed the report , but the future of Wolverine is worth some analysis , from both Jackman ' s and the franchise ' s points of view . The Australian actor , who earned his first Oscar nomination for last year ' s Les Miserables , hasn ' t made any Christian Bale like comments about returning to the character . When he spoke to EW earlier this year , he was noncommittal , but the door was certainly open : " I ' m not sure . I wasn ' t even sure after the first stand alone film if I would do another . I won ' t say never , because I ' m still loving it . But there would have to be a pretty compelling reason . "
