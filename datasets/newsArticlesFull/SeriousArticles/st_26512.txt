With Eric ( Erlandson ) , I have always enjoyed playing music with him and Melissa ( Auf der Maur ) as well . At the time they talk about their feelings about what happened and Melissa said she was concerned about her bass parts and what she was going to do . We became this business that was swallowed by the machine . What we started out as is so different from what we became . We were feminists , we had these things to say , then it became the opposite result . In my mind , I felt a bit of naivet in going along with it we ' re going there , we ' re doing it . Seeds were planted .
