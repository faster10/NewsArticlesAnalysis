Petra Nemcova : Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers . But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art . That ' s perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors . That ' s why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden . Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U . S . was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music . I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I ' m still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies .
