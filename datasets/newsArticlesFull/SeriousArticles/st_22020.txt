McCreary : I definitely know what ' s coming . I ' m aware of where the stories are going . But ultimately that ' s to get some preliminary ideas in the back of my mind .

And that ' s when I sit with the showrunners and get from them what they want the audience to feel and what stories they want to track . Then I go back to my studio to add all that narrative connective tissue in a language that still stays true to the sound of the show .
