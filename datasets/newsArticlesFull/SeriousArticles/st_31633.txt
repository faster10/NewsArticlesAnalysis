With a 5 , 000 loan , he and a friend founded North Face in 1966 , selling sleeping bags , camping gear , and clothes from a shop on the same block of Broadway , in San Francisco , as The Condor , Carol Doda s famous topless bar . The Condor and North Face even shared a basement . Tompkins sold his shares well before it became a global brand ( some reports say for as little as 10 , 000 ) , but he went on to make his real fortune with Esprit . In the late 1980s , Esprit reached 1 billion in sales , although , contrary to rumor , Tompkins himself was not a billionaire .
