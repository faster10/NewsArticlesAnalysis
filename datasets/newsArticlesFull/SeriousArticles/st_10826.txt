When Gervais did manage to riff on more timely subjects , the punchlines were just as lazy . He offered such expected jabs at the expense of Donald Trump and Sean Penn that people on Twitter congratulated themselves for anticipating the jokes . Some took offense to his riffs on transgender women ? Caitlyn Jenner and Jeffrey Tambor s character in Transparent ere two early targets ? but the general problem was his lack of imagination . ( No disrespect to the fourth graders out there who found the line about Tambor s low hanging testicles hilarious ! ) When Gervais tried to poke fun at the pay gap between men and women in Hollywood , a subject that Poehler and Fey would ve relished , he ended up sounding self congratulatory . I m being paid the same as Tina and Amy last year , he said . It s not my fault if there s two of them , and they want to share the money !
