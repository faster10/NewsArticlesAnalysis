My assertion that continual schizophonia is unhealthy is a hypothesis that science could and should test , both at personal and also a social level . You have only to consider the bizarre jollity of train carriages now full of lively conversation but none of it with anyone else in the carriage to entertain the possibility that this is somehow unnatural . Old style silence at least had the virtue of being an honest lack of connection with those around us . Now we ignore our neighbors , merrily discussing intimate details of our lives as if the people around us simply don ' t exist . Surely this is not a positive social phenomenon .
