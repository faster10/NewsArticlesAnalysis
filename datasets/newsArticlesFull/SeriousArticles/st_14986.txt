Lindelof gave this statement to EW : I am totally befuddled by all this . Love it or hate it , the finale that aired is the definitive finale and to alter it in any way defies explanation . Something tells me that this isn t Netflix s fault ? that it s an honest mistake and something got miscommunicated ? ? I seem to remember ABC had to make an edit for rerun airings that tightened the show into format ? ( 42 minutes to accommodate commercials ) , and somehow that version mistakenly got sent to Netflix . This sometimes happened with our finales ? ? we d ask for extra time and ABC would agree to air , but then we had to do another tighter version for subsequent airings and or international markets . We usually left these ( painful ) cuts to the discretion of our editors ? but as the show lives on in DVD form and on Netflix , there is ZERO reason to have the shorter version out there .
