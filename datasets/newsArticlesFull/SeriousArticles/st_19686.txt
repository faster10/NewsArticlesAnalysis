In a bid to win back my mother ' s affections , my dad hit upon an idea . He headed to his local record store and bought a copy of " So Sad ( To Watch Good Love Go Bad ) . " He passed it to my mum ' s brother , with whom he was good friends . It was a classic inside job : The man who is now my uncle passed it to the woman who would become my mum she played it on the family ' s gramophone , and in the words of Ella Fitzgerald the spell was cast . My parents met again , and were reconciled . They didn ' t know it at the time , but I too was saved .
