I really did something serious , says Bergdahl while recalling his thoughts when it dawned on him how he was completely in over his head . He realised there s no going back and instead decided to make like a special forces guy and try to capture one of the Taliban s IED squad , who often set devices over night . In something that sounds like a modern version of a Monty Python sketch , he planned to catch someone , get intel , and trade it off with commanders at the FOB to make up for his indiscretion .
