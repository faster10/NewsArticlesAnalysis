Strikingly , however , none of the 2016 Republican candidates was willing to say that they would NOT vote for Trump if he became the GOP nominee . When one of us posed that question to Jeb Bush on MTP Daily yesterday , the former Florida governor replied , " It ' s not going to happen he ' s not going to be the nominee . " When pressed if he vote Republican in 2016 no matter what , Bush answered , " Absolutely . It ' s not going to be Donald Trump , though . " But if the GOP decides to fight Trump until the bitter end , those kind of answers are hardly fighting words . What do some of the establishment candidates risk by hesitating on this Trump question ? It ' s not like coddling or accepting Trump has helped them much ?
