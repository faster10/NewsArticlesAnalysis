But to sustainably destroy ISIS , you need to understand three things : 1 ) It is the product of two civil wars one was between moderate and extremist Sunnis and the other was between Sunnis and Shiites .

And 3 ) the fight has to be led by Arabs and Muslims but strongly backed by America , the EU and , yes , Russia .
