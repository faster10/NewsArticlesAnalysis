Nationally , Rubio has been a distant third . He averaged 11 percent in the seven polls , compared with 35 percent for Trump and 20 percent for Cruz . But let s take Rubio s dream scenario : Jeb Bush , Gov . Chris Christie , Carly Fiorina , and Gov . John Kasich drop out of the race , and all of their supporters switch to Rubio . That s another 13 percent , which bumps Rubio up to 24 percent . That s still well below Trump s 35 percent . It s not even enough to catch Cruz , if Cruz does half as well in luring voters from Ben Carson , Mike Huckabee , and Sen . Rand Paul ? who have been splitting another 13 percent of the Republican electorate ? as Rubio , in this fantasy scenario , does among the Bush Christie Kasich crowd .
