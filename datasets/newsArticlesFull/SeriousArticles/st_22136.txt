NO COVERAGE CUTS TO LOWER LIMB PROSTHETICS , YET ? Amputee groups are applauding a CMS decision to reverse course on a coverage determination for lower limb prostheses they had worried would reduce Medicare beneficiaries ' access to the devices ? though they ' re still worried that CMS will enact a similar policy next year .

At issue is a new working group CMS proposed to tackle this problem ? which it says will be made up of clinicians , researchers and patient advocates from various federal agencies ? and not from the private sector . The government ' s response , to the groups ' We the People petition : http : 1 . usa . gov 1NbVnIA
