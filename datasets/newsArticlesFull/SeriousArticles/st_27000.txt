A club owner told me that often , men spend time in his establishments and report going home to much friskier interactions with their wives . Whether that is true or not , I know I was struck by how much sexier I felt . I wonder what would happen if we checked our opinions at the door ? If we ' re lucky enough , we might run across someone like Antonia Crane and be able to discuss and debate whether Shakespeare ' s " Dark Lady " was , in fact , a woman of ill repute and be thoroughly excited and entertained while at it .
