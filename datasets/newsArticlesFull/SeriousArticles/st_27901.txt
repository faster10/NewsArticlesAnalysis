A few accidental deaths are often enough to ban certain items , or at the very least recall them , and often without much fanfare . It s strange that we don t have the same reaction to guns . Guns have killed many more infants and toddlers than drop side cribs , not to mention older children , adolescents , and adults . ? Guns have killed many more than a host of other objects not originally designed to kill . Remember lawn darts ? The CPSC banned the sale of the metal tipped ones after three deaths and numerous serious injuries .
