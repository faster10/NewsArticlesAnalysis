" The Great Gatsby " took the No . 3 spot with a 23 . 4 million weekend , bringing its domestic total to an estimated 90 . 2 million . The 100 million mark is close for Baz Luhrmann , and it would be a first for the Australian director , even accounting for price inflation . This could partially be the Leonardo DiCaprio effect , the ubiquity and appeal of the novel , or an indication that there is room amidst sci fi and comic book blockbusters for other types of films even if this literary adaptation is also a 3 D release .
