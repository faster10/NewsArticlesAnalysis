In the mid afternoon , after a round of e mails to colleagues , my wife and I decided to take a walk through the park in our neighborhood , before the mandatory closing at 5 p . m . went into effect . We knew that we might not be able to go outside for a day or two . Here , too , there were fewer people strolling than usual . The gray sky and strong breezes might have frightened off or discouraged some of the ones who were done with their preparations . The park was occupied largely by dog walkers , who recognized that their pets would soon be confined to their apartments .
