If there s anyone that Broncos fans should worry about being affected by the cold , it s Demaryius Thomas . Manning s No . 1 weapon has earned a bit of a soft label that he needs to shed sooner rather than later , and it could begin with a big game on Sunday against the Patriots . But , while he did catch two touchdowns in the two Divisional round games , he caught just 8 of 19 targets overall . He caught just 4 of 8 targets last Sunday against the Steelers , with one of them credited as a drop , and was practically invisible in Week 12 against the Patriots .
