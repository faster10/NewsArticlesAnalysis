" Surprised ? Probably , " he said . " He practiced the whole week , but only Marshawn knows how he ' s feeling , and it ' s something that we can ' t determine . I can ' t determine it by even watching him . It ' s a feel thing . He had surgery , they cut on him , and so he has to have a feel , and he has to feel very confident that he ' s going to be able to go out and do it . We don ' t just want him to go in and have a couple plays and be done . So we want him to be able to finish a game and continue to play . I think that ' s what he ' s trying to get a feel for . "
