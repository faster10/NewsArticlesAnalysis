The Rohingya , of course , were stateless five years ago . What has changed , however , is that whereas in 2010 the military s ruling party , the widely loathed Union Solidarity and Development Party ( USDP ) , needed the Rohingya to vote for them against the local Rakhine nationalist party in Rakhine state , this time round , their disenfranchisement serves another purpose ? to exploit anti Muslim sentiment in the country , also for political gain . The USDP has resorted to stoking the fires of sectarian distrust as virtually its sole electoral strategy to avoid a stunning political defeat . The party has raised the fear of the Muslimisation of the country in order to pose as the only genuine defenders of the Myanmar Buddhist majority . Protecting the precarious interests of the majority , apparently , means not only banning the Rohingya from voting , but also passing extremely discriminatory anti Muslim laws .
