The brief clip shot from a distance shows two black clad gunmen with automatic weapons calmly firing on the bar and then returning toward a waiting car , whose driver was maneuvering behind them . Authorities believe that car is the same black Spanish made SEAT vehicle that was found abandoned Saturday with three Kalashnikovs inside . In the footage , as the gunmen fire their rifles , patrons can be seen falling down on the pavement as others dash or crawl away . The encounter lasted only seconds .
