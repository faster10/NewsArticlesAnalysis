Receiver , however , seems to be Oklahoma ' s biggest concern offensively . Westbrook had a fine year as the second fiddle to Shepard , but it ' s unclear whether he ' ll be able to shine without Shepard taking away the focus of opposing defenses . Outside of Westbrook , no other returning Sooners receiver had more than 20 catches this past season . And though Andrews emerged as an effective weapon in the red zone , there were only three games where he had more than two catches : Akron , Tulsa and Kansas . As a result , whenever Clemson standout cornerback Mackensie Alexander blanketed Shepard one on one , the Sooners ' passing attack basically fell apart in the Orange Bowl .
