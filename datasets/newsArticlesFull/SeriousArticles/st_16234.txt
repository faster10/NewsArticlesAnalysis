" I think if we saw the numbers of how many people voted for what movie , I think a lot of this would go away " , Perry continues . " It ' s our community saying we think you ' re the best " .

The movie chose to leave that part of him out of the movie , and they changed a DUI scene into one in which the cops were just harassing him . But it ' s a bad look for an awards show already clinging to relevance like Leonardo DiCaprio clinging to hope that someday he ' ll actually win an Oscar .
