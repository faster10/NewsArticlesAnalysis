The Fourth Brigade Combat Team , First Armored Division , based at Fort Bliss , deployed to Iraq in August to replace two withdrawing brigades . The troops were sent with the understanding they would be among the last to leave the country and were told to expect up to a 12 month deployment , though it wasn ' t clear how long they would stay in Iraq . But brigade officials informed hundreds of military families gathered Saturday at its headquarters that their troops would begin returning home within weeks .
