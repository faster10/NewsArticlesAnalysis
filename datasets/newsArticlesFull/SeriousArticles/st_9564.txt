Jack was the Republican party ' s greatest advocate of a " big tent theory " and felt the party of Lincoln needed to do more to broaden civil rights and encourage minority participation . He often said he played and showered with more African Americans then most Republicans meet in a lifetime . They were his friends , and in sports you learn all men bleed the same color . He often repeated the line : " I wasn ' t there with Rosa Parks or Dr King or John Lewis . But I am here now , and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do . "
