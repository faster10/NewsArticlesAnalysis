In Navajo culture , the legend of Spider Woman is , essentially , the legend of how the Navajo came to be expert weavers . According to Adam Teller , a Navajo guide and storyteller whose family owned company Antelope House Tours runs guided hikes and 4x4 tours through Canyon de Chelly , Spider Woman also wove blankets in which she wrapped up naughty little kids , then she ' d eat them and spit out their bones to make the white stripes on Spider Rock . ( But maybe that ' s just something his grandma told him so he ' d behave ) .
