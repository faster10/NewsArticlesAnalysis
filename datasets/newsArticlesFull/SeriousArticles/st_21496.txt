In the mid 1930s , Vereide organized local groups of politicians and businessmen to talk and pray together before work , a time which wouldn t interfere with professional or family obligations . Seeking to motivate invitees to address the problem of poverty , he relied on the personal connections forged at the meetings and the personal evangelism of the attendees to spread his ideas . His initiative grew , expanding to other major cities , including New York , Chicago and Los Angeles . In 1942 Vereide moved to Washington D . C . , where he started breakfast prayer groups for members of the House and the Senate . Republican Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas , a close friend and adviser to Eisenhower , attended one of these prayer groups . It was through him that the 1953 breakfast connected the House , Senate and President .
