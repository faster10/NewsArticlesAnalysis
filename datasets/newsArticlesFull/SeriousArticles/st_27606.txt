During Thatcher ' s tenure , I interviewed Sir Bernard Weatherill , speaker of the House of Commons , for a documentary I was working on . Weatherill told me an anecdote about his grandchildren , a boy and girl of around 8 and 11 . The children were dressing up in the speaker ' s robes , " playing Parliaments . " The speaker said he overheard his grandson say , " I ' ll pretend to be prime minister . " His granddaughter retorted , " Don ' t be silly , I ' m going to be the prime minister only women can be prime ministers ! "
