Continuing on with the theme of not waiting , online sales started earlier for mobile shoppers than they did for those who went out to retail stores . While retailers pushed the envelope even further this year by opening on Thanksgiving day ( JC Penney pushed their opening time to 3 p . m . this year , for example ) , several stores like Kohl s , Macy s , Express , and Best Buy made their Black Friday deals available online as early as Wednesday , the day before Thanksgiving . Some stores called these pre Black Friday deals , but others didn t bother . The same deals customers would see in stores were available to them on mobile devices the day before Thanksgiving . While not everyone shopped that early on , it gave shoppers plenty of time to scope out the deals and plan their mobile shopping so they were ready to go when Black Friday came .
