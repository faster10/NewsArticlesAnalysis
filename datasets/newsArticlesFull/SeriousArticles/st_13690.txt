Still , we have accounts of what went on in the other camps . Witnesses had told about the building in Camp 22 where two parents breathed air into the lungs of their dying children before they perished together in the camp ' s experimental gas chamber , and about the two children who drowned when a guard kicked them into a waste pond . We have heard of the guest house at Camp 18 where , according to witness accounts , women prisoners were raped before the guards murdered them , and of the former athlete who was killed by a guard at Camp 14 after hunger drove him to eat part of the guard ' s leather whip . We read how guards at Camp 15 would allegedly make starving prisoners race along the side of a cliff for corn cakes , and laugh each time one fell to his death .
