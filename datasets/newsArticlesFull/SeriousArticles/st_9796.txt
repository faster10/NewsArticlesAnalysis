They often carry small arms and travel in one or two skiffs , the report said , citing Capt . David Reindorp , head of the Defense Crisis Management Center at the Ministry of Defense , as its source . " They will maneuver one of the skiffs to come alongside the vessel and they will throw up a line on a hook , a grappling rope or some form of apparatus by which they can climb up on to the freeboard of the ship . If they are detected during that , they will usually fire at the ship , generally in and around the bridge , aiming either to get the master to slow down or to clear their way on to the freeboard . Once they have got on to the ship , they will proceed to the bridge and take it over . "
