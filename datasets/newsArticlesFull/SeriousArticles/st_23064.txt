5 . Jeb Bush : I have a lot of really cool things that I can do Characteristically , Bush s dumbest remark was a massacred snippet of a call for political civility that might have been compelling coming from somebody else . The full quote is decidedly un stupid : If this election is about how we re going to fight to get nothing done , then I don t want anything , I don t want any part of it , Bush said last month in South Carolina . I don t want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people are literally in decline in their lives . That is not my motivation . I have a lot of really cool things that I can do other than sit around and be miserable listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them . That is a joke . Elect Trump if you want that .
