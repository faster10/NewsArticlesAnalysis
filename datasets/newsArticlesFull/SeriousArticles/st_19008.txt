The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U . N . Secretariat Building . It ' s a no frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called " Caesar , " a Syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police . Caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day , and brought nearly 27 , 000 images like these out of the country . Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals , and accuse Syrian President Bashar al Assad ' s regime in the torture and killings .
