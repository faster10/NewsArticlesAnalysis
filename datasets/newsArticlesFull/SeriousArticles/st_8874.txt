" Before you start weeping for the auto companies and all they pay for medical insurance , let me tell you how the system works . All company bargainers worth their salt keep their eye on the total labor unit cost , and when they pay an admittedly horrendous amount for health care , that ' s money that can ' t be spent for higher cash wages or higher pensions or other fringe benefits . So we directly , the union and its members , feel the costs of the health care system . " ( " A National Health Policy Debate , " Dartmouth Medical School Alumni Magazine , Summer 1989 : 30 )
