While there appears to be an element of confusion in the Indian government about how to proceed with Pakistan , what is clear is that the terms of engagement need to focus on terrorism . And here , India ' s demands are not unreasonable . Some of my Pakistani colleagues have still not understood the impact of 26 11 on the Indian psyche . If Pakistan really wants dialogue to move forward , as its leaders say , they just have to walk the talk on the Mumbai trial . Seven years after the horrendous terror attack , the trial in Pakistan has become a joke . Progress of the trial and the prosecution of the accused is the least Islamabad can do . Mr Modi can take two steps forward with Pakistan , if at least this one big step is taken by the other side . Many colleagues from across the border suggested that the onus was on India to start the dialogue . I believe the onus is on Pakistan to act on 26 11 . If Pakistan ' s army can go after the TTP ( The Pakistani Taliban ) , they need to show they are serious about combating terror and take on the Lashkar e Taiba .
