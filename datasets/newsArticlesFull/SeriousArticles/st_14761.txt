The problem with being the franchisee of a brand is that you have to take the good and bad in the same plate . As the super power brand built by the US has shown that you become a super power by suppressing smaller powers around you , the franchisee of Saudi Arabia has tried to follow the same route . Its clash with Yemen on the pretext to suppress Houthi rebels and its intervention in Syria to counter Islamic State ( IS ) threats is a brand emulation of US interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan to counter terrorism . Iran has been raising the anti American ante but siding with the opponent , Russia , whose intent and strategy is not very different from that of the US . However , these two countries forget that they do not possess the intellectual or the military sophistication of their role models . Thus , the damage that they can create for themselves and the region may actually benefit the other contenders for super power status like China and India .
