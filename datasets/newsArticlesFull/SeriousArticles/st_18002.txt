In fourth place , Titanic 3D sank by only 33 percent to 11 . 6 million in its second weekend . After ten days , the 3 D re release has pulled in 44 . 4 million , passing the re release total of Star Wars : Episode I The Phantom Menace , which earned 43 . 3 million total despite a strong 22 . 5 million start . Titanic should sail right past Beauty and the Beast 3D ' s 47 . 5 million gross over the next few days , and finish around 65 million . While that ' s lower than The Lion King ' s 94 . 2 million re release total , and a bit less than many were expecting , Paramount spent just 18 million to convert the picture , so the the re release will prove profitable especially as a launching pad for the Titanic Blu ray , set to hit stores soon .
