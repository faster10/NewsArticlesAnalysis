If that sounds over the top after one win over an inconsistent team , so be it . Jones will take it . And why not ? He ' s had a remarkably rough two months as a general manager . He cut one backup quarterback ( Brandon Weeden ) and traded for another ( Matt Cassel ) ? both of whom failed miserably to keep Dallas afloat in Romo ' s absence . Multiple parts of his running back committee went through the turnstiles of misfortune , with two released ( Joseph Randle and Christine Michael ) , another placed on injured reserve ( Lance Dunbar ) , and the one perceived most fragile of all ( Darren McFadden ) winning the starting job by default . There were other injuries , too . And of course , the soap operas of Greg Hardy vs . The World and Dez Bryant vs . The Media .
