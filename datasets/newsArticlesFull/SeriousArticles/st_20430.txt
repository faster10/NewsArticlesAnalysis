1965 The Voting Rights Act After blacks were granted the right to vote in 1871 , literacy requirements , physical violence , property destruction , hiding the polls and economic pressures still kept many blacks from voting , particularly in the South . In some states , a voter could vote in primary elections only if his grandfather had been able to vote in primaries other states only allowed whites to vote in the primaries . In the largely Democratic South , these laws prevented descendants of slaves from having an effective vote . The Voting Rights Act was enacted in direct response to the Civil Rights movement . The act bans literacy tests and provides federal enforcement of voter registration and voting rights .
