Equally , I believe spreading Islamophobia and fabricating a Muslim demon which everybody should be scared of is not a reasonable way of dealing with 1 . 5 billion people who bemoan the mayhem and carnage caused by the ISIS terrorists similarly as the people in the United States , Canada , Australia and Europe do .

Islamophobia and anti Semitism are equally abominable . We simply alienate and isolate people by profiling and accusing them over the wrongdoing of a minority that struggles to attribute itself to the nonviolent teachings and principles of an overwhelmingly peaceful majority .
