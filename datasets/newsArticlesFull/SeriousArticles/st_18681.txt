' We have to make certain that when the players come into our environment that we induct them fully into what we are expecting , what we think being an England player means , not just in terms of behaviour and culture , but in terms of how important it is for you to play in a certain way , making certain we get our midfielders turning on the ball , receiving balls on the back foot , being positive . We can do some work on that . We don ' t just have to rely on clubs giving their 19 year old a game in the first team or not . We can do that . '
