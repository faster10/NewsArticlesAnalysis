Richard Rodgers is told to drag , Esiason said . In other words , don t get into the end zone . Be the last guy there because you want to be under everybody else . You don t want anybody in another color jersey in front of you , so he was perfect , and what he was there for ? he s there to get a deflection , not to go up and get it like he did . But once he realized that there was nobody around him , that all the Detroit Lion players were in back of the Green Bay Packer players , then he knew that he could go up and make the play at his high point . He s there to get a deflection , not to actually end up doing what he did . So the execution part of it was perfect by the Packers .
