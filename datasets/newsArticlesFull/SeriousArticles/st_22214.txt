The Broncos have gone with the most effective of the two . C . J . Anderson will get the starting nod , while Ronnie Hillman will provide the element of speed when he takes the field . The best bet to add would be Anderson , though neither of them will break the bank . Besides , there are not that many running backs of significance to choose from in this week s daily fantasy league . It is either Arizona s David Johnson or Carolina s Jonathan Stewart . Beyond them , the daily fantasy options dwindle mightily unless you consider using a member of the duo of the Broncos .
