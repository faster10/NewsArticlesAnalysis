My hope ? not just for me or the Democratic Party but for the Republican Party and for America ? ? ? is that this is an expression of frustration , anger that folks like Trump and , to some degree , Cruz are exploiting , Obama said . It s real within the Republican Party and the Republican base , but that after this venting , Republican voters will settle down and say , Who do we want actually sitting behind the desk , making decisions that are critical to our future ? And I ve always said I want a healthy , two party system where there s vigorous debate but both parties are contributing to a constructive vision of the country and help us make progress , and it will be interesting to watch , during the course of this campaign , whether or not Republican voters steer back toward the center .
