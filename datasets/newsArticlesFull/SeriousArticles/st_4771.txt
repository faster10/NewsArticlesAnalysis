Caleb Buhs , a spokesman for DTMB , said the water coolers were provided in response to the city health notice in late December or early January , which he acknowledged was about a contamination issue ? the city said had already subsided . The state continued to provide the coolers of purified water , right up to today , because " there were more findings as we went along , " Buhs said . Buhs said his department ? never told state workers the tap water was unsafe to drink , but only provided an alternative , as a landlord would do for tenants .
