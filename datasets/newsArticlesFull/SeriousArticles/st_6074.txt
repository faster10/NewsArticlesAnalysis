Through the years , Persians and Arabs ( two very distinct peoples , languages and religions ) , now Iran and Saudi Arabia , ? have been at odds or in battle . As recently as 30 years ago , Iran and then Sunni ? Iraq ( backed by its neighboring Saudis ) ? fought one of the longest wars in the 20th century ? ? nearly eight years . ? Today , each side is engaged in proxy wars in Yemen and Syria . But only rarely has this hatred threatened to boil over as directly , viciously and widely as now appears possible .
