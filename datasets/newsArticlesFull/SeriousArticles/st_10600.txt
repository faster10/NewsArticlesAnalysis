SANDERS CALLS DONALD TRUMP ' S POLICY PROPOSAL TO BAN MUSLIMS ' CRAP ' . Sen . Bernie Sanders isn ' t one to mince words , and that certainly held true for his first public comments about a fellow presidential hopeful , ABC ' s MATTHEW CLAIBORNE notes . The Democratic presidential candidate appeared on an episode of " The Tonight Show " Starring Jimmy Fallon " last night and Fallon jumped right into the topic of the man once again dominating the headlines today : Donald Trump . " What are your comments or what is your take on what he is doing ? " Fallon asked . In his first on camera comments about Trump ' s controversial comments on banning Muslims from entering the United States , Sanders very passionately argued that Donald Trump is trying to divide Americans of various backgrounds . " A few months ago we were supposed to hate Mexicans , and he thinks they are all criminals and rapists , " mocked Sanders . " And now we are supposed to hate Muslims , and that kind of crap is not going to work in the United States of America . " http : abcn . ws 21NwlKp
