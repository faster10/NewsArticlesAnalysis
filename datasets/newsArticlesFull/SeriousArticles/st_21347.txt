This violation is a concrete indication of Russia s acts aiming to escalate problems , despite the clear warning by our country and by Nato , Turkey s foreign ministry said . We openly and clearly call on Russia to act responsibly so that the Turkish air space , which is a Nato airspace , is not violated . We stress once again that all the responsibility for any unwanted grave consequences as a result of any such irresponsible behaviour will belong entirely to the Russian Federation , the statement said .
