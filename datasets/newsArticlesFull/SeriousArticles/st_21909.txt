Another method , known as population suppression , would likely be more effective to combat Zika . The species of mosquito that carry the Zika virus also carry a slew of other dangerous pathogens , including dengue , chikungunya and yellow fever . Population suppression aims to wipe out an entire mosquito population from a given area introducing male mosquitoes modified to be sterile . Birth rates will decline when the modified males mate with females in the wild . That method has been proposed in Florida as well as other areas around the world where mosquitoes are considered invasive species . ( Areas where mosquitoes aren t endemic aren t as likely to face serious damage to native ecosystems if the mosquitoes are removed . )
