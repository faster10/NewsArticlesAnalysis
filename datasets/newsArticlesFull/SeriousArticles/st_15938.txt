When the interviewer asked if the singer guitarist was " too beautiful " for this world , Novoselic sighed . " He was sensitive , and then it was the drug abuse , " the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee said . " That was a big , big part of it . He was under a lot of pressure . And he made a bad choice . He was probably pretty ripped when he decided to do what he did . If he would have had a clear mind he wouldn ' t have done that . "
