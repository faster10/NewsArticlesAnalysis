The Big Three seemingly took turns calling their own numbers , like members of a band wailing out solos during an epic rock song . Love did his damage first , by scoring 14 of his 21 points in the first quarter as Cleveland built a double digit lead . Then it was James scoring 16 of his 29 points in the third , while the Cavs maintained their healthy 17 point halftime lead . The fourth belonged to Irving , as he scored 11 of his 21 points in the final stanza to put the finishing touches on the victory .
