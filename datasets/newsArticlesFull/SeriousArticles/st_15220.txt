These terrorist groups have an army major assigned to them . It is the majors responsibility to ensure the groups operatives are trained and they get the required resources . A major can , for example , authorise a small level attack in Kashmir against an Indian army unit ? an offensive that does not have major strategic implications . On the other hand , every attack outside of Kashmir has to have the army chief s imprimatur , given the likely strategic implications ? after all , if the Americans get upset and hold up coalition support funding , it is the army chief who will have to answer .
