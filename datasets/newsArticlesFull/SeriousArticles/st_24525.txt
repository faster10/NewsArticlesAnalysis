Michael Dorio , the 37 year old brother of the band s touring drummer , Julian Dorio , reiterated Julian s description of the attack on Atlanta s Channel 2 Action News . It was so loud , it was louder than the band , and they hit the stage floor , he said . As they got up to try to evacuate they saw men with machine guns just shooting anything and everything in the venue . Fifteen hundred people , Julian said , was about the capacity of the venue . I don t know if it was seated or standing but Julian , the lead singer and some of the crew , there was a door back of the stage that led to a street and they flew out the back door .
