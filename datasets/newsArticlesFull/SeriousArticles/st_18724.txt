All this suggests that the push for legislation now hinges on the claim that U . S . strength needs to be reasserted . This is staggering to me . If nothing else , our sanctions efforts against Iran of which I was a leading architect since 2006 demonstrate the strength and reach of U . S . power , if judiciously applied . The Iranian government will have to make real concessions to correct the damage sanctions have done to its economy it is not the United States that needs to shore up its position and we should act accordingly .
