On the plus side , the likable trio that Mendes recruited to play Bond ' s MI6 allies ? Ralph Fiennes ' M ( Bond ' s boss ) , Naomie Harris ' Miss Moneypenny , and Ben Wishaw ' s Q ? are all back , and given more to do than these characters ever have been . Mendes has borrowed a lot of tricks from the Christopher Nolan Dark Knight films for his Bonds making the supporting cast more than just window dressing is one of the smarter ones . M is under pressure from a high ranking official ( Sherlock ' s Andrew Scott ) to shut down the archaic double 0 section in favor of an omnipresent electronic surveillance regime . If this seems awfully similar to subplots in last year ' s Captain America : The Winter Soldier or this summer ' s Mission : Impossible ? Rogue Nation ( both more thrilling thrillers than Spectre , it pains me to say ) , we ' ll chalk that up to audiences ' increasing discomfort at being asked to cheer for high tech spy agencies with little oversight and limitless budgets .
