Tony Nash of Buffalo , New York I ' ve been playing " Halo " since the very first game came out in 2001 . After getting the brand new Box with a copy of " Halo " and throwing myself into the game , I quickly realized this wasn ' t a standard gaming experience . It was something much , much more . The game had a great attitude and unique art style . Along with great audio and environments that brought the worlds to life . It also had the most addictive , natural , and fun game play I ' ve ever experienced . It also contained a well written , downright intriguing story . Getting together with friends to play the multiplayer portion of the game only cemented this title ' s epic status . Then came November 2004 , when , of course , a friend and I were in the lines for the Midnight release of " Halo 2 . " It is no joke " Halo " is more than just a game . Now , I plan on " finishing the fight " as soon as I leave work . I had " Halo 3 " pre ordered for about a month before it came out . Hey , after all , it ' s good to keep the kid inside you alive and well !
