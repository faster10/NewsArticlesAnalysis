At present , in the face of current Middle East crisis , the erstwhile so called Middle East peace process is just in the middle of nowhere . The hapless Palestinians are feeling more insure .

Instead , it will badly damage the collective state and societal fabric of entire Muslim Ummah beyond repair . They should put an end to the ongoing zero sum game by halting their proxy war in the region .
