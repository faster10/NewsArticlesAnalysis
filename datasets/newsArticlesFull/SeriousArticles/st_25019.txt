If Rawls were creating a society from scratch , he would design it so that , in his words , " social and economic inequalities . . . are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society . " If the rich making more will help the poor be better off , too , that ' s cool . If not , it ' s unfair , or amoral . For real world reference , here ' s a quick look at CEO pay in the United States , from the AFL CIO : The average S P 500 CEO compensation in 2012 , according to that labor group , was 12 . 3 million . A worker ? 35 , 000 . Do the poor benefit from that disparity ? Does everyone ? Anyone ? I ' ll leave you to fight about that in the comments .
