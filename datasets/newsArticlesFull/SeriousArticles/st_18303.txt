Earlier this year , activist group Mosul Eye reported that ISIS committed mass executions of men and children at Alhud Village just south of Mosul , accusing the entire township of apostasy and affiliation to the local Iraqi police forces . In late December , several teenagers aged between 12 and 16 were reportedly caught trying to flee across the Tigris River toward the Kurdish region , and subsequently accused of being spies by ISIS and within minutes publicly executed in front of their families .
