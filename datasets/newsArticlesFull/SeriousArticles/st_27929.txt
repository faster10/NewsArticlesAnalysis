1 . Marco Rubio isn t flying under the radar anymore . He came out of Wednesday s night debate with rave reviews . There s no doubt he had a strong performance and his showdown with his former mentor , Jeb Bush , struck a brutal blow to the one time frontrunner s already shaky candidacy . Today , the Rubio campaign may be flying high and even raking in some post debate donations , but there is a downside to being on top . Now there s no way Rubio can fly under the radar anymore . With polls showing Rubio rising and last night s performance behind him , he will face more scrutiny and be a target of rivals . A campaign on the rise often brings new difficulties , but that s only something eventual winners have to go through .
