If you are a big fan of Netflix ' s original programming , then it ' s the biggest selling point of the service . That and the kids stuff . We urge you to check out the free month and see if the content is a fit for you , and test if your bandwidth can take the rigours of streaming . The good part is , you can opt out anytime from the service . For us , we got our first taste , and we like it , but we would still like to wait and watch , to see if we get the full glory of the Netflix catalogue .
