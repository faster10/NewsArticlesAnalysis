As the congressional fight rages on , " Lincoln " orchestrates it all . He seduces , cajoles , begs , and tyrannizes . He offers patronage jobs bribes to the Democratic congressmen who support slavery . He courts but also tamps down the influence of Thaddeus Stevens ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , the abolitionist who ' s so possessed by the cause that he might alienate any congressman on the fence . And through it all , Lincoln must delay the war ' s end without breaking the people ' s faith . The Lincoln we see here is that rare movie creature , a heroic thinker . He has the serpentine intellect of a master lawyer , infused with a poet ' s passion .
