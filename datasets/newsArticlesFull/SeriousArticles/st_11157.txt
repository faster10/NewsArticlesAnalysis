A Suffolk University USA Today poll indicated that if the GOP nomination were to go to one of Trump s rivals , many of his supporters would vote for him should he choose to run as an independent . The same poll suggested that if U . S . Sen . Ted Cruz of Texas were to win the Republican nomination , he would run the risk of appearing to sell out to the establishment , assuming he were to mend fences with party leaders . As a result , fears are growing either a Trump or a Cruz nomination could split the GOP .
