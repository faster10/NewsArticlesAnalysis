I needed some way to support my family . While most Syrians are not permitted to work , we can volunteer . I found a role with the poverty fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman , Jordan , where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work . I have enjoyed it so much . After working there , I have become more social , and no longer feel isolated . It ' s not like sitting at home , feeling powerless , losing confidence , wondering what I can do to help my family , to help my people . Instead , I feel empowered . I recognize my potential .
