Overreaction to tiny but frightening risks is not a new problem . Americans fear flying much more than driving , even though flying is much safer . Yet the fear of flying has led to massive ? probably excessive ? public investment in airplane safety while investment in auto safety has languished . Other famous public overreactions , described by Cass Sunstein and Richard Zeckhauser in a recent paper , include the reaction to Love Canal ( no evidence of adverse effects ) , the pesticide Alar ( risk of cancer extremely unlikely ) , shark attacks ( hardly ever happen ) , and the anthrax attack in 2001 ( five deaths ) . Genetically modified organisms and vaccines also terrify some people , despite abundant evidence that both are safe . People vastly overestimate the risk to health and safety of particular threats , leading the government to squander resources eliminating tiny risks while the significant threats ( heart disease , car accidents ) go unaddressed .
