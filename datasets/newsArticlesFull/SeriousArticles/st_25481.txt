Pete Fiutak , College Football News : " The national championship game was so thrilling and so incredibly entertaining from start to finish that it basically erased the memory of a mediocre first 40 games of the bowl season . Yup , that good . Bama Clemson had it all and then some . The offenses showed up , especially Tiger QB Deshaun Watson , who did one heckuva Vince Young impersonation . The defenses did , too , particularly Clemson DE Kevin Dodd , whose salary ask rose significantly over the last two weeks . In the end , though , it was the special teamers and a criminally underutilized tight end that helped lead the Crimson Tide to its fourth national title under Nick Saban in the last seven years . Where would Bama be right now without the fourth quarter heroics of PK Adam Griffith , who perfectly executed an onside kick that preceded the go ahead touchdown ? Or Kenyan Drake , who answered a Clemson field goal with a 95 yard kick return for a score that would prove to be pivotal in the 45 40 win ? And then there was O . J . Howard , the uber talented tight end who d gone 32 consecutive games without a TD and then promptly scored a pair on five catches for 208 yards in an HD display of his potential as a playmaker . The Tide flat out had more answers when it mattered most , even on a night when the defense was uncharacteristically vulnerable and quiet and Derrick Henry struggled to locate much running room , save for an early 50 yard score .
