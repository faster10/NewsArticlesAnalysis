That was a workshop at the COMSATS institute in Islamabad . Islamic science has been around since the 1980s when Zia ul Haq wanted to Islamise all the education in Pakistan , including physics , mathematics and of course , biology . I say of course because it is used to reject the Darwinian theory of evolution . It was very interesting how this was done . Conferences were called between all Muslim countries and they came up with bizarre theories . Those bizarre theories can compete with those heard in India today .
