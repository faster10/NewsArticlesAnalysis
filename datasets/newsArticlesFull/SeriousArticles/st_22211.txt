10 . Thursday night s NFL themed color rush with the New York Jets wearing all green and the Buffalo Bills all red sparked memories of the time the Patriots wore all blue in a 28 10 home loss to the Packers on Oct . 13 , 2002 . As Troy Brown remembers it , the team s captains had pitched the idea , and Belichick agreed to go along with it . After an uninspiring performance , Brown remembered Belichick giving the captains a piece of his mind for focusing on the wrong things . Don t worry what you look like , worry more about the way you re playing because it stinks !
