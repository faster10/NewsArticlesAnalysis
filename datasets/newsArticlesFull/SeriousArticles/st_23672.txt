Some 8 billion a year is needed for a full response to the global tuberculosis epidemic in low and middle income countries , according to the World Health Organization which was 1 . 3 billion short in 2015 . About 1 . 5 million people died from TB in 2014 , and 140 , 000 of them were children . So just one fifth of this 45 billion pledge could respond to the TB crisis for one year or the whole 45 billion would cover almost a decade . This would help them toward their goal of ending TB by 2035 through reducing incident and death rates combined with developing a new vaccine and better diagnostics .
