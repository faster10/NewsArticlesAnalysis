Don ' t forget that Johnson won four straight California Interscholastic Federation state crowns in high school . Then again , he shot a measly 7 26 from the floor and averaged 7 points per game in Arizona ' s NCAA Tournament run excluding one game against a hapless 15th seed , Texas Southern . Without question , he will be asked to score right away , but ultimately ball handling and creative capacity will determine the type of rookie season Johnson has . Both were areas where he struggled in college , and his finishing ability was generally unimpressive . But summer league showed a more polished Johnson , particularly his willingness to run pick and roll , not to mention shoot the 3 ( 42 percent ) . He has already emerged as a bona fide dark horse contender for Rookie of the Year .
