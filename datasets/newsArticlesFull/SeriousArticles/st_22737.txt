At Bar ? a he had Xavi and at Bayern he has Philipp Lahm , dominant figures blessed with profound football intelligence . There is no obvious equivalent at City nor even a player with the sort of understanding of space demonstrated by David Alaba or Thomas M ller . Sergio Ag ero , quick , mobile and deadly , presumably will have a role , as will David Silva with his incisiveness . Vincent Kompany , once his calf heals , will be valuable for his leadership as much as anything else . A better passer alongside him in the heart of the defence may be necessary , though .
