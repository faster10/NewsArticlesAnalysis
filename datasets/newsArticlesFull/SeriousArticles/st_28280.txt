If the Texans want to beat the Chiefs this weekend , they will have to slow down the Kansas City running game . The Chiefs have averaged almost 144 yards on the ground during their 10 game winning streak , and that makes Smith a more dangerous QB throwing downfield to Kelce and Maclin . Smith himself ran for almost 500 yards this year , so Houston s defense has its work cut out for it . On the other side of the ball , Johnson is the primary defender the Texans will have to block on every play . If he s not blocked , he will bring down anyone in the backfield .
