It is perfect and unceasing and sort of amazing . The fact that Cruz is a champion debater has been long discussed , but it s always brought up in the context of actual debates . But his ability to stay singularly focused without wavering is a public speaking skill that doesn t require others on stage with him . He is , simply , a machine . During his entire 45 minute speech at Ottumwa s Bridge View Center , he never said the word um at all , and he only stuttered and stumbled over a word once . ( It was , I swear , the word penetration . ) He had his stump speech down cold , but in a way that was clearly segmented into chunks and able to move around in his brain and rejiggered as he saw fit . Move the prayer section here , shift ripping up the Iran deal over there , drop in the investigate Planned Parenthood right there in the middle . When taking questions from the audience at this town hall , you can almost see his brain click and whirl , like a jukebox selecting the correct 45 . When he received an odd question about whether he would toss those United Nations jerks out of our country , he segued seamlessly into a five minute anecdote about his time taking on the World Court in the Medellin case ? like he was reading it off a teleprompter . Cruz s ability to convert a complicated world into a singular worldview without it ever appearing strained is unerring . It is his oratorical superpower . He is Cruz Bot .
