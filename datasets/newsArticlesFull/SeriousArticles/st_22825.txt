S Note can also convert your block letter or cursive input into editable text . It did a surprisingly accurate job of deciphering my chicken scratchings . But as with every other device I ' ve ever used with handwriting recognition , the payoff didn ' t seem worth the effort required : You need to write words a few at a time , then pause while the tablet interprets them . Except for brief notes , if you want to see your words in a crisp , legible typeface rather than your own handwriting , you ' re probably best off using the on screen keyboard . ( Samsung sells a case , obviously inspired by the iPad ' s Smart Cover , which lets you angle the tablet for comfy typing . )
