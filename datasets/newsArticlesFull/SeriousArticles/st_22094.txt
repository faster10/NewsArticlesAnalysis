" I looked at the vintage typewriter , the table and old door and thought to myself , ' There are many holiday stories that can be told with these three pieces . ' For Halloween , why not honor the great writer , Edgar Allen Poe ? After that I began reading ( " The Raven " ) . The object was to place the reader inside the poem . . . the raven rapping at the window , the narrator lamenting over his lost love , Lenore , all while trying to preoccupy himself with a book of forgotten lore .
