12 Years a Slave is based on a book Northup wrote about his ordeal , and McQueen , working from a superb script by John Ridley , has structured the film as a diarylike series of incidents . There are no trumped up arcs to pad out what we ' re watching . The crushing reality of Solomon ' s day to day existence is all the drama the film needs . Solomon ' s first slave owner ( Benedict Cumberbatch ) reveals a few humane instincts as much as a slave owner ' s behavior can be called ' ' humane . ' ' But then , after showing too much pride , Solomon gets sold off to Edwin Epps ( Michael Fassbender ) , a seething plantation owner who ' s a kind of diabolical psychologist of sadism . He can see the fire in Solomon ' s heart and is driven to break him . When he learns that Solomon has tried to get a white laborer to send a letter north , he holds Solomon ' s face close , saying he knows what ' s going on , and Solomon defuses the situation with an ingenious lie that he must sustain for minutes on end , without a tremor , staring his overseer right in his taunting eye . This is virtuoso filmmaking that lays bare the degraded relationships with a terrifying intimacy .
