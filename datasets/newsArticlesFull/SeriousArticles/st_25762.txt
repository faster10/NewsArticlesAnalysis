Perhaps most ominous for United despite their reputation for accelerating into gear in the second half of the campaign is that they were rarely able to claw back Mourinho ' s Chelsea . In both the 2004 2005 and the 2005 2006 season , Ferguson ' s United were nine points behind Chelsea on Christmas Day . The first time around , United ended up 18 points off Chelsea by the end of the season while in the 2005 06 season , United could only cut the deficit to eight points come the final day of the campaign .
