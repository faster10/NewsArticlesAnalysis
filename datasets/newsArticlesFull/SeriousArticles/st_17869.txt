Terrorism and regional issues will be high on the agenda and will be the most concrete takeaway from this visit . India will apprise the French on Pakistan , Afghanistan and the neighbourhood . In return India will expect the French to share information on West Asia and Africa . In the past France tended to equate India with Pakistan in the hope of selling armaments to both but increasingly this balance has tilted in favour of India . France , however , remains a mid level power and has little ability to lean on Pakistan on the question of terrorism . India was impressed by the swift manner in which the French anti terror units dealt with the November 13 attacks . Cooperation between France s elite GIGN anti terrorism officers and Indian anti terror units will be discussed .
