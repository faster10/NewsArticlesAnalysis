The Circassians found it intolerable not only that Sochi was selected to host the Olympics , but also that Russia did not seem to acknowledge that Circassians even lived there . When President Vladimir Putin delivered his bid for the games in a speech to the International Olympic Committee in 2007 , he said that the Sochi area used to be inhabited by ancient Greeks and did not mention the Circassians . This is noteworthy because not only did the Circassians live in the region at the time of the Greeks and maintain close ties with them , but they actually participated in the original Olympic games .
