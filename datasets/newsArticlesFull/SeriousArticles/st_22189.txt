To look around the stands today provided decent evidence to suggest that Australia s slightly desperate claim to Konta is of interest primarily to the media . The loudest and most sincere support here was actually for 133rd ranked Zhang , though neither player drew outright chants of appreciation . Perhaps this represents a gap in the market for active fans . As it stands Australia s ever present Fanatics supporter group appear to have packed up their yellow singlets and zinc tubes for the summer , which is a shame . Today they would have appreciated Zhang s Hewitt esque cry of c mon in the rare instances in which she gained some momentum . Konta is rarely demonstrative enough for her fading Australian accent to be be heard .
