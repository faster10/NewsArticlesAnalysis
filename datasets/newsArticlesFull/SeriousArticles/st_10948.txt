The almost certain explanation would be that these waypoints were programmed into the flight management system of the 777 200 , a task that would have been beyond the abilities of anyone but a professional pilot . The autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots . That is , when the autopilot is not being manually controlled instead . The manual control part is easy . You turn a knob and the airplane goes where you ask it to . The flight management system part is very complicated . I am a commercial pilot , and I have done some training on the Boeing 777 . Even after a few hours of professional instruction I would have been unable to program the flight management system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that Flight 370 reportedly flew .
