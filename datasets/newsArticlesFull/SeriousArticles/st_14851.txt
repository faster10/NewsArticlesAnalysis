Then I see these same people under the banner of Christianity inciting disorder in our communities , insisting the rest of us must adhere to their beliefs . Sure , the Middle East is destabilized . Sure , it ' s scary . But does that mean we have to sacrifice all our personal freedoms here at home . Does that mean we can substitute the fear of religious rule by one faith for the domination of another ? There ' s a supposed war on Christmas , which is like saying the NBA is challenged by tiddlywinks . The minions incited by the blowhards on Fox News are creating unrest which results in shootings , but the meek and unarmed are the true problem ?
