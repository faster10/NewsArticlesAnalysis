The United States must contribute 10 billion a year into the United Nations Green Climate Fund starting now ! In 2010 the United Nations established the GCF as a mechanism to move funds to Third World , " developing " nations to finance transitions to lower emission and zero emission development . The stated goal is to raise 100 billion a year but most governments have either made weak promises or not even funded what they pledged . For example , the U . S . has pledged 3 billion but makes it ambiguous about whether that is 3 billion a year or 3 billion over 5 years . So far , the president has only pledged 500 million and none of it has been allocated by Congress or deposited in the fund . President Obama can make the pledge for 10 billion a year ( compared to the U . S . military budget of more than 600 billion ) and then we can build the movement to get the government to actually pay it . This should be in the form of cash payments not the ambiguous proposals of loans or " mobilizing funds from the private sector . "
