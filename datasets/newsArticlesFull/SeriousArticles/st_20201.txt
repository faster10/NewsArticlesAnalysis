I have greatly appreciated my time as Communications Director at the DEQ , but I am looking forward to pursuing new opportunities in the new year . Through this ongoing crisis , the people of Flint did nothing wrong ? they are victims of this failure of government . Last week , I called Flint Mayor Karen Weaver , and we re going to meet soon to discuss other ways the state can offer assistance . Snyder s task force found DEQ primarily responsible for the issues in Flint , however , it s hard to imagine Snyder was completely out of the loop for all this ? especially when we considering the fact that Wurfel of MDEQ is married to Snyder s former spokesperson Sara Wurfel . Although the task force s final report is not yet completed , members have made me aware of some interim findings and corrective steps that I have chose to take immediately in order to restore trust in how the state keeps its citizens safe and informed , says Snyder in the statement release by his office .
