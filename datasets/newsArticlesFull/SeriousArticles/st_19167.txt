" Mr President , I still live in the same working class neighborhood I grew up in . My neighbors aren ' t millionaires . They ' re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare . They ' re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills . They ' re immigrants , who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy . The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families . It will cost them their raises . It will cost them their benefits . It may even cost some of them their jobs . And it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save Medicare and Social Security . So Mr President , I don ' t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich . I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors . "
