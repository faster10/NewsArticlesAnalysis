For at least the last 20 years and arguably closer to the last 50 , the Republican Party has bet its future on appealing to a constantly shrinking electoral quadrant of exurban whites , largely in the South and Southwest . Throughout that period , the basis of that appeal has been the idea that America and Americanism ( as core Republican voters understood those things ) were in critical danger and under constant attack from within , from feminism and multiculturalism and the P . C . thought police , from Adam and Steve wedding cakes and the war on Christmas and white people who drove Volvos and wore funny glasses and drank chai lattes . Drive through any rural region of the United States ? in my case , the impoverished hinterlands of central New York State , barely three hours from Manhattan ? and you ll encounter those Take Back Our Country lawn signs . No one on any side of the question needs to ask from whom .
