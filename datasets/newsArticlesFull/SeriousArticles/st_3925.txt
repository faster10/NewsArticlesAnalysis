After years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor Red Bull , the jump is scheduled for Tuesday morning at dawn . Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent , in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon . Then he will climb out of his capsule , jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched " delta " position to maximize his speed . He plans to fall 115 , 000 feet in less than five minutes , before deploying a parachute for the final 5 , 000 feet to earth .
