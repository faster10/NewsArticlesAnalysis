I ' m ashamed to be an American right now , to know that friends in need of reproductive health will shy away from Planned Parenthood after events like these . If one person is too afraid to seek medical help or consultation regarding their pregnancy , our " city on a hill " has already begun to break down . If we allow this to happen again , we have failed as a society of responsible individuals . This is not our future . As cliche as these phrase are by now indeed I sigh just typing them we cannot overlook the familiarity of events like the attack on Planned Parenthood .
