When talking about the right wing , radicals like to stress how the likes of Donald Trump give the green light to street violence against black people , Mexicans and Muslims . Yet , they don t ask how left politicians may give the green light to social movements they are sympathetic to . For instance , Bernie supported DREAMers on hunger strike . Bernie became critical of Rahm Emmanuel echoing Black Lives Matter demands . Bernie lent public support to CUNY workers rights before they voted to strike . Sanders political revolution would require mass mobilization of exactly these constituencies : African American , Latinos and workers . Sanders calls for street mobilization as part of the political revolution .
