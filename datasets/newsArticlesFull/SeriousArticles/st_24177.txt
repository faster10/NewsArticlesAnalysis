But this guy has been a bona fide Dallas Cowboy ? on the active regular season roster ? for less than a month . And in that time , he has now been a public relations problem , argued with Dez Bryant , and put his hands on an assistant coach . All of this on national TV . I emphasize the part about Hardy going nuts on special teams coach Rich Bisaccia for a reason . Not just because Hardy has a history in the area of inappropriately placing his hands on people ? but because this is another very real line that got crossed . And Jerry Jones ? He ' s whistling and going about his business .
