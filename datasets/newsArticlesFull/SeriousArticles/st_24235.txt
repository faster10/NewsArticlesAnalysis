As supplemental background , Germanwings had been established as the low cost , alter ego carrier of Lufthansa . Depending upon a pilot ' s monthly flight time , salary for pilots can be as much as 20 lower than the mainline carrier . In addition , more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member ' s schedule . Apparently as late as March 20 , Lufthansa pilots had been on strike , one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires . Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz ' s absence .
