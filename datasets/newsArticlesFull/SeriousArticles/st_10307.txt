Of course that line didn ' t contemplate Chicago ' s impressive road performance at St . Louis or Denver ' s blowout loss at home . Of course , much of that blame falls in Peyton ' s lap for a mind bogglingly horrid 5 for 20 passing for 35 yards and four interceptions . Kansas City scored 20 of their 29 points off turnovers . But that humongous line swing is the main reason for this pick because Osweiler would need to spray the field with footballs blindfolded to handicap the offense as badly as Manning did last week .
