So when you sit in judgment of what goes on , it s all been thought out , whether you like it or not , whether it s right or wrong . Had some of these things been things that we would have accomplished , it d be a little bit different story . The majority of what we ve done , and you well know it , is to try to put ourselves in a position where that last drive is not going to put us in the situation we ve been in four or five times , and obviously it hasn t happened . We ve tried for touchdowns instead of field goals , and it hasn t happened .
