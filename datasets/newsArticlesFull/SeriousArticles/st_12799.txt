Uber and Lyft are both independent operator ride sharing platforms . Both companies facilitate the connection between driver and passenger . Drivers must be reviewed and approved before giving rides through their system . In a move to gain more drivers and compete with Lyft , Uber reportedly offered bonuses to tempt already approved Lyft drivers to the Uber platform . In some cases , it was apparently easier for a new driver to go through the Lyft approval process and then switch companies , than it was to apply directly to Uber .
