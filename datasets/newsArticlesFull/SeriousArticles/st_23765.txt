Tribal and ethnic affiliations remain strong in Afghan society , and particularly in rural areas . With a multitude of languages spoken in Afghanistan , most Afghans first identify with others who speak the same language . However , tribal , familial and geographic identities are also important . Many Afghans place their " clan " identity before their " ethnic " identity . Such localized loyalties appear to have intensified as society broke down during the Soviet occupation and in the subsequent civil war .
