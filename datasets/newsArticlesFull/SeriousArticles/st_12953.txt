I wanted to discuss Joseph Randle and his efforts to fill in for departed bellcow running back ? DeMarco Murray . And the semi tragic , untimely ACL tear suffered by Lance Dunbar , who in a span of a month went from virtual unknown to pass catching lightning bug to IR . Also , ? Sean Lee . After missing all of last year with his third ACL tear , the former tackle and takeaway machine has come back to play inspired football as well as he ever has . It s a helluva comeback story for the J . J . Watt of the Metroplex .
