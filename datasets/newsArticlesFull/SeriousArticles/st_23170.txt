Today is a sad , sad day for me . I lost someone I cared about and admired very , very much someone who was like a second father to me . Monte was a kind of guy that you had to be around to get to know . ? But once you became friends , he always had your back . You had a friend for life . Monte Irvin was a great left fielder . Monte Irvin was a great man . I will miss him . There are no words for how I feel today . ? I could say so much more about Monte , but this is not so easy to do right now .
