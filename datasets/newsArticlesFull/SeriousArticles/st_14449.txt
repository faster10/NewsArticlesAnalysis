" Again , you ' re looking at a guy that grew up in the state of Alabama , and I mean , my dream was to play there , to go to school there . I was the one first in my family to get a college degree , and to be able to get it from the University of Alabama was a dream come true for me and for my family , and not only to go down there and really as an 18 year old kid , I left when I was 31 . But I grew up in Tuscaloosa , basically . That was kind of the most normal time of my life . I lived in that little apartment there for five years . I lived there longer than that was kind of my spot until I got married . It was a special 13 , almost 14 years for me before I moved away from Tuscaloosa . "
