Nude is a misnomer when it comes to clothing , as the only skin tone it truly represents is a Caucasian one . At this stage we all really should be calling fabric colours what they are ? pink , white , gold , bronze , brown ? without letting one become synonymous with many . Digressions aside , the palest pales and the most golden of tans were complemented with corresponding flesh tone dresses , from Rooney Mara s pink tinged , ruffled Alexander McQueen gown and Cate Blanchett s futuristic fringe , custom made Givenchy to Brie Larson s glorious gold Calvin Klein cutout number and Kate Hudson s daring Michael Kors Collection bandeau . Occasionally , gowns were amped up to a subtle blush pink , as with Katy Perry s warm toned Prada dress . A red tulle overlay on Amber Heard s pink Gucci gown added a romantic dimensionality that was lacking in so many other ensembles .
