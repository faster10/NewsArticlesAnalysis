Federer , likewise , has found two sets of twins no barrier to accomplishment at the age of 34 , renting two houses during the Wimbledon fortnight to ensure that he enjoys his full quota of sleep . It is Murray s task in 2016 to compartmentalise his life just as effectively . A lot of people have asked me how it s going to affect my career , but my concern is that the baby becomes the No 1 priority and tennis No 2 , he says , diplomatically . A lot of the top players are having babies now . Novak has a child , and Roger travels with four . It seems to be affecting them in a very positive way . I m looking forward to it . I hope that I can be a good dad .
