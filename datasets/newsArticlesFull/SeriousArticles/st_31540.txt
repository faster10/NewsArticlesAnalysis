Trump seems to reserve his greatest contempt for minorities be they Latino immigrants , African Americans or Muslim refugees . American citizens are understandably worried about a world in which their wages don t go as far as they used to and in which terrorism lurks as a threat to them and their neighbors . History shows us that during such times , minorities are often made scapegoats and Trump shows every sign of having learned precisely the wrong lessons from history . This isn t just a matter of creating hurt feelings : It does the work of the Islamic State and al Qaida for them . Trump , simply , exacerbates divisions where unity can be a prime strength and safety of the United States .
