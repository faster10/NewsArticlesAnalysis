Back when I was in Catechism class , we called breaking the third commandment " using the Lord ' s name in vain . " Trump , the rich man who can pass into Heaven as easily as a camel can pass through the eye of a needle , takes the name of Christ in vain when he plays at being a man of faith in exchange for votes . Trump has done the opposite of selling all he owns to follow Jesus . Trump has contempt for refugees . Trump is a warmonger and a scam artist . His acolytes may think he is the " Way " but even they know he is neither the " Truth " nor the " Light . " I don ' t know whether Trump is a Christian no one can know such a thing about another but I can see that to Trump , that he views Jesus is his tool .
