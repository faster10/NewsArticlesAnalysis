The Motor City takes its hot dogs as seriously as it takes its hot rods , and a Coney Island experience is a must . While the style isn ' t exclusive to this chain ( there are more than 100 Coney Islands by name in the Detroit area ) , National Coney Island serves up a solid version of the grilled , natural casing dog , nestled in a steamed bun , topped with all meat beanless chili and chopped , sweet onions and a stripe or two of yellow mustard . It ' s a bit messy to eat on the run , so grab it and race on down to your gate to enjoy , or opt for one of the sit down locations .
