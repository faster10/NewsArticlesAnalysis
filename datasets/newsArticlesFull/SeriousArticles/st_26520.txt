All candidates , that is , except for Donald Trump . In fact , Trump isn t just unique among candidates , he s unique among business leaders . Unlike other corporate titans , Trump doesn t bother to pretend that he s in business for something other than money . The CEO of almost any company will tell you that what really motivates them is creating jobs and making great products that improve people s lives . That 20 million salary , and the stock options , and the golden parachute I negotiated ? Eh , I barely thought about it .
