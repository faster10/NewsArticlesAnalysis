Rounding out the Top 5 was Disney ' s Tim Burton directed Frankenweenie , the kooky , spooky tale which debuted with a rather disappointing 11 . 5 million . The 39 million film , about a boy trying to resurrect his deceased pooch , just didn ' t click with audiences . There are a few factors at play here . For starters , domestic moviegoers traditionally don ' t like stop motion animation all that much . The Pirates ! Band of Misfits proved that earlier this year , when it sailed away with just 31 . 1 million . Furthermore , it likely didn ' t help that Frankenweenie was in black and white kids are used to bright , candy colored options like Madagascar or Toy Story . Frankenweenie didn ' t fit that mold . On top of that , there ' s been a glut of creepy ish kiddie titles in the marketplace lately . Not only is the well performing Hotel Transylvania cleaning up at the box office with its own brand of monstrous mayhem , Laika ' s ParaNorman ( which has earned 54 . 4 million so far ) had a similar Frankensteinian sensibility . How many animated movies about undead characters do families really want to see in the course of two months ?
