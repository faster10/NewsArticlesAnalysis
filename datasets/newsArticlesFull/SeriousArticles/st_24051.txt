Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have certainly benefited from Carson ' s collapse . While Carson was falling , Cruz and Rubio were rising on an almost identical climb to each other . So far , it ' s been a slowish climb , but a significant one nonetheless . Cruz went from 9 . 6 percent last month to 14 . 8 percent now a jump of 5 . 2 points . Rubio rose as well ( but not by as much ) , from 11 . 8 percent to 14 . 3 percent . The two seem to be in a neck and neck race for second place ( or will be , after Carson falls a bit further ) . Rubio has , so far , led this race by a nose , but in the past few days Cruz pulled ahead for the first time since they both began climbing . Interestingly , Cruz has jumped considerably in Iowa , while Rubio has stayed fairly stable . This could become an important dynamic the closer we get to the first caucuses , because a Cruz victory there might shift the public ' s perception in a big way .
