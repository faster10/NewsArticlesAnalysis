One thing I noticed when going through his record is what happened in 1955 . Irvin was 36 years old , coming off a . 262 . 363 . 438 season . The Giants had won the World Series . He got off to a slow start , hitting . 253 . 337 . 333 as a part time guy and was sent down to the minors . Doesn ' t that seem a little odd ? I get that he was probably a defensive liability by then , but he was also just two years removed from hitting . 329 . Seems strange to me , perhaps an indication of how black players were still treated back then , even star players . He could still hit : At Minneapolis , he hit . 352 with 14 home runs in 75 games . Irvin played one final season with the Cubs in 1956 and retired after hurting his back in spring training in 1957 .
