It was also fun to see Run DMC . I talked to them both and they barely rehearsed . I remembered that when Henry Winkler and I , four years ago , did this Funny or Die sketch for Obama . It was so funny , because I was wearing this hair piece , Henry was wearing kind of Fonzie wig and we fell into it and I swear to God , I honestly d ja v ' ed and thought I was back in the Arnold ' s parking lot doing a scene . It was so easy . So when I saw those guys , they just nailed it . I just thought , " Well , yeah , you know , sometimes when a thing becomes a part of a fabric of your life , your history , that doesn ' t get so rusty . "
