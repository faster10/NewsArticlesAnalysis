Not only that , I simply reject the notion that the Academy Awards are somehow unimportant . They are important . Yes , multiple ethnic groups have started their own awards ceremonies , and that ' s fine , but the Oscars are the gold standard of awards in the film industry . Being nominated or winning an Oscar can change the career of an entertainer , extend the life of a film , and boost incomes of everyone involved with a project . For those reasons alone , like them or not , Oscars matter . Furthermore , film audiences for Straight Outta Compton , Creed , Concussion , Beasts of No Nation and other films with black actors or directors , are actually very diverse . Creed and Straight Outta Compton were mega hits with African Americans , but they were crossover hits with people of every ethnicity .
