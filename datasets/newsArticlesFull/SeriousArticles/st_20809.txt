Josh has given us consistent play . He ' s played at both guard spots this year , so he ' s had to be in tandem with a lot of different people , certainly the center , David Andrews , but also both tackles , or all the tackle combinations that he ' s played alongside . He ' s an intelligent guy . He ' s tough . He plays very hard , and he always gives us everything he has , so he ' s a guy who ' s been in our system , he ' s learned how to play in our offense , and he ' s a valuable piece to what we do .
