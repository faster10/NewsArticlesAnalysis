Trump also knows that he has Fox trapped in the same way that he has the entire GOP establishment trapped . The network could easily train its fire on him , but it has nobody to elevate in his place . Marco Rubio ? Jeb Bush ? The audience wouldn t have it . And Ted Cruz is , well , Ted Cruz . Fox could go the National Review route , and fulminate about Trump s supposed sins against conservatism , but those efforts would fail for the exact reasons that the magazine s efforts did : first , nobody cares , and second , it s Trump s virulent nationalist racism , not his past statements on health care , that needs to be tackled . There s no evidence that Fox either disagrees particularly with Trump s bigotry , or that it is prepared to mount any concerted campaign against it . Without that , it is left pretty enfeebled . Meanwhile , Trump s every tweet will continue to be the top story on every news show . A Republican frontrunner who doesn t need Fox News : now that is something different .
