Guns don t kill people , people do , someone will say . But people use guns to kill people , and it makes it much easier to do so , including on a mass scale . The idea that guns aren t to blame but the actions of people is misguided and unthinking , to say the least . Specifically , it ignores what guns are for . A crib or , perhaps , a car , may kill under certain circumstances , but that s not what a crib or a car is for . When death does result from their use , we assume that they have , in some way , been misused . At the very least , they have failed to fulfill their intended purpose , intentionally or not . Not so with a gun . The whole point of a gun is to injure or kill . Guns can certainly be used in other ways and for other reasons , such as sport , but these are secondary to its primary function . When a gun is used to injure or kill , it s being used as intended . It s the gun that s at issue , because of the type of object that it is .
