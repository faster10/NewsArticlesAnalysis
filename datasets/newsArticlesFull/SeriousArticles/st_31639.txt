When the leaders meet , when the politicians meet , I think it s really important that we re on streets . It s really important that we make sure that they don t think they can make these decisions behind closed doors , in a vacuum . Especially so now that the protests in Paris have been banned . They may think that they can get away with making these decisions . We want to make sure that they cannot prioritise the interest of the fuel corporations over the interest of the planet and the people who live on it .
