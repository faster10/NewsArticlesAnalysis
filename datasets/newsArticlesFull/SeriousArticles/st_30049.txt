ANDY CASAGRANDE : The smaller sharks will arch their back , drop their fins , and swim in weird postures . If you don ' t have experience with sharks , you might not read those signs . They ' ll get close to you , dart away , and then come back mock charges where they ' re essentially trying to scare you or let you know , hey , I ' m pissed off , and if you keep swimming at me with your camera , I ' m gonna bite you or whatever I can bite . It ' s relatively obvious . Great whites are easy . They ' re built like pit bulls on steroids . They can bend their fins here and there , but their way of showing they ' re angry is they open and close their mouth . So they just show you the jaws sign . They swim right at you and gape .
