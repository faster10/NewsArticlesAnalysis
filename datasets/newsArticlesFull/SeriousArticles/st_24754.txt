Congress , in short , is wearing fiscal handcuffs . Lawmakers can ' t launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments ( to spend more , or tax less ) . What ' s more , as the nation ages , more of our resources are channeled into automatic , formula driven spending on current consumption mainly through Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security leaving fewer dollars to invest in children and families or future economic growth .
