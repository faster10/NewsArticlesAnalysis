Suu Kyi has evolved from a mere icon of democracy to an astute politician in the last 3 years . This has often been at odds with her image as a human rights crusader , and the international media has called her out on her silence on national issues . She has never directly criticized the government s handling of the Rohingyas issue or the violent tamping down of armed rebels on its borders . There is very little sign that she will change her political stance on these issues in the near future . Her position as the head of her party , but not the president and as someone who the military will continue to see as being contrarian to their ideal of a regimented democracy , will not give her or the government the space to change things dramatically . She can however leverage her international standing to get more attention to the issues both within and across Myanmar s borders . ?
