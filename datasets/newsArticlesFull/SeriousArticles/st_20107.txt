A doughnut shop where you can get married . It was a sad day in Portland when its longtime 24 Hour Church of Elvis , a roving storefront art installation dispensing marriage licenses and 25 cent pop culture trinkets , closed this summer . Luckily , Voodoo Doughnut was there to fill in the gap . This cash only , 24 7 doughnut shop performs about 400 legal weddings a year . It was started in 2003 by Tres Shannon , a flamboyant one time mayoral candidate , and Kenneth " Cat Daddy " Pogson to feed the hangover crowd . The FDA eventually put the kibosh on the Nyquil , Robitussin and Pepto Bismo doughnuts , but their signature voodoo doughnut lives on . It ' s shaped like a gingerbread man and comes with a pretzel stick in the belly for stabbing and drawing blood , er , raspberry jelly . As for weddings , which come with coffee and doughnuts for up to 60 guests , Pogson says his favorite involved a groom in a psychedelic suit who brought his mother in an urn .
