If Rose doesn ' t play , All Star shooting guard Jimmy Butler is lobbying Hoiberg to get the assignment of guarding Curry , the reigning MVP who is once again lighting up opponents . " I look forward to guarding everybody in this league , especially a prime scorer like him , " Butler said after scoring a season high 32 points against Phoenix . " So I ' ll ask Coach for that matchup . No disrespect to ( Curry ) but I like that . "
