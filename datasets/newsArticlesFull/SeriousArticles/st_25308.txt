Team of the week : Few teams in the country are hotter than the Ducks . Unfortunately , with Stanford wrapping up the North with its win over Cal , there s not much that can be done for Oregon on the national stage . But during their aforementioned five game winning streak , the Ducks have averaged 43 . 4 points per game , running back Royce Freeman is at a clip of 136 yards per game ( including seven straight 100 plus rushing games ) and the defense has shown improvement . Over the first six games , the Ducks allowed 38 . 6 points . Over the last five , that number has dropped to 33 . 4 .
