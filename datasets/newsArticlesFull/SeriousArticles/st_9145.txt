" The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared , not prepared , " said ranking member Rep . Bennie Thompson , D Mississippi . " Each and every time the threat level was raised , very rarely did the public know the reason , how to proceed , or for how long to be on alert . I have raised concerns for years about the effectiveness of the system and have cited the need for improvements and transparency . Many in Congress felt the system was being used as a political scare tactic raising and lowering the threat levels when it best suited the Bush administration . "
