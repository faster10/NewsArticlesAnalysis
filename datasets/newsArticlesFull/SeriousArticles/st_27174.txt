Johnson : The best quote about that is from my wife . She says , " Walt is who Craig would like to be in 10 years , but he ' s off to an incredibly slow start . " Walt ' s a much better person than I ' ll ever be , but he has his faults , too . I tend to refer to Walt as over . He ' s overweight , he ' s overage , he ' s overly depressed , but he still goes out and gets the job done . If there ' s one thing I underestimated when I was putting him together , it ' s the empathy , the sympathy that people have heaped upon this guy and how much they would care . He ' s not perfect . He ' s damaged goods . It ' s very flattering that people are that concerned about the characters . And it ' s true , women give me love notes to give to Walt . I get a lot of veterans and a lot of law enforcement people that give me challenge coins and say , " if you could pass that on to Walt , I would really appreciate it . " People think this guy ' s real . My gosh , I think that ' s the highest praise a writer could ever possibly get .
