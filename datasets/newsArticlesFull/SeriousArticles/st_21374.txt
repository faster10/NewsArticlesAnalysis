That ' s just the past week . Zoom out further , and we find that Carson has changed his Medicare plan from " End Medicare " to a new version that doesn ' t make any sense . He refuses to acknowledge that his tax plan would force trillions of dollars in spending cuts to reach the balanced budget he wants , partly because he or his advisers appear to have no idea what does and doesn ' t get taxed . And he has confused the budget and the debt ceiling . We haven ' t even touched on his many offensive comments about women , the Holocaust , Muslims , gays and so on .
