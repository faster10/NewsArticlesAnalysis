A Colorado school district has sent out emails promoting a Christian event that calls upon parents , and especially fathers , to urge their daughters ( as young as 11 ! ) to remain pure until they land a hubby . ( The clear , and psychologically damaging , implication : women are soiled by the dirty sex act . ) Shockingly , at least for those unaccustomed to confronting the chauvinism at the heart of the Abrahamic creeds , the advertisement cites Luke 7 : 38 : As she stood behind him at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears . Then she wiped them with her hair , kissed them and poured perfume on them . So , mixing faith and public education lets schools promote female submission to males and foot fetishism ! In the drearily repetitive annals of religious scandal , this stands out . A thousand secular hosannas to Colorado blogger Anne Landman for posting about this perverted unconstitutional indecency !
