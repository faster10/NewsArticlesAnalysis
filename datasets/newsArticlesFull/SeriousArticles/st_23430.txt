Climate negotiations can sound like a lot of abstract numbers with little reality behind them . But a strong agreement will lead to a slew of positive developments when negotiators return to their countries . China has committed to a cap and trade program and said it will peak its emissions by 2030 . India will increase its forest cover . The U . S . will phase out coal power plants . A climate deal will provide the framework to lock some of those commitments into place and push new efforts . Done right , this will set in train a set of policies and actions that would take us across a number of these positive tipping points in a way we design our cities , in the way we consume , in the way we deliver electricity , in the way we work and how we go to work , said Andrew Steer , president and CEO of the World Resources Institute , on a conference call for journalists .
