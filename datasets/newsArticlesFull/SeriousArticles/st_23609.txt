When you succeed , dab on them fools . You worked hard on that sales presentation or whatever other important project your boss was crazy enough to trust you with . And you aced it . Take time to savor the accomplishment . Treat yourself to a little celebration . Maybe you don t go dabbing and dancing all over the office , but why not enjoy a celebratory glass of wine or that juicy steak you ve been avoiding ? What s the sense of working so hard if all it means is you move on to the next brain draining project on the list ? Say whatever else you will about Cam Newton , but it s pretty clear the guy thoroughly loves what he does for a living and celebrates accordingly . If you don t get at least a little bit of that kind of joy out of what you do , maybe it s time to start thinking about doing something else .
