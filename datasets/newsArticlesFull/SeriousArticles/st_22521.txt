Since the original experiments , many studies have explored the bystander effect . Recently , I was part of a research team brought together by Peter Fischer of the University of Regensburg , Germany . We surveyed the existing scientific literature and statistically integrated the findings from 105 data sets . We found that the bystander effect is quite robust , that it has declined somewhat in magnitude over time , and that there are certain conditions under which it disappears or is even reversed .
