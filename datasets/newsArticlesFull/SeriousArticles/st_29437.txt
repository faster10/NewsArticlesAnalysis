Chip Patterson , college football writer : Most of the matchup advantages point to an Alabama win . The betting line points to an Alabama win . If Coker shows up and completes more than 75 percent of his passes , like he did against Michigan State , Alabama will win . But there is no way that I ' m going to pick a blowout victory against a Clemson team that not only hasn ' t lost yet but has come up with answers every time it ' s been tested . This team ' s identity may have been forged in the historic rainfall that drenched Death Valley as Clemson made a stand on the extra point to beat Notre Dame . Swinney ' s " B . Y . O . G . " may have a different feel now that it ' s been co opted as an unofficial marketing slogan for the program but that game where Watson didn ' t play great and a young Clemson defense had its depth tested made me a believer . Alabama will win , but Clemson will find a way to be in it at the very end .
