All Americans believe this . But as Christians , we especially can appreciate this truth . We believe in Jesus Christ . We believe God came down from heaven and became a man ? with a name and a body ? so we could know him . We could begin to understand . He walked among the poor and lowly of this world so he could raise us to new heights in the next . It is a miracle . It inspires us every day . And that is why we should rejoice always pray without ceasing and in all circumstances , give thanks .
