Andrew Garda , Sports on Earth : " The Rams get preferential treatment in moving , and the Chargers get first right of refusal and can join the Rams in Inglewood , though it might not happen for a year , which could seem too long for San Diego owner Dean Spanos . That would mean the Rams have a head start in making Los Angeles their own . The Chargers will get 100 million toward a stadium if they stay in San Diego then the Raiders would have an opportunity to slip into that Inglewood spot down the line . In the end , only the Rams got what they wanted . Or , at least , owner Stan Kroenke . . . got what he wanted . The Chargers are stuck in a city they ' ve now alienated . Meanwhile the Raiders are without a lease anywhere and are in limbo . That ' s life in the NFL . The next few days will likely see some maneuvering on the parts of both the Chargers and the Raiders as they try to sort their situations out . The Chargers will want to decide quickly , since they need to plan their next move . The Raiders will probably start looking at relocation alternatives San Antonio or even Toronto come to mind in the event that the Chargers ultimately decide to bite the bullet and head to Los Angeles . Regardless , the NFL has finally chosen to return to L . A . , removing it as a fulcrum to get money from other cities . While the remaining two teams sort out things out , the Rams and the league offices can start work on mining L . A . for the money they ' ve long thought was there . "
