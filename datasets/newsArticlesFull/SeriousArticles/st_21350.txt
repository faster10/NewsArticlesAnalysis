For five years , I ' ve been writing " Maggie Me , " my memoir of surviving Thatcher ' s 11 years in power . I feel surprisingly protective or perhaps possessive about my relationship with the woman we called Maggie . She privatized my fractured family into poverty by closing the steelworks where my dad toiled and cutting my mother ' s disability benefits , all while not seeming to care about any of it . And yet , as my family descended into chaos and eventually abuse , Maggie was always there in some sense always encouraging me to get an education , to get away , to be an individual .
