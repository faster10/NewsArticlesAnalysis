Throughout Ian Fleming ' s novels , the most frightening thing about Blofeld is his ability to disappear . Every time Bond encounters him , he ' s living under a different name , with a totally different appearance . Once he ' s a fat man with short black hair and pitch black eyes once he ' s a thin man with long silver hair and green eyes once he ' s intimidatingly bulky , with a mustache . Bond is haunted by the idea that he ' ll never really know if he ' s killed Blofeld or some kind of body double , and the uncertainty nearly drives him insane . That was a chilling idea in the 1960s , when Fleming wrote those novels , and it ' s no less compelling in 2015 , when non state actors are the biggest threat to national security , and when plastic surgery and digital manipulation have never been more accessible .
