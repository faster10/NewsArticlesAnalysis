If you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East , of Asia , of Latin America , we feel very bullish about this . And I was making the point earlier today , China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent , not for one year or two years , but literally for 30 years . For 30 years it ' s been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see . So , say the same thing for the Middle East , the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant , but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward .
