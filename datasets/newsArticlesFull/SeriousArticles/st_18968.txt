Kraus : It ' s funny . We look back at books that we ' ve finished with a different lens than we have before . Specifically , we talked a lot about " The Nanny Diaries " in the last couple of years because when we were nannies , we couldn ' t really understand why so much derision and scorn was thrown the way of not just us , but our colleagues . And now that we ' re parents , and we ' re so dependent on having fantastic caregivers , so that we can step away and do things that we need to do , we ' re even more mind boggled by it than we were before . We are so appreciative of the women who come in and make our kids ' days awesome . And we love that our kids love these women . We appreciate the affection that these women give our children , and the structure , and the education and the discipline . And it means the world to us .
