For a quarterback who now requires every fiber in his old body to make NFL quality throws , it would be madness to let Manning play next weekend against the Chicago Bears unless he is absolutely , positively , 100 percent healthy . I offer this with utmost compassion : Give the old quarterback time to heal . Save Manning for the playoffs . The NFL records he sets or the regular season record of the Broncos will mean nothing if Manning limps into January only to get bounced from the postseason one more time .
