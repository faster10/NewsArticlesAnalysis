The younger Dear was raised as a Baptist , Ross said in an interview in Goose Creek , South Carolina , where she now lives . He was religious but not a regular churchgoer , a believer but not one to harp on religion . He believed wholeheartedly in the Bible , she said . That s what he always said , he read it cover to cover to cover . But he was not fixated on it , she added . He was generally conservative but not obsessed with politics . He kept guns around the house for protection and hunting , and he taught their son to hunt doves , as many Southern fathers do . He believed that abortion was wrong , but it was not something that he spoke about obsessively .
