Rob Mahoney : ? The Pelicans steal the eighth seed . At the moment , New Orleans sits at No . 12 in the West behind Portland , Sacramento , Utah , and Denver on the playoff bubble . It s a crowded stretch in the standings , separated in all by a mere 3 . 5 games . Anthony Davis and Co . , even after weathering that disastrous opening stretch , have it in them to leapfrog their fellow playoff contenders and land the final spot this season . Over the last 20 games , New Orleans has posted a top 10 net rating behind strong offense and passable ( read : significantly improved ) defense . Their performance over the last 15 games and 10 games is even more impressive . Plus , only two teams in the West have an easier remaining schedule in terms of opponent win percentage . There s a real opportunity here , provided the Pelicans ( now without Eric Gordon ) can stay healthy enough to take advantage . ?
