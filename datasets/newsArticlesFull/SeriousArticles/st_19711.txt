" There were two shows , ' Weeds ' and ' Dexter , ' that really got Showtime taken seriously for cutting edge original programming , " says Showtime entertainment president David Nevins . " How they get brought home is really important . In this case , both for the sake of the two women behind the show Kohan and Golden Globe winning star Mary Louise Parker and an audience that ' s really invested in the show . TV fans love nothing better than to complain about how shows end and we really want to end this one the right way . "
