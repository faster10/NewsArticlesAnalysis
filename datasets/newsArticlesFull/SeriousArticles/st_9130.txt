The Zika virus is disseminated though the same species of day biting mosquitoes Aedes aegypti which transmit dreaded diseases like dengue , chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis . The chances of its rapid spread in countries like India , where these maladies and their vectors already exist , are rather high . Controlling the mosquitoes is a must to prevent it . But this has been difficult in the past . Fighting Zika is tough also because those infected may not show any visible symptoms but yet serve as potent disseminators of the virus through mosquitoes . Tracking the movement of the infection is , therefore extremely difficult . Worse still , there is no known cure or vaccine for it on the horizon .
