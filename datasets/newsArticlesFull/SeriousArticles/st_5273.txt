On Greg Hardy , and the line between passion and being a knucklehead : I think if his teammates saw it as a distraction , or something that was outside of what they deem to be a team player and deem legitimate , I think they d say something . I think until his teammates say anything , I think it s fine . His teammates rally behind him , they understand where he s coming from . It was a tough point in the ball game , ease of frustration . When you re in a ball game , it s passion . If you have a guys sitting there with his helmet down and just walking out there with no passion , you d be complaining too . There s a certain passion and energy you have to play with , in order to get yourself up , to get yourself to the place you need to be to be a dominant football player . I think sometimes , they catch moments of passion and sometimes they re misconstrued . I had no idea what he said , but I ve seen Dez Bryant have those moments on the sideline and you come to find out he s been shouting nothing but positive things to his teammates and trying to motivate guys . That s football , that s always been football .
