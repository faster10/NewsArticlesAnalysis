In 1969 , he released the album Space Oddity with a title song that became his first U . K . top 10 hit . Under the influence of Marc Bolan , Bowie formed a short lived glittery band called Hype with guitarist Mick Ronson and , on bass , Tony Visconti , who became a Grammy winning producer and collaborator with Bowie through his final album . A version of that group would evolve into the musicians behind some of Bowie ' s groundbreaking work at the beginning of the ' 70s , starting with The Man Who Sold the World .
