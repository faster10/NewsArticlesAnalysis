Despite starting the season in the usual Jacksonville fashion , with victories sandwiched together by a string of losses , they look to have turned things around . On Thursday night , the Jaguars walked away with their second straight victory after beating the Tennessee Titans 19 13 . It was only the first time since 2013 that they won back to back games . Although Tennessee are one of the worst teams in the league , Jacksonville looked decent , stringing a few nice drives together whilst their quarterback s ability is evidently improving week by week .
