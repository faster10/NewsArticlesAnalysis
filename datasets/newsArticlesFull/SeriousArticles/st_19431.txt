0 Minutes . NBC bills tonight as The Last Debate Before the First Vote . They should call it the First Democratic Debate Not Scheduled for a Saturday Since October . It is a Sunday , which would be an improvement if tomorrow were not a holiday . A more honest tagline would read , The Third Democratic Debate in a Row Scheduled at a Time When You Won t Watch . So far Democrats have only gotten 33 million people to tune into their three debates . Republicans have had an audience of 102 million for six debates . Democratic Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz is winning by trying to lose . Democracy is weird , pretty much all the time .
