" Monday ' s caucuses were a unique event that involved more than 171 , 000 Iowans and their neighbors at a specific time and place , and thus they cannot be re created or recounted , " Lau said . " That being said , we are working with all campaigns on individual concerns they are bringing to us , and addressing them on a case by case basis . Just yesterday , we met with the Sanders campaign , which brought us a small amount of specific concerns , and the Clinton campaign has also asked us a small amount of questions . We will look into these concerns and reach out to our county party leadership with any questions . "
