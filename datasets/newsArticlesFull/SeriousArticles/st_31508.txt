Third set : Djokovic 6 1 , 6 2 , 2 4 Federer ( denotes server ) : For the first time in a while , Federer finds himself with a 15 30 lead on Djokovic s serve , working his opponent over with a series of one handed backhands , and then he earns his first break points of the match , standing up strongly at the net and taking a 15 40 lead with a superb volley . Here comes the fightback . Djokovic saves the first break point with a fine serve and Federer squanders the second with a wasteful forehand . Deuce . Yet Federer is playing with more belief now and a journey to the net is rewarded when Djokovic pulls a backhand wide . Here s a third break point . Again , though , Federer misfires with a forehand . What would have been a winner down the line zooms long . He looks furious . Still , at least it s more of a fight now , with Djokovic struggling to close the game out , Federer frustrating him with an array of beautiful shots . This is turning into an awkward game for Djokovic and he finds himself break point down for a fourth time when he drops a volley a touch long , allowing Federer to race forward and guide a forehand past him . And this time , Federer makes the breakthrough , a short ball letting him run around a forehand and wallop it into the left corner , where Djokovic can only knock a backhand wide . Federer breaks !
