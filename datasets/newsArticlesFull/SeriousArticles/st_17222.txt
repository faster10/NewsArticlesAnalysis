Butler lies are those little deceptions that we tell one another to avoid social interaction . Examples include the ubiquitous " on my way " when in fact we are not on our way , or " sorry , I just got your text " when actually we just didn ' t want to respond right away . Another butler lie is the lost reception explanation ( " I ' m in a tunnel ! " ) . Butler lies help us manage our social attention in an always on communication world . They allow us to use the technology as a sort of social buffer to avoid interaction when we ' re technically always available , while at the same time giving plausible excuses to maintain social relationships we care about .
