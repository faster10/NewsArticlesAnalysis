Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood , in their eighth year hosting , remained an affable pair and an asset to the show . I d argue that they re the best hosting duo on live TV , mostly because they excel at a job too many hosts forget : moving the show along briskly . Of course , they throw in quirky quips and musical interludes that often hit and often miss , but their bits rarely overstay their welcome . The duo s humor has grown increasingly sardonic in recent years , and throwaway asides from Paisley like , Miley sets the bar . We try to reach the bar , earned nervous laughter from the audience , many of whom undoubtedly felt a little called out .
