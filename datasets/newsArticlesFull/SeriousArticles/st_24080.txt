Brooks : The only thing that really stands out is the miracle of the firstborn . That miracle is represented in " The Producers . " They actually encouraged me and gave me the money to make a movie . And it was born . Of course , it was killed almost in childbirth by The New York Times . Renata Adler , she stuck a half of a scissor in my neck and gave me one of the worst reviews . It was my first movie . But I was lucky . The newspapers were not that kind and I thought I ' d have to go back and do television where I ' d had success . But then the magazines , about a month later , came out and they saved me . And they saved my confidence in myself . I knew I could make a funny movie .
