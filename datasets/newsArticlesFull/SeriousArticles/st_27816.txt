In an e mail written early June 20 , Ortega wrote , in part , to AEG president Randy Phillips , " My concern is , now that we ' ve brought the Doctor in to the fold and have played the tough love , now or never card , is that the Artist may be unable to rise to the occasion due to real emotional stuff . He appeared quite week and fatigued this evening . He had a terrible case of the chills , was trembling , rambling and obsessing . Everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated . If we have any chance at all to get him back in the light . It ' s going to take a strong Therapist to ( get ) him through this as well as immediate physical nurturing . . . . Tonight I was feeding him , wrapping him in blankets to warm his chills , massaging his feet to calm him and calling his doctor .
