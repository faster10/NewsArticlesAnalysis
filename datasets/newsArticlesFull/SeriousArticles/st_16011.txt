Sunday ' s clash with the New England Patriots won ' t be just another game for New York Giants running back Shane Vereen , who spent his first four seasons in New England . " I ' m not going to say it ' s just another game , " Vereen said Wednesday . " Obviously , for those guys who were on the team last year , I ' m sure it ' s a little more special . I know for me , it is . But we ' ve got to prepare . We ' ve got to get ready to go this week more than ever . We ' re going up against the best team we ' ve played so far this season . "
