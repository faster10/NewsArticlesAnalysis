The bill isn ' t unreasonable on its face : establishing new vetting requirements for Iraqi and Syrian refugees in which the heads of the FBI , Homeland Security and National Intelligence must certify to Congress that each refugee is not a security threat . A Ryan spokesman points out that the bill was written by Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul of Texas , whose panel had looked into the Syrian refugee issue previously . But there ' s no way to know whether this legislation ( called " emergency " to circumvent House rules ) is the best path forward , or better than the current 18 to 24 month refugee vetting process , because there have been no hearings on this or related bills .
