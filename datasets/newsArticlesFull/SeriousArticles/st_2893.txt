" I talk about it every time , especially at the end of a tournament , how thankful I am for the crowd , " Federer said of the support following his 6 1 , 6 2 , 3 6 , 6 3 loss to Djokovic in the Australian Open semifinals . " It is an incredible run . It ' s a big part of why I ' m still playing today . I spent a lot of hours on the practice courts for exactly moments like these where you feel like you ' re appreciated , you ' re being pushed forward , they want to see you win , and all that . I wish I could have one more chance to play another match here this week , but I don ' t . So of course I ' m disappointed , maybe partly for my fans and also for myself .
