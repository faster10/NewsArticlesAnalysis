What was the point of having the RNC serve as middleman in the first place ? To navigate the party through the primary process in a way that didn t damage the eventual nominee too much before the general election . Priebus was able to cut the number of debates roughly in half , and he ensured that no mischievous entity like MSNBC was granted hosting duties . The candidates have found his efforts lacking , though , and are using the leverage that s available to them as a group to run the show themselves . So far , it looks like they ll use that power to ensure that they don t , for even a hot second , have to factor general election considerations into their primary strategies . ?
