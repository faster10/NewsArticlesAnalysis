Right now I ' m reading Rus Bradburd ' s book , " Forty Minutes of Hell : The Extraordinary Life of Nolan Richardson . " It tells the story of the famed Arkansas coach and the battles he had to fight to reach the top of the college basketball world . Bradburd tells the story of a number of black basketball coaches who never got a shot at the major jobs because of their race . He writes about how coaches like Richardson were denigrated for the frantic style of play , and assumed it was all about talent and not about coaching .
