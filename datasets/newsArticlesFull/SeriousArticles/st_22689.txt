Donald Trump was the big surprise . He at times attempted to present a more serious , subdued demeanor but was booed on several occaisions and frankly embarrassed when , for example , after his rant about the Trans Pacific Partnership ? and China , Sen .

He even drew boos when he accused Carly Fiorina of interrupting everybody . Fiorina managed to needle Trump once again mocking his remark that he d met Vladimir Putin on 60 Minutes . ( Although I have met him as well , not in a green room for a show , but in a private meeting , she icily observed . )
