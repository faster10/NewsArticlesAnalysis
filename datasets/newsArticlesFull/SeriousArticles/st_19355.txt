The risk is not so much the Islamic State coming in itself and establishing a foothold in southeast Asia . The primary risk is that in a number of south east Asian countries , including as I said Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines as well , you have people who have gone over to fight with Islamic State volunteers in Iraq and Syria and as these jihadists return to their homeland ? and that s not necessarily happening immediately , but it may happen in the medium term outlook over the next five years or so ? you ll find that the capabilities they bring will be of a much higher level than those of existing militants in those countries .
