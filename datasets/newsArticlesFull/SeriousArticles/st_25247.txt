Everyone has benefited , to some degree , from research made possible by liquid helium . Cell phones , iPads and laptops are possible because of experiments enabled by liquid helium . In the medical world , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is but one example of a host of diagnostic and treatment tools that exist only as a result of groundbreaking experiments carried out by using helium . In fact , the strong and extremely stable magnetic field that MRI devices require to work is accomplished by immersing powerful superconducting magnets inside liquid helium . Manufacturers of fiber optics cable and semiconductors used in electronic components rely on helium . And these are just a few examples of the importance of helium .
