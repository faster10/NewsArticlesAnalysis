The actual incursion ( if indeed there was one at all , which Moscow denies ) lasted merely seconds . Media and online observers estimate anywhere between 10 and 17 seconds , the generous guess earlier allows a little more than that . Even so , not even 30 seconds would be enough to go through the launch authorizing process lock on and fire ? and then there s the time it takes for the missiles to actually reach their target after they are fired . Not enough data is available to hazard a guess but it would take a good few seconds .
