Perhaps the big unknown for this president is exactly how he will start the long , painful and politically devastating business of cutting the deficit . Having had pretty much universal agreement from the IMF , World Bank , OECD and others that now was not the time for retrenchment , we are coming to that time when addressing the U .

There ' s also the matter of seeing the exact nature of the Congress too .
