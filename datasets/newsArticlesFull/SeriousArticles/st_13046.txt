" I want every New Yorker to know that their security is our absolute highest priority , " Gov . Andrew M . Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday night . " After the Paris attacks , I directed state agencies to enhance their preparedness out of an abundance of caution . . . . and remain in close contact with local and federal authorities , including the FBI and NYPD through the Joint Terrorism Task Force , and that vigilance continues today . I encourage all New Yorkers to remain alert and report any suspicious activity , while at the same time not letting this disrupt their daily lives . Remember that the terrorists ' goal is to let fear win New Yorkers never have , and we never will . "
