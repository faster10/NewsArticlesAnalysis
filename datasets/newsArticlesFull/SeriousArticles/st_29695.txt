There was a woman that delivered a premature baby I think that baby was like the size of my hands . We were the only hospital that was well equipped with the high technology . The baby was able to grow stronger until it was able to go home . To see that child every time I go home is like I gave life to somebody . I think each one of us in this world , we have a duty to fulfill our mission . God has blessed some of us in the position to touch many people , and so many people can hear our voices from distances away , and I think I am capable to do it .
