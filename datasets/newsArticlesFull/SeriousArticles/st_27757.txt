This year s lack of diversity has led Oscar nominated director Spike Lee and actress Jada Pinkett Smith to promise to boycott the ceremony . On Monday , the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences , Cheryl Boone Isaacs , issued a statement declaring that the effects of recent efforts to diversify the Academy s ranks are not coming as fast as we would like . She added that the organization will soon conduct a review of its recruitment practices to ensure much needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond .
