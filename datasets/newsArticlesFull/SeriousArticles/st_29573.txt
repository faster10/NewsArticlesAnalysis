The album opens with crisp , airy beats , but Consideration s sonic lightness is a bit of a red herring on an album that favours the moody and the minimal . Bouncy and full of pretty melodies , it features Rihanna s increasingly impressive vocal dancing around alt R B singer SZA s featherlight interjections , the musical calm constantly ruptured by Rihanna s frustrations . I ve got to do things my own way , darling , she sighs at one point , before the pair sadly sing getting no peace over the looped coda . It s surprisingly lovely .
