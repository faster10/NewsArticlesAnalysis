I support Bernie , it s a no brainer , Mr Packer explained . He has been consistent over his entire political career for what he stands for , and that s exactly the same items I have stood for in my own life . It s an absolute right , not a privilege , to have health care . And to get money out of politics . Money is really the cause of all of our dilemmas right now . If you look at Wall Street and how the 1 percent gains and everybody else loses , that s a wrong system . Our capitalist system is broken .
