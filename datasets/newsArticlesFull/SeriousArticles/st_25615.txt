Cam Newton can inspire a run oriented offense that ' s crested the 100 yard rushing mark in every game this season . If Jonathan Stewart can ' t find room on the ground , Newton will have to find magic in the air , though defenders surely will focus on Olson . . . . If defensive linemen Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei can clog the interior , that will allow linebacker Luke Kuechly to patrol with menace and help compensate for the likely absence of Thomas Davis , who left Sunday ' s win with an arm injury . . . . A tight score down the stretch could play to Newton ' s strengths , as he has four game winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime this season .
