Bell : I did not feel comfortable taking a right that was denied to some of my best friends . I would want someone to stand up for me if I was denied a right in this country that prides itself on having equal rights for everyone . I believe that gay citizens of this country deserve to share not only the label of marriage but also the rights behind it . There are over 1 , 100 rights denied to a couple when you can ' t legally get married . I find that to be mind boggling . Dax and I both very much wanted to wait because if we did do something for our wedding half the people we would be inviting couldn ' t celebrate the same right . But when we had a baby it became clear as to why we ' re fighting for this right , because we don ' t have some rights in regard to the baby that married couples do . I choose to be on the right side of history and I know in my heart that ( equality ) is what ' s right .
