Even though SRK never mentioned the BJP or any particular party , some people , who could double up as Pakistan s tourism board , swiftly got into action . Sadly , these statements came a couple of days after FM Arun Jaitley said that India was inherently liberal and tolerant , it looks like an illusion , when SN Channabasappa , a local BJP leader from Karnataka , is quoted saying he d behead Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah if he ate beef . While the likes of Sakshi Maharaj , Sangeet Som and Mahesh Sharma kept quiet about SRK s comments , there were enough " go to Pakistan " chants to go around .
