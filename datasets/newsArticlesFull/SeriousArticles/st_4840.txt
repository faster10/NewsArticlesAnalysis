Hollywood has a long history of ? sucking up to Chinese censors ? in an attempt to rake in more money from one of the biggest movie markets in the world . This segment finds Colbert shamelessly following in that tradition by , among other things , calling out the Dalai Lama and having his life saved by a Chinese doctor astronaut . There s only been one installment of Pander Express so far , but its branding in that initial bit , and the obviousness with which Hollywood goes out of its way to please China , means that even though the first one was a little clunky , the segment should come back soon . It s just a fresher way of talking about Hollywood and one that avoids the standard late night posture of well pandering .
