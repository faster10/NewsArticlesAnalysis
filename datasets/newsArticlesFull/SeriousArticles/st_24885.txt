For me , the two biggest issues are climate change and animal welfare animal agriculture . And oddly enough , animal agriculture is such a contributor to climate change . According to the United Nations , 25 percent of climate change comes from animal agriculture , so every car , bus , boat , truck , airplane combined has less CO2 and methane emissions than animal agriculture . So to me , one of the easiest way of addressing climate change and potentially remedying climate change is to stop subsidizing animal agriculture . ? Moby , musician
