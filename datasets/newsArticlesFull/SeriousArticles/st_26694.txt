You start talking to your brother in your local Middle Eastern language , assuring him that everything is okay and that he should expect you in about 7 . 5 hours . A few minutes later , and as you turn off the cell phone and ask the flight attendant to bring you a glass of water , two police cops enter the aircraft , brandishing a sheet of paper in their hands , looking beneath the overhead compartments to find a specific seat number . As they approach the row wherein you ' re seated , they take another glance at the paper , identify you and ask you to take your belongings and follow them . You dare to ask the reason , and are simply responded that you simply need to abide by the instructions . The plane takes off , and you miss the flight . Maybe you ' ll have to give your brother another call , but apparently you won ' t have enough time for that , as you should get prepared for the interrogation .
