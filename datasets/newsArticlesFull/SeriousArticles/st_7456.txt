In today ' s market , deeds in lieu offer what I believe is a better alternative to short sales for sellers . With deeds in lieu , the bank agrees to take your home back without foreclosing on it . It also agrees not to seek deficiency , which is loss on the loan that banks are entitled to in most states . As a bonus , deeds in lieu have much less impact on your credit score than does a short sale or a foreclosure . So at this point I ' m recommending that if you absolutely need to get out from under your house , a deed in lieu should be your first choice and a short sale your second .
