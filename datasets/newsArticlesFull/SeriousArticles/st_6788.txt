Micky : I don ' t think any of us slept because we were so excited . The night before there was a preview show on the television with Jackie Charlton and Brian Clough on a panel . They were talking about how Leeds were going to pummel us and give us a good hiding . That geed us all up . We didn ' t need a team talk after that . I roomed with Joe Bolton , who was just one of the young lads . We ate bags of sweets all night and watched the television . The next morning we had breakfast with all the television cameras and we all went down in our scruffs , while Leeds in the other hotel were there in their suits and ties .
