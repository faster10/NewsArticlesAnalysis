" Catching Fire " earned 20 . 7 million on Wednesday and 14 . 9 million on Thursday . That 35 . 6 million haul puts the film on track for a five day weekend of about 100 105 million , which will handily beat " Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ' s Stone " 82 . 4 million gross over the same period of time in 2001 . Remarkably , " Catching Fire " will have earned about 290 million after just 10 days of release , and if it keeps up this pace , it will easily outdo the original " Hunger Games ' " 408 million domestic total .
