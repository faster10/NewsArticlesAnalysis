Shawn Andrews as " Kevin Pickford " Then : Who can forget Kevin Pickford ? You know , the guy with the amazing abs who was throwing a keg party at his house before his parents caught on ? Fun fact : during the filming of " Dazed and Confused , " Shawn eloped with co star Milla Jovovich , who also played his girlfriend , Michelle Burroughs , the hot girl who didn ' t really talk . She was only 16 at the time , so her mom had the marriage annulled after two months . Oh , young love . Now : Since then , Shawn has appeared in a handful of other movies , most recently " Fix " opposite Olivia Wilde , but apparently , he never really bounced back from wedding a teenager . At least he still looks amazing .
