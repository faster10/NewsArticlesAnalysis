8 . Archaeologists have identified more than 25 , 000 Ancestral Pueblo sites in New Mexico . Arrowheads are unearthed almost everywhere in the state , but for the most complete and mind boggling perspective of these hunter gatherers who thrived 10 , 000 years ago , visit Bandelier National Monument near Los Alamos . The park covers 33 , 677 acres and centers around Frijoles Canyon , where a mile long hike takes visitors past petroglyphs and masonry walls built into a cliff face . The Ancestral Puebloans cleared out of Frijoles sometime after 1250 , possibly because of drought , deforestation , crop failure , or internal conflict . The reasons are still not known .
