Smith ' s targets over the last four weeks : Jeremy Maclin 30 Travis Kelce 22 Albert Wilson 20 West , Jason Avant , Demetrius Harris 5 Chris Conley 3 . . . . In playoff DFS , Maclin is a top shelf receiver play who may go overlooked with more traffic on Antonio Brown , DeAndre Hopkins , A . J . Green , Doug Baldwin , and perhaps even James Jones . The Texans have solid corners in LCB Johnathan Joseph , slot CB Kareem Jackson , and impressive rookie RCB Kevin Johnson , but they are not immune to allowing wideout production . Allen Robinson went 5 108 at Houston last week , Harry Douglas caught six passes against the Texans the week prior , Donte Moncrief managed 5 51 1 on Houston in Week 15 , Danny Amendola had six catches against them in Week 14 , and Sammy Watkins dropped 3 109 1 on Crennel ' s defense in Week 13 . Seeing more slot usage recently , Maclin could end up running a ton of routes at Jackson while Wilson and Conley work against Joseph and Johnson outside . I think this game lays out well for the Chiefs to aggressively feed Maclin high percentage catches , setting up an attempt at a shot play or two . . . . Kelce figures to be one of the most popular tight ends on the board , particularly among fantasy owners who recall his Week 1 line ( 6 106 2 ) against these same Texans . Houston ended the regular season ranked as the ninth toughest defense versus tight ends in Football Outsiders ' DVOA and allowed the ninth fewest receptions to the position . On paper , this is not a favorable matchup . Kelce , of course , has shown the ability to overcome that before .
