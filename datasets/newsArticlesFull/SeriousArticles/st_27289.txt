The other limitation of " Wrath of the Titans " is that the dialogue is mostly made of wet cardboard . What there is of it consists of actors like Liam Neeson , Ralph Fiennes , and dgar Ram rez ( as the evil Ares ) staring at each other and saying ' ' You ' re my brother and you betrayed me ! ' ' or ' ' You ' re my son and you betrayed me ! ' ' We get it : The gods are losing their power , there ' s a whole lot of betrayal going on , and this means , somehow , that the world is about to end . It ' s up to Perseus to amass an army to fight Kronos and the forces of chaos .
