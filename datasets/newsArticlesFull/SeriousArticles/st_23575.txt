A 2011 Institute for Justice study , " Government Unchecked : The False Problem of ' Judicial Activism ' and the Need for Judicial Engagement , " compared the number of laws struck down by the Supreme Court to the number of laws passed by Congress and state legislatures . From 1954 to 2002 , the court struck down , in whole or in part , just two thirds of one percent of laws passed by Congress and less than one twentieth of a percent of laws passed by state legislatures . Over those five decades , the court struck , on average , just two federal and nine state laws per year .
