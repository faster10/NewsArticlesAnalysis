Colwell : Temperature is a major regulator of the abundance of the cholera bacteria . The study that was carried out by Carla Pruzzo in Italy , with which we collaborated , was an analysis of plankton samples that had been stored for the past 40 years at a marine laboratory in England . They ' d been collecting samples every year for 40 years and so we analyzed the samples , and what Dr Pruzzo and our team found was that as the water temperature is increasing , the numbers of vibrios ( small , comma shaped bacteria ) and the number of cases of diseases caused by vibrio , namely cholera , have been increasing . It has been directly related to the warming of the sea temperature .
