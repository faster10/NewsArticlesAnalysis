Pomfret : I generally agree , but I also think that from 1949 when China had its revolution until today , the Communist Party has actually been the main source of instability in China , and that when the party changes direction it causes enormous suffering in this country . So if we see significant fractures in that top echelon ( of the Party ) , I think all bets are off . If they do not remain united , they ' re going to sink together . If they are united in terms of pushing China forward and listening to the increasing demands of their people , or some type of political opening , they will be in charge for decades to come .
