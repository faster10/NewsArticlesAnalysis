LaCivita s fussing worked and the Paul campaign got an upgrade . But the entire incident is illustrative of a larger problem that affects not just the candidates , but the viewers at home trying to make any sense out of the debate . And no , that problem isn t that Paul has a soft enough seat to sit upon while waiting to go live on national television . This whole incident is a reminder that there are just too many damn candidates being allowed in this debate . Of course they re cramming them into bathrooms ! The University of Colorado may be big , but it s hard to accommodate so many people all the same .
