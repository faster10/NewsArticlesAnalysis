There ' s really just one place to find that foundation : the Syrian people themselves . Though badly fractured , Syrians know the path they ' re on leads only to even greater death and destruction ? with or without foreign intervention . And perhaps most importantly , Syrian supporters of the regime likely know how much they can gain by letting go of Assad and his form of rule . Helping rebel groups find agreement on a post Assad blueprint may not be easy ? accepting regime members into a post Assad government will require a lot of forbearance ? but the alternatives are far worse .
