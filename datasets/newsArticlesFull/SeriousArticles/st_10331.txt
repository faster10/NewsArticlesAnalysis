This time around , Clinton has more of the Obama coalition : most women , African Americans , as well as some progressive whites and millenials . After Iowa and New Hampshire , the Democratic electorate is more than 40 percent minorities and Clinton is beating Sanders amongst non whites 69 percent to 23 percent . We re fighting over whether Bernie will get 52 in Iowa , says Joe Trippi , who managed Howard Dean s 2004 presidential bid . What does that tell you ? It tells you that once you make the turn and only 54 of the party is similar to Iowa and New Hampshire , they ll split that vote even . And then she s beating him with the other 46 percent of the vote .
