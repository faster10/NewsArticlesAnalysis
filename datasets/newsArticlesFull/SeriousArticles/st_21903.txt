Researchers sought to quantify popularity using sophisticated brain imaging to see how our minds track and categorize popularity . Two groups were established of already existing clubs , and the research team first asked each member to evaluate how much they liked other members of their group .

Later , each member was shown an image of every member while functional MRI images were collected as they saw their peers faces .
