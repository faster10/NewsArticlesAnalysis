( Before the George Lopez ) show went on the air , ( Lopez ) wanted me desperately to play his mother and I just kept saying that is the most disrespectful Hispanic woman I have ever seen and I can ' t do that . I mean , he really courted me , he sent me bottles of wine and stuff , " I ' m here because of you , " that kind of thing . And , I know he meant it , he was very sincere and respectful but I just thought that she gave all of us a very bad name . I know she was funny , but I just couldn ' t see myself doing that part , it really bothered me .
