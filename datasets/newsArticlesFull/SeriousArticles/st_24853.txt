gimme a break , adams is just a kid . this is second year in the nfl . the packers have complex route trees . he was injured and it takes time to learn and mesh with a great QB like aaron rodgers . in the long run adams will become the packers anaquin bolden a big receiver who will make big plays . losing jordy nelson was huge . he is the best white wr since lance alworth . not only did the packers lose jordy nelson they lost jermichael finley too . put them both in the line up and all the trolls here will disappear . the packers would have the best offense in pro football and be at least 10 1 right now .
