People rip Kelly for the Bradford Foles trade , and it didn t make much sense when it happened . It hasn t worked out , either . But it didn ' t take Kelly being away from Oregon too long to learn this truth of the NFL : You can win with a poor quarterback , but it s really hard . He knows because he won 10 games each of the last two years with below average quarterbacks . He took a shot on Bradford , a former No . 1 overall pick . He was wrong . Then Bradford got hurt , as anyone should have predicted , and the Eagles season has gone downhill fast .
