Miller : I see myself , the artist side of me , as a storyteller . And I don ' t really see art as all that important . It ' s something I do , it ' s something I ' ve done , it ' s always a part of me , and I enjoy it . But I ' m not building bridges I ' m not saving people ' s lives I ' m painting pretty pictures . So the importance to me of art that I can do is to memorialize people who deserve it . So this is really a chance for me to say these people are important . With this memorial specifically , it kind of dawned on me the other day : It ' s not just about 9 11 . It ' s not just about that day . It ' s about the people that lost their lives and that were affected and lost family , friends , but it continues , especially doing this 10 years later , it ' s about the people that continue to serve . Before 9 11 , after 9 11 , they ' re still important . And this memorial sort of brings that to light . And to me , that ' s important . To keep people ' s minds open . And that ' s kind of what art can do .
