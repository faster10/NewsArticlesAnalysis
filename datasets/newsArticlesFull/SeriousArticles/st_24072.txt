Problem is , as far as the people in and around the Mets are concerned , they ' re sneaking up on some must win games in Queens , and a best of seven series sure seems like a lot of baseball until you lose the first two . Their best pitchers haven ' t pitched like it , they ' ve scored one run in the last 14 innings , now even Daniel Murphy isn ' t hitting , and after Noah Syndergaard ' s Game 3 start they ' ll come back in Game 4 with Steven Matz , a nice young pitcher whose ninth career start could be to save their season .
