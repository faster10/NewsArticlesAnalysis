On advice to budding entrepreneurs : " Believe in yourself . You don ' t have to win arguments . You don ' t have to prove to someone else that you ' re right . If you believe you ' re right . . . that ' s what matters . You ' ve got to follow what ' s in your heart . The second piece of advice is : How far you go in life . . . it ' s how well liked you are by the people you work with . That will determine how far you go up organization ladders and the like . Be nice to people . Don ' t be cutting them down . Don ' t be rude and all that stuff . That ' s my philosophy . "
