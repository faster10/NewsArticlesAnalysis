As usual , Stephen Curry saved the day for the Warriors , hitting a couple of clutch three pointers with over three minutes to go in the game when the Raptors threatened to give Golden State their first loss of the season . On the next possession , he gave the Warriors the lead for good with an uncontested 3 pointer and finished the quarter by finding Ezeli for an alley oop dunk before converting a 3 point play and knocking down a 3 pointer with 1 . 9 seconds left . Reserve big man Andrea Bargnani is expected to miss his third straight game with a hamstring . BUZZER BEATERS1 .
