Five months ago , Donald Trump descended , somewhat inexplicably , upon Ladd Peebles Stadium in Mobile , Alabama , ? and promptly took over American politics . We were all so bewildered by Trump then , and his organization , such as it was , was ramshackle . He simply decided , for reasons no one quite understood , to do a sudden pop in to a college football stadium in the deep South on a Friday night in a state few ? had even thought to campaign in . We all mocked Trump , but we were fascinated by him . The flameout , when it inevitably came , would be glorious .
