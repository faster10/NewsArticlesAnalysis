At 4 : 35 p . m . on Monday , as I worked out of my aunt ' s home in the suburbs of Ottawa , Canada , I got an email : My just issued U . S . visa was in my Pakistani passport and ready to be picked up . I began planning when I could go to the post office the next day . I wanted to see that literal stamp of approval in person to touch it , to know I could return to the people I love , the work I love . To actually hold the document would be a moment of triumph , a brief respite from the knowledge that my life in the U . S . exists solely at the pleasure of bureaucrats . I had a flight booked for Tuesday night . My suitcase which I ' d crammed full before leaving D . C . , since it wasn ' t clear how long the visa process might take was ready to go .
