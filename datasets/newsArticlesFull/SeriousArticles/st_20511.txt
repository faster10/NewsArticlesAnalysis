The Muslim Brotherhood in fact has a shameful record of marginalizing women in the group , until it needs to abuse them to beautify the group ' s image . All through its history , the Muslim Sisters have never been allowed access to the leadership office of the Muslim Brotherhood group . The Muslim Brothers have changed this only in the past year by establishing the Freedom and Justice political party . It hired some women in the supreme committee of the party , but they are the wives , daughters , or relatives of leading brothers . We do not know much about them and they rarely if ever appear in public to speak on behalf of their party .
