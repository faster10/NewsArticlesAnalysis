These trends don t mean the establishment is done for . It very well could be . Or it could be up for grabs . Remember what I said about outsiders and mavericks who try to reshape the issue landscape to their advantage ? That s what I think is happening now . The candidate most likely to surge next is the one who can do the best job , not of adapting to the political world around them , but of reshaping that world to their advantage . If they can bring enough of the establishment along , they will define the new establishment .
