Hooper says presidential elections campaigns , when ? discussion of potential terror threats plays a prominent role in the public debate , ? tend to stir Islamaphobia . But this year has been different , he said . Even before the Paris attacks , Ben Carson , another Republican presidential candidate , suggested that a Muslim could never be fit to serve as president , and lately he has referred to Syrian refugees as rabid dogs . Beyond his 9 11 claims , Trump has said he might support a database to track Muslim Americans ( he later backed away ) . And the entire Republican party has united around a pledge to block new Syrian refugees from entering the country .
