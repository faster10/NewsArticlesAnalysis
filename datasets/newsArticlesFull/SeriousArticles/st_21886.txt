On October 18 , Katy Perry wrapped up her nearly 18 month Prismatic world tour with a show in Costa Rica . Less than a week later , she was spotted performing at a Hillary Clinton rally in Iowa , where she was introduced by Bill Clinton and made her presidential candidate preferences quite clear . I stand and I march with Hillary , Perry said . I believe in her future , her vision . I believe in her policies . I believe in equal rights for men , women , pay Thank you for having me , she s my firework . At the rally , Hillary Clinton , in turn , expressed her admiration for the singer : I have to give a special shout out to somebody really special , somebody whose birthday is tomorrow , someone who reminds us that sometimes you just have to let them hear you roar . Katy Perry , thank you for being here .
