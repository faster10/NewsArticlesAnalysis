In control late : Nearly half Brady ' s incompletions came in the fourth quarter . He was 4 of 10 with two first downs in the final 15 minutes . Even though the Chiefs ultimately cut the Patriots ' lead to seven late in the quarter , the Patriots had a nearly 90 percent chance to win for the entire quarter . Total QBR does not " up weight " for clutch situations , but it does " down weight " when the game is out of hand . Brady ' s relatively poor fourth quarter did not hurt him in total QBR as much as it would in traditional statistics that treat all situations equally .
