" Marketers basically decide what is ' girl ' and what is ' boy , ' which ultimately leads to two very distinct ways to profit as well as a blind acceptance from the consumer who , often , doesn ' t realize it ' s happening , " Yulo says . " Girls are inundated from a very young age with inappropriate messaging by way of products like ' skinny ' jeans for toddlers , or T shirts that say , ' I ' m too pretty to do homework , so my brother does it for me , ' and sexy Halloween costumes . Kids begin to codify other kids by placing them in strict categories that they ' ve been taught not born with . Inevitably , kids begin to believe that girls need to be sexy , and boys believe it , too . "
