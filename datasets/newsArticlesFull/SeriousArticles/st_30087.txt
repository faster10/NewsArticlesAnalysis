Our equipment is running at full capacity and we are working around the clock to produce as much Chocolate Milk as we can . We do hope we will be able to source additional equipment to increase supply but it takes time and we won ' t do anything that compromises the quality of our product . So bear with us New Zealand as we strive to improve our supply . Lewis Road Creamery Fresh Chocolate Milk is here to stay so if you can ' t find some on your next shop , we ' re making it six days a week and there will be more soon , ' Lewis Road Creamery wrote on Facebook .
