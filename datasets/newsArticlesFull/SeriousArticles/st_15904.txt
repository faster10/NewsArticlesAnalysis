The polio eradication movement , started in 1988 , was a joint effort between the Indian government WHO Rotary International the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation UNICEF and various other NGOs the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom and about 2 million workers who vaccinated nearly 170 million throughout the country to finally wipe out the disease . Truly , this worldwide effort should serve as a reminder that when the global community bands together to solve an issue , great things can be achieved . And today should serve as a call to not simply continue the efforts but to exponentially increase them .
