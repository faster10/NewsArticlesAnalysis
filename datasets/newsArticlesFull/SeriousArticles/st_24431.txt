Of immediate concern is the prospect of outright military conflict between Russia and Turkey . Putin was quick to insist to audiences at home and abroad that Turkey would face " tragic consequences " for its " huge mistake . " It ' s not histrionic to wonder if the man who invaded Georgia in 2008 on the eve of the country ' s admittance to NATO under the guise of defending the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and who still denies sending Russian troops into Ukraine would resort to violence in Turkey , too ( though at least Turkey , unlike Georgia and Ukraine , is not in Russia ' s so called " sphere of influence " ) . After all , there has been no love lost between Turkey and Russia , given their historic clashes over the Black Sea , Turkey ' s violent repression of pro Soviet communist movements in the 1970s , and more recent polar opposite views on the Syrian regime . ( To think that only a year ago Erdogan and Putin were hashing out energy deals in private summits . )
