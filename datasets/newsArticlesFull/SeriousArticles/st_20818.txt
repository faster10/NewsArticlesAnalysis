Gibson : All of those things existed before I wrote about them they just weren ' t that big a part of life yet . With reality TV , " Cops " was running when I wrote " Virtual Light , " and I knew about but hadn ' t seen the UK ' s " Big Brother , " likewise the Japanese show that had inspired " Big Brother . " So I was working with something real , but something that struck me as inherently surreal , and trying to imagine it having extremely powerful pop culture legs . Which fortunately it turned out to have . My current stock of things like that is always quite small , so I try not to give them away !
