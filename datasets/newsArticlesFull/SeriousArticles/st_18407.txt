The academy seems to have gotten a lot of these nominations in the hip hop realm right this year , but that doesn t change the history of the awards and the hip hop community .

Kendrick has 11 nods , but it doesn t negate the constant snubs and lack of understanding for hip hop rap categories ? for that , we have a long way to go . This is just one step in the right direction .
