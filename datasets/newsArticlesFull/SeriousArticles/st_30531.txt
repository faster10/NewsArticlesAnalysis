Unfortunately , Washington inadvertently set Iran on its present course . In 1953 the U . S . helped oust Tehran ' s democratic government and turn the Shah into a despised despot , who suppressed political liberals and religious conservatives alike . After his 1979 overthrow the Reagan administration backed the even more loathsome Saddam Hussein in Iraq ' s invasion of Iran , which ended in stalemate after the death of perhaps one million Iranians . Since then Washington has supported sanctions on Iran for its nuclear research and threatened war if Tehran tried to develop nuclear weapons . Today the U . S . backs efforts to overthrow the Assad government , one of Tehran ' s only three allies ( along with Iraq and Lebanon ' s Shia movement ) in the Middle East .
