The guy is completely clueless about building a relationship with the community and cultivating political allies . A REAL businessman understands its about building relations with people , especially when you come begging to the local government for funds or favors . The guy has benefited for years with a ticket guarantee during the Ryan Leaf era . Stealing money from the city without a good faith gesture by putting a halt to it , even temporarily . The guy is the least tactful person when it comes to feeling the pulse of the community and ingratiating himself with occasional moments of humility .
