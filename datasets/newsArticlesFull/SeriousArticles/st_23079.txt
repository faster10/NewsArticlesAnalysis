The military piece clearly remains the group s primary preoccupation , and for good reason . Actually holding territory , the great swath of Iraq and Syria it declared a Caliphate , is what first differentiated the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria , also known as ISIL and just the Islamic State , from other groups . It also animated the group s growing following . ISIS s priority appears to remain on retaining that physical turf . When volunteers in Western countries say they are prepared to do whatever the Islamic State wants ? launch an attack where they are , or hop a flight toward Syria ? they are generally directed to the join the fight in the Middle East . And when attacks go forward , they have been the thrashing , lone wolf efforts that , in America at least , fade into the background noise of ongoing domestic gun violence . ( The Sinai bomb likely originated not with ISIS command and control in Syria but with the quasi independent jihadists who have operated for years in the largely lawless Sinai , but now pledge fealty to the Islamic State . )
