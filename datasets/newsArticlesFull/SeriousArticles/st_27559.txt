3 , LB Mike Morgan : Morgan is another who will benefit from Irvin s absence , getting the start at strongside linebacker . It s just the second of his career , which dates to 2011 . Seattle could have moved K . J . Wright to strongside and had Kevin Pierre Louis play at WLB . But Seattle coaches instead decided to go with Morgan at SLB , which allows Wright to stay where he has played as well as any linebacker in the NFL this season . Morgan played at USC under Carroll , saying this week he has essentially been playing in this defense for nine years . Him getting to start in this one , I m excited for him , Carroll said Friday . I talked to him about it just today . He s got a look in his eye , he s got that gleam . He knows he s got to step up . This is what he wants , this is what he plays for . It s a good time . We expect him to play well .
