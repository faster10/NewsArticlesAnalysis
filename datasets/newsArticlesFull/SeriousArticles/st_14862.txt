I used to take the Amtrak Acela train between Baltimore and New York City pretty regularly . On those rare occasions when I couldn ' t get a seat in the Quiet Car , it was sheer hell , even with headphones . I heard privileged conversations that would get lawyers fired . I listened to talk that wasn ' t fit for children under 17 . I was forced to eavesdrop on people discussing personal , private matters all done in normal tones . And people didn ' t hesitate in trying to have their loud conversations even in the Quiet Car .
