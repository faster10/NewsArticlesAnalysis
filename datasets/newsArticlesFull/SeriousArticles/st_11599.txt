I ve about had it with these people , Kasich said Tuesday at a rally in Westerville , Ohio , according to Politico . We got one candidate that says we ought to abolish Medicaid and Medicare . You ever heard of anything so crazy as that ? Telling our people in this country who are seniors , who are about to be seniors that we re going to abolish Medicaid and Medicare ? That was a particular dig at neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who is leading in the Iowa polls and has said he would support eviscerating Medicare . He also took swings at Donald Trump , saying that his plan to evict 10 11 million undocumented immigrants was crazy . That is just crazy .
