Gao : I think that the Communist Party of China will remain the ruling party for many years , if not for many decades , to come . However , that doesn ' t mean that there will be no increasing amount of democracy or democratic participation . I think participation in the government , monitoring of the government , supervision of the Communist Party by other democratic parties and by the population in general will increase . It may not be the same as in the United States or in Britain or in European countries etc . , it will be very much of Chinese characteristic , and that will set China apart from other developed countries for decades to come .
