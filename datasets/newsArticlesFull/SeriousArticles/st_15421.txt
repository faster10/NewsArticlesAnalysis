I have my iPhone in hand and itching to take a picture when suddenly things go horribly sideways : A white clad girl in the bowl suddenly jumps up and starts screaming " She take a picture ! ! " She runs into the lobby and a grim faced Mama san bustles up to us . The girl crowds us and accuses me more people start to gather . My friends advise me to erase the picture but I haven ' t taken any ! I try and stand my ground and keep saying , " I didn ' t take a picture . " But I am becoming very nervous and the situation is getting ugly .
