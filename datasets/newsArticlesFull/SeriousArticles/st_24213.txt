The HRC has long been considered the whitest , wealthiest , most mainstream gay rights organization its most salient criticisms have come from the very LGBTQ people it purports to represent . The nonprofit has come under fire for endorsing Republicans over pro gay Democrats to make inroads in the GOP base and heaping praise on massive companies with dubious ethics , such as Goldman Sachs . Many believed the HRC sold out transgender people when it stood behind a 2007 version of the federal Employment Non Discrimination Act that was stripped of protections for gender identity . That meeker bill failed anyway , as did the 2014 HRC supported version that would have allowed certain discriminating organizations to claim religious exemption . At a major 2013 rally for equal marriage that was organized in part by the HRC , a transgender activist was told to take a trans pride flag off the podium platform and one of the speakers was asked to remove a reference to his undocumented status from his speech . ( An HRC representative later apologized . )
