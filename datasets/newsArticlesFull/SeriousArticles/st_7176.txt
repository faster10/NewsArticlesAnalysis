The city ' s initiative has led to the organic rise of other notable gestures across Texas in the weeks ahead . At nearby Fort Worth , an eight foot bronze statue of Kennedy stands in JFK Tribute Plaza , the site where Kennedy spoke to thousands in a misting rain hours before he was killed . A few miles west of downtown , the Amon Carter Museum of American Art will show fine art that had hung in the Kennedys ' suite at the Hilton Hotel Texas the night before his death . The Fort Worth Public Library and the University of Texas Library at nearby Arlington both offer extensive exhibitions of photographs from JFK visits to Fort Worth and Dallas .
