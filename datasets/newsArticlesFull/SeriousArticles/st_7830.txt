It wasn t what politicians promised last year . When hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving in the European Union last year on the shores of Italy and Greece , Germany made a bold decision : all refugees from the civil war in Syria would be welcome , regardless of where or how they entered the EU .

In addition to thousands of families fleeing Syria and other war zones , Germany also let in hundreds of thousands of people from other countries with no valid claim for asylum .
