Unless Stanford jumps into the playoff , the Las Vegas Bowl won ' t have a choice on which Pac 12 team it gets . If the Holiday and Foster Farms both pass on UCLA , the Bruins will play in Vegas . If UCLA is selected by one of those bowls ( with Foster Farms a real possibility ) , Vegas gets the remaining 6 3 team . Because UCLA is a likely option , Vegas will have to wait before offering the other spot to either BYU or the Mountain West champion . UCLA and BYU played earlier in the season and a rematch almost assuredly will not happen .
