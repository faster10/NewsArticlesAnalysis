While none of the networks draped themselves in glory , MSNBC was undoubtedly the worst offender . As reporter Kerry Sanders rifled through pictures of children , a queasy sounding Andrea Mitchell told him to not show the child . Sanders , apparently overcome with eagerness , didn t get the hint . He went on to show the Social Security card and ID of Farook s mother ? who is both alive and has not been implicated in any crime at all . No doubt she will thank Sanders and MSNBC for exposing her so directly to the current climate of fear , violence and Islamophobia .
