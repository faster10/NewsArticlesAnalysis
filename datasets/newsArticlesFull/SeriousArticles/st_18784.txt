The air power component of Cruz s anti ISIS strategy has always been there . But he s long been skeptical about the use of ground forces . There are some politicians who like to support boots on the ground in every conflict across the globe in an effort to lean forward and show how tough they are , he told CNN in November . I don t believe the answer is sending boots on the ground to Syria , he said last month , arguing that we had no role in the civil war there . But now he s coming around to a more receptive position on the use of ground troops . In a speech to the Heritage Foundation yesterday , Cruz signaled he was now open to the idea of sending American soldiers into Syria to fight the Islamic State . You need a commander in chief who sets an objective of destroying ISIS , and then we need to rely on the expert military judgment as to the tools necessary to carry out that objective , including overwhelming military power , including arming the Kurds , and including using whatever ground troops are necessary to kill the terrorists and then come home . ( Cruz s people are apparently trying to argue that intervening against ISIS in Syria does not count as intervening in the civil war , which does not make sense , given that ISIS is a key component of that war . )
