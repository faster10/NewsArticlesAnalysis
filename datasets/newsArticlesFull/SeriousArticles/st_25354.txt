It was a bizarre finish . Walsh had already hit field goals of 22 , 43 and 47 yards before his final shank . It was one of the more heartbreaking endings to an NFL game in a long time ( or at least since Saturday night ) . Walsh was 33 of 34 on field goals inside 30 yards for his career , and kickers on the whole were 189 of 191 on field goals from 27 yards or closer this season . In Minnesota it echoed a missed field goal by Gary Anderson in the 1998 NFC Championship Game , his first of the season , that helped the Falcons get to the Super Bowl . Even Seahawks fans lamented online for how bad they felt for Walsh .
