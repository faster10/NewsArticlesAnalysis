" Our soldiers are having to function in many more capacities than they have in the past , " said O ' Hanlon . " Sure they ' re expected to fight , but they have to know how to use technology that didn ' t exist before . They have to be leaders amongst their groups of soldiers and amongst the local populations . We saw some ' hearts and minds ' type of efforts in Vietnam , but not nearly to the extent we see in these wars . All of these factors should be giving them skills they can use when they ' re back here . "
