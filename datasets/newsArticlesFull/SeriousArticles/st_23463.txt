Health care : ? At the urging of Democrats , the bill would prevent an historic increase in premiums for some ? Medicare Part B beneficiaries for services such as outpatient hospital care and doctor visits . Monthly premiums would still go up for the ? 30 percent of Part B beneficiaries who are affected by the scheduled increase , which is roughly 15 million people , ? but ? by only 18 rather than the 54 increase that would occur if Congress doesn t act . The cost of this provision would be offset by a 3 monthly surcharge on some beneficiaries that would begin next year .
