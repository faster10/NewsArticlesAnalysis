There is a plan in place , all departments including my own , with Immigration ? Minister John ? McCallum have been working very hard to create a plan . We ' re ready for other contingencies if we need to adjust . The plan is making sure early on we had it right making sure we had the right people for the processing , which included the proper security screening and medical that was going to be done in the country that they ' re coming from . Then , the next piece was to make sure we had the right transportation to get them here . A lot of it is going to be by charter because it ' s much easier that way . The national defence is also providing aircraft to supplement that as well .
