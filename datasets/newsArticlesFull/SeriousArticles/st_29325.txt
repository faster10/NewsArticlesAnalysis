Without some kind of action to stop poaching and habitat loss , the critically endangered Sumatran elephants , orangutans and tigers will slowly and quietly decline . These once majestic species will only be seen behind a barrier at a zoo . Eventually , the species will go extinct . That ' s what conservationists at sanctuaries and zoos as well as non profit groups like WWF are pushing so hard to stop . Education through the animal ambassadors in captivity is one way to help reverse the trend and hopefully save the species from irradiation .
