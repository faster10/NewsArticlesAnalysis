My second issue is of course Tiffany . Yes I get it , she was shocked and confused thinking David Gest was dead . But when she found out the actual facts , she wasn ' t kind or understanding towards Angie . Her response was , " I ain ' t saying sorry to that old b . She laughed and thought it was all very funny . Only after being ostracised and even asked to leave by the other housemates , and having a reality check from Gemma Collins , did she go and say sorry to Angie , who took it so well and hugged her right from the off . So I ' m not sure if it was genuine from Tiffany or if she had no choice ?
