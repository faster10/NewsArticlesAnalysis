( YBG ) : The political will is there . The question is , do we still have such large scale privatizations ? What we have created is the momentum for a private sector presence in Egypt a significant , important dominant private sector in Egypt . We would like them to lead but we can ' t flood them with all sorts of assets that they may or may not want to buy . So we as the private sector is willing and we will provide them with the assets . But we ' re pretty soon going to be running out of private assets to privatize .
