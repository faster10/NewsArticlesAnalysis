Religious communities : The practice of keeping abuse allegations from secular authorities has a long tradition in several denominations besides the Catholic church . Some Orthodox Jewish communities are coming under increasing fire , through indictments and lawsuits , for pressuring families not to report allegations to authorities . When a family in Lakewood , New Jersey , ignored that pressure in 2009 , some rabbis circulated a proclamation that said , " It is prohibited ( for anyone ) to assist and participate with the secular authorities in their efforts to persecute a Jewish person . " In Brooklyn , the district attorney launched an initiative in 2009 to uncover abuse in Orthodox Jewish communities .
