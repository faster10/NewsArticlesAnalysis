In other 2016 news today , Hillary Clinton is out with a New York Times op ed responding detailing how she would rein in Wall Street . The op ed comes after last month ' s Democratic debate , where Clinton appeared to defend the donations she ' s received from Wall Street by invoking the 9 11 terrorist attacks . " My plan proposes legislation that would impose a new risk fee on dozens of the biggest banks ? those with more than 50 billion in assets . . . My plan would strengthen the Volcker Rule by closing the loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer backed deposits . . . And I would fight to reinstate the rules governing risky credit swaps and derivatives at taxpayer backed banks , which were repealed during last year ' s budget negotiations after a determined lobbying campaign by the banks . " And Clinton answers why a return to Glass Steagall isn ' t the end all , be all . " Some have urged the return of a Depression era rule called Glass Steagall , which separated traditional banking from investment banking . But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008 , like A . I . G . and Lehman Brothers , weren ' t traditional banks , so Glass Steagall wouldn ' t have limited their reckless behavior .
