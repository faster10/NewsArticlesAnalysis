Viola Davis is joining the conversation about diversity at the Academy Awards . " And we are a dignified people and we are powerful " . Last year , " Selma " failed to get an Oscar nod . " It ' s a problem that needs to be solved " . This is a hard but important conversation , and it ' s time for big changes . " I am an academy member and it doesn ' t reflect me and it doesn ' t reflect this nation " . In the coming days and weeks we will conduct a review of our membership recruitment in order to bring about much needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond .
