The Mets ' coaches and managers will out homework Ned Yost : While Royals Manager Ned Yost prefers to keep his players in more tightly defined roles , Mets Manager Terry Collins and pitching coach Dan Warthen have been more experimental . Sensing a weakness in the Cubs , Collins had his team looking to take extra bases , or steal them when possible . The Mets innovate from the mound too . While Jacob deGrom , Matt Harvey , and Noah Syndergaard relied very heavily on high velocity fastballs against an older Dodgers lineup , they switched to more off speed pitches against the young Cubs . Can Collins and Warthen come up with a strategy that beats the strengths of the Royals : contact hitting , rampaging the bases , and great defense ?
