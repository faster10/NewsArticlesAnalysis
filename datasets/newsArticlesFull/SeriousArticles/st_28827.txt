The Patriots made somewhat of " splash " move at the end of the regular season , bringing in veteran running back Steven Jackson . He ' s rushed for more than 11 , 000 yards in his career , but he ' s yet to find his footing in New England . On Saturday , Jackson carried it just six times for 16 yards , but that should change this week against the Broncos . Denver is No . 1 against the pass and No . 3 against the run , and while the Patriots have Brady , establishing the run is key . Giving Jackson more carries will help set up the play action and bring the linebackers in , thus opening up the field for Brady ' s receivers .
