Huckabee , who was relegated to the undercard stage , laid out a hypothetical situation on Friday morning in which a person took a stance a decade ago but now sees things maybe differently . I don t think you can be this person who has a , you know , 180 degree turn , and if you do you gotta explain it , he said . But when a person changes views time after time and is always moving with the political wind vane , when a person is a thermometer instead of a thermostat , that person s not a leader . And no , you can t trust them .
