I often talk about the need for a vision . I m not sure I ever said what I meant . We solve problems here ? yes . We create a lot of them too . But at bottom , we vindicate a way of life . We show by our work that free people can govern themselves . They can solve their own problems . They can make their own decisions . They can deliberate , collaborate , and get the job done . We show self government is not only more efficient and more effective it is more fulfilling . In fact , we show it is that struggle , that hard work , the very achievement itself that makes us free .
