The problem with this argument is that it doesn ' t look at the growth in costs actual beneficiaries face over time . Not only are seniors harder hit by escalating medical costs than the working age population , but since they have roughly half the household incomes , they spend a greater share on necessities like rent and utilities . It ' s quite possible that the CPI W actually overstates the ability of beneficiaries to substitute apples for oranges , or IPods for orthopedic shoes . If so , then a 3 . 6 COLA is not enough , not too much .
