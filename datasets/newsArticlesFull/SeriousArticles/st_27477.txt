Within a 10 minute cobblestone laden stroll from the historic Charles Bridge , which dates to the 14th century and overlooks the Vltava River , we were delighted to encounter LoVeg , an ironic name given that we climbed three flights of candlelit stairs to get to it . It was worth the hike for the delicious vegan burger made of red beets , chickpeas , tempeh and gherkin . The staff is clearly in it for the cause of compassion , hence their motto : " We give food a higher meaning . " We liked it so much we came back again and tried the baked beetroot carpaccio .
