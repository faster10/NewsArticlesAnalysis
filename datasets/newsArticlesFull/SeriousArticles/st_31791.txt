Sitting in your cramped flat has never been the point of Paris . Finally I ventured out with my daughter , aged nine , to the supermarket opposite . A customer there was shouting about his murdered friend . My daughter had been distraught after the terrorist attacks of January , but this weekend she remained calm . She explained to me : We re sort of used to this now . She is coming to think of neighbourhood terrorism as part of life , something that happens and passes . Presumably she is working out how to cope .
