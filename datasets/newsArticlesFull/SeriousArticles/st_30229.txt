Jeb , though , isn t the only example of how super PAC cash has yet to produce the type of return on investment that many deep pocketed donors hoped ? and campaign reform advocates feared ? heading into this campaign cycle . Scott Walker and Rick Perry had two of the better funded super PACs in the GOP field , and yet both dropped out well before the 2016 starting gates . Those still in the race are learning a similar lesson . NBC News crunched the numbers this week and found that campaign ads ? the primary tool of the super PAC ? don t appear to be paying dividends in the way you might expect . Donald Trump , Ben Carson , and Ted Cruz sit 1 2 3 in multiple recent national polls , yet they and their allies have been outspent 16 to 1 by the likes of Bush , Marco Rubio , and John Kasich and their friends . One big reason for that may be that a super PAC dollar doesn t go nearly as far as one raised directly by the campaigns since the outside groups typically have to pay much higher ad rates than candidates do .
