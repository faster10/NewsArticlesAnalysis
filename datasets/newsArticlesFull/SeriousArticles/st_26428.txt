The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity . Michael S . Monje Jr . , an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press , wrote , " The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude . It is a way for autistic people , as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology , to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that natural . The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural , less worthy , or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world .
