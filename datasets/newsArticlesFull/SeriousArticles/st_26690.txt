This complicated system has significant ramifications for all parties involved . For instance , a shortage of work visas and the short filing window once a year prevent companies from hiring highly skilled and educated candidates requiring new H 1B visas on a daily basis . According to Compete America , during fiscal year 2009 , 96 of employers hired 10 or fewer individuals on new H 1B petitions and 69 hired only one . Ultimately , companies often hire these individuals into other countries instead of the United States to obtain legal work authorization .
