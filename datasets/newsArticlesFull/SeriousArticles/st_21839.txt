The Vikings have assembled an impressive collection of defensive talent largely because of general manager Rick Spielman ' s drafts . The unit finished the regular season tied with Green Bay for seventh in sacks with 43 , five of which came in last Sunday night ' s win over the Packers . Veteran defensive end Everson Griffen leads the team with 10 . 5 , but Danielle Hunter has come on strong with six , which ranked second among all NFL rookies . Inside linebacker Eric Kendricks is another 2015 draft pick who has made a quick impact , tallying a team high 92 tackles . Anthony Barr also has blossomed into a blue chip outside linebacker during his second NFL season . The secondary is highlighted by ball hawking safety Harrison Smith , who already has set a franchise record with four career interception returns for touchdowns in just his fourth NFL season . The defense is orchestrated by Mike Zimmer , who was one of the NFL ' s most well respected defensive minds when hired as Vikings head coach in 2014 , and coordinator George Edwards .
