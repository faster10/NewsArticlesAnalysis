Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jabril , American educated and unabashedly secular , announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting , but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise , or if he does , who will succeed him . Jabril and Ali Tarhouni , the acting Finance and Oil Minister who was teaching economics in the United States before joining the rebellion , have been criticized for being outsiders , too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime .
