Love for our fellow human beings , meaning the desire to see everyone succeed , everyone taken care of , everyone treated with the dignity our humanity entitles us to . Hope that political action can be enough , that our country isn ' t too far gone to take back . Hope that the vision of a world marked by economic and social justice , first preached by the prophets of ancient Israel , then fought and died for by Jesus of Nazareth , next articulated by Muhammad , and continually championed by heroes from all faiths all over the world , can and will be realized .
