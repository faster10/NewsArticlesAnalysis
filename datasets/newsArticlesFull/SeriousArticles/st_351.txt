In the early 20th century , while he earned a Masters degree from the University of Chicago and a Ph . D . from Harvard , both in history , Woodson witnessed how black people were underrepresented in the books and conversations that shaped the study of American history . According to the way many historians taught the nation s past , African Americans were barely part of the story ? a narrative that Woodson knew was not true . So in 1915 , he and Jesse E . Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History ( now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History , or the ASALH ) . The organization would promote studying black history as a discipline and celebrate the accomplishments of African Americans .
