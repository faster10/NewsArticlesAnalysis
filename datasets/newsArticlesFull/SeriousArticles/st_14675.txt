Our few planes will not make much difference in Syria . They would be less a military contribution than a political signal : to France , to America , and to others , that Britain is with its allies and will join them in doing what we jointly decide is necessary . Cameron makes all the right noises about military force being only one element in a bigger strategy . How much he , along with other leaders , can deliver on this , we will have to wait to see . Too often , in the past , a military campaign has been put in place and the supposedly equally necessary non military aims have been mismanaged or allowed to drift away .
