In the end , the analysts may be right and , despite holding their convention in Ohio , Republicans will still lose both Ohio and the national election in 2016 . Hillary Clinton , the likely Democratic nominee , is very popular in Ohio . On the other hand , if Republicans do manage to capture both the state and the White House , it will be hard to not give some credit to the GOP leaders who decided to take their convention to Cleveland . And although it is too early to speculate , we should not discount the fact that two Ohioans , Sen . Rob Portman and Gov . John Kasich , have at least a shot at standing on the stage in Cleveland accepting their party ' s nomination for president .
