First , we have to go on the offense in this campaign and refuse to accept that the fight is over . North Korea must be made to pay an extraordinary price for this attack . One step might be to simply confiscate North Korean ships until the dictatorship pays triple damages to Sony and the theaters for the cost of its attack . What must not happen is for the American people to be told it is too hard or too dangerous to defend America against an out of control dictatorship . That could lead to anarchy and chaos , with every predator on the planet feeling they have the right to wage cyberwar against Americans .
