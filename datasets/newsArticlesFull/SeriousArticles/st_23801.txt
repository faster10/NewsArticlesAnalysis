When he was in Berlin in the late 70s , it was kind of a place to escape to . He went there in 76 , 77 to basically escape from the public glare . In previous years , he d been living in L . A . and had a big cocaine problem , and was a kind of famous superstar . He went to Berlin to escape and recorded the Berlin Trilogy a set of three acclaimed albums , and he became linked to Berlin in that period . Heroes was the famous song from then about lovers meeting on either side of the Berlin Wall . The song is not really about the Berlin Wall ? it s obviously not a political song ? but it s a song where the Berlin Wall appears as a shameful thing . The heroes are on the other side ? the shame in the lyrics is on the East Berlin side of the wall . Which would make him , you know , some kind of nice liberal .
