" Today ' s ruling is a major victory for law abiding Illinoisans and for everyone who understands that the Second Amendment protects the right both to keep arms and to bear arms , " said Chris Cox , executive director of NRA ' s Institute for Legislative Action , just after the 7th Circuit decision last week . " This ruling makes clear that Illinois cannot deny law abiding residents the right to carry a firearm for self defense outside the home . This is a step in the right direction for all gun owners . We know it probably won ' t be the end of this case , and we ' re ready to keep fighting until the courts fully protect the entire Second Amendment . "
