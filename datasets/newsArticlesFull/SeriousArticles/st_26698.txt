Ostracizing and defaming the followers of divine faiths , because people or entities associated or supposedly aligned with that faith commit appalling and vicious crimes , should not be made a tolerable convention : this holds true for the Muslims , Jews , Christians or the people of other faiths . I ' m always dismayed and troubled when people , especially my fellow citizens , begin denigrating the Jewish people once Israel launches an offensive into the Gaza Strip and kills a large group of people . The derogatory language used against the Jews and the desecration of their synagogues is utterly obnoxious . Clearly , there ' s no justification to the Israeli violence and aggression , but it ' s undoubted that the Jewish people are not responsible for what Benjamin Netanyahu decides to do to the suppressed Palestinians overnight . That ' s why I reject anti Semitism in the strongest terms and firmly believe that the Jewish people should be treated courteously , first because they ' ve historically undergone discrimination , and the discriminatory measures should come to an end at one point , and also because bigotry against people under the pretext that we don ' t like the way they worship or dress , or because a perverted minority has hijacked their ideology and justifies its cruelty through resorting to their sacred beliefs is in my view tantamount to theft in the daylight . For the same reason , I was always disturbed when the statements of my former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad fueled a vitriolic anti Semitic discourse in the Iranian society : totally indefensible .
