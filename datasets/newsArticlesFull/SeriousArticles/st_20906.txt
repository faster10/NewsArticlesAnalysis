I am Nigerian British and a Muslim , now living in the geographical West . I know that my experiences do not match that of a woman my age in a small town in Mali , or Pakistan . I don ' t wear a hijab never have done , unlikely ever to . I don ' t care one way or another about the hijab , but I do care about choice . In electing not to wear a headscarf , I have exercised that right , and not all of the women who wear scarves have the luxury of that choice . But there are also millions of women who choose , very happily and deliberately , to wear the hijab . Is it " liberating " to ban the hijab for these women ? Femen ' s intent may be honorable , but the implementation seems wrong headed to me .
