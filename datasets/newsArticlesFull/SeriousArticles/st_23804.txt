Bowie has this very distinctively English way of singing . He will vary his voice and make distinct use of cockney accents . On his new album there s a track called Girl Loves Me it s a mixture of Nadsat , the language that Anthony Burgess invented for A Clockwork Orange and Polari ? which is a corruption of Greek and Italian , a slang that was used in the fish market in England in the early 20th century and was used by gay men until about the 1970s . He s using variations of Nadsat and Polari in this song , which is very interesting .
