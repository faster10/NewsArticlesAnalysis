This matters with the Clinton case for a couple of reasons . ? One , it s downright laughable to compare the Clinton case to cases where law enforcement and prosecutors blow accusers ? off . Was there ever a more dogged and determined prosecutor than Ken Starr ? This was a man who was so hell bent on finding something to ding Clinton with that he resorted to questioning about consensual sex to catch Clinton in a perjury trap . Unlike prosecutors who wrongly assume that accusers are lying , Starr and his comrades in the Republican Party were clearly eager to believe . They just never got the evidence together , despite having all the political will feminists wish was applied to less politically convenient accusations .
