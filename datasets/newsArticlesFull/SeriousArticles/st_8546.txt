Young Tom Beadling will be in the squad but it won t be youngsters across the board in the team ? it ll only be one or two , and the rest will be seasoned experienced professionals who have been here all season . There will be one or two players rested who won t travel , who have been playing every single game over the Christmas period . There ll be one or two who have niggles , without them really being that serious , and they ll also be rested on the bench to get ready for Swansea and Tottenham . We ll use our squad to its full potential .
