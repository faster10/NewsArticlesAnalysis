I believe that we must prevent , confront and defeat the perpetrators and would be murders who engage in terrorism . I know that nearly one hundred percent of Muslims in America share that goal , and that we can all achieve it more surely if we respect and support each other . I also believe that I always have two choices when confronted by threats to our way of life . I can choose fear and intolerance , or I can choose hope and openness . As the Civil War approached , Lincoln called forth " the better angels of our nature . " As the war ended , he called for " malice toward none , with charity for all . " Are his words not equally appropriate today ?
