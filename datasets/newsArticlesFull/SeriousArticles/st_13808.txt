Although ? in the aftermath of the controversy ? Bryant would make it to three more NBA Finals , winning two consecutively , the impact of the allegations has loomed like a shadow over the rest of his playing career . Bryant himself has said that the scandal contributed to his wife suffering a miscarriage , and he called the allegations a turning point ? in his life . I lost sight of what is the most important thing , and that s family , he said in Kobe Bryant s Muse , a Showtime documentary which aired earlier this year . ? It s the man s job to protect your family . It s the man s job to look out for your family . It s the man s job to always be the anchor of stability for your family . From that aspect , I failed miserably . Bryant is still married to his first wife and has two daughters .
