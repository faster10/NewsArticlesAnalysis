The BJP ' s other fear is that the fifth phase of polling , held on Thursday , may have gone to the Mahagathbandhan . In this round , nearly 60 percent of the voters ? ? the highest figure recorded in this election ? ? came out to vote . Since the 57 seats in this round were in areas considered strongholds of the Mahagathbandhan because of a large number of Muslims and Yadavs , the record turnout indicates aggressive voting in favour of Nitish Kumar ' s alliance . In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls , even at its peak , the NDA had led in just 17 out of these 57 constituencies . Its vote share was nearly 17 percent less than that of Mahagathbandhan . A high turnout combined with the failure of Pappu Yadav and Asaduddin Owaisi to split the anti BJP vote could lead to the Mahagathbandhan ' s dominance of this round .
