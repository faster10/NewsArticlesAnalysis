But by far the most challenging role I was ever tasked with undertaking was that of a sylph or an " invisible being of the air " in a ballet called " Les Sylphides . " The ballet is non narrative there is no plot . My character ' s motivation was therefore mine to create . I imagined her a malnourished Ukrainian runaway who came to America and discovered the simple pleasures of Capri Sun and " The Simpsons . " She would return to her homeland one day , but not before she got her bachelor ' s degree and some much needed dental work . Externally , she was sweet and vulnerable , but inside she was tough as nails . The part was only four measures long , but I made the most of it .
