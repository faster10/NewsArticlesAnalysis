CHRIS CHRISTIE hasn ' t won a thing and he ' s surviving on a string . But with Jersey kid style he ' s ready to rumble in the Granite State . Christie ' s plays are well scripted challenges to the media , to make Marco answer for his flips on immigration and to give us just one example of a Rubio executive decision . " He ' s the boy in the bubble , " blurts the guv , a Trump like ping on Rubio ' s short stature and resume . And as for Hillary , Christie wants to remind us that there ' s a new sheriff , er prosecutor , in New Hampshire . " Ill beat her read end , " he promises , dashing more gas on emailgate .
