WHAT WE DON ' T KNOW : Did his encounter with the Were Monster restore Mulder ' s belief in jackalopes and other mind boggling creatures ? Will Mulder adopt " Foxman " as his new nickname ? Did Scully save Mulder ' s " I Want to Believe " poster when the FBI closed the X Files or did she buy a copy at the same online store where Mulder evidently purchased the " X Files " theme song as his theme song for his smartphone ? Did Scully adopt Daggoo the dog ? We know Mulder read at least four of Charles Fort ' s tomes , including " The Book of the Damned , " but did he read one of Fort ' s best short stories , " The Giant , The Insect , and the Philanthropic looking Old Gentleman , " too ?
