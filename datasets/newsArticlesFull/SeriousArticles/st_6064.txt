BEN CARSON THINKS THERE ' S A STAR OF DAVID ON THE DOLLAR BILL . ( THERE ' S NOT ) . Addressing the Republican Jewish Coalition Thursday , Republican presidential candidate Dr Ben Carson told a story about how the Star of David came to be on the U . S . dollar bill . Only one problem : There ' s no Star of David on the dollar bill . Carson was telling the story of wealthy Jewish merchant Haym Salomon , who , according to folklore , is said to have been a major financier of George Washington ' s troops during the Revolutionary War . " Salomon gave all his funds to save the U . S . Army and , some say , no one knows for sure , that ' s the reason there ' s a Star of David on the back of the one dollar bill , " Carson said in Washington , D . C . There is a conspiracy theory that a design of stars arranged above the eagle on the U . S . seal printed on the bill forms a Jewish star and that this was done as a way to thank Solomon for his generosity . ABC ' s JORDYN PHELPS reports that the Numismatic Bibliomania Society ' s Wayne Homren says there ' s no evidence to suggest any truth to support the theory that the stars were intentionally arranged to represent the Jewish star , let alone that it was done in Salomon ' s name . http : abcn . ws 1XD4jl4
