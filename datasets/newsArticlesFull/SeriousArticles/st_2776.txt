Trump told TODAY ' s Savannah Guthrie he hasn ' t discussed the possibility of Sarah Palin being his running mate ? but there " certainly would be a role somewhere in the administration " for her if he was elected . " I haven ' t discussed anything with her about what she ' d do , but she ' s somebody I really like and I respect , and certainly she could play a position if she wanted to , " Trump said of the former Alaska governor , who threw her backing behind the real estate mogul on Tuesday . While Trump insisted he hasn ' t considered vice presidential candidates yet , he said he doubts Palin would be interested because " she ' s been through that , " referring to her role as the 2008 running mate of Sen . John McCain . Trump hopes Palin ' s formal backing , the highest profile endorsement yet for the Republican front runner , could provide the boost he needs to distance himself from rival Ted Cruz . The Texas senator has been his closest competitor in numerous polls in Iowa , which will hold the nation ' s first presidential primary contest on Feb . 1 : MSNBC
