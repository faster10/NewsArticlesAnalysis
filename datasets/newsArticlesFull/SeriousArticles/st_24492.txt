" It ' s looking more like it , " said Sean Yokota , head of Asia strategy for Scandinavian bank SEB in Singapore , when asked whether China ' s action raised the risk of a ' currency war ' , or competitive currency devaluations .

" They are probably already not intervening as much on FX weakness as CNY moves , " he added , referring to other Asian central banks .
