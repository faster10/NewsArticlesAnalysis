With " The Walking Dead , " I wanted to focus on the opposite of that . I wanted to let the apocalyptic events unfold naturally . I try to focus on the actors ' performance and try to support them . They ' re the ones who react they are us . When Rick crawls out of the hospital for the first time among all the bodies , the music given what he ' s seen and probably smelled at that time is pretty reserved . And that I think also heightens the tension . Horror is a particularly tricky genre for television . It ' s hard enough to scare an audience and keep them on the edge of their seat for two hours . You really have to pull out a lot of tricks to do that . We ' re on hour 50 of " The Walking Dead " and these producers are keeping people on their toes , and keeping things fresh and keeping it scary . So a subtle approach helps that , because when you have a really long duration story , you want to conserve your energy as much as possible .
