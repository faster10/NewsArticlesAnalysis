My life has been affected a lot more than I thought it would be . I shan t delve into a sob story , or complain about my situation because I deal with it like I deal with everything else that goes on . But I will say that when I am out in public people don t see me they see the scarf wrapped on my head and that for them that is enough . I get glances in my direction , a sigh as someone walks passed and every now and then an intense stare . I don t mind it , but being ostracised for being a Muslim isn t great . It makes me feel impure , vulnerable and worst of all a victim . I do not want to feel like a victim nor feel victimised . I want to weep for those whose innocent souls have passed , not for myself .
