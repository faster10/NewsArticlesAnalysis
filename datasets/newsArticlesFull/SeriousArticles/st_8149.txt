Some Southern states , like Florida , South Carolina , and Texas , have not only passed legislation restricting the right to vote , but also have refused to comply with their responsibilities under the VRA . The law requires certain states with histories of voting discrimination to submit any change in election law to the U . S . Department of Justice for " preclearance " before it can be implemented . Because these states for so long flaunted an obstinate refusal to allow African Americans equal access to the voting booth , the VRA requires they demonstrate that new changes will not have a discriminatory effect .
