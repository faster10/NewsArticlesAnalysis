Gahan : Not at all . I think that ' s because Martin Gore and I shake from the same hip as well . In the past , especially in the " Violator " and " Songs of Faith and Devotion " period , I felt like Martin was writing songs about me or for me . He wasn ' t really I was younger then . But we had those same doubts , and quite often seemed to experience the same weird , dark sense of humor . " Presence of God " is really that understanding that sometimes when you step out of your own shoes and just open your ears and listen to what ' s going on around you , you get answers to the questions you were asking . The title " The Light the Dead See " works so well because sometimes when you ' re still and not trying to steer things in a certain way is really when the magic can happen . It ' s when I ' m trying to figure that out for myself that I get into all kinds of trouble .
