Pelletier ' s sources said that Cherif Kouachi was already under some form of control order in France at the time . He had previously served a prison sentence , after being convicted of terror offenses in 2008 for being part of a recruitment network for al Qaeda in Iraq . But the control order had been placed on him after he was implicated in a plot to break an Algerian terrorist from prison . Pelletier said it was not clear what type of control order he was under . Some require the surrender of passports , while others require regularly reporting to designated officials .
