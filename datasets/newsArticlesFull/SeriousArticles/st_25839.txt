The veneer of fractured ice over the Arctic Ocean is changing , disintegrating before my eyes . Over the last twenty years more than 5000 kilometers of ice has passed beneath my skis during numerous expeditions to both poles , as well as treks across Greenland , Spitsbergen , Iceland , Ellesmere Island and the Patagonian Icecap . Add to this multiple voyages and flights to both Antarctica and the Arctic and I have come to feel part of the polar landscape . I ' ve developed somewhat of a polar sense , and I sense there is something afoot that I don ' t much like .
