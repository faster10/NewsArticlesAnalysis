He s a mirror for me , an idol , awesome player . I ve enjoyed my time on court with you . Obviously just watching the video and hearing those great players talk about you in that light was pretty emotional . On the other side of the net , Hewitt was confounded , unable to offer a response to Karlovic s game , built around the power of his serve . He was combative , never afraid to wave his fist in celebration , let out one of his guttural c mons or , when really amped , pull the cord on his imaginary lawnmower . The second round match between Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and L Hewitt s comments were thought by many to be racist in nature . But love him or hate him ? and make no mistake , public opinion was split ? Hewitt was a genuine battler .
