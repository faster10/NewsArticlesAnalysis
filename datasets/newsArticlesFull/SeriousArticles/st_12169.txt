It is time to recognize an independent Kurdish state . A Kurdish nation already exists and a new Kurdish political entity , freed from its long but uneasy association with Baghdad , could be an important political counterweight in the region . A Kurdish state , taking land from eastern Syria and primarily from the Kurdish regions of Iraq , would be able to sustain itself not simply on oil revenue but also as legitimate center for regional trade and technology . A Kurdish state could take pressure off the Kurdish question in Turkey ( and perhaps in Iran ) if the international community made it clear that independence was conditional on clearly defined borders and the opportunity for migration by ethnic Kurds , if they chose , to the new Kurdish state . A Kurdish state would be a strong U . S . ally and could also partner with Israel , Jordan , and more moderate Arab and Central Asian countries due to its cosmopolitan Sunni majority and could likely find a rapprochement with Turkey and the Assad regime .
