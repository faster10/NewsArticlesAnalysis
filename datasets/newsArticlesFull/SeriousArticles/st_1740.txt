Britain is entering a war against the self declared " Islamic State " , probably the most dangerous and violent organisation in the world , but without a realistic policy to win that war . Mr Cameron stresses the limited nature of the engagement , but Britain will be fighting a state that is also a ferocious sect , does not negotiate and may well retaliate with some atrocity similar to Paris . This is not an argument for rejecting military action against Isis , but it is one for thinking very carefully what we are doing because the only exit strategy will be military victory .
