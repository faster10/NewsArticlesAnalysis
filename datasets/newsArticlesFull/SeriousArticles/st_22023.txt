There was a cue in " The Walking Dead " in the third season , the fourth episode , a major character died . I ' m a bit of a method actor when I write , I can ' t write music for a scene without completely taking myself to this emotion and trying to channel my feelings into music . When people watched it , they were gutted and heartbroken when they saw this scene . I had to watch it probably 70 times . I would be weeping sometimes , my stomach hurt . I was truly miserable doing that scene . But the key turned out pretty good and moved people . Those sort of scenes are not fun to do . The process is not my idea of a good time , but the rewards are much higher .
