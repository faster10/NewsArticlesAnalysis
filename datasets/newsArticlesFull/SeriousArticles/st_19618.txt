It ' s possible , if not likely , that Spectre is the first chapter in a very , very loose rendition of that Ian Fleming arc . Spectre ends with Blofeld alive , on the verge of incarceration , while Bond drives off into the sunset with Madeleine Swann ( L a Seydoux ) ? the daughter of Mr White ( Jesper Christensen ) , a Spectre agent Bond first went toe to toe with in Casino Royale . If this is Daniel Craig ' s final outing as 007 , as he has hinted in several promotional interviews , it ' s an uncharacteristically happy sendoff . But if Craig returns in the role , it ' s easy to imagine the next Bond film doing its own version of the On Her Majesty ' s Secret Service story , with a bloodthirsty 007 seeking revenge on a Blofeld who manages to have Madeleine killed .
