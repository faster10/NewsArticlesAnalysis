I don ' t have a problem with the story per se . Carson claimed he got a full scholarship records show he didn ' t . That s newsworthy and good reporting by Politico ' s Kyle Cheney . But I don ' t like the breathless packaging . ( The headline says " fabrication , " which is a strong , accusatory word . ) And I really don ' t like the reaction I m seeing . It seems way out of proportion to the alleged wrongdoing here . This is still a developing story , obviously . Carson s character is the core of his appeal , so that makes his biography a worthwhile subject of discussion . For now , though , I can t get too worked up about what Carson did or didn t say about West Point .
