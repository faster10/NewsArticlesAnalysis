Trump s status is less that of an outsider than a celebrity game show host who s been lofted on the winds of gushing , constant , media coverage . Ted Cruz has staked his campaign in Iowa , and the sudden turn by some in talk radio from cheerleading for Trump to cheerleading for Cruz hasn t hurt his prospects . Neither man has fans outside their fan clubs , and I expect the winds to blow in Marco Rubio s favor hard and fast if the Trump Cruz bromance ends in the political version of a murder suicide .
