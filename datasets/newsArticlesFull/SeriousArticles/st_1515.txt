ABOUT THE SEAHAWKS ( 4 5 ) : Seattle likely squandered any chance of winning another division title when it fell into a 19 0 hole and failed to dig its way out against the Cardinals last week , but a wild card spot remains a possibility if the defense can turn things around . The Seahawks are 0 5 this season when allowing 25 points or more , and were ripped for a total of 66 in their last two home games . This is a real important week for us to bounce and come back to playing football like we like , Seattle coach Pete Carroll told reporters . We re really disappointed in the way we went out last week , as we started that thing we were off . So it s really important to us to get this thing going and have a good week of work .
