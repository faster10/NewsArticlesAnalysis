You don ' t have to be a First Amendment purist to intuit that political speech was , if anything , the most urgent subcategory covered by the First Amendment ' s " Congress shall pass no law " restrictions . And you don ' t have to be a Hillary hater to imagine the shoe on the other foot . What if MoveOn . org ' s 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , Campaign to Defend America , had been blocked by George W . Bush ' s Federal Elections Commission from broadcasting " McCain : The Movie " ? Wouldn ' t that stink , too ?
