Golden State would prefer their superstar recalibrates the challenge . Though Curry can score efficiently in isolation situations , the Warriors are focused on conserving his energy , getting him the easiest attempts possible . When blanketed by a larger player like Leonard , he ' ll often move the ball and work through some screens , counting on the defense to destabilize . It works because Curry is great at this , and because the Warriors are replete with perceptive playmakers such as Draymond Green , Andre Iguodala , Shaun Livingston and Andrew Bogut .
