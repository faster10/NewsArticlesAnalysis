Mark Ruffalo is the third actor to play Bruce Banner Hulk in the past decade , and even though the soft spoken star would seem to have the longest fuse ( when we first see him he ' s tending to the sick in an Indian slum ) he ' s immediately both more dangerous and more fun than either Edward Norton or Eric Bana in the same role . Whedon gives him a long build up . For the first hour of the movie we ' re invited to speculate along with his new allies just how much havoc Banner ' s rampaging id might cause . Then the leash comes off !
