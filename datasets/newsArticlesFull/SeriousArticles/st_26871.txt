" Right now , you are kind of torn in terms of how much you want to see ( politicians ) do . Obama , right now , has to lay the framework for the future , but can ' t get a whole lot done . Again , I don ' t want to see the various presidential candidates get pushed into positions that they can ' t come back from , " Whitman said . " I mean you don ' t want to see Hillary ( Clinton ) pushed so far left that she would rule out something like nuclear energy , but she ' ll have a lot of Democrats pressuring her to do that . On the right , it ' s the same you have people saying they don ' t believe in climate change . You will find yourselves at the end of the day where we just can ' t move forward and that is not where we want to be . "
