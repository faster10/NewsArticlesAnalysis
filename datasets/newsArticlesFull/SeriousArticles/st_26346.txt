Ronda Rousey s fight against Holly Holm took a shocking turn . You do not want your champion sitting home or making a movie , Roadhouse 2 or whatever Rousey s going to do , or just needs a personal break , which she s earned . I appreciate the concerns about my health , but I am fine . As I have mentioned before , I m going to take a little bit of time but I ll be back . The second is the ( un ? ) intentional burn that Floyd can t help but slide in , noting that he s never lost so he can t relate to Rousey . Despite massive underdog status , Holm stopped Rousey early in the second round ? with a left high kick and a couple punches on the floor .
