When the GOP gathers in Cleveland on July 18 , the party will welcome about 2 , 470 ? delegates . Of these , 168 will be selected by party leaders ? representing Republican stalwarts in Congress , legislatures ? and the national committee . Trump remains unpopular with this group , requiring a solid majority of the 2 , 302 or so other delegates to be selected in caucuses and primaries . The challenge for him is that ? 60 of these crucial conventioneers will be selected in proportional , ? not winner take all contests . ? In proportional primaries and caucuses , any candidate ? with 20 of the vote ( or ? in some cases , even lower thresholds ) gets a share of the state s delegates .
