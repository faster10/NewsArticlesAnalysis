" Television has changed . It ' s not what it was like 50 years ago . Light entertainment is no longer the expensive quality that it used to be . It ' s all quiz games , reality TV and talk shows . Talk shows these days are just cheap TV . In the same way that reality TV is cheap television that humiliates people . There ' s no point saying there can ' t be any humiliation , because the public seem to respond to it , it seems to be something they want . But then again the public liked mass executions as well but we don ' t do those any more . To be honest , I don ' t know where we go from here . "
