I teach about Dr Martin Luther King . I teach about the civil rights movement and movements for human rights around the world , Hagopian said . I m asked to go into that classroom and teach the youth about democracy and teach the youth about how their voice can make a difference in improving the world . And yet when I come out to raise my voice for those very demands , I m met with an unaccountable police force that is willing to brutalize citizens in this city who want to honor the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King by struggling for social justice .
