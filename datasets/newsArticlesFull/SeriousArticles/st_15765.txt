Yes , the public tends to forgive these things after a while . Then again , I don ' t recall getting overly upset about the sniper controversy , either . But now we re getting to a longstanding beef I have with media coverage of campaigns . Personal biographical details get incredibly close scrutiny and policy details do not . The West Point story is splashed across the top of Politico right now and , on MSNBC , hosts are asking whether he can survive this episode . Meanwhile , during the CNBC debate , he denied that his tax scheme would blow a huge hole in the deficit and the media is like . . . whatever . Personally , I ' d prefer more focus on substance and policy and less on personality and character .
