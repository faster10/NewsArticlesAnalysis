ABOUT KANSAS ( 12 1 , 1 0 ) : Wayne Selden Jr . ( 15 . 5 points ) took over the team scoring lead with a 24 point outburst against the Bears mostly on the strength of 5 of 6 shooting beyond the arc ( the Jayhawks went 11 of 19 as a team ) . " His confidence is through the roof and he is shooting the ball extremely well , so that is allowing him to attack the basket easier because opponents are closing out on him . He is getting into the paint and finishing more because of his size , " Kansas sophomore guard Devonte ' Graham said . Graham matched his season high of 15 points in the rout but has been doing a bit of everything for the Jayhawks lately , tallying 21 assists , 11 steals and only three turnovers over his last six games .
