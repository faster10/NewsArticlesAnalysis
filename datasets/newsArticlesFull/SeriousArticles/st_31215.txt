Sunday night debates : Let ' s call the Democratic debate schedule what it is : ridiculous . A Saturday debate just before Christmas . A Sunday night debate just before a federal holiday . No debate from now until AFTER the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary . Seriously ? Say what you will about the Republican National Committee ' s attempts to influence the debate calendar . It pales in comparison to the travesty the Democratic National Committee has made of its own debates . Period .
