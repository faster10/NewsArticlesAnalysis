A troop surge may mean that even more of my friends will be widows and more of their children will be fatherless . It certainly means more Little League teams in my community will be missing a coach , more families here will know each other only on Skype and more pets will be abandoned . It may very well mean that I will spend more years being both mother and father , and that I ' ll have more conversations with my children about why their daddy is always gone when so many daddies never leave . These are not things to celebrate .
