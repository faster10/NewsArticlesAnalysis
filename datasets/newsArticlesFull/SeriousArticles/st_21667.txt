Buffalo Bills : Rex Ryan said this week the Bills will need to be a zillion times better Monday night in New England than they were in Week 2 against the Patriots , when the Bills trailed by 24 points by the end of the third quarter and allowed more than 500 total yards . Holding the Patriots to fewer yards will be one task , but winning the turnover battle will be another . Ryan cited a statistic that the Patriots are 62 1 with Tom Brady at quarterback when they win the turnover battle at home . In other words , don t expect the Bills to win unless Brady makes a few mistakes , and he has rarely messed up this season . Patriots 31 , Bills 20 . Mike Rodak
