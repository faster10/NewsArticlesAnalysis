So far this season : Consecutive losses to the Chiefs and Colts ( 27 24 in Week 9 ) has created a predictable surge of unease in Denver . And the move to shelve Manning opens the door for even greater uncertainty in the weeks ahead .

There is no question that they have a Super Bowl caliber defense . And even without Manning , there s enough firepower on offense to keep the wins coming .
