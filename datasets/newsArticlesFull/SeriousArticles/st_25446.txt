Of course , the UAE perceived Iran s hegemony and expansionist strategy in the region with alarm , though limited media coverage of the war skirted Tehran s brazen activities . Coalition members accused Iran of militarily and financially supporting Al Houthis , backed by John Kerry , the US Secretary of State , who recognised that there were obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran even while he and his team were negotiating in earnest with Tehran to reach an agreement over the latter s nuclear programme . In fact , Iran dispatched dozens of flights before hostilities broke , providing Al Houthis with weapons . Not surprisingly , Iran denied these claims , though government troops in Aden said that they captured two officers who belonged to the Iranian Quds Force in early April , presumed military advisers to Al Houthi militias in the city . The claim was not repeated and the officers were kept in abeyance , which buttressed the argument that Al Houthis were not just an Iranian proxy force , even if reliable assertions surfaced that Iran shipped weapons to the Al Houthis between 2009 and 2013 . Whether fresh supplies reached Yemen after 2013 was a hotly debated issue although the over militarised Yemeni society was never shy of arms .
