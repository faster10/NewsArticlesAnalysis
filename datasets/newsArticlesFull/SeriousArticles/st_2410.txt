Violence plays a major role in the impetus of Syrians to leave their homes and flee their increasingly dangerous country , but Shelly Pitterman of the UNHCR said perhaps the main trigger for flight is the humanitarian funding shortfall . In recent months , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) cut its program by as much as 40 . The current Syrian Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan for 2015 is only 41 funded . The UNHCR expects to receive just 47 of the funding it needs for Syria in the next year .
