Trayvon Martin couldn ' t give his side of the story , leaving ample room for reasonable doubt . More importantly , under Florida law , it ' s perfectly legal to follow someone for even the worst of reasons , confront them , and even start a fight with them . Then when you lose the advantage to the point where you believe you ' re in danger of " great bodily harm , " you can shoot the other person dead . The law forgives , whether forgiveness is deserved or not . Zimmerman could have had the soul of Martin Luther King or Bull Connor , and it wouldn ' t have made a difference to whether he was innocent or guilty under this law .
