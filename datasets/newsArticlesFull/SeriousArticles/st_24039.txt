There was no fire involved in this crash however there was air bag deployment , which to the untrained eye can appear as if the vehicle is enveloped in smoke , Walpole police said in a statement . The officers on scene did indicate one of the vehicles did have a broken window . The operator of that vehicle did make statements to one officer that a male party kicked in my window , I think he was a patriot . This was not entered into the report as this was a standard motor vehicle crash report with no injury .
