The Patriots didn t bother trying to run the ball the first time around , with Tom Brady dropping back to pass 61 times and the Patriots calling just 12 handoffs . The Bills have some decent cornerbacks in Stephon Gilmore , Ronald Darby , and Nickell Robey ( who tend to stick to one side of the field but are capable of matching up ) , but Brady negated the pass rush and devastated the Bills back seven with a ton of quick passes , completing 38 of 59 for a whopping 466 yards , with three touchdowns and no interceptions .
