Jennifer Lawrence ' s nomination for best actress might be a stretch , as she was the protagonist in a film that received only a 60 percent favorable rating on the critics ' aggregator , website Rotten Tomatoes . Perhaps being a three time nominee ( she won in 2013 for " Silver Linings Playbook " ) makes the 25 year old a safe choice . A more adventurous and deserving candidate might have been Julianne Moore for " Freeheld , " another movie to which critics gave a collective " meh , " but not because of her powerful performance . Other best actress nominees include , in addition to Larson , likely favorite Cate Blanchett for " Carol " ( another movie that could have easily been added to the best picture category ) , Saorsie Ronan for " Brooklyn " and Charlotte Rampling for " 45 Years .
