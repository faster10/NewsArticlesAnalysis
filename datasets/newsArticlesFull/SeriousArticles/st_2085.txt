" I think Ken and Roger have a lot in common , " said Tony Roche , an Australian who played with and against Rosewall and later coached Federer . " Their games weren ' t the most physical types of games . It all came pretty easy for both of them . Ken got through without any major injuries , and so has Roger , which , when you consider the amount of tennis he has played , is incredible , really . " But it ' s got a lot to do with the way they hit the ball . Ken was so smooth and fluid with everything that he did , so that obviously helped him , I think , with being able to play into his 40s .
