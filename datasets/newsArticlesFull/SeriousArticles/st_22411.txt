( HA ) : I ' m surprised about these talks . We know these talks were more serious six months ago . But after the crisis I think most of the sovereign wealth funds , which have helped in the United States and elsewhere in Europe , this has been welcomed by the government . They are talking about this fund coming from a different space , from another space , and taking over the market . First of all , we are not politically ambitious to play a role in these companies . We do not want to take over companies . Maybe some , but not all .
