Cook had the same effect on Michigan State in 2013 . The team s offense had sputtered the entire previous season , and the quarterback position was unsettled going into the following fall . Cook got the nod to open the season but was pulled late in a Week 4 loss at Notre Dame . It wasn t until the following game ironically , in Iowa in the last meeting between these teams that the coaching staff fully committed to Cook . He rewarded them by throwing for 277 yards and two touchdowns in a 26 14 win . The Spartans did not lose another game that season .
