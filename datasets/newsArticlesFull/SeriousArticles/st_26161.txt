The operation to right the Concordia is the biggest maritime salvage exercise ever undertaken with 111 divers working in shifts 24 hours a day from a floating accommodation support vessel tethered next to the wreck . They are helping to deposit 18 , 000 tons of concrete beneath the hull to stabilize it before it is carefully rolled upright in the summer . Huge " sponson " flotation tanks are being prepared that will act like children ' s water wings to give the ship buoyancy and massive metal frames anchored to the granite seabed will become vital crutches to support the hull . The sponsons will then be pressurized with air and the Costa Concordia should then float , enabling experts to tow it to the mainland to be cut up for scrap metal something that couldn ' t have been done on the water , for fear it would lead to devastating pollution of this national park . But even if this ambitious salvage is successful , it still will have taken almost two years to remove the wreck .
