It would not be a surprise to see the Texans lean heavily on the quick passing game , because the offensive line may struggle to hold the Chiefs pass rushers at bay . Houston placed starting left tackle Duane Brown on injured reserve Monday because of a quad injury he suffered in a vicious collision against the Jaguars , which is a bad break considering they must now face a defensive front that should have star edge rushers Justin Houston and Tamba Hali back in the fold . Chris Clark ( 6 5 , 305 ) will fill Brown s spot , and he will need to step up in a big way ? he s a better run blocker than pass blocker ? especially if the Texans interior linemen again have a difficult time blocking the likes of end Allen Bailey and nose tackle Jaye Howard , who combined for three sacks in the first meeting between the teams . Keep an eye on Su a Filo , the left guard , who has struggled in pass protection this season , and Newton , the right tackle who struggled against Houston in the first game , yielding a sack that led to a fumble and a hurry that led to an interception .
