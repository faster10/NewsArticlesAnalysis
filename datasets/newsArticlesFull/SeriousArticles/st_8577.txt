Although we parents can ' t control everything that happens in our kids ' lives , we can do a lot to help them build inner security , confidence and a strong inner moral compass that will guide them through challenges they will face when we are no longer there . And our schools should build on this foundation . We should insist that our schools address not just academics , but the whole child so that all our children can become healthy and strong and enter adulthood as responsible and caring citizens .
