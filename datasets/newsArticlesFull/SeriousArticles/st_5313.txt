Beyond the demographic argument , though , the next week will be a turbulent one for the Democrats . Clinton has long almost conceded New Hampshire to Sanders ( call it the " favorite son next door " advantage ) , but she knows that losing Iowa would be a much more major blow to her campaign . If she loses Iowa and New Hampshire to Sanders , the whole race changes , because the argument " Bernie can ' t actually get anyone to vote for him " will be obliterated . On the Democratic side , Nevada will follow New Hampshire , and Nevada is always somewhat of a tossup ( for some reason , very little polling is ever done in Nevada , making predictions almost impossible ) . Even if Clinton holds on to South Carolina , if she loses the first three contests she ' s not going to look very inevitable anymore , meaning voters in other states will be giving Bernie Sanders a long and serious second look . While the Clinton camp openly calls South Carolina her " firewall " ( which may indeed be true , heading into a mostly Southern Super Tuesday ) , I ' m sure Team Clinton would be much happier if Iowa turned out to be her first win .
