ISIS is the thing bin Laden s al Qaeda never managed to become : a true movement . It inspires volunteers . The source of that inspiration likely depends on the individual . The group s apocalyptic , end times theology may convince some . Many others may hark to the group s dynamism ? it s actually fighting and holding ground , not drifting , as many Muslims say their global community has been since the last acknowledged Caliphate was destroyed , along with the Ottoman Empire that maintained it , at the close of World War I . When he established his Caliphate in June 2014 , ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi s call to arms appealed to that sense of aggrievement that has bedeviled Muslim politics since : So rush O Muslims and gather around your khalifa caliphate , so that you may return as you once were for ages , kings of the earth and knights of war . Come so that you may be honored and esteemed , living as masters with dignity .
