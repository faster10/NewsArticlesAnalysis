We used to have a common set of theological ideas on which to draw , but our growing commitment to freedom of religion and a secular public sphere has meant such appeals today have little force . Claims that , say , all of us are created equal by God ? or that we have a special duty to the stranger and the poor ? have no special authority . We used to be able to appeal to the words and ideas of our Founding Fathers , but in an era of sensitivity to race , gender and colonialism these are also anything but authoritative .
