We collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C . who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies . Their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass media conversations . These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well ! Instead of the usual negative views I ' m too fat or I don ' t like my nose these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs . It ' s refreshing . Their story was a huge success and got over 5 , 000 shares .
