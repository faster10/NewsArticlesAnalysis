That s too bad , though . Mad Max isn t just a fun movie that is ? extraordinarily well made . It s an experimental movie ? that has a lot to say about the art of film making itself : What makes movies work and what draws audiences to them . It s a blockbuster film that doesn t talk down to its audience . It s a live action cartoon , and yet the characters all feel ultimately very human and their stories linger with you . It doesn t have a bear attacking Leonardo di Caprio , but still , Mad Max is ? a singular achievement , one that should be recognized by the Academy .
