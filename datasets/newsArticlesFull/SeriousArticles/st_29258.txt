MOORE : It ' s a little unclear , but I think the point is that if you look at what the authorities have done in Indonesia in recent years , the last major terrorist attack was 2009 when two luxury hotels in Jakarta were attacked . Since then , the authorities work very hard with the FBI and U . S . , with authorities in other countries to crack down on terrorist cells . They ' ve killed a number of extremist leaders . They have arrested a number of other people , and they have been very successful . And any terrorist activity in recent years has really been very limited to local areas , and the police have been a target .
