The try they organised at the start of the second half was , by some distance , the best thing in the entire game . There was Pat Lambie ' s elegant chip beyond English cover , there was Willie le Roux , striding on to clutch the ball from the air and making swiftly adequate ground , there was his subtle off load to Cobus Reinach , and there was the controlled sprint to the line , culminating in a sprawl without a white shirt in sight . It was quite glorious , and the fact that it carried them to a 20 6 advantage seemed to have concluded the argument .
