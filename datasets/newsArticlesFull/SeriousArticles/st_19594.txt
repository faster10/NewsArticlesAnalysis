Tony was born in the aftermath of World War I . He was an airman in World War II , and often talked about his experience . He lost a brother in that war , but also saw it as a watershed , marking no return to the unemployment and fascism of the 1930s . As he said , the young conscripted troops became radicalized by the war , arguing that if there could be full employment in wartime , so there could be full employment in peacetime to build houses , hospitals , schools and all the other things people needed . He was Labour all his life , campaigning for the 1945 landslide , but in the last part of his life his main activity was outside Labour ' s structures .
