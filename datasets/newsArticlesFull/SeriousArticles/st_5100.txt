Thursday ' s game took a little while to turn into a disaster , and it became a disaster on both sides of the ball . The Eagles missed a 50 yard field goal on their first possession , but Detroit was forced to punt , and it looked like a pair of average teams that would slug it out artlessly all day . But the Eagles defense couldn ' t pressure quarterback Matt Stafford , and the Lions would score on their next six possessions , moving out to a 38 7 lead before having to punt again in the final minute of the third quarter .
