Nicholson added : At this current juncture you might think there could be a pause on the renminbi weakening next week or perhaps for a couple of weeks . But at some point down the line they are going to restart it and maybe at the next point when they do it it is a one off major devaluation . It s anyone s guess when that could occur but certainly in the short term in that event it would be a crisis for equities and global economies . But probably over the longer term might be a far preferable outcome than this steady devaluation and increased panic that we are seeing at the moment .
