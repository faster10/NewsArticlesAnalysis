The experts reckon Klitschko is just nudging ahead now , but it ' s very tight . Klitschko , either riled or growing in confidence , begins to hurl a few works back in Fury ' s direction as the Brit lands a one two and opens up a second cut , this one above Klitschko ' s left eye . Fury ' s hands go behind his back again and , again , Klitschko refuses to throw the punch . Now , I ' m not the world ' s greatest expert , but I feel like Klitschko might have to punch his opponent a few times if he ' s going to win this . Fury 10 9 is my call on that .
