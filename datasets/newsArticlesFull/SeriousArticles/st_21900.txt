Netflix beat out HBO in terms of total nominations with seven that include nods for actors like Robin Wright in House of Cards , Uzo Aduba in Orange is the New Black and Aziz Ansari for Master of None ? The show is great , and has earned ? both critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base . Ansari absolutely deserves recognition for his writing on the show . But the acting nomination seems a little misplaced , because Ansari pretty much plays a version of ? himself . Then again , ? Ansari himself is insanely likable ? which we re ? now rewarding him for . It s a perfect example of how awards shows reinforce our social hierarchies by rewarding ? figures already in public favor . In many ways they serve as a parade of the popular kids in high school , despite the Golden Globes ? pointed apathy towards Mad Men . ( Maybe Mad Men is more like the understatedly stylish kid , cooly smoking in the bathroom and far too busy to be in the homecoming court . )
