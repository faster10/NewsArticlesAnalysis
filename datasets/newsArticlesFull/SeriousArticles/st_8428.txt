The big release of the latest National Review edition , with a cover declaring Against Trump , on Thursday night was above all other things a wonderful gift not just to liberals , but anyone who lives outside of the conservative tribe . Because it ? gives us a glimpse , however temporary , of what it feels like to be a Trump supporter . ? I defy readers to take one look at the cover and not feel an overwhelming surge of contempt for these establishment conservatives who love to pander to the camo crowd when it suits them , but get fussy when the rubes rise up and start demanding real skin in the game . You want to rub their smug little faces right in Donald Trump s ridiculous hair and ask how they like those apples .
