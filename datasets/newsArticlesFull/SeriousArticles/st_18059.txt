For so long I had measured my beauty ( and , really , my worth ) by my dress size . And , hey , I would love , I mean love , to be a size 6 again . Still , every time I give a lecture or teach a workshop and touch someone or write a page and reach a deeper part of myself I feel so useful and relevant . It translates to a more profound feeling of beauty than the rush I once got from someone admiring my breast size . I like superficial praise as much as the next person , but at 40 the love finally had to go deeper , didn ' t it ?
