Do the Chiefs have their long term replacement for Jamaal Charles ? Charles will be healthy enough to play again next season after his knee injury . But the Chiefs can t and won t leave themselves without an alternative to a running back who has a lot of wear and tear , had surgeries on both knees in his career for torn ACLs and will turn 30 next season . They need to determine whether that player is on their roster . Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware have done an admirable job of filling in for Charles , but are they good enough to carry the Chiefs for another season , if need be ? Knile Davis is clearly not this player , even though the Chiefs drafted him in 2013 for that reason . He was passed on the depth chart by West and Ware this season .
