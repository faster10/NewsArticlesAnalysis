2 ) ? Bulls execute better than Spurs down stretch ( you read that right ) , pick up big win . ? With two of the top six defenses in the Association coming into the game , you had to expect San Antonio Chicago was going to be ugly , gritty , and come down to execution in the clutch . Let s be honest , that sounds like a recipe for a Spurs win . But on Monday night all those things went the Bulls way ? Chicago ? didn t score a field goal the final six minutes of the game and still won 92 89 . The pairing of Pau Gasol and Nikola Mirotic played better defense than we d expect , and the Bulls as a team kept the Spurs from looking Spursian ? San Antonio was 2 of 14 from three and seemed to rely more on beating guys one on one ( specifically Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker ) than most games . The Bulls offense late is too much Derrick Rose and he can t carry a team like he once did ( although Butler couldn t do much do to Leonard s defense ) . But it was enough for one night ? this was a huge home win for the Bulls .
