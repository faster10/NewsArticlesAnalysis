Vic Walia , a spokesperson with Hotels . com , isn ' t concerned about a lack of accomodations , but does want the London or Rio bound to know that they ' ll have to contain their excitement for a few more years . " With London , right now we ' re only taking stuff through October 2010 , " Walia said , adding that Rio bookings are a long , long way off . " But , " he said , " we do have inventory in Rio now and we have an office in Brazil , and we ' re always adding new hotels to our network . By the time 2016 would rolls around , our hotel network should expand . "
