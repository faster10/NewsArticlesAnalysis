" Both were most comfortable around a coterie of close aides and friends ( like most presidents ) and largely shunned the Washington social scene . Both , I believe , detested Congress and resented having to deal with it , including members of their own party . And so , unfortunately , neither devoted much effort to wooing or even reaching out to individual members or trying to establish a network of allies , supporters or friends , " Gates writes . " They both had the worst of both worlds on the Hill : they were neither particularly liked nor feared . Accordingly , neither had many allies in Congress who were willing to go beyond party loyalty , self interest , or policy agreement in supporting them . "
