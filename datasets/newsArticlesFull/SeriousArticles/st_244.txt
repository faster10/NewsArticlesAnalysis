EPA hopes water transfer rule will ' hold water ' on appeal : Water lawyers are heading to court in New York City this morning where the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear arguments over an EPA rule exempting water moved between rivers and lakes from pollution permits . The 2008 water transfers rule stems from environmentalists efforts to stop dirty water from being pumped into Florida s Lake Okeechobee , but has big implications across the West , where communities and farmers rely on vast networks of canals and pipelines to shuttle water from a far away river to their local reservoir .
