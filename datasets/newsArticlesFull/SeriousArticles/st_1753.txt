But , as a Syrian , you can notice few details others perhaps won ' t see . For example : I don ' t need any " clarifications , explanations , justifications , or elaborations " on the reasons behind the death of Khan . I know the regime killed him because the pattern of events is so typical we can almost accurately predict the regime ' s next course of action when it comes to similar cases . Many regime officials have been assassinated in the last four decades and we were told that they committed suicide . You can also ask the Lebanese , for they can bear witness at the regime ' s skills in shooting somebody four times , then saying they did it to themselves .
