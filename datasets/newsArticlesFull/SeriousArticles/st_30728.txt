The endgame for cultivating that kind of classic pop canon can be found in the reunited Beach Boys . The band has a treasure trove of outright classics , and they performed what felt like all of them during their Sunday afternoon set . " Surfer Girl , " " Barbara Ann , " " Wouldn ' t It Be Nice , " " Sloop John B , " " Surfin ' Safari , " even " Kokomo " you name it , they probably played it . While that wasn ' t inherently surprising , what came as a bit of a shock was how fresh the band sounded even if its elder members didn ' t look the part both on their classics and on tunes from their recently released reunion LP , " That ' s Why God Made the Radio . " Brian Wilson ' s presence is what makes this reunion so successful , but onstage he looked like the Queen of England , sitting idly behind a grand piano and taking the occasional vocal lead Mike Love , meanwhile , seemed to be the main Beach Boy behind the wheel . Taken together with the afternoon ' s balmy weather and the day in the park vibe of festivalgoers knocking around beach balls and splaying out on towels , the group ' s sublime set was just the thing for a lazy , hungover Sunday .
