It was largely the NFL s strict television blackout policy that drove the Rams from L . A . to St . Louis at the end of 1994 , after 49 years in the West Coast city . The blackout rule stipulated that if a stadium was not sold out 72 hours prior to a game , it would not be televised in the city where the game was played . This was based on the idea that broadcasting a game would hurt attendance . Half of all NFL games were blacked out in the 1970s , according to ESPN . The Rams often struggled to draw enough fans to either of their L . A . homes ? the 90 , 000 capacity Coliseum ( 1946 1979 ) and later Anaheim Stadium ( 1980 1994 ) .
