I mean , you re talking about a campus that is 7 percent black and a football team that is 69 percent black . And you re talking about a school president ? and this ? doesn t make him different , special , evil or anything he s actually very ordinary ? who put a tremendous emphasis , financially and socially , on football . And ? this drove a lot of students , who feel that there are a lot of issues of systematic oppression on campus , to think , Oh , so this is the top priority ? To make sure we support the football team ?
