The clinic provides mental health assessments , linkage to proper care , and permanency planning . Counseling is made available for managing family issues and , if needed , substance abuse treatment . If a patient stops coming in for their scheduled appointments , a substance abuse counselor gets out into the community to find them , and the staff doesn ' t hesitate to involve the police and paramedics if they sense something is wrong . It ' s all part of the HIV clinic ' s larger role as a presence in the community , not just a department in the hospital .
