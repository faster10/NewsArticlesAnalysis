cmadatme I do blame him for his comments because he needs to be held accountable for his actions . You can blame the NFL all you want but it doesn t take away from what he did . As folks said , you don t need the pictures to know that what he did was reprehensible , all it did was gave it more credence . You sound like someone who wants to shift blame to everyone but the person who should be blamed . Hardy did something reprehensible and his comments and actions following were reprehensible . He should be held accountable .
