The NFL is making millions billions of dollars . These players are getting the tiniest percentage compared to what the league makes . Why worry about what these dudes are doing let them play . They re out there sacrificing their bodies and making the league they re money and getting little back . I m not gonna watch Rodger goodell play QB he makes poor choices as is . So if they want to support a loved one then let them . WHY DO YOU CARE NFL . oh wait because you aren t making money from it . The NFL is a big fat goodell joke .
