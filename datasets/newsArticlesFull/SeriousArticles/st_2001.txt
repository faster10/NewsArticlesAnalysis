I mean it as no slight to reality TV to say that true crime programming reminds me of Survivor or Top Chef those shows editors know that the firefighter from Boston or the sous chef from Detroit will end up winning the game , and structure revelations over the course of the season to make that outcome satisfying . Everything you see onscreen happened . But it might not be something you want to sign a petition over . Or maybe it might ! Either way ? in an era of greater than ever one upsmanship on social media and less than ever meaningful mixing of ideological opponents ? ambiguity is the thing that s falling out of fashion .
