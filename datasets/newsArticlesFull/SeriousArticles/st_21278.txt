I ' m not saying that all is well in the world I ' m really suggesting that we are in the midst of great global change . Much of this change is driven by good news people ' s desires for greater freedom and autonomy , new information technologies , etc . But all change is disruptive , and without the institutions of freedom and the civic culture of liberty , this period of transition can be dangerous . The forces of integration will not automatically triumph over the forces of disintegration . But there are many good forces out here that are also sweeping through the world these days .
