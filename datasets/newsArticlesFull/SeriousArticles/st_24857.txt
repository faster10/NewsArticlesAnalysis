The PM invoked Ambedkar , whom his party is accused of trying to appropriate , but also Nehru , whom the Congress attempts to own . He spoke of the contributions made by previous governments to India s journey and progress . He referred to what Sonia Gandhi had said in her speech ? about the Constitution being only as good or bad as those who implement it ? and recounted an anecdote in which Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad underlined that , offstage , political opponents can also be friends . The PM spoke of taking the constitutional spirit beyond Lok Sabha to the jan sabha , to the people . That Friday promise , of a more inclusive , less partisan politics , is very attractive . It should not be forgotten on Saturday .
