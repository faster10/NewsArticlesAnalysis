I am not going to overly ennoble the role of the artist here as compared with any other line of life work I am not qualified to venture so far afield . But rather , speaking to common elements within the world of artists , I can say from experience : It is a potentially quixotic path along which it is easy to lose one ' s way be it by dearth of inspiration or demand , temporarily untethered from a sufficient sense of purpose or discovery , perhaps wandering without enough focus or free time . You test your limits , and when you inevitably fail ( or at least don ' t connect with an audience , as even Bowie acknowledged battling ) , you regroup and reassess and try to succeed anew .
