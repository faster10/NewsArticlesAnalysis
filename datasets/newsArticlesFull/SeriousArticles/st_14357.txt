TS : They basically just have the actress Carrie Ann Moss up in the air and they take a photograph each at the same time so that ' s why she ' s in that movement . . . the camera moves around her but she doesn ' t move because its all different shots so you stretch the whole experience in two or three seconds . We ' re doing something similar on the film " Prince of Persia " that I ' ve just finished . We record some action with five cameras . . . from these five images they recreate the actors as 3D objects and then project according to which angle . It ' s fascinating what kind of technology is out there .
