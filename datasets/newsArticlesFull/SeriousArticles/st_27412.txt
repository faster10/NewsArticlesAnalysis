One close friend , Charlene Wood , wrote to Facebook : I think Mark ' s choice was to not remain here without Kathy and face what would be criminal charges and he made sure he honored her wishes which was to not be in a vegetative state ! ! ! Until our country can honor right to die laws , people will have to make very difficult choices to end their pain and suffering ! ! ! He had such courage to carry out her wishes and put her life before his own . . . . such honor and respect for his wife ! ! ! ! ! ! !
