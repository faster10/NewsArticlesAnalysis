And yet the Royals stormed into New York , baseball s biggest market , and bounced the Mets . Kansas City and its leadership team ? general manager Dayton Moore and manager Ned Yost ? stuck with their plan to develop young talent like Hosmer and Gordon and Moustakas , while weathering the growing pains . Brett remembers when shortstop Alcidies Escobar first struggled in Kansas City after arriving in a December 2010 trade with the Milwaukee Brewers . People are booing Ned and questioning him and criticizing him in the paper , for never pinch hitting Escobar in the seventh or eighth or ninth inning with the game on the line and you re 20 games out of first place , Brett recalled . And I remember Ned telling me one time , he said , How is he ever going to be a good every day shortstop on a championship team if we pinch hit for him now ? He s gotta learn from these situations . And now look , he was the MVP of the American League Championship Series . Why ? Because Ned had the courage and conviction to say , Look , we re building a team . We re not winning it this year , but we re building for the future . Little things like that , you know , have really helped put this team together .
