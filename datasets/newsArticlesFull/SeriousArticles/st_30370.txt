The most pleasant surprise : In days leading up to the address , White House aides had been dropping broad hints to the press that a newly combative Obama would once again stick it to Republicans . Not an olive branch , reported Politico , but a cattle prod . Instead , Obama wisely chose to use tempered , constructive language in addressing the other side . That didn ' t change the atmosphere much in Washington but give the president credit . He didn ' t make it worse either . It would be good to hear the Republicans act in the same spirit .
