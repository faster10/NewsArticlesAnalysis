The National AIDS Control Organisation ( NACO ) had been spearheading the NCAP earlier however , in August last year , the departmental status of the AIDS programme was revoked by the government . NACO used to work like an autonomous body headed by a director general and secretary . Now NACO only has operational powers while most of its financial powers stand reduced . Today the body is headed by an officer of additional secretary rank , says Mohanty . Additionally , the government s move in early 2014 to change the process by which the Centre distributes funds for AIDS control to the states has created new problems . Describing the situation , Mohanty says : Earlier the funds used to flow from the finance ministry to NACO and then directly to SACSs . Now , the funds first flow to the state treasuries instead of the SACSs and then the treasuries release these funds to the SACSs . Now the treasuries decide whether HIV is a priority for them or not . That is what is causing problems and as a result states like Maharashtra have not had the required money for things like the targeted intervention project for the past few months . ?
