That day , Bloomberg Politics published an article in which Sanders campaign manager , Jeff Weaver , joked that Clinton would make a great vice president for Sanders . Weaver offered to interview her for the job . As Jonathan Chait has pointed out , that s a standard put down among candidates : Clinton said the same thing about Barack Obama in 2008 . But when Weaver tried it on Clinton , her supporters erupted . Christine Quinn , a Clinton backer , accused the Sanders campaign of sexism . Quinn pointed at Sanders himself : I m stunned that a man like Bernie Sanders , who has clearly committed his life to making the country a better place , would get sucked into this very dangerous rhetoric , which perpetuates sexist and misogynistic stereotypes .
