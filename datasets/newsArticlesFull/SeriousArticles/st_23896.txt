3 . We need more female chief executives : I ' m not really into betting , but this is a wager I feel very confident I ' d win . Would a female chief executive officer have ever suggested that women should trust the system and trust that they ' ll receive " good karma " if they don ' t ask for raises ? Absolutely not . I don ' t think any woman , especially one who has gone on to head a Fortune 500 company , would say she ever trusted the system to get where she is . She most likely had to take on the system and speak up for herself over and over again throughout her career . So Nadella ' s big time gender gaffe points to why we need more women in the C suite . Sadly , as we reported last year , there has been no significant difference in the number of women in executive positions for four years in a row .
