As part of an investigation I have to try to figure out which defects in the body come from bullets entering , and which from their exit . Usually these wounds are distinctly different in appearance , but the more complex the body position of the deceased , the more complicated things get . Exit wounds in flesh pressed against the ground or against tight clothing can appear just like entrance wounds . An entrance wound inflicted through an intermediary target that deformed the bullet can look just like an exit wound . Sometimes I have to wait for the police reports or witness transcripts in to correctly interpret what I see on the body in the autopsy suite .
