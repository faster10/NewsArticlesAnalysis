Official reserves in the form of gold or widely accepted foreign currencies are used to purchase the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets so that the exchange rate is maintained . However , as the supply of the two key reserve assets ( gold and Dollar ) proved inadequate for supporting the expansion of world trade and financial flows , it was decided to create a new international reserve asset backed by the IMF .
