" Clouds Over Cuba " gives audiences a front row seat to what could have been a catastrophe . Working closely with the John F . Kennedy Library , filmmakers were given unprecedented access to letters , memos , documents and imagery , which viewers can engage with as the documentary plays . Additionally , special real time alerts can be set up to notify a viewer ' s mobile devices to mirror the critical events of the 13 day crisis . And , perhaps its boldest feature , the site also offers a terrifying companion film which imagines what might have been , had the worst not been avoided half a century ago .
