Terry idolized George Jones . It was through him that i began to " hear " George , not just listen to him . There is a big difference between listening and hearing . I had listened to George growing up with my dad , a big country fan . I had listened to him in high school again , when I discovered Hank Williams Jr . and found out Hank also loved George . But it wasn ' t until I was in Nashville and hanging out with Terry that I finally heard George Jones . I finally got it . The tone and the ache of his voice clicked . I heard how every word George sang was first filtered through a broken heart .
