Miley Cyrus ' performance of " We Can ' t Stop " surely turned heads with her skimpy outfit , twerking and several crotch grabs . Miley wore a furry leotard and danced around the stage with oversize teddy bears . But it was her collaboration with Robin Thicke for his hit single , " Blurred Lines " that caused a gasp among the crowd . Miley stripped down to a nude bra and underwear and , with a foam finger in hand , she proceeded to grind her body hard against Thicke , making his controversial music video seem PG rated .
