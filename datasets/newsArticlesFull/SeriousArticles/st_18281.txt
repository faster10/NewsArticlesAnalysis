Tom Hanks is one of the most beloved film stars in Hollywood . He ' s a successful producer and two time Oscar winner . After a sluggish few years , marked by " Cloud Atlas , " " Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close " and " Larry Crowne , " he was back in the good graces at the box office and with critics , thanks to " Captain Phillips " and " Saving Mr Banks . " The result ? No Oscar nominations . Maybe he split the vote maybe voters just weren ' t that impressed . ( They certainly weren ' t by " Mr Banks . " )
