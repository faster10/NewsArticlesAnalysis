AlphaGo is actually comprised of two neural networks . The first network searches for possible moves . The second network then evaluates each move under consideration to determine whether it will give AlphaGo the upper hand later in the game . Unlike chess playing algorithms , the AlphaGo program doesn ' t crunch through every possible permutation of the game , it just gets a sense of which move provides it the upper hand . " This approach makes AlphaGo ' s search much more humanlike than previous approaches , " says David Silver , another Google researcher .
