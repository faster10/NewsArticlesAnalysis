The youths , aged 14 and 15 , are being held by police on suspicion of deliberately starting three fires . Firefighters said that while it has rained in the area , the hilly landscape meant little moisture remained near the top of the soil . There was also a lot of dead , dry growth left over from winter , which had been the sunniest since records began in 1929 . Commander Craig Baker of Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said : ' It is probably one of the largest heath fires we ' ve had for a couple of years . The main problem yesterday was the strength of the wind . '
