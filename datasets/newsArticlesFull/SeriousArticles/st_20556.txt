When I hear folks say that well , maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims , when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who s fleeing from a war torn country is admitted , when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefitted from protection when they were fleeing political persecution ? that s shameful , Mr Obama said at a press conference in Turkey . That s not American . That s not who we are . We don t have religious tests to our compassion .
