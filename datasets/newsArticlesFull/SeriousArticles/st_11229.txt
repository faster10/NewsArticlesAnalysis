One reason to panic : Should you panic at all about this game if you ' re a Bengals fan ? No . Was this a timely wake up call for a team that had been able to get by despite having a few miscues throughout the season ? Yes . The biggest reason of concern had to stem from the Bengals ' ineffectiveness on third down on offense . They finished the game with a 4 for 15 third down conversion ratio , their worst since a 2 for 11 showing in a win over Pittsburgh last year . Earlier last season , they also went 1 for 13 on third down in a game at Indianapolis . Cincinnati entered this particular contest ranking second in the league in offensive third down conversion percentage . If these late down woes become an issue , it could be problematic .
