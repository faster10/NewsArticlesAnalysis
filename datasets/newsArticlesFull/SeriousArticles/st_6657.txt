At first , the languages Lucas invented for his new worlds were a kind of burbling baby talk . Hence his Wookiees and Ewoks , or the gloriously nonsensical names of characters like Grand Moff Tarkin and Wedge Antilles . In the prequels , the neologisms turn ponderous . When he locates the droid foundries in Attack of the Clones on a red , craggy planet called Geonosis , Lucas attempts a metaphysical pun : compressing Genesis , gnosis and geology , the made up word chokes on its own indigestible etymologies . For Revenge of the Sith , in which the titular dynasty consolidates its power , he strains to make up a word that would exude the sulphurous essence of evil . A monosyllable that starts with a hiss but ends with a lisp hardly has the desired rumble of malevolence if you unscramble the anagram , Sith sounds better as shit . Beelzebub and Mephistopheles remain unchallenged as names for our eternal adversary .
