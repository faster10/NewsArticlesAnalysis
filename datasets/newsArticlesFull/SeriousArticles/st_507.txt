Who would have said that one day , Marine Le Pen , in Nord Pas de Calais a region that has been predominantly leftist for 100 years would beat her adversary on the right by nearly 20 percentage points ? Who would have thought that a 25 year old woman , niece of the former , talented and sharp as a blade , would crush her rival , the mayor of Nice , by 14 or 15 points ? Who would have bet that the members of the triumvirate of the Le Pen family ( Marine , Marion , Lous Aliot ) , with a major boost by Florian Phillipot , would become the only discussion topic of the evening , and that we would stop debating to listen to their statements ? Those who have a big smile next to their rivals ' crestfallen looks , who have the luxury of mixing national discourse with local commentary in their statements that of Marine Le Pen even seeming very presidential ?
