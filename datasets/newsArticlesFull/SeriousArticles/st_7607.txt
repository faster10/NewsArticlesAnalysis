Now the Republicans are experiencing the law of unintended consequences . Their actions have produced a major issue for one of their leading presidential contenders , all because of their fervor to make Obama an illegitimate president . Now Republicans are facing a dilemma if they support Cruz ' s assessment , the whole Obama " birther " claims become completely ridiculous and a waste of the public ' s time . On the other hand , if they don ' t support Cruz and say he does not qualify to be president based upon the constitution , they take out a major leader in their party . We will see whether being born on foreign soil is really important to the Republican Party when it comes to their politicians . I already know the answer , no . Watch as this issue goes away for Senator Cruz . If I were running as a democrat presidential contender , I would expose the hypocrisy of the Republican Party by simply asking " why does this not matter with Senator Cruz but it was job one with President Obama " ?
