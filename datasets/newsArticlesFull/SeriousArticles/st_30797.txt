Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media . It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so . Further , there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky ' s involvement in this matter . Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course , following any investigation of this matter .
