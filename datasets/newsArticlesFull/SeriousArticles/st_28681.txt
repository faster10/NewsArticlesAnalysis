Cooke : I ' m trying to stay open to different ways to tell the story but remain incredibly faithful to the novels while I do it . There is some room for visual interpretation , but it ' s a balancing act . In " The Score " one of the main characters is Parker ' s pal , Grofield . In the novel , Donald describes him as an actor who always hears music in his head . Grofield hears background music to whatever it is he ' s doing , he ' s always dramatizing what he ' s doing . I picked up on that and all the scenes with Grofield start out like movie scenes featuring the kind of music he ' s hearing in his head as they go about this crime . Someone else will speak and the bubble pops and then we ' re into the reality of the situation . It ' s a great cue every time that Grofield comes on stage in the book . When we see the musical notes , the reader knows , OK , we ' re in Grofield ' s head now . It ' s something you can carry forward .
