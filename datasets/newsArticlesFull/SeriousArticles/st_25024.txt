Heading changes are also what I would expect to see in an autopilot off situation . The 777 ' s fly by wire roll control law controls the tilt of the wings . The airplane would be subject to atmospheric disturbances that could act to tip a wing up every now and then , but built in protections prevent the plane from exceeding bank angles in excess of 35 . While a conventional airplane would tend to spiral down in that situation , the 777 incorporates automatic pitch compensation , so the airplane could easily hold its altitude in these turns .
