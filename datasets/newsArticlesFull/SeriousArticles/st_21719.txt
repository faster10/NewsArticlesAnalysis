CHEMISTRY : The Dow DuPont megamerger appears quite cleverly timed from a political perspective . While observers expect there will be hearings from both the antitrust and agriculture committees , the impending recess means there won ' t be an opportunity until after the State of the Union . And by then , the way things are going , other more recently announced mergers will have taken the edge off . A Washington antitrust lawyer said Dow will probably be covered with its existing stable of lobbyists from Akin Gump , Fierce Government Relations , FTI , Ernst Young , Holland Knight , MWR Strategies , and Valente Associates . ( Weil , Gotshal Manges advised them on the deal ) . DuPont , on the other hand , may have to hire , with only Strategic Marketing Innovations and Glover Park Group on retainer last quarter . ( Skadden was DuPont ' s legal advisor . )
