A trip to Malta is not merely a walk through a living history book . Along the way are stunning natural formations , like the Blue Grotto on the southern coast near the village of urrieq . When the weather permits and seas are not too choppy , boats take visitors to the 140 foot high natural stone arch and surrounding caves . Of course , on an island this small you are never far from the coast , though sun seekers often head to the beaches of the northern resort of Mellie a to soak in the rays .
