? Daniel Murphy . Weird as it might be to say considering what happened in September , there ' s likely a part of the fan base that wants Murphy back more than Yoenis Cespedes . Murphy had a great postseason but is it worth overpaying for peak production and when it ' s likely not sustainable . And we don ' t mean homering for six games straight but just the type of power he has never shown in his career . Murphy is also a below average defender and the Mets saw in the World Series just how important defense is . If you subscribe to the theory that there ' s no such thing as a bad one year deal then the qualifying offer , which they ' re expected to give , makes sense .
