Kudos to Empire ' s Taraji P . Henson for winning Best Actress TV Drama and for shouting at director Louis J . Horvitz to stop the music . " I ' ve waited 25 years for this , " she said . No plaudits , though , for Quentin Tarantino accepting Best Score for an absent Ennio Morricone , the composer for The Hateful Eight . Perhaps anticipating it would be his only time on stage ( he lost to Aaron Sorkin for Best Screenplay ) he hogged his time and , in praising the much acclaimed Morricone , he stretched a bit , comparing him to Mozart and Beethoven . You think ?
