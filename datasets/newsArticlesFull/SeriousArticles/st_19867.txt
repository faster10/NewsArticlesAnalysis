But when faced with a suspected domestic violence case , what can you personally do to help ? You may feel powerless like I did at the restaurant but there are in fact , many things that you can do . The GFEDV has developed a range of training modules for medical professionals , such as doctors , midwives , and community health workers as these professionals are primarily the first point of contact for victims of domestic abuse . The training is designed to help professionals spot the first signs of abuse and help victims . Even if you are not a medical professional , the GFEDV and Peace One Day have partnered to help individuals organise awareness workshops in their local areas that can instruct individuals , organisations , and businesses can help combat domestic violence .
