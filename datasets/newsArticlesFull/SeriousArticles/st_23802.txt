SC : The murky side of Bowie is that he left England pretty much for good in 1974 and never really lived there after that . And then in the 1970s he was interested in fascism and national socialist memorabilia , and there were lots of stories connected with that ? some of them were true , some not true . There was this famous moment when he appeared at Victoria Station in London and waved to his fans , and he was very thin ? this was his Thin White Duke period ? and when the wave was photographed it looked like a Nazi salute . And everyone said , Oh , Bowie s a Nazi . He wasn t a Nazi . It was misunderstood .
