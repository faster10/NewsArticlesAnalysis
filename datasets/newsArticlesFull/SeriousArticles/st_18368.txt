The Fire . Running for president is a long and brutal journey and the folks who pull it off are the ones with a burning intensity inside of them . Excitement and confidence are contagious , and people respond to candidates who speak from the heart and have an emotional stake in the issues . Many Democrats are responding to the passion of Sen . Elizabeth Warren , D Massachusetts , and they hope she runs for president . Many Republicans get excited by the likes of Sen . Rand Paul , R Kentucky , or Sen . Ted Cruz , R Texas .
