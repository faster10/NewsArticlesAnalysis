END OF AN ERA ? Most of you all probably know that a number of senior folks are leaving POLITICO at the end of the year . They include CEO Jim VandeHei and chief White House correspondent Mike Allen . Jim and Mike are the reason Morning Money exists and I could not be more thankful to both of them for recruiting me to POLITICO and helping make the place the incredible powerhouse that it is . Thankfully both will remain through the 2016 election before moving on to new and exciting adventures . I will miss them along with the rest of the departing crew including the great Danielle Jones , Kim Kingsley and Roy Schwartz . Couldn t ask for better friends and colleagues .
