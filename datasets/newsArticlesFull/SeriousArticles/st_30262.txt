McCarron ' s targets since he replaced Dalton : A . J . Green and Marvin Jones 25 Gio 16 Mohamed Sanu and Tyler Kroft 12 Hill 8 Tyler Eifert 4 . . . . Green ' s recent stats versus Pittsburgh ( 6 132 1 , 11 118 1 , 8 82 0 , 11 224 1 ) combined with the Steelers ' porous cornerback play give Green a strong Wild Card outlook , especially in a game where the Bengals are underdogs and may have to pass to move the chains . Football Outsiders has graded Pittsburgh as a bottom six defense in coverage of No . 1 receivers . . . . All the DFS traffic on Green will result in lowered ownership for Eifert versus a Pittsburgh defense that yielded the sixth most receptions ( 85 ) , 12th most yards ( 883 ) , and ninth most touchdowns ( 8 ) to tight ends this season . Fully healthy after late year brain and neck injuries , Eifert posted a 4 51 1 receiving line in Week 17 and will be all systems go . . . . Jones ' stat lines in McCarron ' s three full games are 4 89 0 , 3 33 0 , and 5 38 0 . Jones played two of them with Eifert inactive , and posted the 89 yard game against San Francisco with Green limited by a back injury . While Jones always offers playmaking potential , his complementary player usage renders Jones a weak fantasy bet , even in plus matchups .
