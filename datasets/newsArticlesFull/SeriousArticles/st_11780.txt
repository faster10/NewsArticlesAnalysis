This experience gives Christie license , as he exercised ? during a speech to the Republican Jewish Council on Thursday , to ludicrously claim that he has done nothing but protect our country for 13 years , a statement that probably has a few members of New Jersey s public employee unions tearing their hair out with one hand while holding their reduced pension statements in the other . It allows him to claim in all seriousness that when , as president , he gets his first national security briefing , the FBI director won t have to worry whether I understand all the acronyms he s using . ( Vote Christie : He Knows Acronyms ! ) It allowed him to cast as false the idea that Bush era anti terrorist tools such as the National Security Agency s metadata collection program that was finally shut down just this week were in any way unconstitutional , a conclusion with which a federal court has already disagreed .
