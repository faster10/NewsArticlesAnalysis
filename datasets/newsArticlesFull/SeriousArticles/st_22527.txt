It s the most dominant team of the last decade against the Clemson Tigers for the national championship on Monday night . The Alabama Crimson Tide are the winners of three of the last six college football national championships and this year s champions of the ballyhooed Southeastern Conference ( the SEC has claimed seven of the last nine national championships ) . This isn t necessarily David versus Goliath , but it is Goliath versus someone significantly smaller and less accomplished . Clemson have won only one national title in their history and over the last few years the Tigers have become synonymous with underachievement . Clemson come into this game as the only undefeated team in the country , but are still heavy underdogs . History and pedigree may favor the Tide , but this one may not be as lopsided as it may appear .
