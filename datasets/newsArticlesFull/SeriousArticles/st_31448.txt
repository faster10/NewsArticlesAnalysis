Thompson : I believe that the scene in which Eddie Fisher comes home to that party , and Richard in front of everybody forces her to confess her love for him in front of Eddie , seems so outrageous , but it is so absolutely true , having been reported many , many times over the years as happening just like that . As is every scene in the movie , by the way . The fact that they were denounced by the Pope , that ' s pretty strong . It ' s one thing to get a DUI , it ' s another thing for the Pope to denounce you . . . I know that when I was a kid , I used to go to the movies and when I would watch a true story about someone who was famous , I believed that to be THE movie . People who make movies have to understand the responsibility you have when you make a biopic . You have to be accurate . It takes a lot of effort and painstaking details to make these movies right , down to the wigs that take place over four decades , even after they ' re dead . Laughs That ' s hard .
