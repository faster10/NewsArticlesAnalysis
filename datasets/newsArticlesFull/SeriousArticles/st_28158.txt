Lovely ! The legislation will , in all likelihood , be blocked by Senate Democrats , who are working with the White House to try and redirect attention away from the refugee program by proposing changes to the visa waiver program . Republicans are being a little overly optimistic , I think , in believing that this issue will have any real potency a year from now , but for the moment they can have their fun ? making the argument that spineless , weak on terror Democrats opposed a BISPARTISAN measure to protect the country from the potential threat posed by terrified and desperate people who want nothing more than to live in America .
