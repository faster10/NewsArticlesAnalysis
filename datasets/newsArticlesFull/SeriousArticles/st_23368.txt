After 9 11 Democrats should have played every point . When Bush said they hate us for our freedom Democrats should have said , No , they hate us because we arm rulers they are at war with . When he said we fight them there so we don t have to fight them here they should have said , No , they re here because we re there , propping up petrol states with guns and bribes . : When he said the world s a better place without Saddam in it , they should have said not for the hundred thousand Iraqi dead or hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Christians who fled their homes not for our killed or wounded soldiers or their loved ones . Nor is America better off as a bankrupt , nor is the Middle East better off in a permanent state of bloody chaos .
