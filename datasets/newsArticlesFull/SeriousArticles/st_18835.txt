" Pennsylvania State Police continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case , " said Centre County ' s District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller . " Everybody , regardless of what position they held , deserves this kind of attention . In any missing persons case , he ' s not the only one , we feel discouraged when we can ' t answer the questions for the family , but it doesn ' t change our dedication to the case . "
