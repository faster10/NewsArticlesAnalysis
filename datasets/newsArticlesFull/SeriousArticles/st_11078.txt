Tahari : Cars . I had to have help with cars . Although , in fourth or fifth grade , there was some crazy snowstorm in Atlanta where she grew up . I was stuck in carpool on the way home from school with eight people for eight hours . I had one Tootsie Roll in my backpack , and let me tell you , a Tootsie Roll between eight people did not go far . So I decided in the car section that I wanted to have an emergency road list , a check list of things to have in the car . I was stuck in the car for eight hours , starving to death .
