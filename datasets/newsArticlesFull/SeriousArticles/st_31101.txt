" The ones in the fingers were the big mystery . We couldn ' t figure how those got there because the way your circulatory system works , it would have had to have gone through my heart to get to my hand and come to find out , I had a hole in my heart between my left and right atrium and that ' s how they got to my hand . Well , if a clot goes through that hole it has two places it can go , your left hand or your brain . Typically it goes to your brain . So I got very lucky that I didn ' t have a stroke , " Vickers said .
