Ben Golliver : The Rockets will claim the West s No . 5 seed . To be clear , Houston has deserved all ( or virtually all ) of the criticism that has been sent its way over the last three or four months . That s the past . Despite the firing of coach Kevin McHale , the persistent issues with focus , and the bouts of inattentive defense , the Rockets are just 1 . 5 games out of the No . 5 seed and a possible rematch with the Clippers . Houston boasts a more talented roster top to bottom than both Dallas and Memphis , the two teams directly above it in the standings , and the Rockets 2 . 7 point differential since Dec . 1 far exceeds the Mavericks ( 0 . 6 ) and the Grizzlies ( 1 . 8 ) . James Harden has led the Rockets to a top five defensive rating over the last seven weeks , a strong indicator that Houston will overpower enough of its opponents down the stretch to make up for its middling defense . If the Clippers do catch the Rockets in the first round , L . A . will be the only higher seeded team in the West at serious risk of an upset . ?
