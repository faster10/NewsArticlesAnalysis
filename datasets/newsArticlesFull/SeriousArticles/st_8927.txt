Sure Patty Mills , Boris Diaw and Matt Bonner are part of the bench but Joseph and Baynes are strong defenders that could ' ve helped maintain a certain defensive level when either Duncan or Kawhi Leonard would take a blow . And with Duncan currently being injured and Aldridge not being a strong rim protector , San Antonio could use a backup big like Baynes to help control the paint . West and Marjanovic can fill this role at times , but the veteran forward is not a shot blocker and the Spurs rookie is not a very mobile player .
