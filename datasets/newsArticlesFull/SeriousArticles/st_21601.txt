If these women are speaking up about how difficult it is to be a woman of a certain age when all you get offered are long suffering wives , mothers , and witches , the Golden Globes are actually doing something about it ? by recognizing the women who continue to be trailblazers in their field . Actresses like Kate Winslet , Jennifer Jason Leigh , Jane Fonda , and Helen Mirren aren t just over 40 these are incredible role models and icons who have helped open the door for every woman that came after them . In Youth , Fonda steals the movie with a monologue that doubles a look back at her own career as a firebrand and cultural lightning rod . I don t owe anybody anything , she boasts . I did it myself !
