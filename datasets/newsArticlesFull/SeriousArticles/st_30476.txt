Yes , this is a war . I have covered this war in its many theatres across the globe . I know that Muslims mourn their dead as we do . Muslim mothers bury their children . Muslim fathers wonder how they will keep their families safe . Muslim homes are destroyed . Muslims sit in overcrowded refugee camps . Muslims survive on relief rations from charities . Muslims get on creaky people smuggler boats to escape . They fan out across Europe seeking haven . They come to our shores looking for shelter .
