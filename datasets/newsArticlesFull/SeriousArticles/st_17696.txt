That s a good question . I think that people who base their political appeal on stirring up the latent anger of , let s just say , for shorthand s sake , what Richard Nixon called the silent majority , know that they re riding a tiger . Whether it was Richard Nixon very explicitly , when he was charting his political comeback after the 1960 loss , rejecting the John Birch Society . Or whether it was Ronald Reagan in 1978 refusing to align himself with something called the Briggs Initiative in California , which was basically an initiative to ban gay people from teaching , at a time when gays were being attacked in the streets . Or whether it was George W . Bush saying that Islam is a religion of peace and going to a mosque the week after 9 11 . These Republican leaders have always resisted the urge to go full demagogue . I think they understood that if they did so , it would have very scary consequences . There was always this boundary of responsibility , the kind of thing enforced by William F . Buckley when he was alive .
