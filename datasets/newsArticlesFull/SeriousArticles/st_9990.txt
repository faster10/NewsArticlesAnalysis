Vincent ( with us tailing him ) was graciously afforded an almost all access behind the scenes tour of Kennedy Space Center mission control was a no go , unsurprisingly which included a pilgrimage to launchpad 39A , site of the impending STS 135 mission , NASA ' s last in the Space Transportation System ( STS , or Space Shuttle ) era . He also got a peek at the NASA engine shop , shuttle landing facility and control tower , vehicle assembly building , and mobile launch platforms , as well as several other difficult to remember locales .
