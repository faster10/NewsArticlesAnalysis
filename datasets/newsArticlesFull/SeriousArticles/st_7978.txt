I am sorry but I won t agree with this generation of whining excuse makers . Reggie Bush ( and I like him ) has unbelievable ability to cut , turn , change speeds etc . , so why couldn t he pull up when he ran out bounds ? You know I m right , watch the play he had 15 yards to turn or slow down . It is terrible that it happened , but 100 s of games were played there before . Go to any HS Football game ( outside of rich , spoiled Texas ) and the fields are in horrible shape with brick walls at the field s edge and the game goes on . I am not saying prevention is not worth a thought , but 1 failed ShoeBomber tried something stupid and now we still take off our shoes at airports 10 years later . Not everything can be prevented , but c mon already .
