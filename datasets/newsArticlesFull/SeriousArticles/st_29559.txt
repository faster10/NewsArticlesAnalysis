PH : That s all the matter of interpretation . According to the federal government , they always act legally but whether they act lawfully ? that is another question altogether . So , it seems like according to reports especially by this one witness whose account we ve read at 21st century wire , it looks like a federal ambush . You have multiple federal vehicles , dozens of agents , snipers in the woods , red lasers all over the passengers in the car when they came out . So , this was preplanned , prepositioned . This was a serious operation . They knew exactly they were coming through a remote rural stretch of road , stopped them and what happened was very unfortunate ? a man has died . And this is a game changer . The fact that someone has died and that someone had their ? hands up would be a huge change in the narrative . And it would have very serious repercussions . Let s hope that there is no more loss of life in this situation because there are still eight to 10 protesters holed up at the wildlife refuge . ?
