Now : In our digital dealings , the problem is less about foreign phrases ( a friendly " Merci ! " is better than no thank you at all to the intern who just spent four hours doing data entry for you ) . Rather , the issue is LOLspeak the ugly Internet bred lexicon that Emily couldn ' t have seen coming . In nine out of 10 e mails , posts and other missives , a spelled out word will be clearer and less idiotic sounding than its abbreviated synonym . ( This rule does not apply to hilar advice columns of the world , obvi . Hey , YOLO . )
