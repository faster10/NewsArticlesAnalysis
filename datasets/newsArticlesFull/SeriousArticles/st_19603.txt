The play was amazing , but no less than the crowd reaction . The Washington fans leaped up and cheered as though their guy had hit a buzzer beater . The noise from the Washington crowd was enough to make you question where you were . Was this the road ? What are sports allegiances ? It would seem many of the people who cheered the 3 were also the people cheering when Wall drew Curry ' s third foul . They just got lost in the action , beholding a play unforgettable enough to make them briefly forget themselves .
