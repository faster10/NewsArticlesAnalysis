An example of a more temperate Islamism might be found in Morocco , where the appointment of an Islamist prime minister , Abdelilah Benkirane , has shown signs of opening the country up . He has promised transparency , a war on corruption and a fairer distribution of wealth . Crucially , anything more radical that the prime minister might try to do is tempered by Morocco ' s monarch and powerful army . This arrangement sees Islamism expanding popular representation while the political establishment safeguards secularism .
