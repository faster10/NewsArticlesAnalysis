The outrage wasn ' t confined to the media . Rep . Peter King of New York , then chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , dubbed the film disgusting , claimed it " could incite real violence " and reportedly warned that the filmmakers " would have blood on their hands if anything should ever happen . " King went on to call for no movie theater or TV network in America to show the film : " Any theater that would show this , any TV station that would show this , is acting irresponsibly . It would be a disgrace for it to be shown anywhere . "
