We all came to Congress knowing we would face hard choices . For Boehner , that hard choice means abandoning the foolish Hastert Rule , which requires that " the majority of the majority " party support legislation before it can be brought to a vote in the whole House , an artificial barrier to bipartisan cooperation . In effect , the rule keeps the speaker in power while preventing Republicans and Democrats from coming together . And most troubling , it thwarts the will of the people , a consequence that is fundamentally at odds with who we are as Americans .
