I could tell you that the A380 is 18 meters wider and 5 meters longer than a Boeing 747 , that it has a wingspan of 79 . 8 meters and its tailfin alone is 24 meters high . But no matter what the numbers say or how often you see an A380 on the ground or in the air , the most impressive way to get some perspective on the size and scale of the Superjumbo is to see it out of context unpainted , just its green protective coating , in individual parts , moving down the main street of a small French village , towering over roof tops and tree tops alike .
