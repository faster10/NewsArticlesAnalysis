Ferguson : Being the lead of the show is more difficult , it ' s harder on my body , it ' s more strenuous , it ' s harder on my mind but it ' s rewarding in a day to day manner , but what I love about being the director is you get to protect the story for longer , so you can take all these talents you know , all the people you work with and you get to make sure they get to do all they can do . I love them both . Directing is it ' s easier to act in something that you have questions about than it is to direct something . Directing is so much work for such a long period of time .
