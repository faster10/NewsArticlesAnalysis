About the Cardinals : The NFC West champs won more games than they ever had in their mostly dreary 96 year history . The Cards also led the league in offense for the first time in the Super Bowl era and posted 489 points , most in team history . A fifth ranked defense rounds out a well balanced squad , though the late season loss of DB Tyrann Mathieu ( knee ) remains a blow , particularly against a quarterback as good as Rodgers . QB Carson Palmer had an MVP caliber season and established more team records ( and career bests of his own ) with 4 , 671 passing yards and 35 TDs . OLB Dwight Freeney was signed off the street and provided a team best eight sacks in 11 games . In five games since replacing injured Chris Johnson , rookie RB David Johnson , an excellent receiver out of the backfield , compiled 658 yards from scrimmage . Arizona is 3 0 in playoff games at University of Phoenix Stadium . Palmer has an 0 2 postseason record . Both games were with the Cincinnati Bengals , and he tore an ACL in the first one .
