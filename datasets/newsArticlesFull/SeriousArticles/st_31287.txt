Kiper : " In another year Stanley would be worthy to be the first offensive tackle taken , but Tunsil gets the nod in this class . Stanley was a gifted but inconsistent player last year , and he decided to go back , which is going to work out well for him . This year , the talent is still obvious , and he was better technically , and it showed . Baltimore can ' t pass on a potential left tackle with Stanley ' s upside here given the state of the O line , not to mention with Joe Flacco coming back from an injury . "
