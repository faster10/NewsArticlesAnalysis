Elections in Russia do not resemble elections in the West . The core of a victorious candidate ' s support is generally passive voters who are threatened at their place of work , bribed with small gifts or favors or bussed to the polling places where they can vote under the watchful eyes of their supervisors . It is this system that accounts for the electoral " success " of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 2012 elections and that of the United Russia Party ( described by Navalny as the " party of swindlers and crooks " ) in the last parliamentary elections .
