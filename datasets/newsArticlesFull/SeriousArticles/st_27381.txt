We know that pitchers become less effective each time they face a lineup , a combination of their fatigue and hitters ' familiarity . The quality of a pitcher , the quality of the available relievers and the importance of the game all feed into the decision of when to go to the bullpen , but in the postseason , where run prevention is paramount , that decision almost always bends toward pulling the starter . There can be little question that Matt Harvey , 102 pitches in and facing Lorenzo Cain for the fourth time , was likely to be less effective than Familia , zero pitches in and facing Cain for the first time . Everything we know about starters and relievers , about in game fatigue , about familiarity , about Harvey and Familia themselves pointed to putting Familia on the mound with nobody on base and a two run lead .
