A : An estimated 1 in 5 Republican voters in New Hampshire are evangelical , compared with about 60 percent in Iowa . Iowa has more older voters ? roughly one fourth are over 65 , compared with about 15 percent in New Hampshire . New Hampshire s voters are somewhat more liberal . The wild card in New Hampshire is the undeclared voters , who can participate in either party s primary they make up about 40 percent of the electorate . That could favor candidates who don t emphasize their religious calling , and perhaps helps those with appeal to younger voters .
