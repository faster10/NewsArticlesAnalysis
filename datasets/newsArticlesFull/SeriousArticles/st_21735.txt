? ? Here s Cleveland s schedule going into the All Star break : at Indiana , at Charlotte , vs . Boston , vs . New Orleans ( back to back ) , vs . Sacramento , vs . the L . A . Lakers . If that stretch doesn t boost this team s confidence or turn out consistent results , Griffin has one week from the Lakers game until the trade deadline to get busy . And though Love may not be headed anywhere , the Cavs have a surplus of high priced big men and a definite need for a defensive presence and shooting on the wing . After what the Warriors have done to them , and twice at that , it would be remiss to think they won t aggressively explore their options .
