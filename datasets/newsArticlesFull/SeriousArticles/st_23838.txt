Forsberg : The Celtics have done an amazing job in the asset collection phase of this on the fly rebuild , especially when you consider that along the way they ' ve scooped up guys such as Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder two players who could still be key cogs even after Boston makes a move for an established superstar . Here ' s the only downside : While the Celtics are positioned for a big move with all their young talent , a pile of draft picks and cap flexibility , there ' s no obvious move in the offing . The Celtics are at the mercy of waiting for a disgruntled star to emerge , and then they still have to convince another team to bite ( and teams will be leery given Ainge ' s track record in deals involving Kevin Garnett ) . Otherwise , Boston ' s fate is still a bit tied to pingpong balls ( and the futility of the Nets ) . Ainge is content to remain in draft and develop mode and stay patient in the process .
