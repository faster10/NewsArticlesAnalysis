TRUMP KEEPS GREAT FRIENDS JUST FANTASTIC PEOPLE Real winners . Christina Wilkie : " Trump did what he ' s always done when he needs to fund the Donald J . Trump Foundation : He called up a small group of people who do business with him , or who owe him favors , and asked them to pony up Mall developer J . J . Cafaro , who socializes with Trump in Palm Beach , gave Trump ' s foundation 50 , 000 , prompting Trump to describe Cafaro as ' a fantastic man . ' What Trump didn ' t mention is that Cafaro has pleaded guilty two different times in federal court to charges related to illegal political campaign donations . In 2002 , Cafaro pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe then Rep . Jim Traficant ( D Ohio ) , part of a deal Cafaro made to avoid jail time . Six years later , he again pleaded guilty to a campaign related offense this time , failing to disclose a 10 , 000 loan he ' d made to his daughter ' s failed bid for a seat in Congress .
