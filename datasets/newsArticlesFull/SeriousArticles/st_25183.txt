Once again , the Bulls have been hit hard by injuries again this season . Joakim Noah is probably out for the season after shoulder surgery . Mike Dunleavy has yet to play a game because of offseason back surgery . Kirk Hinrich is currently out because of a quadriceps injury . Teams deal with such things , though . It ' s part of any NBA season . The real problem for the Bulls is that the three players who were supposed to develop even more under new coach Fred Hoiberg Snell , McDermott and Mirotic just haven ' t been very good .
