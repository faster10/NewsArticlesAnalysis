I remember when ALL were demeaning Dez , every time he even spit . . lol . . He is now a true passionate leader , but , other teams fans do not follow the Boys like I do ! Time will tell with Hardy , but for now , he is playing on a huge incentive laden contract , not getting all the millions of most think he is , but there again , most do not know that . I would have been royally ticked ( and I was ) when ST allowed a 100 yd runback ! ! The media spins so much and it makes me very ill ? ( here comes thumbs down lol )
