The global energy market has been awash with speculation since Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared to indicate in an interview with The Economist magazine last week that Saudi Arabia might sell shares in Aramco , as part of a privatisation drive to raise money in an era of cheap oil . On Friday Aramco , the world ' s largest oil company , issued a brief statement saying it was considering options including the stock market listing " of an appropriate percentage of the company ' s shares and or the listing of a bundle ( of ) its downstream subsidiaries " . Aramco has crude reserves estimated at about 265 billion barrels , over 15 percent of all global oil deposits , so it could become the first listed company valued at 1 trillion or more if it went public , analysts have estimated . But several sources close to Aramco said its massive size , and the confidentiality surrounding it as the main instrument of the kingdom ' s oil policy , meant the sale of a stake in the parent firm was not being actively considered .
