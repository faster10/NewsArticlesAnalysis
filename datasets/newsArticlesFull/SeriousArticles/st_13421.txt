Who says defense can t win championships anymore ? What s to say this game can t end in a safety ? While we re all aware of Florida limitations offensively , that s no reflection on the other side of the ball where the Gators are loaded with talent . Saban referred to Vernon Hargreaves III as one of the best cornerbacks in the country , and he s not wrong . Hargreaves partner , cornerback Jalen Tabor , isn t too bad himself . Whether it s safety Keanu Neal , linebacker Antonio Morrison or defensive lineman Jonathan Bullard , there are future pros at every level of Geoff Collins defense . If they can stuff Derrick Henry and force Jake Coker to make plays through the air , then all bets are off . Coker has been prone to interceptions at times , and Alabama has already allowed one more sack than it did all of last season .
