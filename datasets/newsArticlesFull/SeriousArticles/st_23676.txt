Trump is upset because Carson is now leading in Iowa , which he thinks is just crazy . How is it possible that Carson could be leading in polls in a contest for leader of the free world , simply by virtue of the fact that he told lurid personal tales ? which may be exaggerated or made up ? that captivated a lot of attention ?

These polls don t actually mean that we are going to put him in office , as Trump puts it . They create appearances of support that are misleading and are all but certain to prove fleeting .
