Starting with Never Ending , the last four tracks on this album head further and further back into retro sounds , and here Rihanna moves from folk to 60s soul . Not that Love on the Brain sticks strictly to one style . The song seems designed as a showcase for Rihanna s vocal versatility : She starts out singing high and sweet , then drops into her chest to show off the lower part of her range , and finally powers into some Beyonc style belting . She even does a few seconds of what sounds like Frank Valli s falsetto ( listen at 2 : 12 ) . The point seems to be to underline the theme of swinging back and forth between the highs and lows of love . ( The F bombs , too , help keep the song from sounding too retro Rihanna may be trying on the sequined costume of a Supreme , but she s still Rihanna . )
