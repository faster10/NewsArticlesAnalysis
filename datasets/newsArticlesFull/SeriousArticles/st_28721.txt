The new incident comes as the story of how exactly the U . S . came to bomb a different Doctors Without Borders facility ? the hospital in Kunduz , Afghanistan ? on Oct . 3 continues to look worse and worse for the U . S . military . The AP reported Monday that the Green Berets who ordered the strike were aware the target was a hospital but believed it was under Taliban control . Doctors Without Borders has denied that the Taliban was in control of the facility or even that Taliban fighters were active within it , but even if they were , firing on a facility known to be treating wounded people would probably violate both U . S . rules of engagement and international humanitarian law .
