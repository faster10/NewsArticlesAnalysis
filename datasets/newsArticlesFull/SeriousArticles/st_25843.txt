Apparently , the filmmakers originally had a much shorter project in mind . For reasons of art and avarice ( not necessarily in that order ) , Netflix supersized their vision to 10 hours . This imposed a pace , editing rhythm and a slow burn internal processing of their 700 hours of footage . The end result is a fever dream of cascading details and characters with absolutely no externally imposed rush to just get on with it . Indeed , with no format demanded length , scenes in Murderer play out as long as they need to , and this coral like accretion of details , forensic and otherwise , gives the series much of its novelistic power . Sure , there are one too many ( actually , many too many ) drone shots of the Avery Mausoleum of Junked Cars and brooding images of courthouses with tattered flags blowing , but who really cares ? We are given privileged access into a landscape where no detail is too small to matter , where lives turn on a phrase or nuance . With the filmmakers out of the picture , and no narrator , the viewer is thrown into the deep end , unable to reach the shallow side of things .
