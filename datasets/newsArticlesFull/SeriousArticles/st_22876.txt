The faculty has two types of teachers : " lay " employees , who are on one year contracts , and called teachers like Perich , who have completed a formal colloquy , receiving a certificate of admission into the teaching ministry . Those parochial instructors are hired on an open ended basis and cannot be summarily dismissed without proper justification . Perich began as a contract teacher , but fulfilled the requirements to be a called teacher , becoming a " commissioned minister " in the Lutheran Church .
