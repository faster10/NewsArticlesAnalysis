Closed for several years , Volcano House reopened in 2013 following a 7 million renovation that preserved the character of architect Charles Dickey ' s original 1941 design . Talk about a view : some rooms overlook Kilauea , one of the world ' s most active volcanoes , while others face native Hawaiian rainforest of ohia lehua and koa trees , accented by tall hapuu tree ferns . Watching the crimson feathered apapane fly from branch to branch while Halema ' uma ' u Crater erupts about two miles away is an otherworldly sensation . Even the fireplace in the hotel ' s Grand Lounge is made of lava rock .
