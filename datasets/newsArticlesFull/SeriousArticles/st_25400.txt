It feels different to the attacks in January , when I stayed inside to appease my worried parents rather than out of actual fear . This time I am truly afraid . As a Brit living in Paris , I wasn t as familiar with Charlie Hebdo in January as I am now , but the Bataclan is a place I ve frequented and love . I regularly eat and drink around the Republique area that was also touched by this . The Stade de France is just up the canal from my place and such a familiar sight , I can t even comprehend what happened there .
