You know , like when guys dare each other to do something stupid ? say , take off their trousers , pull their underpants over their head and whistle the theme to Gilligan s Island ? except this must have been a group of female lawyers . Imagine it . A bar scene . ? Hillary ? Rodham Clinton to be says , Yeah , well , if you re so smart , I dare you to argue the pro life position , that the state has the right to force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term . And Camille O Rourke Lefkowitz responds , Oh , yeah ? Well , I dare you to shave your legs and join the ? Marines .
