It s been a long , hard road and I ve had a lot of disappointment and a lot of people who I thought were genuine who turned out to be disgraceful with their behaviour , said Hennessy . To have someone like Tyson , when the craic went sour he put his arm around me and said you believed in me when I needed it , and whatever it takes and whatever rollercoaster we get on , I ll be on it with you and if it means me fighting for nothing I ll do it . Hennessy s future as a big time promoter was questioned after his split with his former fighter Carl Froch , but he was visibly delighted to see his heavyweight star finally climb to the mantle of heavyweight champion of the world .
