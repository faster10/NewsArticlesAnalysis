It ' s a nation of laws . Lots and lots of written , otherwise stated , largely assumed , often implied , always religiously motivated laws . The country is a curious confluence of laws , divine and terrestrial . The country is caught in the grip of a clerical elite that takes its cues as much from the pages of an Orwellian dystopia as it does from the pages of any sacred text . This is what makes Iranian film so amazing . It is an industry and a culture that thrives to international acclaim and prestige in the face of all of those rules and laws ( or maybe because of them ) .
