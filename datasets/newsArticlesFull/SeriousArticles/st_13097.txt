The bombing campaign has also helped destroy the flow of illegal oil on which Isis has been building its proto state . It still makes about 1m a day from this oil , which renders it a rich terror organisation but a very poor state one that claims jurisdiction over 8 million people . Coalition strategy has also armed the anti Isis forces , somewhat patchily , but sufficiently enough to keep them in the field . A bombing strategy that took a long time to make a difference on the ground is now paying off as Isis is forced on to the defensive ? which is precisely why it has now added to its traditional military campaign the element of outright international terror against European soft targets .
