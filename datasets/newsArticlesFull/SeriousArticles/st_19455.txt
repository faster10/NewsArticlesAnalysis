In particular , Trump is attacking Fox News , which has enjoyed an odd existence as both a news source and the media gatekeeper for the Republican Party for more than a decade . So at 9 p . m . , Trump says he won t be at the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines as all the other top tier candidates hit the debate stage . Instead , he says he will be a few miles away , at Drake University in West Des Moines , holding a fundraiser for veterans that CNN has said it will cover live at least in part . It , and other news networks , pretty much have to cover Trump tonight . Because he s the news . Even Fox News says it s sending a crew to Trump s event , which creates the most surreal possibility of them all . Trump could go up on stage with a TV tuned to Fox News and the debate , and use the opportunity to simply make fun of the candidates as they talk , like a political Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Fox News , covering the event , would then be filming ( and eventually , airing ) footage of Trump watching Fox News . Talk about meta .
