The news that Schweinsteiger will also be out for weeks , added to the fact that Bayern ' s directors and sporting director Matthias Sammer couldn ' t find a way to incentivise Kroos now at Madrid to stay , means that Guardiola was bound to act . And decisively , too . Bayern was once the Euro elite club with the strictest transfer market and wage policy . But they ' ve just bought a man on the verge of turning 33 for what may well amount to 8million and to whom they ' ll pay a minimum of 8m in wages over two seasons . It ' s a risk . And couldn ' t they have used that much money to persuade Kroos to stay ? Or was there another reason for his exit ?
