Before you get all riled up , I understand that hospitals need money to run . The American Hospital Association reports that hospitals lost upward of 40 billion in unpaid bills in 2010 alone . I ' m not suggesting care should be given out freely or that hospitals should be forced to operate at a loss . But let ' s acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care , even in the emergency room . If they can ' t pay those bills , their credit can be ruined . Medical bills are a very significant cause of bankruptcy in this country .
