I would like to think so , but only time and box office receipts will tell , to be frank . She wasn t used to that . Going back over all her writing and filmmaking incarnations , that outsider perspective was the thing I was interested in mining . I thought at first that she was probably just pumping up her own reputation as a lesbian stud , but , in fact , her peers ? the women that she chased , many of whom actually did remain friendly with her ? confirmed those stories . Playing out with episodic inevitability , the plot feels schematic and obvious until the viewer realizes how expertly Haynes has drawn the viewer into Therese and Carol s feelings and desires . With married women , that was rarely possible .
