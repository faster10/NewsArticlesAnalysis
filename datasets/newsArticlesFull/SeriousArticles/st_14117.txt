Along with the families , we were buoyed elated , overjoyed by cases like Shawn Hornbeck , an 11 year old who disappeared from a country road near his parents ' home in Missouri in October 2002 and was found alive four years later . And whose parents never , ever gave up hoping . Elizabeth Smart , whom we found after she was held for nine months by a so called street preacher . Or the astounding case of Jaycee Lee Dugard , who was recovered after 18 long years and who was honored Tuesday night in one of those wonderful moments of synchronicity at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ' s annual Hope Awards .
