Trump continues to be a formidable candidate for the Republican nomination because he grants legitimacy to most basely racist notions of the GOP ? base . I spend a lot of time thinking about how we have arrived back at a moment rife with such overt antiblack racism . Many of us in the African American striver class had been convinced that while our society was still rife with covert racism and dogwhistle politics , that white Americans had evolved past the moment where they would dare express such explicit racial animus with no expectation of serious repercussion . These are not the same Republicans who forced Mississippi Senator Trent Lott to resign from his Senate Minority Leader position in 2002 , after making favorable comments about Strom Thurmond s run for the presidency .
