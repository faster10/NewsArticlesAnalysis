I think we could eliminate Ohio State because the Buckeyes have one good win all season , this past week against Michigan . Ohio State beat three teams with winning records Northern Illinois , Penn State , and Michigan all season . The Buckeyes would be in discussion because they have a good loss although that loss would diminish in quality quite a bit if Iowa wins and are the defending national champs . But I think an objective review of their resume , even with the impressive win over Michigan , eliminates them from legit selection here . ?
