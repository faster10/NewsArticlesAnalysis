Republican candidates say they want substance , but when they get substantive questions ( about the budget and the debt ceiling ) , they ignore them and refuse to answer . They say they want more interaction between the candidates on stage , but the second debate was pretty much designed to do just that ( CNN almost exclusively set up candidate versus candidate questions , and then showed both in a split screen , hoping for some juicy interaction ) . This format was loudly attacked after the second debate , however , so it ' s kind of hard to figure out what the Republicans really want at this point . Wimpy demands to pre approve on screen text aside , what exactly would they change ? At this point , it ' s anyone ' s guess , because no matter how the next debates are structured , there are bound to be lots of complaints , media bashing , and other assorted whining after they happen . Actually , make that " while they happen , " since the biggest " winners " from the last debate were the candidates who bashed the media the hardest during the debate .
