" When you localize it to the hunger strike it really is about the environment that is on campus . We have reactionary , negligent individuals on all levels at the university level on our campus and at the university system level , and so their job descriptions explicitly say that they ' re supposed to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students . . . but when we have issues of sexual assault , when we have issues of racism , when we have issues of homophobia , the campus climate continues to deteriorate because we don ' t have strong leadership , willing to actually make change . So , for me , I ' m fighting for a better tomorrow . As much as the experiences on campus have not been that great for me ? ? I had people call me the n word , I had someone write the n word on the a door in my residence hall ? ? for me it really is about a call for justice . I ' m fighting for the black community on campus , because justice is worth fighting for . And justice is worth starving for . "
