Cahill : I don ' t think it ' s any secret that he ' s not 100 percent confident about where he is with his game at the moment , but a lot of credit has to be given to Gilles Simon .

If you don ' t have the same weapons as your opponent , part of your job as a player is to bring down the level of your opponent ' s game . It ' s the players with a defeated attitude that don ' t go out there and give themselves the best opportunity .
