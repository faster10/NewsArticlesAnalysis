Nowhere did that emerge more clearly than in the most recent British and Canadian general elections , two countries with political traditions similar to that of the USA . In Britain , the outcome ( a parliamentary majority for the Conservatives ) marked the biggest polling upset since 1945 . The recent Canadian general election was similar in the sense that until the very end , the polling predicted an outcome very different from the one that actually occurred ( a solid victory by the Liberals ) . Why the British election polls were so far off is still under study . The Canadian election ones were misleading , it seems , because a lot of voters decided late , and they went heavily for the Liberals .
