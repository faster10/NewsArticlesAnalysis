If voter turnout stayed exactly as it did in 2008 ( impossible , I know , but hear me out ) then 11 , 000 some new voters would push the Aloha State out of last place for voter participation . Watch out West Virginia , Hawaii is coming for you . If 11 , 466 more people voted in the presidential election in Hawaii , then the state ' s turnout rate would hit 50 of the eligible population , based on numbers compiled by George Mason University ' s Michael McDonald on a site called the United States Election Project . That would push Hawaii past West Virginia , which had a 49 . 9 turnout .
