What happened with Tempt gave way to the Not Impossible Labs , a foundation and company with a simple idea . We ' ll create these devices with whatever we can coat hangers , duct tape , chewing gum . Essential to the process is what ' s called " open source " we give everything away , for free . We post the design on the Web and hope other people will pick it up and improve it . That ' s just what happened with the Eyewriter : A Samsung engineering team in South Korea saw the device and made a better one . Now Samsung , working with a government agency , is providing hundreds of those to ALS patients . And they ' ve " open sourced " their design as well so now anyone can make one , for around 50 bucks .
