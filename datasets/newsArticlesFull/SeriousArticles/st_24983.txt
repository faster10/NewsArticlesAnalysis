Both times I wanted us to come in and slip , Stevens said . Slip out of a pick and roll and just to play . Because you let those guys get set , they re so long they switch things , they make it really difficult on you as you saw even in the side outs . They re very physical . And we had the ball with unique time because all I would do is call something , get it in , and run the clock down . So obviously the first ? first ? regulation shot got blocked , so that s not as good as the second one . The second one was a great move , great look . If you got a chance to beat those guys on that look , I think you d take it every time .
