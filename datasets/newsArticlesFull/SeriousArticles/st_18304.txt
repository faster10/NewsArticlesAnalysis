In Bolli ' s study , published in The Lancet , 16 patients with severe heart failure received a purified batch of cardiac stem cells . Within a year , their heart function markedly improved . The heart ' s pumping ability can be quantified through the " Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction , " a measure of how much blood the heart pumps with each contraction . A patient with an LVEF of less than 40 is considered to suffer severe heart failure . When the study began , Bolli ' s patients had an average LVEF of 30 . 3 . Four months after receiving stem cells , it was 38 . 5 . Among seven patients who were followed for a full year , it improved to an astounding 42 . 5 . A control group of seven patients , given nothing but standard maintenance medications , showed no improvement at all .
