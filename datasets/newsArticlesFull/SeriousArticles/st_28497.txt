On the diversity question , one has to wonder if the Academy forgot all the fuss made last year when " Selma " was all but shut out . This year , the Academy overlooked two crowd pleasers in the best picture category , where there was room for up to 10 nominees : N . W . A . biopic " Straight Outta Compton , " which did get a best screenplay nod , and " Creed , " which got a nomination for Sylvester Stallone in the supporting actor category but was bypassed for director ( Oakland ' s Ryan Coogler ) and lead actor ( Michael B . Jordan ) .
