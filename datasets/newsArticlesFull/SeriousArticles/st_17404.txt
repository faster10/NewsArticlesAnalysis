France has the largest Muslim immigrant population in Europe ? a population that feels marginalised and angry at France s perceived rejection of religion , most particularly Islam . Certain Paris suburbs , known as ban lieues , are slums dominated by immigrants , and the large concrete housing projects are concentrations of poverty and social isolation . Many have been dubbed these areas incubators for terrorism . Unemployment among people of colour in France runs at twice the national average , and while the country s Muslim population is 8 , half the nation s prison population are Muslim men .
