" You know I ' m gonna tell you the truth , I think it ' s the hardest thing in the world to find an action person because its an indefinable thing . What makes an audience like a person ? Because it ' s not about muscles , because a lot of good action guys are not very muscular , they ' re not particularly good looking . There ' s something almost intangible and I don ' t know what it is , but I know it ' s very rare because there ' s only been about 15 action heroes I mean real serious ones in history . "
