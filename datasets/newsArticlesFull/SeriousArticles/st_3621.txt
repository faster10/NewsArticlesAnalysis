Same sex partners of military personnel are also denied dependent identification cards . This meant that when my partner was hospitalized in 2009 , I had no way of independently gaining access to the Navy hospital where he was treated without a special " hospital visitation authorization . " Moreover , whether my partner and I are married or not , today I would still have no access to the shops , gas stations or recreational facilities available to other military spouses on base . I would also not be entitled to spousal health care benefits if we are married .
