Osweiler did things in the offense that Manning hasn t been able to do . The bootleg pass was back , a staple of Broncos coach Gary Kubiak s offense through the years . His rushing offense also relies on the threat of the quarterback keeping the ball on outside zone run plays , and that has been missing . With Osweiler s mobility , the Broncos passed their season average for rushing yards in the third quarter . The Broncos , 29th in the NFL in rushing yardage and also with a lackluster 3 . 8 yards per carry coming in , had 170 rushing yards as a team on Sunday .
