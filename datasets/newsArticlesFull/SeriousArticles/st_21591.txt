The upstarts shall lead : This was the year the studios returned to the awards game in a big way . Every lot in town had one big contender , many of them more . The biggest ? Fox , which has three legitimate candidates " Joy , " " The Revenant and " The Martian " before you even get to its art house division , Fox Searchlight . Yet on Wednesday , Fox landed a grand total of one , for Leonardo DiCaprio in " Revenant . " Who got in instead ? Upstarts , upstarts everywhere . Netflix with " Beasts , " landing two nominations . Broad Green Pictures with two , for two different movies , Silverman in " I Smile Back " and Michael Shannon in " 99 Homes . " Bleecker Street with three , courtesy of " Trumbo . " Sure , Universal had a good day courtesy of " Compton " and two noms for " Steve Jobs . " Still , it used to be that the established players made waves on big nomination mornings and the newbies sat on the sidelines . No longer .
