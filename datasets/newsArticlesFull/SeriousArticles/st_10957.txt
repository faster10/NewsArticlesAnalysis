Maybe the Cincinnati Bengals mascot is a black cat , or perhaps Marvin Lewis broke a mirror on his way to the field at Paul Brown Stadium , because the football gods did not do him any favors in trying to get his first playoff win . The Bengals already had their work cut out for them with starting quarterback Andy Dalton was already on the sidelines with a broken thumb . Back up quarterback A . J . McCarron had to battle an aggressive Pittsburgh Steelers defense and a driving rain storm certainly not the best conditions to break an 0 6 playoff record for Lewis with Cincinnati .
