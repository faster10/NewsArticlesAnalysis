" Returning director Francis Lawrence finds interesting visual moments , even in the underground bunker , " Duralde writes . " At one point , Katniss looks down on rows and rows of rebels climbing down , down , down a metallic triangular staircase , and it ' s like something out of " Metropolis . " That ' s a pretty bold quotation to make for a film that ' s also about a proletariat revolution , but even if " Mockingjay " isn ' t on the level of that silent classic , it ' s not an altogether inappropriate reference point .
