Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was one of the first pay tribute on Twitter : " Very sad to hear that Alan Rickman has passed away . One of the greatest actors of his generation . My thoughts are with his family friends . " In April last year , the much loved actor had revealed he had married his partner of 50 years , Rima Horton , in secret . The pair had been in a relationship since they met at the Chelsea College of Art and Design , when he was 19 and she was 18 . His death comes ahead of the release of a new film called ' Eye In The Sky ' in April , in which he stars alongside Dame Helen Mirren .
