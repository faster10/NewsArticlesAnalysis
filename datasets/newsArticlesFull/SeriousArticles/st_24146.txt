The Chiefs have a number of playmakers but none more explosive than their leading receiver , Jeremy Maclin , a key free agent signing during the offseason . He finished the regular season with 87 catches for 1 , 088 yards and eight touchdowns . Kansas City has been without its star running back , Jamaal Charles who was lost for the season when he tore his ACL on Oct . 11 versus the Bears , but the young trio of Charcandrick West , Spencer Ware and Knile Davis have stepped up nicely , combining for 1 , 535 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground .
