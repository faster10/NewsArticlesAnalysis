" When I first came in the league , it was fun playing against Smitty ( Steve Smith ) , Dikembe ( Mutombo ) , and those guys , " said Bryant . " I enjoyed those moments . . . and trying to go to the rim to challenge Mount Mutumbo . Those were always fun moments . I remember during one of the All Star events ( 2003 , Philips Arena ) and Dikembe was there . My youngest daughter was with me , and I said ' That ' s Dikembe Mutumbo . ' And she looks at him and I ' m not sure if she understands who he is . ' He ' s one of the best defenders of all time . Let ' s go say hello to him . ' So we go over to him and he says , ' Hey , how are you doing ? ' And he put his hand out to shake her hand , and she looks at him and she goes , ' No , no , no . ' And we both just fell out laughing . She knows him from the commercials . . . she doesn ' t know him from basketball . "
