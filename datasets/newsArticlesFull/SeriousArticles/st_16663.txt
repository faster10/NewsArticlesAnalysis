The last time the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers met was on December 20 at Heinz Field . The game was a perfect illustration of two halves that looked like separate matches altogether . After allowing the Broncos to get a large first half lead , the Steelers defense adjusted to shutout the Broncos for a 34 27 win . With memories of the 2006 AFC Championship game in the minds of many , the Broncos look to get revenge for the loss during the regular season as well as the opportunity to redeem themselves after allowing Pittsburgh to use them as a stepping stone to Super Bowl XL in Detroit .
