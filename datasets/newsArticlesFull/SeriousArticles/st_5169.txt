Curry is pretty good , but Golden State is much more than just their superstar . If it s not Curry , then Klay Thompson ( a game time decision for Friday night s tilt ) is knocking down shots , averaging 18 . 2 points per contest . If Thompson is out it would make life much easier for the Celtics , but they d still have their hands full with Draymond Green , a candidate for the MVP Not Named Curry award the NBA should also give out at the end of the season . The versatile big man is doing a whole lot of everything to start this season , averaging 13 . 4 points , 8 . 5 rebounds and seven assists for Golden State .
