When I followed Ed Miliband during the election , his minders were so terrified of another bacon sandwich style moment they tried to minimise his contact with the press ( sometimes sending the media bus is completely the wrong direction . ) When I finally bagged my interview , I squeezed him hard on his pressure points , asking if he was too left wing to be PM , why he wasn ' t being straight with the public about a deal with the SNP , whether he regretted knifing his brother if he was going to lose anyway . He was forced to come out swinging and it ended up being one of his best interviews . All that was left for his aides to worry about is that we filmed him getting on the bus before me , when as a gentleman he apparently should have let the lady get on first !
