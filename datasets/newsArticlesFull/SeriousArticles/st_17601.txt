" While this book is for children , the horror movie that we ' re making out of it I think hopefully captures how scary those books were when you were a kid but is not strictly a kids movie , " he explained . " In fact , you should not take certain younger kids for this movie . I can ' t actually take the art into the house , because if my daughter saw it , we would have nightmares . We ' re aiming for a PG 13 the same way that I loved ' Poltergeist ' and ' The Ring , ' movies that aren ' t gory , but man they can freak the bejesus out of you . "
