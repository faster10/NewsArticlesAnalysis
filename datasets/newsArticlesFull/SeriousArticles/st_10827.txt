Of course , you can t blame everything on Gervais . He might ve failed to shock anyone , but when the Globes did manage to surprise us , that was a problem , too . Mozart in the Jungle , a show that EW s own Jeff Jensen panned , beat the critically adored Transparent for best comedy series , leading most of America to Google What is Mozart in the Jungle ? ( Sadly , it s not a biopic about the composer s lost years in the Amazon . ) The Martian trumped Trainwreck in the best comedy or musical film category , despite the fact that it s neither a musical nor a comedy . Aziz Ansari , a nominee for his performance in Master of None , would ve gotten one of the night s biggest laughs when he hid behind a book called Losing to Jeffrey Tambor With Dignity ? except he ultimately lost to Mozart star Gael Garc a Bernal . When the HFPA did get things right ? yay for Mr Robot , Taraji P . Henson , Rachel Bloom , and Maura Tierney ! ? it was such an anomaly , you d be forgiven for imagining that fsociety , the anarchist group behind Mr Robot , had hacked into the system and changed the votes .
