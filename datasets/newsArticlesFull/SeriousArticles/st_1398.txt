Gurira : What you have to do as an artist is invest your character with as much life and dimension , and stick to what ' s written . You stay true to that you don ' t think " let me make this character someone to look up to . " I don ' t know how to play that . All you can do is function in the character that ' s been crafted . However she resonates , I just have to go with that . You really can ' t bank on that . The beauty of the show is that and I share this with her we ' re not people pleasers .
