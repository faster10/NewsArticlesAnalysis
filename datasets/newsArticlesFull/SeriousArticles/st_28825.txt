DHS has expanded the program by partnering with cities , states , universities and private businesses , including the transportation , hospitality and retail sectors , to raise awareness for the " If You See Something , Say Something " campaign . In each sector , we have provided materials and collaborated on advertisements to help engage and educate the public as well as those working behind the scenes . The campaign has also forged a strong partnership with sports in every part of the country , including auto racing and college athletics .
