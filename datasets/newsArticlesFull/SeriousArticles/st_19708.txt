It ' s really striking that I went from being a " suspicious driver " to being the " hero " who helped Gabby . It ' s one of the reasons that I ' m so vocal about staying in Arizona and doing what I can do here . I love Arizona . But if Latinos aren ' t here to fix these problems , then it ' s never going to be done . It ' ll only get worse . The demographics will change soon the Latino population will soon be the majority , but we need institutions to facilitate that . I want to show that we ' re here and we care just as much as you do about making Arizona a better place to live for everyone .
