I write to inform you that pending further discussion between the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) and our presidential campaigns , we are suspending the partnership with NBC News for the Republican primary debate at the University of Houston on February 26 , 2016 , Mr Priebus wrote . The RNC s sole role in the primary debate process is to ensure that our candidates are given a full and fair opportunity to lay out their vision for America s future . We simply cannot continue with NBC without full consultation with our campaigns .
