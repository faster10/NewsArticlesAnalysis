What I bring to your attention is there is no historical precedent for solving this problem because the quarrel of these people is not with the government and people of Afghanistan . We are fighting on behalf of all of you but we are the ones , who are daily suffering some of the worst atrocities , including the butchering of our young children and our elderly , totally innocent , totally unharmful , but theater has become a part of this . The second issue is , unfortunately , these terrorists groups are not going to be a short term challenge . I want to pay tribute to all the victims of terrorists , particularly in the recent events , Istanbul , Paris , Sharm el Sheik ? the Russian plane ? Mali , San Bernardino , it goes on . We do have a problem , it s a global and a regional problem and it requires us to focus on it systematically and coherently .
