I am a civil rights and climate justice organizer . I have been working at the United Nations through the World Conference Against Racism in Durban in 2001 , the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 . I have spent the last year reading every version of the U . N . Durban Draft , and have attended , along with Strategy Center Associate Director Barbara Lott Holland , two preparatory UNFCCC meetings in Bonn , Germany in May and October . I have spoken with hundreds of representatives of world governments and international NGOs . Based on this investigation and assessment I am deeply troubled by President Obama ' s role in this process and want to put forth some positive and necessary programmatic proposals .
