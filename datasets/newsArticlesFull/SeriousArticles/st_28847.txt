Although Yatsenyuk ' s political party is so unpopular that it wouldn ' t get into parliament if an election were held this week , it ' s an important part of the coalition . And if the prime minister loses his job , there is likely to be a snap election . The outcome would be hard to predict : Recent local elections empowered both the remnants of the pre revolutionary regime and some dangerous extreme nationalists . The U . S . administration clearly doesn ' t want such turmoil : It wants the current parliament to pass laws making it possible to hold elections in areas held by pro Russian rebels . Biden assured Ukrainian legislators of continued U . S . support against Russia , and got a standing ovation , but his real purpose was to convince the Ukrainian leaders to stick to the Minsk compromise with President Vladimir Putin , end the armed conflict and reintegrate the east of the country into Ukraine , even on terms favorable to Russia .
