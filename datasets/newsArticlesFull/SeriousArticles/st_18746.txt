Minnesota is young like , really young and Towns will be featured in the post as the T Wolves attempt to establish an identity . His pick and roll game with Ricky Rubio will be extra notable as a result . Finally , under the tutelage of teammate Kevin Garnett , the 7 foot Towns will learn how to become a pro , the importance of which cannot be understated in today ' s NBA .

( Remember , he shot below 40 percent in summer league . )
