There ' s a film festival that Will Smith and Meryl Streep are affiliated with the Giffoni Film Festival . It ' s a film festival for kids . They never show documentaries , only feature films that appeal to kids , right ? But with " America the Beautiful " , the Giffoni Film Festival made an exception to let a documentary in there . I went to the screening , and I was terrified that my film was going to put all these kids in a comatose state . We went to the awards presentation , and they announced the audience award and called our name . I went into shock . Here are kids voting a documentary as their favorite film in this big film festival . That was literally my proudest moment .
