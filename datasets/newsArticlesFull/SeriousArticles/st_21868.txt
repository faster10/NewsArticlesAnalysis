David Bowie landed on the floating space debris of my consciousness with his big album " Let ' s Dance " the album that made him the kind of rock star that was no longer an asteroid but almost just a planet . Yes , I know the voice behind Ziggy Stardust was already big . Yes , I already had a passing acquaintance with his big hits through my college age brothers , but for me those albums were the music of the guys that used to terrorize me with threats and bullying and mean ness . This album felt like it was a message in a bottle intended just for me .
