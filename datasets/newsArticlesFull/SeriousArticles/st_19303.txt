Last month ? in the wake of the Paris attacks ? Republicans united in opposition to America accepting Syrian refugees . The Statue of Liberty says bring us your tired and your weary , declared former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee . It didn t say bring us your terrorists and let them come in here and bomb neighborhoods , caf s , and concert halls . Sen . Rand Paul also used the attacks as a justification for refusing refugees . I think Paris should wake us up to the fact that we can t just let anyone come to this country , he said .
