One should keep in mind that throughout Egypt ' s modern history , the Egyptian military has had overwhelming public support . That continued through the military transitional governing period of 2011 2012 . Even at the height of anti military sentiment , Gallup recorded that public confidence in the institution remained well over 85 , and at some points exceeded 90 . That figure may be less now , as pro Morsy supporters may feel resentment towards the military for having removed him from power but it is still likely to be at least over 80 .
