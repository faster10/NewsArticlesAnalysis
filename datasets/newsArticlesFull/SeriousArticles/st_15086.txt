This week I m back in my hometown meeting with , listening to faith leaders across the state to strategize about where they are going from here . ? One thing is certain : we re not going anywhere good without a working democratic process , where the voices and votes of Flint residents count , and where cost cutting is not placed above the lives of Flint s children and adults . The African American Ministers Leadership Council , nationally and locally , will be a part of the revitalization of Flint . We can ' t change the past , but we certainly can make sure my great nieces and nephews , now 2 5 years old , know we fought for them , for human rights , environmental justice and true democracy !
