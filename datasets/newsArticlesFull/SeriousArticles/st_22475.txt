And this is a deployment worth soft pedaling in any event . The Australian press duly pointed out that one of the four Russian vessels was an oceangoing tugboat , sent along in case one of the combatant ships suffers a mechanical breakdown or some other cataclysm . Dispatching a tug as a matter of routine betokens a navy less than confident in its hardware , material upkeep and basic seamanship . U . S . Navy expeditionary forces don ' t travel with tugboats . We don ' t expect to break down at sea . The same goes for the Royal Australian Navy and the other highly professional services fielded by America ' s allies .
