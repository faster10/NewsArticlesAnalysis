Well , I would say Marco Rubio has been out there talking about how Muslims have not been discriminated against . That is just not factually true . You ve seen Jeb Bush make some comments , problematic comments about Muslims and sort of what restrictions should be put in place , Psaki said . It s not just that this isn t who we are as a country , this is also sending a message overseas that we are ? we re for restrictions , we re for , you know , kind of preventing a community from really flourishing in the United States . That s not who we are , and that s exactly the kind of message that s strengthening ISIL and their recruitment overseas . "
