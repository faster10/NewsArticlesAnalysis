On the other hand , the majors ' strengthening of the hub and spoke networks ( by which travelers go from A to B via a hub in airport C ) imply that entry into new markets what in the industry is called " city pairs " is relatively simple . All a major needs to do is to start service between one hub and a given city to have service to hundreds of new city pairs , all prior existing cities being suddenly connected to a new destination . So if an airline attempts to gouge its customers on a particular destination , other airlines with reasonably located hubs will have a strong incentive to add such destination to their networks , frustrating the gouging airline ' s ability to raise prices .
