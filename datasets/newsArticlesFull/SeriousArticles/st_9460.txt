I learned the rejuvenating and transformative power of dreams firsthand . After my life saving surgeries at 18 years old , I gained life back after my coma , but lost the only world I knew . Defeated , my " inspiration " became worn . and my imagination lost its bubbliness , fizzling into " survival mode . " Eventually , through my dreams , I learned to re trust those buried away fantasies and ideas in my mind , and allow them to send me soaring for the day , taking a risk and daring to believe again . Dreams reminded that " Amy " was still in there . I dreamed my " aliveness " until I felt that aliveness in my body and flesh . It took time , but thankfully , dreams are an ever renewing source a source that rebuilt my faith .
