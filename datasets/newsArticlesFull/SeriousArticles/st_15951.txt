If the US or her allies go into certain places in Syria to target ISIS , they will likely run into conflict with Russia , Iran and Assad ' s forces , something that could result in accidental clashes . Additionally , if the US and or her allies go into Syria to try to remove Assad , they have to contend not only with Russia and Iran but also ISIS who would love to have US troops on the ground in Syria . Having said that , it is not the policy of the US military to avoid going into places where our soldiers face danger . We avoid it when we can to preserve life , but we do it when necessary when our vital national security interests are at stake .
