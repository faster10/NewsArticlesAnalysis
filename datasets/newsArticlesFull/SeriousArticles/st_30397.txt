So what are Boehner ' s options at this point ? He could , as he has done previously , pass a funding bill on the backs of House Democrats . The 2011 and 2012 omnibus spending bills , the 2011 Budget Control Act , and the 2012 Payroll Tax Bill all passed the House because of Democratic support . And earlier this year , Boehner brought the Violence Against Women Act and the Hurricane Sandy Relief bill to the floor , despite opposition from a majority of House Republicans . These bills had bipartisan support in the Senate , making it difficult for Boehner to dig his heels in and stand behind his conservative majority .
