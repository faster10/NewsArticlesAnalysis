The 30 year old outfielder was viewed as a rental from the moment he arrived at the July 31 non waiver trading deadline , but then he morphed into Hank Aaron for nearly two months . Cespedes had a rough postseason , both offensively and defensively , making it easy to believe the organization will move on if it can t get him to accept a deal shorter than the five or six years he might land on the open market . Because of the way Cespedes contract is structured , the Mets will not receive draft pick compensation if he departs .
