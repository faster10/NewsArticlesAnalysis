Edmund Chua of Singapore Maestro ' s voice was truly a blessing . That exciting , that fascinating quality , that , sigh . . . too many adjectives . Of course , there was that unforgettable personality . Personally , ( don ' t know if this is a right thing to say but ) I saw Italy in him , so to speak , always loving life . Knew he was fighting cancer but always thought he ' d recover . I was hoping I ' d be able to watch him live but I guess it ' ll only be in the footage . He ' s indeed a legend lost , a legacy remembered . . . . We ' ll miss him .
