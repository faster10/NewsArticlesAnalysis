Cruz is the only challenger to Trump who has gotten any kind of traction , but his rise has been overwhelmingly on the right , a path that numerous insurgents have taken and failed in . Maybe he ' ll succeed this time ? but why assume that Trump will be easier to defeat in this manner than candidates who were manifestly more disliked by the rank and file GOP electorate ? Isn ' t it more likely that , if voters in New York or Pennsylvania see their choice as " Trump or Cruz or some loser , " they ' ll mostly go for the angry but non doctrinaire Trump ?
