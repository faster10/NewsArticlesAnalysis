Still , the monetisation scheme may gather some 20 25 tonnes of gold in the next six months , as the minimum deposit limit has been brought down to just 30 grams and depositors will get up to a 2 . 5 interest annually , said analysts . This will be a huge improvement upon the old monetisation scheme , launched in 1999 , under which only about 20 tonnes of gold was mobilised so far , as the interest rates were less than 1 and the minimum threshold of deposit was as high as 500 grams . Even SBI s gold scheme could manage to garner only about 8 tonnes despite the existence over the years . Under the gold bond scheme , apart from a 2 . 75 annual interest , the investors can potentially gain from an appreciation of gold price .
