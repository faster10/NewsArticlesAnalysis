Boston College said Tuesday that 80 students , including members of the men ' s basketball team , have fallen ill after eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant in Boston ' s Cleveland Circle , upping the initial count from Monday . Chipotle says there ' s no " evidence to suggest that this incident is related to the previous E . coli incident , " which has been linked to 52 cases across nine states , though none in Massachusetts , Forbes reports . " There are no reports of illness from any other restaurants , and the pattern here looks like norovirus isolated to one restaurant , " spokesman Chris Arnold told Reuters .
