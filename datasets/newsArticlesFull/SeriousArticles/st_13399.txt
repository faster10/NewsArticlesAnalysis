So it seems to be more common that people sit in their seat , and they want to just stay in their zone , and you ' ve kind of purchased your tiny piece of space on the plane and you ' re trying not to trespass . And so no , there has been very little conversation . And on 101 flights , I ' ve had exactly three people , ever , ask me questions about what I was up to . And I think in part that ' s because I ' m fairly stealthy about what I ' m doing . I mean , I think that . . . the camera phone is important because I essentially kind of look like a bored person trying to pass the time . I ' m just kind of taking these random looking snapshots of things in front of me . And I really don ' t want it to look like I ' m making art . I want it to look like , in fact , I do sort of want it to look like I ' m a bored person . So the very thing I ' m trying not to be sort of becomes my alibi in a strange way .
