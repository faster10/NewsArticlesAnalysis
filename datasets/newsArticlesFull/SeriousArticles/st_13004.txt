Ten years earlier , as a journalist , I had covered the 1991 case of gay couples in Hawaii who sued for the right to marry . Opponents would successfully persuade 38 state legislatures and the federal government to bar recognition of same sex marriages out of concern that they would be made legal . I ' d watched this fight firsthand and wanted no part of it . We had made our private commitment in the absence of legal benefits and divorced ourselves from the ongoing public fight . I was a journalist who wanted to see every side of this debate , not become a part of it .
