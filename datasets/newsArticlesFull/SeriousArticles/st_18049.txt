5 . Polling places can ' t be trusted : That ' s the feeling at least on the Big Island of Hawaii . During the primary election this year , some polling places opened an hour and a half late because voter registries hadn ' t been delivered to the polling stations . The state is stepping in to try to make sure November elections are conducted with more professionalism . But I met a sous chef in Hilo who said that ' s too little , too late . He doesn ' t trust the polls because he had so much trouble voting before .
