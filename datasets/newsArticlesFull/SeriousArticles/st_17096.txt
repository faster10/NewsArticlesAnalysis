Investigators believe Malik radicalized before meeting Farook , FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said Tuesday , though she didn t elaborate on what led the FBI to that conclusion . Farook , 28 , a restaurant inspector born in the US to a Pakistani family , radicalized before Malik , 29 , emigrated to the US from Pakistan in July 2014 on a fianc e visa and married him the next month . America s counterterrorism infrastructure has had success flagging individuals who try to travel abroad to fight alongside militants , fund operations overseas or who communicate online with overseas terrorists . But it s been far more challenging for law enforcement to identify each and every individual who self radicalizes online , a process the Islamic State has facilitated with slick Internet propaganda aimed at the disaffected .
