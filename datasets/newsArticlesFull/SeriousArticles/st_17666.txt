The North American Meat Institute , an industry group , called the WHO report " dramatic and alarmist overreach , " and it mocked the panel ' s previous work , which treats coffee , sunlight and wine as potential cancer hazards . The WHO panel " says you can enjoy your yoga class , but don ' t breathe air ( Class I carcinogen ) , sit near a sun filled window ( Class I ) , apply aloe vera ( Class 2B ) if you get a sunburn , drink wine or coffee ( Class I and Class 2B ) , or eat grilled food ( Class 2A ) , " said Betsy Booren , vice president of scientific affairs for the group . " We simply don ' t think the evidence supports any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer , " said Shalene McNeill , executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen ' s Beef Association .
