In one of the oddest dynamics of any primary election , both Trump and Cruz are fighting to see who can get the most " anti endorsements " ( disendorsements ? unendorsements ? ) from the bigwigs in their party . The Republican establishment seems torn between its fear and loathing of Trump and its white hot hatred of Cruz . The well respected governor of Iowa denounced Cruz ( probably for his lack of support for the ethanol program which is a honking big deal in Iowa ) , while a prominent conservative magazine devoted an entire issue to being " Against Trump . " Both men proudly wear such denouncements on their sleeves , as badges of honor which sounds bizarre , but might be exactly what the GOP voters are looking for this time around . Republican bigwigs are so distracted with making the agonizing choice which candidate to denounce that they ' ve failed to get behind any of their preferred candidates , which has left a scramble among Jeb Bush , Marco Rubio , Chris Christie , and John Kasich to see who is strongest . Because of this split effort , none of these candidates ( with the possible exception of Rubio ) has much chance of doing very well in Iowa ( the big race for the establishment candidate slot will really come in New Hampshire , a week after Iowa votes ) .
