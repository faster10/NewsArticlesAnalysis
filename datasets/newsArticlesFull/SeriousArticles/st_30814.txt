A . S . : I don t know if you re necessarily stuck recruiting from your own backyard . Thanks to Saban and Miles , LSU has become a national brand . Having a more sizable presence in Texas is a must , but I think there s an opportunity to extend the program s reach even further . Just look at Alabama , which has had no problem going to California or Maryland for top recruits . Don t tell me LSU can t do the same . Georgia has that ability too ( see : Jacob Eason ) , but I see LSU as the trendier school right now .
