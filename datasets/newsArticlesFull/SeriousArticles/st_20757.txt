RICHARD HAASS , PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : Well , we ought to make clear to everybody that the next Korean War , if one were ever to happen , is going to be the last Korean War because it ' s going to end with a unified peninsula , and it ' s go to be under Seoul , not Pyongyang . And that will hopefully make the North Korean leadership think twice . Also , though , a lot of this message is aimed at Beijing . Probably three quarter of North Korea ' s trade still transit Chinese territory . If there ' s any country that has the capacity not to control North Korea , but to influence North Korea , it ' s still China . The Chinese always say they have very little influence . They have more than they say they do . We should put pressure on them to do it and there ' s finally , Bob , we ' re seeing the first signs of a little bit of Chinese disaffection . At some point they ' re getting tired of the antics of this country . This is a dangerous ally for China to have . And the more Chinese can pressure them and put the economic screws on them , the better it will be for everybody .
