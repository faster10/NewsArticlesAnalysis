The Ducks haven ' t been embarrassed much this season , but the 70 57 Pac 12 opening loss to the Beavers was certainly an eye opener . The Ducks were playing well before that game and then they were beat soundly by the Beavers . And since then , they ' ve responded . The Ducks have gone 5 1 since that game , recording wins against Cal , Stanford , at Utah , USC and UCLA . It ' s put them in a position where a win Thursday against the Wildcats at McKale , where Arizona has won 50 consecutive ? games , would still be an upset , but it wouldn ' t come as a complete shocker .
