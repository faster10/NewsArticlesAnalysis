Gibson : Actually , it takes place in the year before it was published . Literally in the year in which it was written . A speculative novel of the very recent past . Historically , it will be seen as having taken place before the Murdochalypse Hackgate era . So Bigend ' s warning to Hollis , to assume all phones in the UK are tapped , will have a little sheen of prescience . But I ' m not really shooting for prescience . I ' m trying to realistically describe the inherently fantastic world we live in .
