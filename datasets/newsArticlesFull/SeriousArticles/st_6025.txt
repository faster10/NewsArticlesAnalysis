Swimming remains my weakest link . I just learned to swim last summer . Sometimes I forget that and don ' t cut myself any slack or recognize how far I ' ve come . Once my formal swim class ended in February I found myself seriously slacking on my swim training . Enter my swim angels , Lovie Twine and Eanista Bailey . They took me out into Lake Michigan last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory " swim " ( which was really just wading ) . It was great to have them join me for a swim workout . I appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching .
