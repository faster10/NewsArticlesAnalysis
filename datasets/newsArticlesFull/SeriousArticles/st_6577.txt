The leaders for the Patriots are taking the blame for the loss , but anyone who watched could see that it wouldn t matter much when Von Miller was running right around Cannon and collapsing the pocket from behind Brady . You have 5 linemen and it looked like 3 were only trying to protect the middle leaving the Broncos best linemen one on one with guys who could not engage them fast enough off the line . Add on that Stork s head bob was tipping the snap counts and you have a recipe for a bad game .
