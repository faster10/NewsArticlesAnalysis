Cruz represents an extremist wing of the GOP that can ' t seem to govern . Since the emergence of the tea party in 2009 , the Republican Party has been shaped by a group of politicians who have been willing to employ extraordinarily aggressive tactics in the pursuit of cuts to domestic spending . Nobody has symbolized this style of leadership more than Cruz . He led the drumbeat to shut down the federal government to force President Obama ' s hand on spending and has favored the Republican refusal to raise the debt ceiling . Cruz has also been a master of the filibuster , employing variations of the tactic to bring the Senate to a standstill .
