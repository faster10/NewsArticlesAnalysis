Without going into the details of what ISIS is and where it did erupt from , it s an absolute reality that ISIS is a direct or indirect outcome of the policies of US and allies in the region . These policies are meant for securing vested economic and strategic interests by toppling , replacing and controlling regimes . The big powers are fighting proxy wars by giving arms and ammunition to their respective pawns , exploiting their ignorance and sectarian differences . The ultimate losers are the millions of innocent men , women and children who were either buried under the tons of debris , left paralyzed to live a miserable life , or remained homeless wandering across international borders for shelter .
