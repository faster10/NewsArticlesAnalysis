Republicans would have a couple of responses to this objection . The first is that if you ' re going to cut everyone ' s taxes , of course the wealthy will benefit more , because they pay at higher rates and their incomes are higher . As Rubio himself said during the debate , " 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand . So yeah , someone who makes more money , numerically , it ' s going to be higher . " But there ' s no requirement that if you ' re going to cut taxes you have to give everyone the same percentage reduction .
