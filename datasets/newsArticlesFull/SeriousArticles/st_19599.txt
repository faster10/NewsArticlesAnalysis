The former sceptic Crispin Blunt , the Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee , said his mind had been changed by the attacks on Paris , and the subsequent potential to form a unified front against Isis . It is in the latter field that Britain s move on to a war footing will have most impact , and Mr Blunt is right to say that playing a full role in the coalition will better help Britain shape the politics . ( Indeed , for the air strikes to have any military impact whatsoever , additional spotters should be deployed to flag up targets on the ground . The scarcity of such information has long hamstrung the US and French air forces . )
