Third , India needs a complementary but nuanced approach to ensure that such a review , update and stocktaking process maintains pressure on industrialised countries with much higher levels of total cumulative emissions over time , and far higher per capita emissions , and is not used to pressure India . The latter is a real concern ? our review of existing studies suggests that even with India s ambitious renewable energy targets , coal fired electricity will provide the majority of our electric power at least through 2030 . The principle of common but differentiated responsibility , and the differentiation that flows from it , will need to be thoughtfully articulated and operationalised to ensure that India has the necessary carbon space to develop . Although the template provided by the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol for differentiated responsibility has served India well thus far , given the fundamentally different conceptual architecture of the 2015 agreement and the realpolitik , a more tailored approach to differentiation is now necessary .
