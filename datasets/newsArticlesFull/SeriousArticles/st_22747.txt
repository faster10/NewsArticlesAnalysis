A group backed by real estate interests called Homeowners Against the Land Trust began picketing City Hall . They red baited Sanders and other democratic socialist officials , claiming they were seizing land and betraying sacrosanct property rights . When a developer offered to build 40 new homes on a vacant parcel in the North End and donate them to the trust , HALT showed up in force at Planning Commission hearings .

The group s heated protests eventually forced the developer to only give seven of the homes to the trust , even though all 40 were built .
