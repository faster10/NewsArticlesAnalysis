The European mechanism that was supposed to solve this problem with refugees is the Dublin Regulation , which came into force in 1997 and has been amended several times since .

As envisioned , the agreement would ' ve meant that potential refugees wouldn ' t flow freely across Europe ' s internal borders , but would stay put waiting for their asylum applications to be processed .
