And that is exactly where we sit today . As I listen to the Occupy Wall Street protesters and watch as their protest spread across the country , similar to the lunch counter sit ins that spread like wildfire across the South in 1960 , the goals and ideals sound eerily familiar . While in the 1960s it was about race , the civil rights battlefront today is about class . It is about the widening gap between the rich and poor , and how the middle class is being pushed down to the poor , rather than being helped upward .
