2 . New school vs . old school : Super Bowl 50 could also be a referendum on style points . Manning is your classic , dropback , pocket passer viewed as the ultimate field general who allows his play to speak for itself . Panthers counterpart Cam Newton is the deserved MVP front runner , even if his " look at me " dab TD celebrations and cocky persona have drawn the ire of opponents and many fans alike . The personalities of their leading men are also indicative of each team ' s personality . Denver has a veteran laden roster that largely takes it cues from team leaders like Manning and OLB DeMarcus Ware . The Panthers ' brash persona dabbing , bats on the field , group photos on the sideline before games end largely stems from Newton and all pro CB Josh Norman .
