" Hey look , if you ' re a fastball and that ' s your main pitch , that ' s what you ' re throwing . What you ' ve got to do is make good pitches with it . So we ' re not going to change the way we go about things . We ' ve still got to pitch to our strength and our strength is power . And so we ' ll use that and then we ' ll change speeds and throw strikes and again , if you make quality pitches , your chance for success is gonna rise . That ' s what we ' ve done , we ' ve made big pitches when we ' ve needed to . "
