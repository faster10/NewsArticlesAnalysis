A senior BJP leader told Firstpost that Outlook ? ? ? would now be served a rebuttal and a notice ? ? ? either by Rajnath Singh ? ? ? s office or by someone from the BJP . ? ? ? It had not come to our notice so far , at least the Home minister was not aware of publication any such statement attributed to him . The magazine and the writer concerned will have to do a lot of explaining . Do you imagine if he had actually said so this would have become big national and even international headline ? It could not have been noticed only by the writer in Outlook magazine . ? ? ?
