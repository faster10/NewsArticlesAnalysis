Buhari this month was in Yola to decorate soldiers for bravery in the counter insurgency as well as visit a camp for people displaced by six years of violence that has left at least 17 , 000 people dead . He told troops he believed Boko Haram " are very close to defeat " and urged soldiers " to remain vigilant , alert and focused to prevent Boko Haram from sneaking into our communities to attack soft targets " . Red Cross official Aliyu Maikano and residents said the area targeted was a lorry park which also houses a livestock market , an open air restaurant and a mosque . The area was immediately cordoned off but poor power supply in Yola meant the rescue effort was conducted in near darkness .
