Fury s promoter , Mick Hennessy , insisted his man was only quoting scripture . He also stressed his fighter is far more intelligent and nuanced than he is often perceived . He is a smart kid , said Hennessy . He can talk on any subject you want , even though he is someone who didn t have a formal education . He has old fashioned values . He s got morals . He s generous with his time . He s generous with his money . He also needs to be respected and appreciated . Because he is such fun . He s larger than life .
