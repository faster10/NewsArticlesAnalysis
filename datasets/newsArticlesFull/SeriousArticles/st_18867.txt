What do they need to fix first ? The defense . The Redskins will bring back Junior Galette , but he ' s coming off a torn Achilles and there ' s no guarantee he ' ll provide what they hoped he would before the injury . The Redskins need more youth along the defensive line , which they definitely know . Their lack of pressure over the last three quarters Sunday proved to be a big difference and they failed to get off blocks and make stops when the Packers spread the field and ran . Jason Hatcher turns 34 in July and it ' s uncertain if he ' ll be back after dealing with knee issues the past two seasons . They have a decision to make with nose tackle Terrance Knighton , who did not perform the way they had hoped . And they still have questions at safety : Is DeAngelo Hall a legit option or will they look to add someone else to pair with Dashon Goldson ( who will need to re work his contract thanks to a cap hit that jumps to 8 million next season ) ?
