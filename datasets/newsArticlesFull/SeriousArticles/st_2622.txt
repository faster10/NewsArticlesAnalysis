Women prefer personality to looks . As a woman , I know this to be very true . But I also know it ' s a tough one for men to swallow . Obviously , in the first five seconds , she judges a man based on his looks . But after that , something interesting happens : A man ' s face shifts according to how he makes a woman feel . A hot man can become hideous , and an average looking man can become the sexiest guy in the room . What women are really attracted to has nothing to do with appearance . It has to do with the character a man projects . A man who is calm , cool , collected , comfortable and confident will trump an Abercrombie model every time .
