The announcement comes amid concern that the West has struggled to respond quickly enough to the speed of Russian aggression in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East . Cameron will also reverse the decision to axe nine Nimrod maritime patrol jets , which was one of the most controversial aspects of the 2010 spending review . They will now be replaced with nine new submarine hunter Boeing P8 maritime patrol aircraft , which are equipped with torpedoes , sonar buoys and a suite of sensors .
