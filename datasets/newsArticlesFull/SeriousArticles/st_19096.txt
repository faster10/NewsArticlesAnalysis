Throw up the X : It took some time for the Romo to Bryant connection to get going , but they came up with the decisive points on the first play of the fourth quarter . Lined up in the slot with a linebacker in coverage , Bryant was able to run free down the field for a 16 yard touchdown to give the Cowboys the lead for good . It was the 50th time in 68 games Romo and Bryant have hooked up for a touchdown , the most in franchise history . Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin , who had 49 touchdowns in 128 games together , are now No . 2 on the list .
