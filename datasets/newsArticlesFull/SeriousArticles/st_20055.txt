We don ' t have it today . About 15 years ago , when we started our surveillance for West Nile , we found two specimens in the light trap here in Niagara , and we sent them off to export down to Florida who verified for us that they were indeed Aedes ? abodipitus even though they were not supposed to be here . And that raised all sort of alarm bells , and we have been looking for them ever since and have never found any additional specimens . So we think that back in 2002 , they just blew up in wind currents ? from somewhere in the States but they certainly haven ' t establish yet a breeding population here .
