Dennis Dodd , senior columnist : After watching Alabama obliterate Michigan State , it ' s hard to me to give Clemson a chance in this game . While the Tigers are more athletic than the Spartans , all that means is Clemson will be able to keep it within 38 . Alabama may never have played better under Nick Saban than it is now . Check me , but I ' m pretty sure this has never happened before in the history of the game : An undefeated 14 win team has to explain why it can make a game of it for the national championship . This won ' t be a shootout , and the Tide should be able to win handily .
