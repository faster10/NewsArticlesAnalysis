It ' s a song about the importance of remembering old friendships : " And there ' s a hand my trusty friend ! And give me a hand o ' thine ! And we ' ll take a right good will draught , For auld lang syne . " It might seem silly to reduce a decision about the future of a nation to a few lines of a song sung drunkenly and off key at midnight , but friendship is a precious thing that men will give their lives for . Many , many British soldiers have done so in the past . I would save the Union out of respect for their memory alone .
