DS : The Kurdish fighters appear from the reports we ve been given about this particular incident to have been perfectly capable they killed an unstated number of ISIS troops or people in the process and I don t know if it was intentional or not . And one American died , no Kurdish did . Perhaps , it was the Americans who were incompetent , I don t know . But clearly , the US loves to be involved . Loves to train , loves to support , loves to lead , loves to arm and was choosing to be involved whether it imagined the Kurds were incapable or for other reasons .
