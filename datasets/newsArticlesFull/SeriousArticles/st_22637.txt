William Koch The Palm Beach , Florida , billionaire says that a 1787 Lafite Bordeaux with Thomas Jefferson ' s initials etched into the bottle is fake . " I thought that I had a piece of history , a piece of America ' s most important history , " Koch told the Los Angeles Times . So Koch sued the seller and has filed four other lawsuits . He says there are more to come . His goal is to clean up an industry where a single bottle can go for more than 100 , 000 . In 1989 , Koch purchased the Lafite and three other bottles of Bordeaux , also purported to be Jefferson ' s , for about 500 , 000 . In the federal lawsuit he filed in New York against the wine supplier , Koch claims Jefferson ' s " initials " were etched into the bottle with modern day power tools .
