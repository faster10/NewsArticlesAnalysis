An anything goes state fair spirit runs through Raleigh ' s weekly flea market , held on , yes , the fairgrounds every Saturday and Sunday except in October , when the actual state fair is in full swing . A thousand vendors spread out between six buildings and several acres of fields and lots , hawking used books , bluegrass albums , North Carolina pottery , batteries , and barbecued pork . Throw in family friendly extras ( face painting booths ) and access to other events ( a handbell festival , say , or a model train expo ) , and you ' ve got plenty of diversions for the 2 . 4 million shoppers the event draws annually .
