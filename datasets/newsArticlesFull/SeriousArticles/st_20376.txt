Soon it was Cruz s turn to speak . He promised that on his first day as president , he would instruct the Justice Department to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood . Cruz said he d appoint judges who would overturn last year s shameful and fundamentally illegitimate Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage . He asked the assembled to pray . Father God , please , continue this awakening . Continue this spirit of revival , awaken the body of Christ , that we might pull back from this abyss , Cruz said . His cadences were those of a preacher .
