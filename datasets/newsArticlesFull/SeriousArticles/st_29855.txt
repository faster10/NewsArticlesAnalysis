" He can defend a status quo that ' s failed the middle class by vetoing the bill , or he can work toward a new beginning and better care by signing it , " said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R Ky . ) . Republicans say ObamaCare is driving up health costs . Democrats say it is providing access to health care for millions who used to be uninsured .
