The two players who have benefited most from Griffin ' s absence are Chris Paul and J . J . Redick , and that should continue . Redick is averaging 18 . 8 points per game since Dec . 26 , and should continue to be one of the better scorers and shooters in the league . Paul is averaging 20 . 2 points and 11 . 1 assists without Griffin , and is a top five guard as long as Griffin is out . DeAndre Jordan ' s role increases a bit without Griffin as well , and he remains a must start Fantasy center .
