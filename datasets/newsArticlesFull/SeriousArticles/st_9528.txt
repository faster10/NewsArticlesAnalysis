To have at the time . . . that this was worst shooting anywhere in the world , it gives a stigma that you don ' t ever want to have for your city . It ' s similar to the one that happened at Columbine and at Virginia Tech . Nobody has the answers as to why these things happen and the randomness of the person shooting his victims doesn ' t make any sense . It ' s not logical , you can ' t comprehend it . To see death happen to people , they were just there to have a meal with their boss and have a celebration of that and no interaction with the person that perpetrated this act .
