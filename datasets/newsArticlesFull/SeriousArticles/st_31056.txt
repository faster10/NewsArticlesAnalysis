Liverpool can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch . The wing backs don ' t have to get back and cover as much as a full back does , so they can be right in behind and the side has five , six or even seven pressing up top . It has restored the energy to Liverpool ' s game , enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession . Suddenly , they looked like the 2013 14 side . If you need to defend , you can drop deep and have a back five , so the system has flexibility . But Liverpool usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against .
