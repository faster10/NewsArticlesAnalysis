The first term of Bose was a smooth affair with many activites aimed at setting up goals to see that " everybody man , woman and child is better clothed , better educated and has sufficient leisure for recreation and cultural activity " . Though Bose reassured Gandhians that he firmly believed in encouraging cottage industries , he felt , like Nehru , the need to embrace the idea of heavy industrialisation . Nehru was away to Europe in 1938 but Bose wanted him back to take over as the chairman of the National Planning Committee he proposed to set up for socio economic reconstruction of the country when it became free .
