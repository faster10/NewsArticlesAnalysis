Officials have not determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign , or doing actual harm . An investigation is ongoing . Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network , and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion , the drone systems do have security issues . Noah Schactman says they still use external hard drives , and when they ' re attached to the top secret computers it can open them up to infection . He says the true danger of this virus comes not from an ability to " bring down a drone , " which is unlikely . Schactman says it comes down to trust . And he surmises that if officials come to think that the data they ' re receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised , they ' re much less likely to view the information as safe and valuable .
