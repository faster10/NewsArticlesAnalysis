It was the Michigan Republican ' s first visit to the 99 , 000 resident city since October , when he called for a switch back to Detroit ' s water after more corrosive Flint River water leached lead from 15 , 000 service lines and into homes . Lead exposure can impair both mental and physical development in children , sometimes causing " profound and permanent adverse health effects " , according to the World Health Organization .

They also want to ensure monitoring protocols are followed properly this time .
