I think as the sectarian tensions rise and you ' ve already been seeing this over the past decade you will have , as Victoria just said , people fleeing to their communities . And this means you ' re going to have even more sectarian division the fault lines are opening up over sectarian lines . And at the moment there ' s no indication that this government has the ability to roll back wholesale the gains by ISIS and the Sunnis . Anbar and Falluja are a prime example of that they took control of these places at the beginning of the year , and the government has been incapable of taking them back . It has basically just built very big checkpoints on the roads , essentially cutting them off . The government has just walled off connections to large Sunni areas .
