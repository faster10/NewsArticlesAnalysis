I ve got to do a better job of getting our team prepared , quite frankly , coach Jay Gruden said . This is on me . We had too many penalties , turnovers . These are things that we have to get fixed . Last week , we were feeling pretty good . Top of the mountain . This week , this game is a humbling game . You feel like you can t do anything right . We have to make sure we ride the roller coaster , but we have to try to do the best we can to stay level , and we re not doing that right now . We re either really good or really poor .
