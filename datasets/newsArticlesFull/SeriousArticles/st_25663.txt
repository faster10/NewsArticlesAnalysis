There ' s been much hypocrisy on this . You have all the news outlets running Broadwell ' s picture next to Holly Petraeus ' , more or less saying : Draw your own conclusions . Then a few days later they ' re all running finger wagging articles ( e . g . Frank Bruni in The New York Times ) rebuking the other news outlets for focusing on Broadwell ' s appearance and " well toned arms . " My own view is that given Broadwell ' s tendency to showcase her physique in public appearances , it ' s a legitimate part of the story .
