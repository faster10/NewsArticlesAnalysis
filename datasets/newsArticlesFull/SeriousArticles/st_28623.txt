Each year , the leaders of the world ( or their representatives ) meet to review the state of progress on the agreements on climate change that have come out . The most famous such agreement is the 1997 Kyoto Protocol from COP3 , where the 55 industrial countries that produced ( then ) 55 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions were supposed to reduce their production of greenhouse gases by at least 5 per cent within 10 15 years . Unfortunately , the protocol failed , as the United States refused to ratify it , Canada and Russia withdrew from it and China , which has since become the top producer of greenhouse gases , was not involved then .
