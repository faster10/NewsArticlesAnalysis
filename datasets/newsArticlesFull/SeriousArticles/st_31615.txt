" Starting off , he ' s so fast , explosive , his size , " Hoiberg said Monday . " The game hasn ' t really seen someone with his physical attributes and does the things he does . He can shoot the three . He can post . He has mid range . His passing ability is so unique for someone with that size and athleticism . He ' s just a load out there . You have to try to make it tough , knowing he ' s going to make some spectacular plays . You can ' t hang your head when he does it . You have to try to stick with the game plan and execute . "
