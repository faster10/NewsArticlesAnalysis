Unfortunately , today the Muslim world faces a leadership crisis unparalleled since the advent of Islam . The OIC and Arab League have failed to provide leadership or collective wisdom to extricate the Muslim ummah from this multifaceted crisis .

The yawning gap between the rich and the poor has given rise to extremism and disgruntled elements . In view of the current political scenario whereby Muslim countries are looked upon as places that engender terrorism , it is imperative for them to organise themselves and improve their image .
