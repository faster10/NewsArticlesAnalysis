Why To Watch : This rivalry gets even more old school with Ben Roethlisberger out again this time with a foot injury in what could be a true throwback game . The Steelers go back to Landry Jones , knowing they can ' t afford to lose to any inferior AFC teams , while the Browns ' organization sans stubborn Mike Pettine can ' t figure out why the coach hasn ' t already named Johnny Manziel his starter for the rest of this lost season . With two wins in their last 14 games , the time for change is clearly now , and the youngster might be able to spark a little something out of the offense . The Browns did manage one of their rare wins at Baltimore already , and a win in Pittsburgh would take some of the sting out of the fans ' misery , and coming off that embarrassment in Cincy last Thursday night , one might expect a bit more determination from the Browns on Sunday .
