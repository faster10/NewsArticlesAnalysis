Farook was born in Chicago and grew up in California . Since the attack , investigators have discovered that he had contacts with people associated with the Nusra Front ( a Syrian al Qaida affiliate ) and Somalia s al Shabab . But investigators anonymously concede that all of these contacts are years old , not substantial ( for example , liking a Facebook page ) , and not with anyone of significant investigative concern . As of Friday night , no one has found a connection to ISIS . The bottom line , according to FBI Director James Comey , is that we have no indication that these killers are part of a network .
