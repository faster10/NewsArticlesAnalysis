JL : I think the U . S . wants to hear what everybody says , and everybody knows that Iran is fundamentally important . They have thousands of troops in Syria , they are funding the Syrians to the tune of billions of dollars : there s much controversy over how many billions , we don t know and Hezbollah is in Syria , at Iran s urging , to a certain degree and so , Iran is a key player . You cannot get any kind of peace agreement that would stick without Iran buying in and I think U . S . understands that . And , in some ways , Russia , and the involvement of Russia in Syria has given cover to Secretary of State Kerry and President Obama to begin to revise some of their stance in the past .
