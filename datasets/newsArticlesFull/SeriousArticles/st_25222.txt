Even diagnosing Zika is difficult , because its symptoms can mimic those of other mosquito borne diseases , and there are no approved tests . The only way to prevent infection is to take the usual steps to avoid mosquito bites , such as staying indoors when visiting an area where the virus is present , as well as wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts ? and using mosquito repellent . Communities can reduce their risk of Zika by doing their best to eradicate mosquitoes , such as by removing trash that collects standing water , according to a report published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine .
