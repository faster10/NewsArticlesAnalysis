General Paul von Lettow Vorbeck , the German commander , is often lauded for his military genius , outwitting the British during four years with barely a fifth of their numbers . Some of the tales written are nothing short of David vs . Goliath . But von Lettow Vorbeck had been ordered not to engage by Berlin . As far as I am concerned , his actions would be better described as a war mongering megalomaniac effort by a military commander responsible for the callous deaths of 300 , 000 porters , the looting of hundreds of villages and the devastation of years of crops . If the death toll had been of German lives , would he have been as celebrated in the scrolls of History ?
