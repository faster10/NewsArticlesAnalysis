While some view Haley ' s speech as an audition for a vice presidential slot , or perhaps a cabinet post , it is also an opportunity to broaden the GOP base and reach out to minority voters . The lack of support among minority voters , coupled with the country ' s increasing diversity , continues to trouble the party ' s political establishment . As South Carolina ' s Senior U . S .

Haley ' s speech represents a key symbolic moment in the party ' s continued efforts in this area .
