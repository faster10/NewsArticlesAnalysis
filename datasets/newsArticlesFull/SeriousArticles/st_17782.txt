It had one team which entered the game as a clear favorite , and the plucky underdog that we quickly realized wasn ' t plucky , and wasn ' t an underdog at all . It followed the expected script for a few minutes after Derrick Henry burst through the Clemson defense for a long touchdown run , and then went completely off script for the next 50 minutes of game action . Entering the game we all wondered if Clemson could hang , yet Monday night not only did they hang , but for big chunks of the game the Tigers were the better team . In an era where Alabama has absolutely obliterated its competition in title games , Clemson was every bit as good as the Tide all the way down to the final few minutes . DeShaun Watson had one of the best individual title game performances we ' ve ever seen .
