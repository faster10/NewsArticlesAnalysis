The threat from al Qaeda and its associated forces has changed significantly since 9 11 . Today , almost 13 years after 9 11 , al Qaeda has not successfully conducted another attack inside the United States . And since 2011 , no individual charged with plotting to conduct an al Qaeda inspired terrorist attack inside the United States has acted with more than one accomplice . This demonstrates the difficulties today of forming a jihadist group sufficiently large enough to conduct a complex attack anything on the scale of 9 11 , and is a tribute to the success of law enforcement agencies in detecting and deterring jihadist terrorist activity .
