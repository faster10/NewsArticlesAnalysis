Trump is , of course , absurdly wrong about these things . The United States has no official mechanism for blocking entry based on religious beliefs and any plans to do so would likely be unconstitutional . Immigrants from Latin America do not represent a wave of super murdering rapists . Lastly , most homicide victims in the United States tend to be killed by people who live near them , and because neighborhoods remain racially segregated , most white murder victims are in fact killed by other white people . To his supporters , however , the fact that Trump is wrong about just about everything does not seem to matter because he affirms something they feel in their bones : that their rightful place in the order of things , or rather atop the order of things , has been usurped by immigrants , blacks , and Muslims .
