Brooks : I think maybe two , of all the stuff I ' ve ever written that I never pursued again to get made . They were done very early . Before " The Producers , " when I had no reputation , I did a script called " Marriage Is A Dirty Rotten Fraud . " It ' s about a guy who gets divorced and the only way out of his big alimony payments is if his ex wife gets married again . But she hasn ' t met anybody and it ' s been going on two years , all he ' s got left in his life is a grapefruit plant . He has no money . Every penny he makes goes to the alimony . So he decides to make a fictitious character he knows what she likes and wear a beard and marry her and then disappear in a drowning accident or something and be off the hook . I never got it sold .
