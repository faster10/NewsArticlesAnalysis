There is no shirking on specs . It has an incredibly sharp 2 . 5k ( 518ppi ) screen , 4K video recording , 3GB of Ram and a 64 bit octa core processor . It starts with a generous 32GB of internal storage , too . The 6P ' s camera is excellent , though just a twitch off the best out there ( from Sony , Samsung and Apple ) . This is mainly because of Google ' s slightly clumsy camera snapping process . Technically , its 12 megapixel , f2 rear camera is superb , with ' larger ' pixels for better light capture . If you find yourself taking selfies a lot , the 6P offers up a fairly high end super selfie 8 megapixel front camera . And for those who curse their phones ' battery lives , the good news is that the 6P packs a relatively long lasting 3 , 450mAh battery which comfortably takes it through a day ' s use . The 6P also comes with a fingerprint placed on the back of the device which is handy for security .
