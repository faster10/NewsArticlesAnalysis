Pain Gain , which stars Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson , redeemed both stars following unimpressive box office results for action films earlier this year . Wahlberg ' s Broken City petered out with just 19 . 7 million , while Johnson ' s Snitch fared only slightly better , grossing 42 . 1 million . While both those films had darker , more serious tones , Pain Gain was marketed as a sunny , over the top black comedy . Unfortunately , audience reaction wasn ' t particularly sunny . Polled moviegoers issued Pain Gain a dreadful " C " CinemaScore .
