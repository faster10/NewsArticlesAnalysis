POGGIOLI : Well , you know , as archbishop of Buenos Aires before he became pope , Francis was known as the slum priest for all the time he spent ministering to the poor in the city ' s shantytowns . And when he arrived at the Kangemi slum today , he said he felt at home , and he delivered one of the toughest speeches of this trip . He denounced the living conditions in the overcrowded neighborhood , the lack of infrastructures and basic services , schools and hospitals . And he has spoken out a lot against the health risks of megacities due to environmental degradation , overcrowding and urban chaos . So in a city where 60 percent of the population lives in shantytowns , this was the perfect location to touch on one of these issues that ' s so close to Francis ' s heart .
