DISPATCH FROM ABC s IOWA CAUCUS BUREAU with ABC s JOSH HASKELL : It was a busy day in freezing Iowa Tuesday where I covered Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who many thought , just over a month ago , had the Iowa Caucuses nearly rapped up . But , with 19 days to go that couldn t be farther from the truth . A fiery Hillary Clinton hit Bernie Sanders on guns , healthcare , and Wall Street saying ? now if that s the kind of revolution he is talking about , I am worried folks . ? And Donald Trump continued his attacks on Cruz s opposition to ethanol subsidies and whether he can be President ? because he was born in Canada . ? You know , a lot of people say that natural born means you have to be born to the land , and you know , on the land in this country , so you know , we have to see , Trump told 1300 in Cedar Falls . There s no doubt we re in for an unpredictable ride as nothing is inevitable and nobody is safe .
