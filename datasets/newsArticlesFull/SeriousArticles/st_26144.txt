A prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife led birthing centers . These have been found in the U . S . and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals . Freestanding birthing centers ( as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a " birthing center " ) are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers . The cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies , a shorter stay ( mothers typically return home within 24 hours ) and lower personnel costs .
