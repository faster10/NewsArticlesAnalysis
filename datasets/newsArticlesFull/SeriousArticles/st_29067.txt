On one occasion , according to the TFM ' s director , Mazin Ramadan , a currency trader arrived at Benghazi airport short of 20 , 000 dinar . The money was due to leave on a flight to aid civilians in the western mountains who hadn ' t received salaries and pensions . Time was short , and a TFM official who had previously spent his own cash on a project was told to take an equivalent sum from a stockpile of cash held on board the plane . A guard thought he was stealing and reported the incident .
