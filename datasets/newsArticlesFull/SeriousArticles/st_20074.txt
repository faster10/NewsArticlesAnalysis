I ' ve done a lot of shows where there ' s fighting and often times the stunt coordinators can get carried away , throwing in fancy moves and special punches . I love Matt because he comes in and says " No , that ' s not real , that would never happen . Take three punches out and make it real . " I think most people who have seen a fight in real life would be like " Yep , that ' s about right : Two guys who should never be throwing down are taking crazy swings at each other and one guy gets plunked in the nose and that ' s game .
