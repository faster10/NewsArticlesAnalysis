There ' s a very good reason why Hillary Clinton is making such a big deal out of gun control , of course because that ' s the only real issue on which she can position herself to Bernie ' s left . It ' s the only thing she can honestly say " I ' m more progressive than him " about , and she knows it . Sanders managed to deflect much of this attack by shifting gears on the liability immunity issue ( I was surprised Clinton didn ' t use the term " flip flop " last night , because she was endlessly repeating it Sunday morning in multiple interviews ) . Sanders may be slightly vulnerable on gun control , but Clinton is vulnerable to this type of attack on just about everything else .
