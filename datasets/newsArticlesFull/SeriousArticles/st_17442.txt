Here s the thing with ( Braun Strowman ) , if I recall correctly , when he got brought up to the main roster , he d had like eight matches . He was never even on NXT television . He s totally not ready for a match with Undertaker , or anybody . I would suggest that ( WWE ) puts him on the road with Kane , because Kane is a big guy , who has lasted a long time . It s not like he has great matches , but he never has a bad match , and what Braun Strowman needs to learn is how to sell , and I think Kane will teach him both sides , the offense and the selling .
