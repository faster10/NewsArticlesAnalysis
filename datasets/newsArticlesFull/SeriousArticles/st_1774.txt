On the other hand , Clinton has some explaining to do here as well . One important tax supporting the ACA the so called Cadillac tax has been delayed and , I suspect , killed . Clinton opposed the tax , and has also pledged not to raise taxes on all but the top three percent of households , those with incomes over 250 , 000 . How is she going to make up for the loss of the Caddy tax ? And while the ACA should be progressively funded , why should only those at the top of the scale pay for a national system of health care ? What s wrong with skin in the game from less wealthy households ?
