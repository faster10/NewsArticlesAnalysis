Last Word When Clermont Auvergne beat Saracens in the 2012 Heineken Cup quarter final in Watford , they brought 2 , 000 supporters to Vicarage Road and the raucous ' yellow army ' illuminated a drab venue . On Saturday , there are likely to be around 50 fans from the French club at Allianz Park for the same fixture . They have evidently opted to save their travel budget for another occasion , but in many cases , rugby is not doing very well when it comes to enticing visiting spectators . Kick off times are becoming more absurd with every passing season geared towards on screen viewing figures , not in ground attendances . This Sunday , Wasps face Leinster at 5 . 15pm , while the December fixtures announced last Friday have Leicester hosting champions Toulon at Welford Road at 5 . 30pm on a Sunday . These are not fan friendly times . The same can be said for Friday night internationals in particular , not least when they involve crossing the Severn Bridge in rush hour . One theory is that some clubs don ' t tend to bring many supporters with them , so there is no need to cater for their needs well , they never will if their needs continue to be shamefully ignored .
