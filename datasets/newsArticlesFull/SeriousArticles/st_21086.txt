SM : ? This is my belief . Now , everybody is saying , even the Republicans in the U . S . , they are worried that Yemen would become Vietnam of Saudi Arabia . Everyone understands , Saudi is spending billions of dollars , killing thousands of civilians , have achieved zero in Yemen . Therefore , this . . . I believe , Iran also should understand Saudi Arabia , Iran also should try to help Saudi Arabia , to find a face saving solution or a face saving exit from the Yemen crisis , and this is a way to go : Saudis , ultimately , they would understand they have to stop the war . They would have to stop bombing Yemenis and they would have to go for diplomacy .
