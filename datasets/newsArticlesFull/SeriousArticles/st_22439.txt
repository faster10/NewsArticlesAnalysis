This was the second game this season that the Clippers gave up a lead to the Warriors and ended up on the losing end . All summer , the Clippers hinted at being at least an equal team to the Warriors . Clippers head coach Doc Rivers even went as far as to call the Warriors lucky that they were able to avoid the Clippers in the playoffs . For the way they go at each other both on and off the court , almost anyone would tell you that this is the best rivalry we have going in the NBA today . But after losing on Thursday night , Blake Griffin woudl have to disagree . He doesn ' t see this as a rivalry . He says Golden State is just the better team .
