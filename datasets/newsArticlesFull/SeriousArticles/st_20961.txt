Sadly , Fox News and the Republican National Committee say there won t be an empty podium in the middle of the stage to represent Trump s absence . But even without a political totem , the GOP front runner s presence will still be felt . Trump is leading the polls in Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina , raising the very real possibility that he could sweep the first three nominating contests of the year . At this point , you just can t talk about the Republican nomination without talking about Trump . The question for the seven candidates on stage , then , is how much they want to talk about the MIA mogul . If they mention Trump only in passing , they risk giving him a status quo preserving free pass . But if they hit him too often , they risk turning a Trump less debate into a debate all about Trump ( itself an exercise in status quo preservation ) . Walking that tightrope would be difficult if the candidates were moving in unison it will be that much more so given each will show up on Thursday with his own agenda and game plan .
