The tragedy in Paris is unfortunately why we need to be extraordinarily cautious in who we allow to immigrate , visit or study in this country . For years , I have called for limitations on admitting foreigners who want to come from countries consumed with hate for America , and I have called for reinstating a program of special scrutiny for anyone coming here from countries that have hotbeds of radical jihadism . We should help , in coordination with the international community , to curb the refugee crisis , but we must restrict the number of refugees entering America until we develop an effective screening process .
