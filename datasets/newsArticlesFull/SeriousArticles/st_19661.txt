There has been strong opposition to Trump hosting SNL this Saturday . Some individuals have suggested that we should not prevent Trump from hosting SNL but that instead we should voice our opposition by not watching . This view misses the point . Trump has targeted Latinos with his racist and xenophobic remarks and his rhetoric is causing real harm to the Latino community . We cannot allow him the time nor a platform such as SNL to advance such views . Allowing Trump to host a widely popular program is nothing short of a slap in the face to the more than 50 million Latinos living in the U . S . whose only wish is the opportunity to work hard and provide for their families .
