Fox made a nice nod to the " Grease " legacy by asking Didi Conn , who played Frenchy in the film , and Barry Pearl , who was Doody , to appear in small roles . ( Travolta made his own cameo in an ad for the upcoming O . J . Simpson series ) . But Fox spoiled some of that goodwill with the heavy product placement of Coke ? a sponsor . Maybe a better sponsor would have been whoever made the golf carts , usually not the hip , cool transportation option . Here they were positively greased lightnin ' .
