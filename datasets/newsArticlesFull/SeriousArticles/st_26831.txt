Granted , to claim that any show ranks among the best of any given year has always been a more ridiculous idea than the Hollywood Foreign Press ? or critics like me ? would like to admit . Obviously , there s no scientific way to judge television . It s more accurate to say that certain series rank among the favorites of the highly subjective individuals who choose the honorees . So , in the past , the Golden Globes didn t just reflect which shows were the most watchable that year , but also which shows people actually watched . Now , by championing smaller , more polarizing series , they re finally acknowledging that this is an impossible task . There s so much TV out there that novelty and discovery have become just as important as quality . That s a fitting trend for television in general , since it s a genre that caters to short attention spans . And it s probably a good thing for the Globes , which loves to shock its audience by calling unexpected names onto the stage to tearfully accept their statues , mid martini , giving this year s host , Ricky Gervais , more to joke about .
