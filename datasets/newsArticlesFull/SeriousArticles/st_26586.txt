This isn ' t exactly a new strategy for a politician running to replace a president of their own party , of course . It ' s really just " Politics 101 , " in fact . But it is a lot better strategy than Democrats attempted in Obama ' s two off year elections where they essentially ran from his record rather than running on his record . Clinton is positioning herself as a continuation of the Obama agenda , with promises to make his achievements better ( mostly by tinkering around the edges ) . However , she goes too far when she tries to paint Sanders as someone who would willingly dismantle and destroy what Obama has achieved Democratic voters are smarter than she is assuming , and they ' re likely just not going to buy that line of attack ( since it is so disingenuous to begin with ) .
