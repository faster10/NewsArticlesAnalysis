Brady had entered this game with a 22 8 postseason record and four championships , with two one and done exits from the playoffs . Manning entered with a 12 13 postseason record , one title and nine one and dones . If Peyton wasn ' t going to win the rivalry Sunday ( Brady had that in his hip pocket for eternity with his 11 5 head to head record ) , he could surely help his legacy by beating Brady for the third time in five postseason duels , and for a third consecutive time in an AFC Championship Game .
