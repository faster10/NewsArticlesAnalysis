" Katy and I have known each other a really long time , she ' s a friend of mine , and it seemed like there was this infusion of people wanting to create conflict and drama . I find that to be really fatiguing , " she said . " It ' s an old paradigm of pitting people against each other based on the idea that there ' s not enough not enough fans , not enough music lovers , not enough space for both of you , so you have to hate each other . I don ' t believe in that . I was disappointed . I feel it was misguided . There ' s better s to do than worry about that stuff . "
