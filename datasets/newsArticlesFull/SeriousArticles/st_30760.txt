There are going to be a lot of post mortems ( to go along with the already voluminous collection of pre mortems ) explaining what went wrong for Paul , so we can leave that to the side for the moment . The immediate impact of Paul s departure will be to significantly lessen the already limited ideological diversity of the Republican presidential field . One example that stands out prominently for me is torture . Paul s disappearance from the Republican field ( along with Lindsey Graham s exit in December ) means that the number of GOP candidates for the presidency who vocally oppose the use of torture has now dwindled to just one man : Sen . Ted Cruz .
