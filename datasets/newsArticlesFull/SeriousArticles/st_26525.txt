The same reason anyone does , he said : Just to see if anything was broken . Of course , when this particular player had just completed his 179th consecutive start , any dent in the armor is a reason to raise eyebrows . Manning said he got the all clear from the X ray room but refused to say where he was injured . He did say the mystery injury did not occur on his scramble for 2 yards in the third quarter , when he did not go out of bounds or slide and was hit hard by linebacker David Harris in the right shoulder . I always get banged up a little bit , but yeah , I should be fine , he said . Everything s good . He walked out of the stadium without any noticeable wrap , limp or impediment .
