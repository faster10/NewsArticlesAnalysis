Michelle Obama arrives in Kenzo dress for Japan visit
First lady Michelle Obama started her first visit to Japan on a stylish note Wednesday, touching down in Tokyo in a brightly-printed dress by Kenzo.  Mrs. Obama paired the lime green, flared design with a metallic belt and black pumps, all donned as she stepped off the plane for her visit to the country, part of five-day trip to Japan and Cambodia promoting the White House's "Let Girls Learn" education initiative.Kenzo is a fitting choice for the first lady's visit -- the French fashion house was founded by Japanese designer Kenzo Takada, and is currently helmed by American design duo Humberto Leon and Carol Lim. So it symbolically brings together the U.S. and Japan, all in one outfit. In Tokyo, Mrs. Obama plans to announce, along with Japanese first lady Akie Abe, a partnership supporting girls' education. She will also visit historic sites in Kyoto before traveling to Cambodia -- one of 11 countries participating in the "Let Girls Learn" initiative.
