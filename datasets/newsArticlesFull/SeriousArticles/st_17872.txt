In all countries there are circumstances when authorities intercept or block communications that are viewed as criminal or dangerous . This is permitted under articles in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which is part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and in the ITU Constitution . However , these are exceptions to the basic principle enshrined in those documents : The right to freedom of expression and communication . The ITRs must conform to the ITU Constitution , and nothing in the revised treaty can diminish that fundamental right to free speech .
