ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : The Palin Trump alliance marks the ultimate triumph of personality over policy in the Republican Party ? at least for this very big campaign moment . Sarah Palin was Donald Trump before Trump took to politics , and Tuesday night s endorsement event ( no more pussy footing around drill , baby , drill ) showed she still may have more catch phrases than him . In backing Trump , Palin is putting her considerable pull among tea partiers and other grassroots conservatives to the test . She s signaling to them that ideology matters less than attitude ? a proposition she tested , intentionally or not , when she joined John McCain s ticket in 2008 . That was as intense a national roller coaster as we ve witnessed in politics , so it s fair to expect dips and turns along the way . It s also fair to note that Palin is unlikely to motivate many possible Trump voters in Iowa who weren t already on board . But in its timing and its implications , with Ted Cruz having just started to break through by questioning Trump s conservative credentials , you betcha this matters for Iowa and beyond . Trump has a figure who can be described as Trump like to campaign on his behalf ? one famously boosted to national prominence by none other than John McCain . The revolving door of politics and reality TV has opened to a new pairing at the center of the presidential race .
