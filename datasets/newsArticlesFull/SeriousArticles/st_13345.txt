Last Word It was somehow inevitable . Having ignited the rebellion against the European status quo which led to the creation of the new Champions Cup , Aviva Premiership clubs have suffered in the early stages of the new tournament . After two rounds of matches , the tally of victories for each of the competing leagues is as follows Premiership five , French Top 14 seven and Guinness Pro12 eight .

In fact , the latter have generated much of the intrigue so far . Their 37 10 , opening weekend demolition of Bath was arguably the most eye catching result to date , while Munster ' s last kick win at Sale delivered the most remarkable drama of the new event ' s initial encounters . Pool stage ' derbies ' may fit in with the heightened meritocracy this year but , as expected , they and the occasionally absurd kick off times are not a positive development .
