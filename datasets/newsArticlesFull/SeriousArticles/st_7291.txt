John Elway and the Broncos finally got their first Super Bowl title , but it was Terrell Davis who led them there . Davis rushed for 157 yards and three touchdowns to win the MVP award in a 31 24 win . The reigning champion Packers struck first with a 22 yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre to Antonio Freeman on their opening drive , but the Broncos responded with a 58 yard drive capped by a 1 yard TD from Davis . The Broncos took the lead after a 1 yard TD run by Elway early in the second quarter , and they held onto it until the fourth quarter . After Eugene Robinson intercepted Elway ' s pass in the end zone , it took the Packers just four plays to score a touchdown and tie the score at 24 24 with 13 : 32 left . It stayed that way until the Broncos got the ball at the Packers ' 49 following a 39 yard punt with 3 : 27 to go . A pair of penalties , a 23 yard pass from Elway to Howard Griffith and a 17 yard run by Davis brought the Broncos down to the Packers ' 1 , where Davis punched it in to take the lead with 1 : 45 left , securing the victory for the Broncos .
