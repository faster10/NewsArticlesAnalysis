They got two of their starters back as center Weston Richburg ( ankle ) and guard Justin Pugh ( concussion ) returned to action , but they might be without rookie left tackle Ereck Flowers for a while . He injured an ankle and had to be carted off the field . That forced Pugh to slide to left tackle . The Giants already were without their other starting tackle as Marshall Newhouse did not play ( back ) . Rookie Bobby Hart started and did a respectable job , Tom Coughlin said . With Hart and Flowers as bookends , it was the first time the Giants started two rookies at tackle since the 1970 NFL merger .
