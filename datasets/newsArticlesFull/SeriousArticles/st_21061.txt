" The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder , " Trump said . " They ' re making a tremendous amount of money . They have to pay tax . I want to lower the rates for the middle class . . . They ' re getting absolutely destroyed . " Trump is also right about this . We bailed out the executives on Wall Street who caused the biggest economic crisis since the 1929 Crash and nobody went to jail . In fact , the banks profited enormously . And they manage to game the tax code in their favor . What Trump has not proposed , but many voters would probably support , is breaking up the big banks that are " too big to fail " and returning the financial system to some form of sanity .
