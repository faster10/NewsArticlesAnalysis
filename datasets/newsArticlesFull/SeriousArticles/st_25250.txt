The fanboy friendly director , who earned his Comic Con bona fides by crafting oddball fantasias including Pan ' s Labyrinth and boy films , has spoken at length about being weaned on creature double features as a kid in Mexico . And it wasn ' t just the granddaddy of all man in a rubber suit behemoths , Godzilla , who cracked open his mind . He also swooned over the more esoteric beasties in Toho Studios ' kaiju ( i . e . , giant monster ) stable titanic brutes like Mothra , Megalon , and Mechagodzilla . It goes without saying that the man ' s geek credentials run deep .
