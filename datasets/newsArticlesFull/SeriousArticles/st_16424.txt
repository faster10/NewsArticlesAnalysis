Last weekend , actor Jim Carrey tweeted that he has decided to withdraw his support for his movie " Kick Ass 2 " due to its violent content . Carrey said he became uncomfortable with the violence in light of last year ' s tragic Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut . People must make their own decisions about what media are appropriate for themselves and their family , and I respect Carrey ' s choices . Yet , as someone who researches media violence , I worry that some will draw the wrong message from his position .
