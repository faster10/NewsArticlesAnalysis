And exactly the same semantics were trotted out last week when the Tory MP and member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee , Daniel Kawczynski ? who was also chairman of the all party UK parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia ? was questioned on television about the 47 executions in Saudi Arabia , the kingdom s misogynistic policies and its harsh anti gay laws . Faced with the unspeakable ? indeed , the outrageous ? acts of a regime which shares its Wahhabi Sunni traditions with Isis and the Taliban , Kawczynski replied that the executions were very regrettable , that targeting civilians would be completely unacceptable and the anti gay laws highly reprehensible . Reprehensible , I suppose , is a bit stronger than regrettable .
