Gary Lauder : We drive , so it ' s hard to ignore that experience which we all share , and while driving , one ' s thoughts go to how this can be improved . In particular they were driven there by having received that traffic ticket . . . a long , long time ago . The whole issue of stop signs making you stop for no one in particular or no one at all , which is often the case , made me think : What is this trying to achieve ? And is there not a better way that might make our driving more in sync with common sense and with what ' s best for the environment and for the driver ?
