BP ' s job is to focus on stopping the flow of oil . The government needs to provide more military " command and control " of the situation . As BP works to stop the gusher , the government must address the problem of the oil coming ashore and take care of the people affected , possibly retraining them in other jobs . The government could do this by using the Stafford Act to fund the states so they can protect their shoreline and clean up the oil . Then , the long term effects of the spill must be mitigated .
