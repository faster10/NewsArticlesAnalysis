Read when you go to the grocery store . If there ' s a natural seal or if they have a green cross on it , they ' re a natural , safe , organic product . I recommend so highly the ACT Natural microfiber products from Sweden , the cloths and the mops . Because with nothing but water , they remove 99 . 9 percent of germs and bacteria and soiling from surfaces . You ' re not getting any residue on surfaces , and you ' re not spending any money on chemicals , and you ' re saving the environment and your health too .
