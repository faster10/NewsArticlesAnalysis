Deliberation is a predominant central virtue promoted by the Constitution . That document requires that in criminal cases , there be an initial appearance , indictment by a grand jury , representation by counsel and the right to not only appeal a conviction but to petition for habeas corpus . All of these slow down the process . Above all , our Constitution expressly mandates " Due Process , " even when that process produces delay and uncertainty , as it is bound to do . Deliberation is what makes us civilized , and when it fails , we fail profoundly .
