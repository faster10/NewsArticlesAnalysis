ABOUT THE 49ERS ( 3 6 ) : San Francisco was 1 6 against Seattle with Colin Kaepernick under center , and Gabbert did just enough with two touchdowns and two interceptions against the Falcons to earn his first shot at the Seahawks ' defense . I like what Blaine did , 49ers coach Jim Tomsula told reporters . I like where he s at and we re going to continue with Blaine . Gabbert could be getting some weapons back this week with wide receiver Anquan Boldin ( hamstring ) and running back Carlos Hyde ( foot ) limited participants in practice this week .
