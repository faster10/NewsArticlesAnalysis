About the Chiefs : The AFC ' s hottest club , Kansas City is riding an 11 game winning streak and is just the second team in NFL history ( 1970 Cincinnati Bengals ) to make the playoffs after a 1 5 start , which included a season ending knee injury to star RB Jamaal Charles in Week 5 . The potential loss of WR Jeremy Maclin , who injured his right ankle Saturday , would hurt the passing game significantly . The Chiefs do a lot of things typical of successful postseason squads : they run the ball effectively , play stout defense and almost always win the turnover battle . And QB Alex Smith , often criticized for a risk averse style , has taken more chances downfield and thrown for the most yards ( 3 , 486 ) of his 11 year career while keeping interceptions ( 7 ) to a minimum .
