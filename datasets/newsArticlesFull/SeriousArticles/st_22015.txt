The Supreme Court has long recognized the federal government ' s special power in immigration , and has therefore allowed Congress albeit not Executive Branch agencies to discriminate against non citizens so long as it has a " rational basis " for doing so . But all of those cases involve statutes that apply equally to non citizens of different religious affiliations and national origins ? for example , statutes that impose residency requirements before non citizens can receive government benefits .
