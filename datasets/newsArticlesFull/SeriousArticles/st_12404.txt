The connection between Hamlin and the people at VCU is obvious . He relates to the young patients he visits with , but the staff as well . Banners bearing his picture hang throughout the clinic , as well as messages wishing him good luck in his attempt to win a NASCAR championship . In the restricted area of the research lab , appreciation and understanding of the gift he has given is deeply felt . There is a tiny cardboard cutout of Hamlin in his race suit on top of a refrigerator that contains cells . Staff members joke that they call him the Guardian of the Cells .
