DreamWorks and Fox have already proved that there ' s room in the animation game for studios other than Pixar especially thanks to the lucrative international market and it seems Sony is growing into a viable contender as well . " Hotel Transylvania ' s " debut trailed the openings of " Brave " ( 66 . 3 million ) and " Madagascar 3 " ( 60 . 3 million ) substantially , but it was right in line with " Ice Age : Continental Drift ' s " start ( 46 . 6 million ) . Still , the animated title wasn ' t the only reason for Sony to be happy this weekend .
