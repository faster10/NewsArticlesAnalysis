Lest you think I ' m defending this month ' s rollout , I encourage you to review my last article here . I still maintain that the administration has had a failure in management in overseeing and reporting on progress towards October 1 . But I ' m also sympathetic that they ' ve had a hard job to do . I would like to see this go better . I ' d like to see millions more get insurance . I ' d like to see the law of the land function as well as it can , and if it doesn ' t , I ' d like to see Congress continue to amend it to make it work better . I ' d like a better health care system .
