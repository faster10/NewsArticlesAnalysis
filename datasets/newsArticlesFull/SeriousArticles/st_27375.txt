First , take a young man and start small . Work up to altruism and moral courage step by step . Each small thing he does to attend to the suffering of another or stand up against injustice will make the next act feel easier , more natural . Second , give him a clear system of rules with predictable consequences . Teach him he has the ability to make choices about his life , and that these choices matter . Third , teach him that the world ' s problems aren ' t as simple as us versus them , good versus evil . Teach him that there aren ' t easy solutions to complex problems . Teach him to tolerate , without fear and anxiety , life ' s difficult ambiguity and uncertainty .
