" You ' ve got to be disciplined to understand the ultimate goal . That ' s always got to be important , " Bengals Pro Bowl offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth said . " It ' s not about one guy ' s mistake , or one guy that wasn ' t or was . At all times , our team as a unit , everyone has got to understand the discipline of winning the football game , and that ' s more important than anything else . It always has got to be No . 1 . When you get those priorities out of control , that ' s when bad things happen . "
