Conditions are clearly fertile to start organizing a Trumpist paramilitary wing , a key fascist institution . A pack of heavily armed white nationalist militants recently popped up at a mosque in Irving , Texas , announcing their intention to intimidate local Muslims . Trump ' s personal security squad is already made up of goons , assaulting people and threatening reporters . With an incomprehensible number of guns floating around the country , all Trump needs is a R ? hm to get the organizing started ? except probably with Carhartts and camouflage instead of imitation military uniforms . ( After that , watch for the next step : starting fights at Bernie Sanders rallies . )
