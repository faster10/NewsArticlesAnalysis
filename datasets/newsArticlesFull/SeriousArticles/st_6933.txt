Strauss : Stephen Curry . I thought he ' d be better , but I didn ' t expect " better " to mean best statistical guard season in NBA history . Crazy as it sounds , that ' s the pace he ' s on . Account for the fourth quarters Curry is resting and he ' s scoring at a Michael Jordan pace , but far more efficiently . This doesn ' t mean 2016 Curry is " better " than Mike it ' s difficult to compare across eras . Still , Curry outpacing Jordan ' s statistical production is something few , if anybody saw coming .
