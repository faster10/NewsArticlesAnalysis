There ' s this one other thing , too . It has to do with high leverage situations , which put more simply are just the most important situations . High leverage at bats are the clutch at bats . In low leverage situations , the Angels ranked 15th in OPS , and the Royals did , as well . But , in high leverage situations , the Angels ranked third , and the Royals ranked third . So you ' re getting another part of the team identities both offenses had a knack for good timing . No matter whether you believe in clutchness as a skill , those Angels regularly came up big . The Royals have done the same . This clearly hasn ' t stopped in the playoffs .
