Prince Amukamara said he knew that fade pass was coming his way and tried to play off the receiver in an attempt to dissuade Ryan Fitzpatrick from going in that direction . But he s going to believe in his guy more than me , Amukamara said , and he was blotted out by the 6 4 , 230 pound Marshall . Amukamara said he could have pressed and tried to disrupt the route , but if he had to play it again , he would have used the same technique . I just would have been a little bit more outside , Amukamara said . No doubt that was a key play in the game and I lost the battle .
