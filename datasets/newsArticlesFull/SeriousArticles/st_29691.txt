Sometimes he doesn t even need an offensive line , Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller said of Brady on Wednesday . It s just that connection with Gronkowski , the connection with Edelman and with Amendola and all of the receivers that he has is just instantaneous . It s just , Hut , and boom , pass right now . Half of the time , he doesn t even need pass protection . He s doing most of it himself . We re going to have to be tight in the secondary , which I expect us to be . We will have to get a pass rush every down because you never know what opportunity is going to present itself for you to go and make a big play .
