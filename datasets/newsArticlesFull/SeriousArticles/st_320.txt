So far , the UN climate process has faced the challenge of rallying all countries behind one unified resolution . While this remains crucial , efforts to build global consensus are increasingly varied , emphasising the role that multilateral , national and subnational policies can play in responding to the unique circumstances faced by societies around the globe . The Paris meeting reflects this shift , as the UN increasingly looks to shape the individual national commitments of countries around the world into a new , dynamic global compact . This approach creates encouraging possibilities for China , the US and India ? which together make up roughly 40 per cent of global carbon emissions ? to become global leaders in a new and more sustainable energy future .
