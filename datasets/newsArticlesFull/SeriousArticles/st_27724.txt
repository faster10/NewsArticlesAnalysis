Rep . John Katko , R New York and chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security , said , " As threats to aviation security continue to evolve , it is critical that the Transportation Security Administration , as well as the airport community , are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats . I look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the TSA on what can be done , going forward , to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports .
