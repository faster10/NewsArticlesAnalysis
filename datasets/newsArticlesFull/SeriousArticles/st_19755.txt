Wine is one of the great pleasures of life , and between the great wines of Bordeaux and the much cheaper ( but very good ) wines of the Bergerac I ' m spoiled for choice . Increasingly I buy wines direct from vineyards that I know and visit , often buying en primeur , which means I buy it this year and collect it next year or the year after it has matured in the barrel . My friends and neighbors all have their favorites , and we swap wines and drink together and compare notes over a good meal , and often it ' s not the most expensive wines that give the most pleasure , but a wine that somehow perfectly matches the food , the mood and the company .
