In a brief filed Tuesday in the U . S . 10th Circuit Court of Appeals , the Department of Justice said that " The Wheaton College injunction does not reflect a final Supreme Court determination that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act requires the government to apply the accommodations in this manner , " but that the rules outlined in the brief are meant to augment a Department of Health and Human Services accommodation process that will no longer require the use of a form for any institution if the temporary order for Wheaton College is enacted for all religious nonprofits .
