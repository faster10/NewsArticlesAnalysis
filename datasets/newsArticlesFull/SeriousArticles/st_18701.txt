Compare that to Benedict ' s statement : " In today ' s world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel , both strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me . For this reason , and well aware of the seriousness of this act , with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome , Successor of Saint Peter . "
