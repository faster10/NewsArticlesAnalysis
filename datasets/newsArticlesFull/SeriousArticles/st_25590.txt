Time to split ? Most Labour MPs are far removed from the party s 220 , 000 new members , who dictate that Corbyn or someone of his views leads Labour . But here s why an SDP style split is unthinkable . New parties are always crushed by our first past the post electoral system . There was never a better chance than in 1981 when four substantial national figures launched a left of centre party built on principles of social justice and internationalism in a yawning political vacuum , with Labour and Tories at their most extreme . But instead of breaking the mould , the mould broke them . You get one chance , and the SDP came within 2 of overtaking Labour in 1983 , but crashed back to earth with 25 of the votes yielding just 23 seats .
