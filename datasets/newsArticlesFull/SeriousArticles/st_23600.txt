This logic may not apply to the IRGC in Iran however , because its thinking is constrained by projects for regional dominance and the exportation of the Islamic revolution . The IRGC believes that given that it was able to double down at the time of isolation and sanctions , it could do much more after the sanctions have been lifted and money is flowing again . The IRGC could come down hard on moderate forces that want to focus on economic growth and prosperity rather than military intervention , the creation of militias , and imposing costly dominance .
