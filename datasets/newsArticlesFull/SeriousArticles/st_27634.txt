One former Yemen Times radio journalist , Mohammed al Qalisi , recalls the golden years of press freedom from 2011 to 2014 . I could say anything against the government . These are dark days for media now . After the revolution in 2011 that led to the end of Ali Abdullah Saleh s 33 year reign , there was a proliferation of websites , newspapers , television and radio stations . Now all that remains are two newspapers in the capital , forced to operate according to the militia s guidelines . Al Qalisi from Sana a , a reporter for The National , is trapped in the south of the country and can t return home for fear of reprisals . Unwilling to leave Yemen , he is keen to tell its story , but feels he can t do so freely .
