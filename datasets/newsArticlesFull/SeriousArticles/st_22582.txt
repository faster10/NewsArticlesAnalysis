" His Girl Friday " : Howard Hawk directed this 1930s slapstick comedy , which is based on the Ben Hecht penned screenplay for The Front Page . Cary Grant plays editor Walter Burns trying to woo his ex wife and fellow journalist Hildy Johnson ( Rosalind Russell ) back to the world of the newsroom , with its roll top desks , three martini lunches , rotary phones and manual typewriters clacking away . In a nice bit of symmetry , the film debuted the overlapping dialogue technique that Aaron Sorkin later perfected .
