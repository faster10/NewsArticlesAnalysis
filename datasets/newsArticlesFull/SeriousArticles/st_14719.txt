The new role we doctors play , after all the dust is settled , is entirely built on trust . We are the expert consultant to whom you bring the information you have generated from your own body and your own research . We help you navigate your ideas and worries , and craft the concise guidance you need . At the same time we cannot ultimately be your concierge we stand on the ground between our best understanding of science and its application . Navigating that shifting territory requires winning your trust .
