The gripe of every sidelined campaign was that , in a year when pollsters have been caught short in race after race , national polling has been prioritized over state polling to cast the televised debates .

John Kasich ( Ohio ) . Yet Kasich and Paul would appear in prime time , while the much liked Graham would stay home .
