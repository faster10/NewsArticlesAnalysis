Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3 D printers with children in need of hands and arms . The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture . org that can be assembled for as little as 20 to 50 . Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free .
