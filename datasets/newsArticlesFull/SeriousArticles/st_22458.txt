Hahaha , it is funny . This is one of Sowell s many tics , where he takes something eminently explicable about which he feels peevish and magnifies it into a mystifying new social aberration that can only prove the world has gone mad . It s an affectedly homespun voice that is meant to contrast the author s clear eyed humility with the fantastical manias of the modern world . This is how an academic with enough initials after his name to stencil all the crypts in a Balkan cemetery comes to feign surprise at the fact that a media figure for the last three decades who once helmed a hit reality show and has his own chain of branded hotels is the subject of media obsession just because he is one of two people leading the polls for the most powerful job in the world .
