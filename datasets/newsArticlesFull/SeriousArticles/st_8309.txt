For example , in 1995 we had just started an interview outside the show with Kurt Loder and Madonna while the VMAs were still on air . Our crew caught sight of Courtney Love walking down the street by herself , headed straight toward us . She started yelling , trying to get our attention , and then began throwing her make up one piece at a time up at Kurt Loder and Madonna . On camera , Kurt said " Courtney is throwing stuff at us . " From inside the production truck , the producers encouraged Courtney to join the interview . Courtney stumbled up the stairs and onto the stage , interrupting Madonna , and the rest is VMA history .
