You know , 2016 will come soon enough , but before I came here to the DNC I was among those getting incredibly frustrated by the fact there was so much attention paid to 2016 when we ' ve got a lot of work to do before then . That ' s why I ' m over here . We ' ve got important races in 2013 . We ' ve got a lot of important races in 2014 . Folks need to start laying the groundwork for 2016 but there ' s more important stuff to do now electorally as well as helping the president pass his agenda and that ' s why I ' m here . "
