House Republicans , moved to the right by the tea party , have little appetite for spending on anything that does not seem to be absolutely essential to the nation . In 2008 , when she voted against the re authorization of PEPFAR , Michelle Bachmann said , " The United States is the most generous nation on earth . We have to have a balancing act between our benevolence and our prosperity . And our prosperity today is at risk . We will not survive if our benevolence allows the treasury to not only be empty but to have us be a debtor nation greater than we have ever been before . "
