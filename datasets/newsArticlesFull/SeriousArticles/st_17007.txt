People who don ' t know me personally often describe me as smart , cold , and calculating . People who have known me for decades and people in Iowa who have spent time with me tend to describe me as smart , warm , and responsive . The gulf between those views is wider than the Grand Canyon . Can both be true ? I hate to say it , but . . . yes . In my public speeches and interviews , I ' ve listened too much to advisers and pollsters and too little to my heart . Well , that stops here . Starting tonight , you ' re going to get the Hillary Clinton my friends and family know .
