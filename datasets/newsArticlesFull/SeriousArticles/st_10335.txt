What African American voters did take away from that debate is that Clinton hearts Barack Obama ? and she would represent a third Obama term . Clinton s strong embrace of a somewhat unpopular president nationally helps her with one key demographic : African Americans . In the history of insurgent versus establishment Democratic presidential candidates ? Jerry Brown vs . Bill Clinton , Dean vs . John Kerry , Bill Bradley vs . Al Gore ? only one insurgent has won : Obama . That was almost entirely thanks to the African American vote . Which is why Clinton reminded debate viewers that Sanders actively sought progressives to challenge Obama to a primary battle in his 2012 reelect .
