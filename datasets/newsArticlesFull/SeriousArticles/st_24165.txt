Ben Carson arrives in Wisconsin a wounded candidate . In the past week , his biography ? the very foundation of his unlikely candidacy ? has started to crack under the weight of questions about everything from a West Point scholarship that wasn t to his insistence that he really did try to stab a close relative when he was a teenager . The more immediate question , though , is whether Carson will be forced to address the controversy on stage in Wisconsin . The Fox moderators could justify giving him a pass given their all economy all the time pledge , but even if they do , Carson might still have to fend off attacks from his rivals ? particularly a certain billionaire who is visibly flustered by Carson s rise in the polls . So far , surveys suggest that the more Republican voters learn about Carson , the more they like him . It s unclear , though , whether that trend will hold if conservatives discover what they like about him isn t even true .
