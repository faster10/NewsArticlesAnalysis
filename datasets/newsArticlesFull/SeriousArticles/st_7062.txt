I remember a 14 year old and his friends going to each village , telling everybody how they wanted an education . You think about how many kids hate school here and how much they just wish they didn ' t have to go to school . You know , I was one of those kids . I complained all the time about having to do homework and I wanted to go out and play , and these kids are begging for school . . . . It was so powerful . It makes you more aware of how fortunate you are . There was this little kid playing with a bunch of plastic bags that he wrapped string around , and it was a soccer ball . That ' s all he needed . And you think about all the Game Boys and all the things that kids " need " to be entertained here . It was all about simplicity with them . I loved being around them . It got me excited to help more .
