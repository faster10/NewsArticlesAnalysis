" Ted is a supporter of legalizing people that are in this country illegally . In fact , when the Senate bill was proposed , he proposed legalizing people that were here illegally , " Rubio said during a campaign stop in Hilton Head , according to a readout from his campaign . " He proposed giving them work permits . He ' s also supported a massive expansion of the green cards . He supported a massive expansion of the H 1B program , a 500 increase . So , if you look at it , I don ' t think our positions are dramatically different . I do believe that we have to deal with immigration reform in a serious way , and it begins by proving to people that illegal immigration is under control . "
