During the Oklahoma City Thunder Utah Jazz game Monday night , the Vivint Smart Home Arena crowd in Salt Lake City saw quite the show in a night full of emoting . The baby race featured three crawling rugrats and only one of them truly embraced the competition . As two of the kids just kind of stayed at the starting line when the race began , the baby in the first position took off . He was crawling like a young Carl Lewis , bolting ahead of the competition in a way that made you feel like he ' s destined to be the next great Olympian .
