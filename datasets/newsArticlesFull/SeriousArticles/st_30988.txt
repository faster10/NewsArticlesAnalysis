Jim Sundberg bunted into a forceout at third base , but a passed ball sent Onix Concepcion ( who had pinch run for Balboni ) to third and Sundberg to second . Heavy hitting Hal McRae was then intentionally walked to set up another force play , but pinch hitter Dane Iorg ' s bloop single to rightfield brought home both runs , despite a strong throw from Andy Van Slyke , for a 2 ? 1 walk off win that tied the Series .
