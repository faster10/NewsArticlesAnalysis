2 . Thanks to Chad Kelly , maybe Ole Miss isn ' t done without the 2013 recruiting class stars after all . The headliners of that famous class are all juniors now , and they ' re all widely expected to head to the NFL after this season . But there could be plenty of life for Hugh Freeze ' s program even without Robert Nkemdiche , Laquon Treadwell , Laremy Tunsil , etc . , starting with Kelly . The JUCO transfer will be back in 2016 and will have an argument as the SEC ' s best quarterback , given his combination of hard nosed running and accurate passing . After adding four more touchdowns to his tally , he ' s already accounted for more in a single season than any Ole Miss player in history and has no doubt made Ole Miss fans forget that " how will the Rebels replace Bo Wallace ? " was ever a serious question .
