HIGH COURT TO HEAR CLASS ACTION CASE Dave Jamieson : " On Tuesday , the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a crucial case that could tighten the rules dictating how workers and consumers band together in the first place which could limit their ability to bring class action lawsuits and other collective actions against corporations . The case , Tyson Foods v . Bouaphakeo , involves a group of pork processing workers in Iowa who claimed the meatpacking giant shorted them on overtime pay At issue are the federal rules of procedure judges must follow when ' certifying ' a class of plaintiffs the first step in all class action cases . Both plaintiffs and corporations put up their biggest legal fight at the certification stage , which can easily take years to complete . If a handful of workers can t adequately show that they represent a ' class ' of thousands , the certification fails and the case essentially dies . Each employee is then left to sue on their own , and most don t have the resources to do that . " HuffPost
