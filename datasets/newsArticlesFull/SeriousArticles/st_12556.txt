5 . London , we have a problem : The third game in London is this week between the Lions and the Chiefs . Only eight of the 30 teams to play in England went there with a winning record and , of course , this week is another two teams with losing records . The other problem with the games in London this year ? The penalties . English fans I speak with always complain about the huddles and the penalties slowing the games down . In the two previous games this year , there were 43 penalties . Each penalty stops the game for two to three minutes and it interrupts the action to the point where people wonder about the game . Hopefully , this weekend there will be a number of no huddle plays ( Detroit averages six and Kansas City averages four ) and the penalties are way down .
