The Seahawks ( 11 6 ) didn t score until Russell Wilson s short touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin early in the fourth quarter . Being unable to punch it in while in the red zone while allowing the opponent to score in the red zone was a factor , Adrian Peterson s lost fumble was a factor , and , ? of course , the missed field goal was a factor . The missed field goal to win the game stings and it s something that will linger for a long time , but to me it doesn t mar the season Walsh had , particularly when you factor in what he overcame during the preseason .
