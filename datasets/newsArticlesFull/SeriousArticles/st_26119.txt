? The Broncos have everyone on the field and healthy according to HC Gary Kubiak . The biggest question mark is CB Chris Harris , Jr , who has a shoulder injury and basically played as much as he could vs Pittsburgh ? with one arm . Kubiak said Harris was doing better this week heading into the game than he was last week . That will be something to keep an eye on because you talk to media folks out here and they all think the biggest problem the Broncos have going into the game is Brady vs the secondary .
