Mr Cameron committed Britain to spending over ? 1 billion in reconstruction funds if a peace deal could be put together and a new Syrian Government formed . He made clear that while Assad could not be a part of this new regime his army would not be dismantled and many parts of the state apparatus would remain unchanged . He promised not to make the same mistake as after the Iraq war when the Americans disbanded the Iraqi army fuelling instability in the country . The Prime Minister also claimed that degrading Isis would strengthen moderate opposition forces against President Assad and increase the likelihood of an orderly political transition in Syria . ?
