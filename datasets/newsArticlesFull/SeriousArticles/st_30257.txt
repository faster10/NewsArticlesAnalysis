The game total on Chiefs Texans is 40 points with visiting Kansas City favored by 3 . 5 . The Chiefs ' team total is below 22 . . . . As Houston finished the season No . 7 in Football Outsiders ' pass defense DVOA but 13th versus the run , Texans DC Romeo Crennel ' s unit is technically more vulnerable on the ground . After appearing to pull ahead of Spencer Ware in Week 16 , Charcandrick West finished the finale against Oakland with a 54 snap rate to Ware ' s 46 and 14 touches to Ware ' s 16 . A second half lead contributed to Ware ' s clock killing usage bump , but he was also more effective ( 16 76 1 ) on the ground than West ( 13 34 ) and remains the favorite for goal line work . West and Ware are best viewed as timeshare backs in what ' s still a sub par matchup . West offers superior big play ability Ware is the better bet for a short score . . . . Houston played shutdown pass defense in the second half of 2015 , holding the following signal callers to weekly fantasy finishes in parentheses : Andy Dalton ( QB24 ) , Drew Brees ( QB19 ) , Tom Brady ( QB13 ) , Blake Bortles ( QB31 ) . The Texans did allow top 12 weeks to Tyrod Taylor ( QB7 ) and Ryan Fitzpatrick ( QB12 ) , however , and they have in common movement ability in and outside the pocket . As does Alex Smith , who ranked fourth among quarterbacks in rushing yards ( 498 ) this season . My expectations remain capped , but Smith ' s scrambling helps his floor as a DFS punt . I also think his top two pass catchers could be quality plays , which puts me onto Smith a bit .
