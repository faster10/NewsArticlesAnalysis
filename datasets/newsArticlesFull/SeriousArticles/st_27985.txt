There were also the typical number of dropped passes for the offense , and poor tackling and missed assignments by the defense that cannot be controlled by Ben McAdoo or Steve Sapgnuolo . Spagnuolo s scheme got some pressure on Ryan Fitzpatrick , but there were far too many missed tackles on the afternoon . Coming into the game , we knew that the safety position would struggle , but neither Prince Amukamara nor Dominique Rodgers Cromartie had a good game which cannot be blamed on the coaches . Ditto to Josh Brown missing the 48 yard field goal , it cannot be blamed on the coaches .
