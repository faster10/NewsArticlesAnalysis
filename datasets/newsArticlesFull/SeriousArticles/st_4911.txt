Paul F . Chavez , president of the Cesar Chavez Foundation , said at the time , " For my father , La Paz was a personal refuge from bitter struggles in agricultural valleys and big cities , a spiritual harbor where he recharged batteries , drew fresh inspiration and prepared for the battles ahead . It was a place where many dedicated people spent years of their lives working with Cesar Chavez for social justice , inspiring generations of Americans from all walks of life who never worked on a farm to social and political activism .
