We noted for a long time that we expected Clinton to benefit from the departure of Joe Biden the two shared a large base of support . If you look at the trend in Iowa over the course of the month , Clinton was already gaining steam even before Biden bowed out . Now that he ' s gone , it ' s not surprising she would surge even further ahead . ( We ' ve included a " Biden Clinton " line as a sort of guidepost of what we might expect Clinton to see if Biden ' s base was 100 percent shared with her ? which is an overestimation of what she ' ll actually get but is still instructive . )
