LENNON : That will be Murphy ' s choice , actually . The Mets were hesitant about extending a qualifying offer to him before October , but after his Babe Ruth impression during the playoffs for the first two rounds anyway dangling 15 . 8 million on a one year deal is worth the risk . Odds are , Murphy won ' t take it , and the Mets get a compensation pick , so it ' s win win . In the off chance that Murphy does , it ' s a short commitment , and the Mets will hang on to a . 300 hitter that gives them insurance at a number of infield positions . After Game 5 , Murphy said he enjoyed his time with the Mets . But with the indelible image of that grounder skipping under his glove in Game 4 , Murphy may also think it ' s time for a fresh start to go with a bigger payday somewhere else .
