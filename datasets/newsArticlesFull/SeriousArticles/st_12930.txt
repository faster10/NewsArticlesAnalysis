The movie within a movie is directed by Damian Cockburn ( Steve Coogan ) and stars chubby clown Jeff Portnoy ( Jack Black ) , rapper Alpa Chino ( Brandon T . Jackson ) , action beefcake Tugg Speedman ( Stiller ) and Aussie method man Kirk Lazarus ( Robert Downey Jr . ) . The latter is a temperamental chameleon who takes his craft so seriously he has undergone skin pigmentation treatment for his role as a black GI . ( Any resemblance to Russell Crowe is entirely superficial but can hardly be coincidental . )
