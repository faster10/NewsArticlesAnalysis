" Many Americans believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman , and most Americans live in states where that is the law today , " said Judge Michael Boudin , appointed to the bench in 1992 by President George H . W . Bush . " One virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice , but this applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same sex marriage .
