Perez : I think what it boiled down to is that we were young . We were married and together 24 hours a day , seven days a week . We had to learn how to handle that and that was both of us . It ' s not like she brought up the idea and I was fighting it because honestly I was right there with her . We communicated with each other and when that came out on the table it wasn ' t like I hadn ' t thought of it myself . The more we talked about it and the more time went on , it wasn ' t a long time , maybe a month , we ended up patching things up and making a promise that we would never let that happen again .
