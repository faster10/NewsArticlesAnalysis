Thank you Mr Trump for bringing issues to the forefront , and thank you for engaging many in the discussion who have not been engaged before . I saw it somewhere on television many years ago and I never forgot it ? and it was on television , too , Trump said . While other participants didn t outright condone him , they also didn t endorse him , expressing reservations about comments Trump has previously made that could be construed as offensive . It was the biggest show in the history of CNN , Trump said . Couzens says about 50 black ministers showed up to Trump Tower , not the 100 that had been promised ? or touted afterward .
