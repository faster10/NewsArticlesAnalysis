Atlanta Falcons : Quarterback Matt Ryan is struggling a bit , but he has never lost three games in a row at the Georgia Dome . The Vikings come to town boasting the NFL ' s top rusher in Adrian Peterson ( 1 , 006 yards ) , but the Falcons have the league ' s top rushing defense , allowing just 87 . 4 rushing yards per game . If Ryan shakes off his slump and if the defense can at least contain Peterson , the Falcons should be able to get back on track after losing three straight . The wild card here might be the play of rookie running back Tevin Coleman , seemingly destined to replace Devonta Freeman , who is recovering from a concussion . Falcons 21 , Vikings 17 .
