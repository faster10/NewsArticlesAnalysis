And so , from a very young age , if I didn ' t feel well , she ' s like , " Well , draw what ' s happening and draw a solution . " If I had a stomach ache , I would draw a picture of my stomach , and I would draw what I thought the bad germs looked like and , you know , they had little robber masks on and stuff . And then I would draw a good germ , and of course it had a cape , and some tights , and he had a washcloth in his hands , and he could fly around and clean up the bad germs . And for some reason , I would always feel better afterwards .
