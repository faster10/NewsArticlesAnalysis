Weinfuss : One by one , their lockers are lined up like a murderers ' row , of sorts . Fitzgerald . Michael Floyd . John Brown . Jaron Brown . J . J . Nelson . There isn ' t one specific thing that makes this group of receivers unique . It ' s five things . Each brings a specific trait and skill set to the Cardinals ' offense . But to sum it up in one word , the Cardinals receivers ' calling card is their diversity . While Fitzgerald can do it all , he has found success out of the slot which is where his two catches in overtime against Green Bay came from . Floyd is the Cardinals ' big play threat . He can go up and over defensive backs when needed . John Brown has the speed and the hands to break off a big play on a deep route or a short one . Jaron Brown flies under radar in a wide receivers ' room that features a future Hall of Famer but is generally a lesser known reliable option . And Nelson , the rookie , hasn ' t been utilized since Week 13 , but he has the fastest wheels on the team .
