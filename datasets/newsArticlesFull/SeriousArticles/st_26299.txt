But if there s one thing that may unite our cold , divided populace on this chilly January morning , it s hating the Oscars . The Academy Awards yearly nomination pool was announced this morning on ABC , and nearly everyone should be able to find something to dislike . Were you angered by last year s OscarsSoWhite controversy and wanted to see a more diverse crop of nominees ? Too bad . Just like in 2015 , every single acting nominee was white . Idris Elba ( Beasts of No Nation ) was snubbed in favor of Tom Hardy ( The Revenant ) , despite the fact that Elba was nominated at the Golden Globes and SAG awards and Hardy was not . Also missing were Will Smith ( Concussion ) and Michael B . Jordan ( Creed ) , while movies that at least had people of color in them ( Straight Outta Compton , The Force Awakens ) were bumped from Best Picture .
