? That s a bit harsh . But you re point is well taken . I flew in Sunday from Sydney and sat a few rows from Viktor Troicki , who had just won the title . I m thinking : good for him . But how is he going to play his best when he arrives at a major less than a day before first ball ? This is always the issue with these tune ups . The players want some prep work . But a ) the best players aren t taking matches and risking fatigue before the event . B ) other players are withdrawing at the drop of a visor ? and in the case of Bernard Tomic , they re unapologetic about it .
