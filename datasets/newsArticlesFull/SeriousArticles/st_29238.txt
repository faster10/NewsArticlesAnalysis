It is interesting that in response to ISIS ' hostage taking , President Obama ordered a review of U . S . policy on this issue . Even though other countries , particularly Israel , negotiate and trade with terrorist groups , it is virtually certain that Washington won ' t change its official policy . But it should in the event there are real opportunities to redeem hostages look the other way , if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members ? Sure nobody wants to give in to terror and enable more hostage taking . But on the other hand , do we just write these Americans off as simply unlucky souls in the wrong place at the wrong time ? After all , if this was your son , father , husband , wife , daughter or sister , would that be an acceptable response from your government ?
