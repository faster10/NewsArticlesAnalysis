Nigeria previously had said its military drove the extremists out of towns and villages in the Maiduguri region previous year but the recent attack indicates that the group identified as the deadliest terrorist organisation has little intention of retreating . Three suicide bombers , all women , then ran into a group of people fleeing to a nearby village , the AP reported . I urge all citizens wherever they live to own the war against terror and to be part of the fight because it is the only way we can finish the remaining work that needs to be done to make our country safe again , Buhari said , according to Agence France Presse ( AFP ) . He said several members of his family were among those killed or wounded .
