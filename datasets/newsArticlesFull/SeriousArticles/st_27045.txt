Hillary is ready for the debates . She won t have as many debates in which to hone her skills as the eventual GOP nominee , but she has many other edges , including her 2008 experience the fact that going forward she will face only one or two opponents rather than nine or so on the debate stage ( much closer to the dynamics in a general election ) her professionalised and experienced debate prep team ( many of whom worked the same gig for Barack Obama ) and her own fearsome , dogged , and scrupulous preparation .
