That doesn ' t mean the atmosphere can ' t kick up a planet girdling storm when the weather is just right . Right now , as evening approaches , the sky is a dusty pink , tending to brown black in the east . The sun is a brilliant disk in the west , one third smaller than I ' m used to on Earth and not nearly as warming . Feathery layers of dust fan out around the lowering sun , and a few smeared out ice crystal clouds glint silvery gray , but the rest of the sky is clear , and the stars above stand out brighter and sharper than night on Mauna Kea .
