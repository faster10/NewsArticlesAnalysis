Li : Of course he will be convicted , otherwise it would be disastrous . But the sentencing now can ' t be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they ' ve conducted this trial . So there are difficulties for the prosecution unless there are dramatic twists and turns in the following days . I think certainly the sentencing won ' t be the death penalty , probably not even the death penalty commuted to life . The worst is probably the life sentence , and the most lenient probably 15 years .
