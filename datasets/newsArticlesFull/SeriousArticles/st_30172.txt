I also wonder about including so many recent popular novels , such as Jonathan Franzen ' s " The Corrections " or " The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao " by Junot Diaz or , even more puzzling , " The Secret History " by Donna Tartt . These books made a splash , and continue to find readers , but any one of a dozen or more books could have been substituted for these , and the books in this category would certainly change with the decades . In the ' 20s , everyone thought you should read " Java Head " by Joseph Hergesheimer . In the ' 30s , you would have been asked to read " Seven Who Fled " by Frederic Prokosch .
