My parents were drawn up from the cotton fields of the rural South . Daddy wanted to be a farmer when he got home from France , but the best he could do was sharecropping and there was never a man who made a fortune growing another man ' s crop . They lived in a bit of a shack with no electricity or indoor plumbing and sheets were hung in the single room to provide privacy for sleeping and when the wind blew cold in the winter Ma said they tacked newspapers over the spaces between the wallboards because there was no insulation .
