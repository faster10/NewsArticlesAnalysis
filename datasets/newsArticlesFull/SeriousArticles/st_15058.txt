Yes , Carrie Fisher ' s Princess Leia in the original trilogy paved the way for characters like Rey . But even though Leia had agency which was inspiring for many girls and nonconforming boys ( like this one ) her fiercest moments always felt like false starts ( Taking a stand against Darth Vader , but then needing to be rescued from him or rescuing Han Solo from Jabba the Hut , only to be enslaved in a metal bikini or hopping on a speed bike to catch an enemy in the woods awesome ! but then getting pushed off and leaving Luke to finish the chase . ) Now Leia is in command as a general , a role in the world of Star Wars that had only everbeen occupied by distinguished looking men or amphibious male aliens .
