The President struck the right note when he commented on the frequency with which we have had to endure these acts of terror and the fact that we simply cannot allow these mass murders to become " the new normal " that have come to define our daily lives . There are , as I have noted in an earlier article the killings in Charleston , more than one mass shooting per day in the United States and all too often these horrific acts are committed by mentally disturbed individuals with access to weapons of unconscionable lethality . Some are crimes of passion , while others have political intent . In the latter case , whether at a church in South Carolina , a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado , or an office party in California , there have been too many instances where insane people armed with sophisticated weaponry have acted out their ideological fantasies taking the lives of just plain folks who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time .
