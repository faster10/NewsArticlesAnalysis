Chris Nissen of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania I heard Pavarotti perform twice in Philadelphia during the years he sponsored an operatic competition for young performers . I still have goose bumps thinking about the brilliance of those two evenings . Not only was his performance breathtaking , but his genuine joy in sharing the stage with the winners of the competition was obvious and written all over his face with a grand smile . Whenever I need to feel inspired with my own work I go and dig out my Pavarotti CDs . Bravo to the great one !
