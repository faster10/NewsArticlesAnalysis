Stone : Writer Stanley Weiser and myself did a lot of research . There ' s not much known about the first George W . Bush administration , the first few years . It ' s coming out gradually from " Price of Loyalty " author Ron Suskind and " The Bush Tragedy " author Jacob Weisburg , and it ' s coming out gradually . We ' re finding out about oil and the secret meeting . It is supposition . There are geopolitics involved . There are other issues at stake . We ' re trying to do justice . We allowed Cheney to speak for himself and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to speak for himself . And former Secretary of State Colin Powell , by the way , is the guy that argues with Cheney in that scene . iReport . com : Will you see ' W . ' ?
