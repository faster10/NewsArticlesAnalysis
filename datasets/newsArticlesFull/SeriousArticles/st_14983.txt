In a New York Times op ed published Thursday before his town hall on guns , President Obama called the " epidemic of gun violence " in the United States a " crisis , " and said it was time to " demand leaders brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby ' s lies . " Gun related deaths and injuries " constitute one of the greatest threats to public health and to the safety of the American people , " and while it will be hard to reduce gun violence , " there are steps we can take now to save lives . " As president , Obama wrote , he used his legal authority to issue executive actions , and as a citizen , " I will not campaign for , vote for , or support any candidate , even in my own party , who does not support common sense gun reform . And if the 90 percent of Americans who do support common sense gun reforms join me , we will elect the leadership we deserve . "
