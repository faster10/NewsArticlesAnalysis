President Obama yesterday urged fast development of vaccines and treatments ( there are none at the moment ) , which is good . And today the World Health Organization ( burned by its slow response to Ebola ) announced it was scrambling to put plans into action . But in the meantime , the fears are so visceral and the images so graphic that it ' s possible to imagine a future where easy contact begins to break down . ( Zika has also been tentatively linked to a bizarre condition called Guillain Barre , whose victims are paralyzed for weeks or longer . ) The social and ideological stresses of the 20th century divided the world into distinct camps now , as we are forcing the planet ' s physical systems to change at the same breakneck pace , it seems possible that we ' ll see a replay of those divisions , this time along epidemiological lines , and as usual making life hardest for those who have done the least to cause our problems . Zika provides a glimpse into a future we should do everything possible to avoid , a terrifying reminder why the fight for a stable physical planet is the fight of our time .
