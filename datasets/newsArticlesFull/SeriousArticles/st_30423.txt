The New York Jets , with a record of 5 3 started the season strongly with wins over teams such as Indianapolis and Miami , but they have since petered out , only just beating Jacksonville 28 23 on Sunday . The Pittsburgh Steelers are just half a game behind New York with a 5 4 record . Injuries have plagued this team , and will continue to do so , but their gutsy win over Oakland on Sunday proved that they continue to fight for a play off spot . The Raiders loss to Pittsburgh may prove costly as they look to make the play offs for the first time since 2002 . At 4 4 , Oakland have looked strong in parts throughout the season and a win over New York over a week ago may give them upper hand should the play offs be decided by tiebreakers . ?
