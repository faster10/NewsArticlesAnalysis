The insular Hollywood Foreign Press Association released its yearly slate of nominees this morning ? which covers both TV and film ? and the results were characteristically kooky . The HFPA apparently liked Outlander ( nominating it for three awards ) , while recognizing the artistic contributions of Wiz Khalifa and Ellie Goulding ? both of whom earned Best Original Song mentions . And throughout the land , a curious sound rung out Thursday morning , one that made the animals stir . Was it the clompety clomp of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ? Close . It was the announcement of Golden Globe nominee Lady Gaga , a curious cry that may never be unheard .
