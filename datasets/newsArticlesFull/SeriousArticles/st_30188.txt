Over the past few years of Democrat control in the Senate , too often the minority party was shut out of the legislative process , leading to dysfunction and gridlock . Under Republican control , the Senate will get back to work . Creating jobs and encouraging economic growth should be bipartisan priorities , and we look forward to working with Democrats on everything from repealing the job killing medical device tax to approving the job creating Keystone XL pipeline . We hope Democrats and the President will join us .
