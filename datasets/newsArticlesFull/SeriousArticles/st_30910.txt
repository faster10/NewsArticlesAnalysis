Cruz claims to have inherited an ability to interpret science from his parents and then immediately confuses the political debate surrounding climate change with the actual science of climate change . Scientists aren t in the business of labeling non scientists and politicians deniers ? though perhaps they should be . ? Scientists develop and test hypotheses , following the data wherever it leads . Belief and heresy have no place in a scientific context : There s the evidence ( the facts ) and a working theory or framework that explains it . Cruz fatuously uses the phrase accepted scientific wisdom , but it s utterly meaningless . There is no accepted wisdom in science . The best explanation we have is cautiously accepted until new evidence and a better theory supplants it ? wisdom has nothing to do with it .
