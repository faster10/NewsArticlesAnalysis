Officials and analysts with ties to Riyadh say it was just a timeline laid out by the judicial process . Saudi Arabia did not take into account Iran when carrying out the sentences on the convicted terrorists , said Mohammed Alyahya , research fellow at the Gulf Research Centre thinktank , based in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . During the judicial process leading to his conviction , his case was scrutinised by 13 judges in three courts . But the country s judiciary is not isolated from its ruling family and it was clear that the execution would stir up tensions . Some analysts think the move was intended to reinforce Saudi Arabia s alliances by reminding western nations where their core interests lie in times of turmoil .
