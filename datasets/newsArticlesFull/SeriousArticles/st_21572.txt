One of the Warriors greatest attributes and this is a testament to the brilliance of Steve Kerr and Luke Walton is making on the fly , in game adjustments . If the Dubs sense a mismatch of some sort , whether it s a particular defender or the way a team defends a particular set , they will exploit it immediately . A couple weeks ago , the Warriors made an epic comeback against the Clippers after the Clips kept showing and trapping Curry Green pick and rolls , resulting in Green playing 4 on 3 and simply finding the open shooter . Andre Iguodala in the right corner . Boom . Iguodala in the left corner . Bang . Game over . If the Warriors burn you a couple times , adjust accordingly . Also , play your best lineups . Every minute counts .
