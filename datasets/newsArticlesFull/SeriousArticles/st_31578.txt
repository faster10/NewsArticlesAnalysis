The second problem is worse , though . Healthy people often don ' t know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick . Healthy people , after all , don ' t make as much use of their plans .

The way the private insurance market works today , almost no one has the luxury of firing the insurance company once he or she figures out it isn ' t doing a good job .
