AMD is the top cause of blindness among people 65 and older living in the developed world . It occurs when blood vessels or cells in the macula , the central portion of the retina responsible for central vision and seeing sharp detail , begin to break down . In early AMD , people have no vision loss or other symptoms , but do have yellow deposits in the retina called drusen . Some people with early AMD ( but not all of them ) will develop late AMD , in which a person has larger drusen and a blurred area at the center of their visual field .
