Sorensen : I assume so . I don ' t think Mr Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion . Just as I don ' t think Senator Barack Obama should be denied because of his race . Or that Mrs Hillary Clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender . This country is in deep , serious trouble , and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion , race , or gender .
