There, users can track every single murmur and cardiac pulse as he spends six days in Austin, TX. The project, in collaboration with artists Luke Turner and Nastja Säde Rönkkö and DAZED magazine, is meant to encourage people “to tune in to the loving side of our selves; the imaginative, the intuitive, the compassionate, the inner wisdom we all possess.” Or you can just try to guess what exactly LaBeouf is doing at 3 o'clock in the morning when his BPM suddenly increases.
