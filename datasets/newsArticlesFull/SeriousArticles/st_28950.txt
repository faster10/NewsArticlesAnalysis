About the Chiefs : Are the hottest team in the NFL , with a 10 game winning streak , longest ever for a team coached by Andy Reid . . . Back in the playoffs for the first time since the epic collapse at Indianapolis two years ago when they led by 28 in the second half . That team started the season 9 0 and finished 2 5 . This year ' s club started 1 5 and finished 10 0 . . . Quarterback Alex Smith is 1 2 in postseason starts his victory came following the 2011 season when he was with the 49ers . The Chiefs really leaned on Smith after star running back Jamaal Charles went down with a knee injury in Week 5 . Smith ' s 3 , 486 passing yards and 498 rushing yards both were career highs . . . It ' s been the defense , though , that ' s carried the Chiefs during their streak . Only once in the last 10 games has it allowed more than 20 points . . . KC offensive coordinator Doug Pederson is one of the many names mentioned as candidates for the Eagles ' head coaching job .
