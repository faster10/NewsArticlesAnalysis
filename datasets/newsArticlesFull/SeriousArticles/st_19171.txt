" He knew when he was running for president that quite frankly the American public doesn ' t actually care that much about the uninsured . . . . What the American public cares about is costs . And that ' s why even though the bill that they made is 90 health insurance coverage and 10 about cost control , all you ever hear people talk about is cost control . How it ' s going to lower the cost of health care , that ' s all they talk about . Why ? Because that ' s what people want to hear about because a majority of American care about health care costs .
