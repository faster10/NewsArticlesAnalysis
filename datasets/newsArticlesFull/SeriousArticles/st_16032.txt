Mr Chapo , wouldn ' t it be cool that you started trafficking with love ? With cures for diseases , with food for the homeless children , with alcohol for the retirement homes that don ' t let the elderly spend the rest of the days doing whatever the fuck they want . Imagine trafficking with corrupt politicians instead of women and children who end up as slaves . Why don ' t you burn all those whorehouses where women are worth less than a pack of cigarettes . Without offer , there ' s no demand . Come on , Don ! You would be the hero of heroes . Let ' s traffic with love . You know how to . Life is a business and the only thing that changes is the merchandise . Don ' t you agree ?
