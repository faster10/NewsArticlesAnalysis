Continuing in the same vein , BJP minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy , Giriraj Singh and Sushil Kumar Modi mocked Nitish Kumar for allegedly publishing ads in Dawn , a Pakistani newspaper . They had posted screenshots to make their point , but what they had actually done was post screenshots of the online version of Dawn . Sadly , what they were doing was displaying an alarming amount of ignorance about how Google Adsense worked , which led Nitish Kumar to mock them on Twitter . Kumar wrote on Twitter that it seemed like BJP leaders didn t understand the basic aspects of the digital world , and maybe Sundar Pichai ( Google s CEO ) could help them .
