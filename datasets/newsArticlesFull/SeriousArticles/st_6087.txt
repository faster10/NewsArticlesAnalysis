Because of this , my older daughter , 6 year old Elyse , spends a lot more time at home than many of her peers . There are a lot of things Elyse doesn ' t get to do . I am not a " Let ' s join the traveling soccer team and spend hours every week on the road " mom . I ' m not a " Do every activity you want as long as you get your schoolwork done " mom . I am not a " playdates every weekend " mom , a " spectator at every event " mom or a " spontaneous family trip " mom . " ( Hell , I ' m not even a " well planned vacation " mom . ) Depending on Anabelle ' s health , I ' m not even a " tuck you into bed every night " mom .
