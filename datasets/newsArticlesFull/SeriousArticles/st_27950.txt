While before a person had to be personally exposed , through people or perhaps a book , to vile characterizations of Jews , today anti Semitism is prominently available everywhere anytime to those seeking it out or to the innocent person just looking for information . Typing " Jew " into Google or Bing returns a top site ( sometimes No . 2 ) called JewWatch , which is a vast emporium of anti Semitic accusations and hatred claiming 1 . 5 billion pages in support of its mission to defame and eliminate Jews and their supposed power . This is but one of tens of thousands of anti Semitic hate sites , which include a growing alternative to Wikipedia , called Metapedia , which seeks to create ( currently in 18 languages ) an anti Semitic informational universe .
