' From my point of view it ' s not about the coach . It ' s about the players , it ' s about winning and it ' s about English cricket . We ' ve got a very committed bunch of players and support staff who desperately want to win for England . So I ' m going no further than the next five weeks when we ' ve got three Tests against tough opposition . If we do well we ' ll get some momentum going into what is a very big summer . So that ' s got to be the focus , on playing the right sort of cricket because that ' s what the fans want .
