Munoz : Because I have a family at my house and I have a second family out there . And that ' s about 130 to 140 guys . And there ' s always a line out there . And the economy is not good right now , and those who have a place to stay have to choose between a place to live and food . And when we ' re there they have something to eat . At least we provide a little something , and the only thing we ask in return is a smile . If you hand a meal to someone who hasn ' t eaten anything in the last 20 hours and they smile , you know you did something good .
