" Puss in Boots " entered theaters a week earlier , but it will need to endure even better than " Megamind " to earn back its budget . The " A " CinemaScore grade it earned from audiences should at least make that achievement possible , but considering people are already familiar with the " Puss in Boots " character , it ' s doubtful that the film will attract many uninitiated viewers . We won ' t officially know where " Puss in Boots " is headed until next weekend , when we see how much the snowstorm , the World Series , and Halloween really affected the box office this frame . ( My guess is not much and I ' m not just being catty . )
