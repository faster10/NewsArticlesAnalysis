We re not happy , center Kory Lichtensteiger said . I think it could ve been better , but that s the way it goes . I think we re just thinking of reminiscing . I ve seen a lot of guys grow . I ve seen a lot of guys come into their own as players . It s not the way we wanted it to end , but over time I think we ll at least be pleased with the development in guys and the chemistry we kind of had as an O Line . We re kind of bummed , but at the same time I think we can appreciate the things we did .
