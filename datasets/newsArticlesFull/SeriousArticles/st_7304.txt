These are all important issues , of course , but it s easy to guess why Clinton wants to do this from a political perspective . Talk about Wall Street and you talk about her ties to Wall Street , the donations she s taken from the sector , her outlandish speaking fees from Goldman Sachs . The debate showed that she doesn t have a good answer on any of these things . She called for money to be taken out of politics but insisted that the money she s taken hasn t influenced her ? a self evidently oxymoronic position . She also deflected a question on whether or not she ll release the transcripts of all those paid speeches she gave to Goldman and others , a topic sure to come up again .
