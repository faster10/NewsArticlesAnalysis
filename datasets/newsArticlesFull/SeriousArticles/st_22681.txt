Bowie was never much of a sportsman . Though a picture emerged this week of him lining up in his primary school football team , his knees hardly look those of a natural athlete . You imagine he was one of those kids always to be found skiving round the back of the bike shed with a packet of No 6 when cross country was on the curriculum . When the PE teachers were seeking a front row for the school rugby pack , there was no point looking in the direction of the young David Jones . Even in later life , he always preferred a good book to a jog . That enviably slim profile was maintained through a strict diet of Marlboro Lights rather than daily gym sessions .
