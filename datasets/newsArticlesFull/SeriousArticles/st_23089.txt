Today more than 80 of patients at the Trinitas clinic are considered non detectable that is , they show few to no outward signs of having HIV . The Trinitas program is helping them keep their health under control and preventing their HIV from becoming full blown AIDS . When the community needs support and a partner in the fight against HIV , the clinic is there for those affected by the virus . For Shawn Sullivan , and thousands of others throughout the last two decades , it has been a lifeline . For a patient group still stigmatized by a three letter diagnosis , it ' s a haven . And it ' s another example of how Trinitas Regional Medical Center is going above and beyond for the community at large .
