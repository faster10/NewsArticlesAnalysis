We are better than that . We must , individually , begin discussions with family members , friends , neighbors , and coworkers about the way that these ideological acts of terrorism are corrupting our nation and tearing us apart , that the threat of terrorism does not come from across our borders but from across the table . It is not sufficient to " like " a post or share an article through social media . We must talk about these things face to face with those close to us , with love and concern yes , with understanding and generosity yes , but with firm commitment to name our concerns and show this false sense of patriotism for what it truly is domestic terrorism .
