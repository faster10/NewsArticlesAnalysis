He adds , " Whenever I launch a new project , I can hear the bullets hitting the door , and I say , ' Should I open the door ? ' But I always open the door . I know people are waiting for me to fail ? everyone is human . But it shouldn ' t affect you . Someone not liking my work doesn ' t mean I have to give the awards or the money back . People who don ' t like your work have no effect on you . But people who like your work do have an effect on you . They buy your DVDs . When people don ' t like your work , they don ' t exist . It ' s anti matter . "
