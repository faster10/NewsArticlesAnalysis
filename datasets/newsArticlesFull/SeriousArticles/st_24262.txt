Clinton also lacks an ability to unify the nation . She is and always has been a polarising figure in America . Eight years ago this troubled me more . American politics has grown so divisive ? and the fault can be apportioned to any number of places , including the Tea Party , Fox News and the aftermath of the global financial crisis ? that it s hard to imagine any of the current crop of candidates bringing the nation to a common purpose . Obama notably failed , so I can hardly judge Clinton harshly on this score .
