But let s grant Rubio all the conditions he assumes will come to pass before voting starts in South Carolina : He finishes third in Iowa , takes a commanding second in New Hampshire , and afterward all his rivals pack it in and throw their support behind Rubio . If you look at the current polling averages in South Carolina ( where Rubio is running a distant third ) , the combined support of Rubio , Jeb , Kasich and Christie is good enough for second place ? nearly 10 ? points behind Trump s commanding lead , and not so far ahead of Ted Cruz as to be unassailable . Does Rubio believe that Trump , after winning New Hampshire , will suddenly experience the collapse that so many people have been wrongly predicting ? If Jeb doesn t drop out and decides to stick around through South Carolina , things start looking mighty prickly for Rubio , given that the two are basically running even in the state right now .
