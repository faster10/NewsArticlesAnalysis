OR : Rihanna has been my muse from the beginning . I have been listening to her albums since I was young and followed her career . I love women and I love wonder women those kind of women who have no boundaries and no ( limits ) and have this power to express themselves . And I had the chance to meet her two years ago and it was love at first sight literally . She showed me how to believe in myself and push the boundaries and limits at the same time keeping control of your life and that I think is the best I could learn from her .
