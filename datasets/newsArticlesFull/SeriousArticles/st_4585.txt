There ' s some dark irony to that , as Pinkel was embroiled in a scandal last year when ESPN reported the coach knew about a rape allegation against former running back Derrick Washington , and he did not discipline the player because police didn ' t file charges . In 2010 , Washington was charged with deviant sexual assault . ESPN reported Washington was accused of assault by four different women before his arrest and dismissal from the team . The situation was not too dissimilar to the recent events at Baylor , where head coach Art Briles was skewered by the media for his lack of vetting of a transfer from Boise State with a checkered past . The transfer , Sam Ukwuachu , was convicted of rape after arriving at Baylor .
