DISS OF THE DAY with ABC s MERIDITH MCGRAW : FUEL FEUDS . Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad the longest serving governor in United States history tries to avoid endorsing candidates before his state s caucuses . But yesterday , when asked if he wanted Texas Sen . Ted Cruz to lose the caucuses , Branstad shocked reporters by saying yes . I think it would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him , Branstad said at the Renewable Fuels Summit in Iowa . The reason for Branstad s brutal honesty ? Federal ethanol mandates . Cruz does not support the federal requirement that ethanol from corn must be mixed in gasoline , while Branstad is a big biofuel fan . Cruz s main opponent , Donald Trump , reveled in the rejection , writing on Twitter : Wow , the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that Ted Cruz must be defeated . Big shocker ! People do not like Ted .
