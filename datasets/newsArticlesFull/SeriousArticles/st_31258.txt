This is quite possibly the least likely scenario , as North Carolina was slotted 10th in the committee rankings released Tuesday night . But if the Tar Heels down Clemson in the ACC title game , especially in a lopsided affair , I am of the opinion they would be worthy of a playoff berth . They would meet most of the necessary criteria . Conference champions ? Check . Finished strong ? Check . Take the team name out of the equation , and North Carolina s offense has basically been Baylor s : The Bears average 7 . 47 yards per play , first in the nation , while Carolina averages 7 . 46 , second in the FBS .
