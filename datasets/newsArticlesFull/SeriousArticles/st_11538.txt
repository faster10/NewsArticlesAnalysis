Richt will depart Athens , GA with a better winning percentage ( . 739 ) than any coach in school history . ( Yes , better than Vince Dooley , and better than Wally Butts . ) Unfortunately for Richt , just two SEC titles and no National Titles was not enough success . I understand that , but I also stand by a statement I made a decade ago , if I had a son worthy of playing college football at the top level I d be a very happy father knowing Mark Richt was his head coach . ( Yes , I obviously add Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze to that list , and think the world of Herman after just one season at UH . )
