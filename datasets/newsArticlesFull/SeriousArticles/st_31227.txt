From Bill Barnwell ' s story on how the Broncos can beat the Patriots : " Brady Manning XVII is expected to be an exercise in squeezing Denver ' s quarterback , in Bill Belichick swarming the field on the fading Manning and waiting for the 39 year old to make mistakes . The game could very well turn out that way . New England is rightly the favorite to win this game , almost wholly because nobody trusts Manning . The divisional round victory was Manning ' s first start of the year without an interception , and it would be a small miracle if he bumped that streak to two . As much as it would be a fairy tale story in what is likely to be the last Brady Manning encounter , it ' s extremely tough to imagine the Broncos evening the quarterback gap by virtue of a classic performance from Manning .
