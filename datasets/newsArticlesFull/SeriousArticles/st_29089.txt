After exiting the train and lingering in the parking lot for a moment , persona non grata because of my female status , I was approached by an erudite looking Jew , who asked what I was doing there . He claimed that I couldn ' t possibly understand what the rally was about , that the event was for men only . Reporters inched closer , extending mikes and cameras . People seemed to think something juicy was going to happen . I opened my mouth to talk , and suddenly I felt a surge of adrenaline , the kind that makes your knees all shaky , fuel my words . It was my first time standing face to face with a man who represented my former oppressor .
