I remember the moment Lenny first mentioned improvisation , because I was horrified : he suggested I put in something along the lines of the family chat at the table , and I balked , and insisted on writing pages of dialogue instead . I see now that as a newbie screenwriter I was focusing rather too much on the dialogue as the one aspect of the script that I d bet most cinemagoers think of as constituting the whole script . Of course I paid attention to every other aspect of Room as well ? the unfolding plot , what scenes to show and how to show them , the descriptions , the characters actions ? but I know I fretted over the spoken words disproportionately . I tried to whittle them down to those that mattered most ( because the paradox is , in film , that sometimes a line can be most powerful if it s the only one spoken in a scene ) . I was aiming to get them to a state of high polish : finished .
