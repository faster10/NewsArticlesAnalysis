Well they ve other candidates been condemning practically everything I say , and then they come to my side , Trump said Tuesday on Morning Joe . They were condemning the wall , they were condemning illegal immigration , they were condemning all of the things that I ve been espousing , and now most of them are on my side . And the ones that aren t on my side are down to about zero in the polls and aren t going to go anywhere ? I mean , I see the and not everybody has condemned if you want to be specific about it . "
