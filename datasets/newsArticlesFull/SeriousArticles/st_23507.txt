Coughlin , like Shula , Belichick and other experienced , successful head coaches , would not consider coming to an NFL team without having complete control of Football Operations . That is to say , having life and death control over their respective players . Without that , there is little or no discipline . Teams like Miami , Cleveland and several others are not , it seems , willing to grant their head coaches that power . And without it , the head coach does not get the respect he needs or deserves , in most cases .
