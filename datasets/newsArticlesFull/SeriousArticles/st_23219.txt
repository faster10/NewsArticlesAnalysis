Brooklyn , New York ( VBS . TV ) Several events converged recently that conspired to take me back to the summer of 2006 , the summer I snuck into Iraq . The first event was the Iraqi elections . The second was the Oscars . The third was a concert at a little bar tucked into a hip corner of the hippest neighborhood in the world Williamsburg , Brooklyn . These events all brought me a little closer to that time , a little closer to recalling the way things were back then . And I realized how much I had forgotten .
