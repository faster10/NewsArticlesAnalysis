When you open the app , you can choose from a set of icons at the bottom of the screen to send a poke , type a 120 character message , open the camera to snap a picture ( you cannot choose an existing photo from your camera roll , but you can add fun doodles or text on top of the picture you do take ) , or shoot a 10 second video . Decide how long you want the other person to see your message or photo ( 1 , 3 , 5 or 10 seconds ) , add a location if you like , then choose one or more of your Facebook friends from the list and hit send .
