Higher standards are already working their magic on a piecemeal basis . This fall California , which has a population of about 38 million ( about the size of Poland ) , passed legislation mandating that 50 percent of the electricity provided by utilities in the state by 2030 must come from renewable sources , a requirement that will trigger a host of investment and innovation . Alberta , a large province in Canada that is home to a great deal of oil production , has just placed a tax on carbon . If China , already the largest car market in the world , were to seriously enforce its mileage standards , it would force automakers to develop and sell cars that are much more fuel efficient . In the short term , the pull of these standards ? telling businesses that if they want to participate in very large markets they have to make products that pollute less and use less energy ? is much more powerful than the push of whiz bang new technologies . Inertia will prevent homeowners from buying better insulation so that their homes use much less heating and cooling power . Telling builders they can t get a certificate of occupancy for a newly constructed house unless it meets passive house standards would spark a revolution in construction .
