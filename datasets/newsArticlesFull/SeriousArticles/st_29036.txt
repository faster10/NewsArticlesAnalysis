The United States must play by the rules first . For example , Huawei was recently singled out by Congress as a company threatening U . S . national interests and was essentially declared unwelcome in the U . S . The telecoms giant has businesses globally , including a recent 1 . 3bn investment in the United Kingdom which would create 500 jobs . In September , Obama issued a rare presidential order instructing Ralls Corp . , whose owners are Chinese , to divest itself of four Oregon wind farm projects near a military base , citing a national security threat . But firms operated by other foreign owners in the same area are apparently conducting business as usual . Where is the level playing field ?
