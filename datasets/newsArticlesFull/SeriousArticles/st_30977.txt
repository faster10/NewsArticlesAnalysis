The revenge game narrative will be in full swing this week , but McCoy is an elite play regardless of the fact that he used to play for Philadelphia . Since returning to Buffalo ' s lineup in Week 6 , McCoy is averaging 5 . 0 yards per carry on 21 . 3 touches per game . Has has four touchdowns during that span , and his 812 scrimmage yards is third most in the league . Only Lamar Miller and Adrian Peterson have more fantasy points over that period . Set for 20 plus touches against a defense that has allowed 15 touchdowns during its past three games , McCoy is an elite play and a nice value at this price .
