I encourage everyone to help take a stand against domestic violence . My wife , Tana , and I ran the London Marathon for Women ' s Aid for the past two years . As ambassadors , we are pleased to say that we have received more than 5 , 000 in donations from friends , well wishers and supporters of the charity . Just last week , Tana and I hosted a fundraising dinner and auction for Women ' s Aid in Berkeley Square in London , which helped raise more than 475 , 000 , more than double our original target for the evening .
