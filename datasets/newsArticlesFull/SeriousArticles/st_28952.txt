About the Steelers : Needed a win and a Jets loss in Week 17 to claim the final playoff spot . . . Ben Roethlisberger has thrown six interceptions in his last three games . In the meetings against Cincy , Big Ben was more like a bedside alarm clock ( one TD , four INTs ) . Roethlisberger is 10 5 in his postseason career , but his last win was the 2010 AFC title game over Mark Sanchez and the Jets . . . The Steelers have a high risk reward defense under first year coordinator Keith Butler , the type that often confounds inexperienced QBs . . . Running back DeAngelo Williams ( right ankle ) missed practice again Thursday . If Williams , who already was filling in for star Le ' Veon Bell , can ' t go , Pittsburgh likely will turn to Fitz Toussaint , a September castoff by the Ravens . . . Cornerback Brandon Boykin has 18 tackles over the last four games and had a fumble recovery last week .
