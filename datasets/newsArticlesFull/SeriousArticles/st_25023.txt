Let ' s look back at some of the nominees . I think around 2004 , certainly there were black nominees like Don Cheadle , Morgan Freeman . And all of a sudden , you feel like we ' re moving in the wrong direction . There were nominations left off the table . There were four films this year : " Creed " could have gotten nominations " Concussion " could have gotten Will Smith a nomination Idris Elba could have been nominated for " Beasts of No Nation " and " Straight Outta Compton " could have been nominated . And certainly last year , with " Selma " director Ava DuVernay I think that it ' s just ridiculous not to nominate her .
