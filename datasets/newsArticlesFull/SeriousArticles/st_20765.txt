Crais : I really strive to bring something new to each book . I don ' t want to write the same book over and over again . I ' ve done Elvis books I ' ve done Joe books I ' ve done mixed books , but this time , I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50 50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles . When I discovered this particular story , it just seemed a perfect way to do that . Part of the book , they ' re working together . Then there ' s Elvis ' track through the story , and there ' s Joe track , where he ' s trying to find Elvis and save him . So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage .
