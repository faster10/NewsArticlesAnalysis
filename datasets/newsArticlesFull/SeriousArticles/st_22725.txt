While Trump has yet to be chosen as the 2016 Republican Presidential nominee , he has already caught the ire of Britain ' s House of Parliament , who described his sexist , bigoted , and in many cases , curiously stupid platforms as nothing short of dangerous and toxic to global politics . None was more offensive than Trump ' s proposal to temporarily halt Muslims from entering the U . S . in a downright silly attempt to curb terrorist attacks . If we ' re to be fair and adhere to such nonsense then we must also temporarily revoke the citizenship of the militia Bundy Brothers , and other violent young white men from the U . S . when they bomb federal buildings or black churches ?
