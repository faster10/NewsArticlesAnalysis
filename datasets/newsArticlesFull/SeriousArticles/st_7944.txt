While the Panthers took their foot off the gas in the second half ( and Seattle made necessary adjustments ) , that 30 minutes ? and 60 more against the Cardinals ? represent who these Panthers believe they are . Their chief commodity is pressure , and it comes in two forms . First is a defense that gets sacks ( sixth in the NFL this season ) , forces errors ( first in interceptions ) and shuts down the running game ( fourth in the NFL ) when teams adjust to save their sinking quarterback . Second is quarterback Cam Newton , who has elevated his game to the point of alternating between his less than celebrated offensive pieces to score . Tight end Greg Olsen may be his primary read one moment . Wideout Ted Ginn the next . Take them both away and he ' ll manufacture something with Corey Brown or rookie Devin Funchess .
