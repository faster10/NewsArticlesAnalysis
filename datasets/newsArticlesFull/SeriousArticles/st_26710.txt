It was like a ' mela ' on Beer Chand Patel Path having various political parties ' offices . A large number of people crowded around a large TV screen showing the exit polls . With eyes glued to the TV screen , people didn ' t bother if some one was honking his bike or car to move ahead . In fact , the screen acted like a speed breaker with vehicles automatically slowing down resulting in traffic jam . Even the passengers on rickshaws kept staring at the screen till the pictures blurred . Some of them rammed into other vehicles leading to small accidents .
