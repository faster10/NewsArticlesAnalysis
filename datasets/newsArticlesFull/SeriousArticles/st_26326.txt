The urgency couldn ' t be clearer but even at this yuletide 11th hour , signs of progress are slim to none .

There is just no rational reason to think that lift will be any easier in the next Congress than in the current lame duck Congress , where our elected officials are supposedly more free to do the right thing , freed from electoral consequences .
