" You don ' t change , " he said . " I think once you start changing and you get too analytical about everything , I think that ' s when things start falling apart . Sometimes when you have pitchers like they have , when they ' re so quality with their fastballs and so good with their secondary pitches , sometimes I think if you get them looking at too many scouting reports ? hey pitch to his weakness ? that ' s not your strength . If you go away from your strength , that ' s what gets anybody ? it gets us in trouble . You see it through the course of the year . "
