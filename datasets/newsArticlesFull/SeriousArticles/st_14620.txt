As part of its economic reforms agenda , the world ' s second largest economy is set to impose greater cuts of steel and coal production to the tune of 150 million tonnes . The move is seen as part of its supply side reforms , which should lower the current glut in the market and bring relief to global commodities prices .

The steel industry will continue to suffer from further import cuts in China .
