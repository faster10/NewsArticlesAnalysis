TRUMP : But , you know what ? I wasn ' t the President of the United States . And I wasn ' t dealing in the Oval Office , all right ? A big difference . I wasn ' t the president . And my first wife thinks I ' m great . And my second wife and my and I have a great marriage . I mean , I have a great marriage . So I mean , it ' s fine . I ' m not saying don ' t bring anything up with me . But when she says that , I had to bring it up . And by the way , they ' ve become very unresponsive since then .
