The kids in junior high , though , weren ' t as kind as the ones in elementary school . He was bullied on the bus , called a freak . With all due respect , your " zero tolerance anti bullying policy " is crap . A kid got off the bus at Aden ' s stop , and then attempted to strangle him . He got two days suspension , after which he commenced taunting my son as if nothing had happened . Ironically , that was the same punishment Aden got earlier in the year for admiring that shark tooth necklace a little too closely .
