People are hailing Star Wars : The Force Awakens as a huge leap forward in onscreen diversity . The new protagonists include Rey , a heroine so capable that she does all the saving Finn , a black leading man wielding blasters and lightsabers and Poe Dameron , described as the Resistance s best pilot . Dameron s ethnicity isn t stated in the film , but actor Oscar Isaac is a Guatemalan American . Beyond the new leads , you see women and people of color throughout The Force Awakens : flying X wings , commanding Stormtroopers , examining schematics , and doling out mystical advice . But one group still absent from this galaxy far , far away is the LGBT crowd .
