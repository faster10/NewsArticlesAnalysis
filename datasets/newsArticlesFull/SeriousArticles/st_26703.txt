I was in New York , writing " Remedy " with Ryan Tedder . We were having lunch , and " I Knew You Were Trouble " came on the radio ? Taylor ' s song that she did with Max and Shellback . I was like , " Who did this ? " I knew it was Taylor , and I ' ve always loved her , but this is a totally other side ? like , " I want to know who like brought that out in her . " And he said Max Martin . I was unaware that I knew who Max Martin was . I Googled him , and I was like , " He ' s literally written every massive soundtrack of my life . "
