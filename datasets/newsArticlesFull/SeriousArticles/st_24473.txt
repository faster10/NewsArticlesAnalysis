DS : It is just twisting language , just like bombing Libya was not going to be war or hostilities and therefore not fall under US laws banning presidential wars because no US troops would be on the ground even though US troops were on the ground . Here they choose to call it non combat even though it is soldiers with arms , trained for nothing other than combat , taking part in combat and then saying : Well , he didn t mean to , he was supposed to stay back . It is combat . But this is part of a war that has been ongoing since 2003 that in recent months has involved primarily combat from the air . The Iraqi deaths don t make the news the way a single American death does . And it has been counterproductive from day one and has been generating more enemies than it is killing . A fact that Russia should have pay more attention to be for jumping into this itself .
