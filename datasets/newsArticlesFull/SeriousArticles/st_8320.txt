I had seen Bob back at Gerde ' s Folk City in New York years earlier . Everyone was talking about him . I saw him play and thought , " ( Expletive ) , I can sing better than that . Why are they making all that fuss about him ? " Then I started really listening . And I almost quit , right there . Truthfully , I think the Byrds were Bob ' s best translators . Bob did not envision this song the way we did it . When he came to the studio where we were rehearsing and heard us do " Mr Tambourine Man , " he was stoked . I think hearing our version was part of what made Dylan shift over to being a rocker . He thought , " Wait a minute , that ' s my song , " and he heard how it could be different .
