In the dystopian future , the human race has been forced to abandon a toxic earth overrun by snappy jawed monsters that look like they came out of a Starship Troopers sequel . Will Smith plays Cypher , a military Ranger famous for his total absence of fear ( that ' s why he ' s invincible to the monsters , who stalk their prey by smelling fear ) , and Jaden plays his upstart Ranger cadet son , Kitai , who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission . When an asteroid storm forces the ship to crash land on earth , Cypher is badly injured , and it ' s up to Kitai to travel a hundred kilometers on foot , all to retrieve a homing beacon . But his father , who can see what Kitai sees through a digital transmission , talks to him as if he were a videogame avatar , guiding the kid through his trek to manhood .
