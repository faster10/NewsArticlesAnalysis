For some reason I was more relaxed heading into my All Blacks debut than my first Crusaders game . Maybe it was the Mehrts situation , or because we were coming off a loss . But I didn ' t feel the same burden of expectation , and instead relished all the theatre . The fireworks , the anthems and the haka . I snuck to the back , as I wasn ' t very confident . Even though I ' d been doing it in the mirror since I was 5 years old , there ' s nothing like doing a haka in front of a sold out stadium to test your technique . Nevertheless , it was an unparalleled thrill every All Black loves the haka , and knows what it means to the team .
