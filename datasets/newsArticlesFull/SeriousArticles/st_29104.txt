Pellegrini , 62 , is charming and has been a breath of fresh air in the PL over the last two and a half years . The Chilean boss arrived from Malaga with plenty to prove but delivered a PL title and a League Cup in his debut season in England , finished second last season and City has a real chance of completing a quadruple this campaign . All three seasons they have made it into the UEFA Champions League knockout stages ? something they d never achieved before ? and when we look back at his time in charge , his class , grace and ability to manufacture a team who play silky , attractive soccer will be at the forefront of our minds . He won t find it hard to get a top job this summer .
