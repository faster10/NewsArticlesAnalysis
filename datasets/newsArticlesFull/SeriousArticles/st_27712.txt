My own triple feature for tonight ? I think I ' ll go with " High Noon , " the 1952 Western starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly , about the power of quiet courage when it seems there ' s no one in the world willing to help " Hoosiers , " the 1986 movie starring Gene Hackman , about a basketball team in small town Indiana that triumphs over every obstacle and " That Thing You Do ! " , the deliriously joyful 1996 movie written and directed by Tom Hanks , about a one hit wonder rock band from Erie , Pennsylvania , that briefly , in 1964 , makes it to the top of the charts .
