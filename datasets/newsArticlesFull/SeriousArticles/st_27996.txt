The Islamic State ( ISIS ) has always massacred civilians in large numbers to show its strength and instil fear in its opponents . In the west , people notice these atrocities only when they take place on their own streets , though ISIS suicide bombers killed 43 people in Beirut on 12 November and 26 more in Baghdad on November 13 . These attacks are almost impossible to stop because they are directed against civilians , who cannot all be defended , and the bombers are willing to die in order to destroy their targets .
