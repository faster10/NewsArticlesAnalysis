I ' m not a big fan of declaring who " won " and " lost " debates , and I actually thought both candidates furthered their cause with a particular emphasis towards appealing to South Carolina and minority voters . That was one bar for the debate , and both candidates cleared it pretty easily . Oh , I should insert the obligatory mention that Martin O ' Malley was also on the stage , even though he has no chance whatsoever of winning . Below are my debate reactions , complete with advice to both viable candidates on how to improve their performance for the next time around .
