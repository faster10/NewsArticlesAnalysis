To Red from Chicago : Yes , people are complaining because there is no Social Security increase for 2016 . Why ? Not only is it the price of groceries , but Medicare Part D has gone up at least 10 to 20 per month and the supplemental insurance has gone up 10 to 20 . The bottom line is when you ' re only making between 17 , 000 and 20 , 000 a year , it ' s not easy to afford much and every increase adds up . Some people have ways to make more money , but others do not . So have a little sympathy for the senior citizens , Red . You ' ll be there if you ' re not there yet .
