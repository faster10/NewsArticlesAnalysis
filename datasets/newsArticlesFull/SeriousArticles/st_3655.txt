MR : I think it ' s not necessarily Rwanda alone because I also lived in a couple of African countries , but I feel like general use of color , variation and also the presentation . Also the fact that its made in Rwanda and I ' m using bits and pieces that are sourced locally . One of the things that I started doing , the sliders and the hooks for the soft tie bow ties , are made out of cow horn for my newest collect . Cows are a big part of our culture here in terms of dowry and sustenance and history .
