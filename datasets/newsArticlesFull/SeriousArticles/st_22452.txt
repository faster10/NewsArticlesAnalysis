This established a pattern , of sorts . Clinton would always rely on black voters as a base , cultivating their support and appealing to them throughout his presidency . When it suited the circumstances , however , he would distance himself . He wasn t a fair weather friend , but he wasn t a reliable ally either . But what was true was the extent to which he treated black Americans as equal partners in national life . He addressed black concerns in national addresses like the State of the Union and worked with black leaders on priorities like the Crime Bill . Both Clintons made active efforts to appeal to and respect black voters , which was not the norm for American politics ( although , with George W . Bush s compassionate conservativism , it became the norm , at least for a moment ) .
