With six seconds left and not close to field goal or even Hail Mary range , the Green Bay Packers attempted one of those multiple lateral desperation plays looking for some kind of miracle . Unfortunately for the Lions , the Pack got an intervention of the not so divine variety . In an attempt to keep the ball alive , the Lions were called for a incredibly dubious 15 yard facemasking penalty on Packers QB Aaron Rodgers , who had become a runner after taking a less than advisable lateral . So a game that should have been over wasn t , and the Packers got an extra 15 yards and an untimed down , so attempting a Hail Mary was a realistic option .
