Yet even if clubs have become much more open to the idea , with the Premier League employing a whole department to focus on the academic education of young footballers , it isn ' t always enough to break down barriers . ' I know that here ( in England ) they look after the kids to further their educations , ' said Calderon .

That ' s a terrible mistake because the chances of that are so small . I ' m not saying that you shouldn ' t want to be a footballer , because it ' s a dream come true for me , but you can do the two things at the same time and I don ' t see why not .
