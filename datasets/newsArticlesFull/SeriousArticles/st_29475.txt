None of this is to say that the Obama administration has been a failure . It has many accomplishments , including Obamacare , the stimulus package , Dodd Frank , the Iran nuclear deal , and more . After inheriting the worse economic crisis in eight decades , the economy has recovered , slowly but surely , and the deficit has been cut by two thirds . But these have been the accomplishments of a centrist , not a progressive . ( Obama arguably falls into the center left of the political spectrum . ) To think of how much more the administration could have done ( or how much less , when considering mass surveillance or the drone program ) ? leaves a lot to the imagination .
