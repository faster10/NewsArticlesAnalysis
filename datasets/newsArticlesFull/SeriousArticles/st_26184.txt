Around the table there will be six a side , as one insider put it . Cameron and Tusk , plus five close advisers each . Neither team will be under any illusions about what is at stake or how difficult the talks will be . One senior government minister close to the negotiations on the UK s demands said last week that , for all Cameron s months of shuttle diplomacy between European capitals , no one yet knew precisely what would be on offer from Tusk on the most important issue of all ? the prime minister s demand for a four year ban on EU migrants claiming in work benefits . Next week Tusk will send out a legal text to all 28 EU leaders , and then some clarity might emerge . But we really genuinely don t know what will be offered or how it will all work . He admitted that , with many opinion polls showing the ins only narrowly ahead of the outs , it was also difficult to predict with any certainty at all whether the UK would be a member of the EU in six months time or not . These are tense times at the top of government .
