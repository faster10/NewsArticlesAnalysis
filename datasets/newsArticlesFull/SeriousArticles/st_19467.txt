Cam Newton was not the only reason that the Carolina Panthers blew out the Arizona Cardinals . After putting together an MVP season of his own this year , Carson Palmer was brutalized in this game . Through the regular season , the Carolina Panthers considered themselves thieves , and for good reason .

Against Seattle last week , Carolina was 1 with two interceptions . This week , it wasn t even close .
