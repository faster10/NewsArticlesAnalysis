So I ' m going to test this theory in real life . And I ' m going to call it the Rawls Test , named for the philosopher whose work inspired this journey . This week , I ' ll be going to an undisclosed location , which happens to be the most unequal place in America . I ' m going to meet people from all five income brackets , spend time with them , trying to get a real understanding of the economic challenges they face . Step away from the statistics . And then I ' ll decide : Is this the America I want to live in ? Do you ? Does everyone in this country have a more or less equal chance of success if they work hard and want to get ahead , as politicians from both parties argue they should ? Consider this a referendum not on this undisclosed place but on inequality in America writ large .
