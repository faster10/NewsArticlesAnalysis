The civilized world continued with the implementation of their aggressive foreign policy to meet their vested interests under the cover of saving humanity from evil . Their next target was Syria . With the help of Sunni Arab States they created free Syrian army ( FSA ) to overthrow Bashar s Shia regime that was supported by Iran and Russia . This turned into a worst Sunni Shia civil war . In this web of uncertainties the coalition had no control over their arms ammunition going to ISIS that was actually sanctioned for FSA . In fact , many renowned strategic analysts believe that CIA is arming and funding ISIS owing to their common objectives . Russian president Putin recently bashed Obama administration for actively sponsoring ISIS . Some ground facts also point towards this direction . For example , a major source of revenue for ISIS is oilfields operating under their control , but coalition forces never bomb them . Neither do they take serious measures to stop oil smuggling to other countries . Some coalition partners are also allegedly involved in taking this oil . Even fools know that cutting enemy s supply line is the first move in war . Anyway , according to a careful estimate , more than 300 , 000 people have been killed in Syria including women and children since 2011 . The number of wounded , homeless and refugees is in millions .
