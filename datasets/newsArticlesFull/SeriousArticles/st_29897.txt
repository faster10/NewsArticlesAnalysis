Saudi Arabia not only has a political and judicial system capable of repulsive acts , it has also a foreign policy that the west should have no part of . Along with Israel it hounded , unsuccessfully , the US , Russia and the EU into not making a deal with Shia Iran over curbing its nuclear programme . Today , it opposes Iran on a wide range of issues , not least its support of President Bashar al Assad of Syria . Now with the beheading of a respected Shia imam , it has made a bid to be the unchallenged tough guy of all Sunni majority countries in what looks like a potential clash of civilisations between the major strands of Islam , in defiant disregard of the admonishment of Prophet Mohammed ( PBUH ) himself not to kill fellow Muslims .
