Because Harry ' s post Voldemort days eventually become pretty dang easy , I got to thinking about his Hogwarts years , which were 4 , 224 pages strong of mountain troll fighting , blood quill dealing , and mysteries galore . While I ' m sure even the non Potterphiles among you are aware of his biggest accomplishments ( defeating Voldemort comes to mind ) there are a lot of moments where Harry was pretty bloody awesome , and it ' s totally been forgotten if you haven ' t recently done a re read .
