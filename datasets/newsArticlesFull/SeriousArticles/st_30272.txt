Rodgers ' targets in the final month of the season : James Jones 40 Randall Cobb 30 Davante Adams 23 Richard Rodgers 17 Starks 8 Jared Abbrederis 6 Kuhn and Lacy 5 Andrew Quarless 3 . . . . Wide receiver lines allowed by Washington over the last month : 8 173 ( Terrance Williams ) , 5 111 2 ( Sammy Watkins ) , 6 107 1 ( Alshon Jeffery ) , 6 104 1 ( Jordan Matthews ) , 5 52 2 ( Cole Beasley ) . . . . The best matchup on Green Bay ' s side goes to Jones against RCB Quinton Dunbar , an undrafted rookie who missed Week 17 with a quadriceps injury . In chronological order , these are Jones ' target totals over the last five weeks : 3 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 . Jones is the top low cost DFS receiver play on the board for Wild Card Weekend . . . . Adams is an easy fade against Redskins top corner Bashaud Breeland , whose physical style may render Adams a non factor throughout this one . . . . Cobb will spend Sunday ' s game in the coverage of 31 year old journeyman Will Blackmon , who played surprisingly well at slot corner this season before getting shredded by Matthews in Week 16 and Beasley in Week 17 . Pro Football Focus has charged Blackmon with nearly 60 yards per game and four touchdowns allowed over the past six weeks . Cobb , of course , flopped consistently in prime matchups this season and hasn ' t hit pay dirt since Week 11 . . . . The Redskins gave up 6 58 1 to Jason Witten in Week 17 , 13 122 to Zach Ertz in Week 16 , and 5 85 1 to Bears TE Zach Miller in Week 14 . Washington ' s zone heavy defense does not pose a worrisome matchup for enemy tight ends , but TE Rodgers ' usage is frustratingly hit or miss with target totals of 8 , 2 , 4 , 3 , 8 in the last five weeks . Rodgers should pay fantasy dividends if he scores a red zone touchdown against the Redskins . He ' ll probably flop if he does not .
