The French government will be looked over carefully by international investors . If France was to adopt short term tax cuts or increases in spending , it will likely be met by investors demanding higher interest rates on government bonds , which would constrain the government in its ability to promote growth . If France pursues a stimulus package , investors will want to see not only how much money is spent but also how the money is spent . For example , investments in infrastructure , technical education and scientific research should produce very different results than traditional policies of tax cuts and added unemployment compensation .
