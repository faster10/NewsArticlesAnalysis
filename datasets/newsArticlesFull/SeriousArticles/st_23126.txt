The President and the E . U . have set the ground rules for Paris that prohibit any legally binding agreements such as Kyoto which the U . S . had refused to ratify . This time the U . S . has imposed a plan for Paris called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ( INDC ) . Under the INDC process every nation is free to make up whatever GHG emissions reduction numbers it chooses , to present them without an implementation plan , and to leave Paris without any obligation to carry out its " intended " reductions . This is planetary destruction on the honor system what I call Pretended Nationally Deceptive Retributions .
