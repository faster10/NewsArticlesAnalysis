The biggest grunge rock festival during the ' 90s disappeared for awhile around the turn of the century , but it was revived in 2005 as a more traditional " big weekend " destination festival in Chicago .

The anticipated crowd of nearly 200 , 000 is staggering , as are this year ' s headliners : Kings of Leon , Tool , Depeche Mode , and Beastie Boys , just to name a few .
