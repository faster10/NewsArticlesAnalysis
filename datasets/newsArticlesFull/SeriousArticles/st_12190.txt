There is always champagne at these things , but this art opening is an actual party . Purple light bounces off the white walls in the massive foyer of London ' s Royal Academy punk music falls down the stairs and Kenneth Anger ' s homo erotic biker short Scorpio Rising is playing on a TV screen . Jarvis Cocker is here , and so are Bob Geldof and Rupert Everett . There are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux , as well as twenty somethings in backpacks huddled in groups , downing their drinks before walking into Pace London ' s booze free exhibition space for the opening of A Strong , Sweet Smell of Incense : A Portrait of Robert Fraser .
