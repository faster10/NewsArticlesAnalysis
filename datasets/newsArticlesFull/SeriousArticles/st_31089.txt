On the court : I hope the justices are influenced by right and wrong not by what they fear will be the reaction of the public . I hear ya on the kick back point . A pro same sex marriage opinion would make lots of people angry . And there are plenty of corners of the country where being gay is still not OK ( I went to one recently for this op ed on the " county where no one ' s gay " ) . But I hope the justices realize legalizing same sex marriage would strengthen families and support inclusion equality . Both of those sentiments would trickle down through America . And , after the initial freakout , we ' d all be better people for it .
