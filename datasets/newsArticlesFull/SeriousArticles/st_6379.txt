Donald Trump had the last laugh when he walked out on the stage to deliver his concession speech , Mr Hurt claimed . For weeks and months we have been told that Mr Trump cannot handle losing . His entire campaign is built around winning every time . And if he loses Iowa , we were told again and again and again , Mr Trump would fall apart . The first chink in his armor would utterly crumple him to the ground . Only , instead , Mr Trump came out with his family and delivered a wonderfully gracious and funny and hopeful concession speech and told his supporters how honored he was to come in second place in Iowa .
