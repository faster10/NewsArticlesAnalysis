Opportunities don t guarantee success , of course . The real test for the GOP young leaders will come when adversity strikes , when they are hit from all sides and when not all expectations can be met .

So , yes , the Republicans ? can hope that Rubio is the party s Obama , but a conservative one who will govern effectively in tandem with Ryan . Perhaps the GOP will come to terms with a basic political truth : You can t govern if you don t win first .
