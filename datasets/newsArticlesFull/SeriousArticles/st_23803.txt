I think he was attached to English traditions , musical traditions And although the vocabulary of many of these songs is American English , he sings with an English accent . He made it acceptable for artists to sing in an English accent ? he followed up on what Syd Barrett in Pink Floyd did and pushed singing in an English accent even further . Bowie kind of aspirated a kind of Englishness in his voice in a strange way . And then you have American artists start singing with fake English accents !
