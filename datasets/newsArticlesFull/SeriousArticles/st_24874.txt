I hate to kick JJ Watt when he is down and I don t want to take away from his outstanding efforts , but this guy faces TE s for half his snaps and RT s the rest unless he s Stunting . He met a RT with LT quality in Fisher and it showed . Seriously , I am not saying he isn t a great player , but his circumstances give way to his Stats . He gets compared to Poe , Suh and other DL s that take on 2 3 blockers all the time and it is not fair . Congrats to the Chiefs . They made this look easy . Hoyer should have been given a KC Jersey though .
