A generally measured and quiet Rajnath Singh has become this upset for the second time in the last 16 months and threatened to quit if the charges against him were proved right . In August 2014 he was angry against a group of anonymous persons for spreading rumours that his son Pankaj was fixing deals . He had reacted , saying : " In the last 15 20 days , there have been continuous rumours in the air about me and my family . I thought rumours have no basis and these will end in some days . But I am seeing that these are gaining momentum by the day . I want to assure the nation that the day allegations , even prima facie or even small , are proven against me or my family , I will quit politics and public life and sit at home . "
