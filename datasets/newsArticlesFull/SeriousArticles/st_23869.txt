The climate issue can be seen as a form of governmental chauvinism . The whole concept of ' The Climate ' has become a windmill at which we are tilting there is no ' ideal condition ' for the climate , it is not a given default ideal , it is a set of natural processes driven by the sun climate change has been with us forever preceding the industrial revolution we had two significant changes : The Renaissance warming trend , and the ' Maunder Minimum ' which ended in about 1850 since this time we have been on another warming trend which halted about 18 years ago and we are now entering another period of cooling while the sun goes into a temporary pause in output ( another natural cycle ) . The climate issue has been created to legitimize the continued roll out of increased central control , restriction of freedoms it is interesting just how closely linked the question of climate is to always increasing control and higher taxes the scientific underpinnings of this debate are governed by the funding hegemony of the main players this needs to be brought out into the open and the political nature of the climate debate exposed .
