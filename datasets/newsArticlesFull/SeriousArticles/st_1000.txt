Carson can get away with his constant reinventions about his alleged bad behaving , bad acting , tough guy , troublemaker past in part because he ' s just doing what politicians do , and that ' s puffing up the narrative about themselves . If it takes a little creative fiction to do it , then where ' s the real harm ? This adds more gloss to the narrative that got him national attention , made him the darling of GOP conservatives , and the object of endless awe and fascination by much of the media . That is of a black guy who pulled himself up from the alleged squalor and mean streets of inner city Detroit , and made himself into an exemplary figure of achievement . He supposedly did all of this through grit , spunk , and personal initiative , and not affirmative action or government hand outs .
