When I was a kid , my brothers and I had an Atari 2600 . I still have the original one , as a matter of fact , complete with the " Why would you put this on a children ' s toy ? " metal knobs on top that could poke out an eye . One of my favorite games was called " Keystone Kapers . " In it , Officer Keystone Kelly , a police officer in a blue uniform , chases Harry Hooligan , a criminal in a vintage prisoner outfit , around a four story department store where Hooligan is on the loose , no doubt after a recent prison break where he was rightfully doing time for crimes he ' d actually committed . It was all very simple and straightforward , really . And not at all like real life .
