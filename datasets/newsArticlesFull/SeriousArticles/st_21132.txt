President Obama , who has mainly limited his comments about New Orleans to feel good boilerplate , did pledge to make good on President Bush ' s promise on that eerie , floodlit night in a deserted Jackson Square in 2005 , to rebuild New Orleans better and stronger .

Like President Bush , President Obama so far seems to be acting as if just saying it makes it so .
