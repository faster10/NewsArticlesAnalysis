It might be little comfort at the moment , but St . Louis fans mourning the loss of their team ( back to its previous home ) should take some solace in the fact that they won ' t be held hostage for the 477 million the city was willing to throw at Kroenke to stay in a place he apparently didn ' t really like anyway . In the relocation application , the Rams took shots at the St . Louis market as one that " will continue to lag " and send any NFL team that stays to " financial ruin . " It also contended that the city is " unable to sustain three professional sports teams " an idea which , in order to buy into , one would have to also believe that there ' s a single city in America in which pro hockey is more viable than pro football . And nowhere in the screed against St . Louis does the team acknowledge that Rams fans have been as loyal as one can expect to a squad that hasn ' t had a winning record in more than a decade . As ESPN ' s Trey Wingo notes , since 2011 , the Rams have fewer regular season wins ( 29 ) than the city ' s baseball team , the Cardinals , have playoff wins ( 32 ) .
