It ' s great that corporate leaders no longer assume a high powered female employee will lose her brain , drive and work commitment when she gets pregnant . And I admire Mayer for feeling free to set a high priority upon her work commitments without succumbing to the guilt that weighs down so many working moms . But it might be better for the rest of us working parents , who don ' t have the same resources and support systems , if she would take a longer leave and maintain a dignified silence about just how many work hours she puts in during it .
