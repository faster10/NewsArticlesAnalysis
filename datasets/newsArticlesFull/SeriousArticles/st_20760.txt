PLETKA : Well , I don ' t know how reliable the reporting was , but when North Korea conducted that nuclear test , there were reports that a senior Iranian official was present at the test . That wouldn ' t be the first time . And it would mean for the Iranians that they are further ahead on their program , which we tend to look at in this sort of isolated soda straw way by looking just down at Iran . If they ' re working with the North Koreans , then they have in fact been able to be present at a nuclear test . That means they are in better shape than I think many , including the Israelis , strangely , want to admit .
