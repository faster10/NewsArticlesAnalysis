That ' s not to say Pope didn ' t have second thoughts throughout the season . The singer admits she was taken aback when many on the Internet protested that her previous music industry experience put her at an unfair advantage in the competition . " When I came into the show , I got a lot of that and it was discouraging , " she says . " But I had to just prove myself and try to prove people wrong . I thought it was kind of crazy to think that someone like me who ' s been working towards this my whole life , since I was four years old , and then toured in bands and did all that , and really has been working hard doesn ' t deserve it as much as someone else next to me who ' s never done it before . I feel like if you have the heart and the passion for it , you deserve it . "
