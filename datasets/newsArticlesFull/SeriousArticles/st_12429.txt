Greg Olsen leads Carolina with 45 receptions and 664 yards . He s caught five of those passes for touchdowns . A preeminent route runner and a physical presence ? Redskins cornerback Will Blackmon said Olsen is a hybrid of Patriots star Rob Gronkowski and Washington tight end Jordan Reed . Olsen destroyed the Titans in the first quarter last week . The Redskins can t allow his so many free releases , but it s uncertain if their linebackers Perry Riley and Will Compton can hang with Olsen in coverage . They could use a physical corner like Chris Culliver or Bashaud Breeland on him instead and hope they don t get outmuscled by the 6 foot 5 , 253 pounder .
