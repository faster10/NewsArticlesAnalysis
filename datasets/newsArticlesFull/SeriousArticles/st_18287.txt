One aspect of federal law has changed for the better , and a federal judge just smacked down the Justice Department over its refusal to accept the new reality . Medical marijuana providers even in states where it is legal by state law are still being persecuted by federal attorneys . Democrat Sam Farr and Republican Dana Rohrabacher put together a bill in the House to ban this abuse of power , by zeroing out the budget for the Justice Department for any resources used to target medical marijuana operations in states where it is legal . Federal judge Charles Breyer just confirmed that this new law means exactly what it says it means and that the Justice Department should just cease and desist trying to reinterpret it to mean something else . So while medical marijuana is still a Schedule I substance and is illegal , the feds now won ' t be able to do anything about it in states that have changed their own laws . This is not the perfect solution the law itself needs to be changed at the federal level but this is Congress effectively using the " power of the purse " to temporarily halt such persecution . The Justice Department should not appeal this ruling , but rather they should wholeheartedly embrace the new law .
