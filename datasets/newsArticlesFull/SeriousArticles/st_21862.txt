Flacco was quite brave , and as a Ravens fan I admire him but now we are down to Matt Schaub as if things couldn t get worse . We are in line now for a number 1 pick . What I do want to talk about is the fact that Keenum was clearly concussed , I saw it at home on the tv , he could barely stand up , had there not been a penalty he would have had to leave the field , yet that great NFL savior in the sky who was going to intervene and stop things like this , just conveniently disappeared in a tight contested game with a critical QB s playing time in the balance . Someone s head should roll , this concussion was diagnose by my 12 year old sitting beside me , yet a professional neurologist hired by the NFL with closed circuit cameras missed it . Must have been his bathroom break .
