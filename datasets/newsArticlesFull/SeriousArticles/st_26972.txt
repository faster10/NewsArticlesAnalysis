The world soon knew how bad it was . The incident at Virginia Tech on April 16 , 2007 , remains the worst mass shooting in U . S . history in terms of casualties . Thirty two students and school staff were killed that morning by a dangerously mentally ill student with guns , including high capacity magazines . The killer should have been prevented from purchasing firearms , but when he purchased his weapons , his mental health records were not in the FBI database against which background checks are run . He used 30 round magazines , which had been outlawed up until 2004 , when Congress let the Assault Weapons Ban expire .
