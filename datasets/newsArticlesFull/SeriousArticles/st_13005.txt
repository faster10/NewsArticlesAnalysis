In 1999 , I traveled to Montpelier , Vermont , when that state came close to allowing even a limited state sanctioned marriage between two people of the same gender . A state legislator showed me a stack of old legal papers . " This is what ' married ' means in Vermont , " he said , adding they would replace the word with " civil union " to satisfy a state court ruling that the Vermont constitution guaranteed equal treatment for gays . A simple search and replace of wording would allow Vermont to create separate but equal institutions .
