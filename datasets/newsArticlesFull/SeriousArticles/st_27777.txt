Adonis , or Donnie , the character Jordan plays in Creed , is the son of Rocky Balboa s greatest rival , the late Apollo Creed . He is a downtrodden kid who cannot make peace with the father who abandoned him as a child . He finds his identity by following Apollo s footsteps as a fighter , with none other than Sylvester Stallone s Rocky , now a fatigued restaurateur approaching 70 , putting him through his paces . The baton is passed , and those irresistible hits of empathy and adrenalin Stallone first pumped into his audience in the ultimate underdog sports drama are socked over anew by his co star .
