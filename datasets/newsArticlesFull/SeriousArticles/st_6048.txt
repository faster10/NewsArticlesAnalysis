A flight attendant came through the door of his private room with two trays and placed them on the table . I quickly gathered up the documents . " Let ' s eat , " he said . I started to protest , trying to explain that his time was so limited I wanted to take advantage of every minute . He stopped me and said : " This is a humble breakfast , a breakfast from the barracks , what I most love . " I looked at the tray for the first time . On it was a small plate with an arepa , a typical Venezuelan corn patty , a few shreads of white cheese , a couple of pieces of canteloupe and some anchovies . Beside the plate was a small cup of black coffee . No frills and not what you would expect on a presidential airplane .
