The reality is that many of the low risk lesions we call breast cancer would never come to our attention and never harm us if left alone . After more than a decade of screening and finding 50 , 000 to 60 , 000 women a year with pre cancerous or low risk lesions in the breast ( which are frequently treated aggressively as if they are cancer ) , you would expect that the incidence of invasive cancers would drop . But in fact , the frequency of invasive cancer occurrence hasn ' t gone down . This highlights the need to know more about how specific cancers develop and progress so we can distinguish between them and label them properly . Proper labeling would provide us with a more precise method for evaluating individual lesions and allow us to offer our patients the least invasive and most effective treatment options .
