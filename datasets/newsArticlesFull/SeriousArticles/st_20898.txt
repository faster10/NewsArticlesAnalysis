There have been organised attempts to impose the Hindutva agenda across the country with the tacit support of organisations that have no respect for the law , leave aside reason or secular values . The recent actions of the Shiv Sena , despite being in a ruling alliance with the BJP , such as throwing black ink on Observer Research Foundation Chairman Sudheendra Kulkarni s face because he launched a book written by former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri , not allowing Pakistani musician Ghulam Ali to perform in Mumbai , and storming the offices of the Board of Control for Cricket in India during a meeting with officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board , are examples . Apart from attacks on freethinkers and Dalits , minorities are also made to feel like second class citizens . Churches have been attacked and more recently , in an apparently premeditated assault , Mohammad Akhlaq , a blacksmith in Dadri near Delhi , was lynched and his son severely injured on the suspicion that they ate beef . This incident was defended by BJP legislators Sangeet Som and Sakshi Maharaj .
