About an hour up the road , John introduces me to his homemade energy drink . It ' s a concoction of vegetables and Habanero sauce that he bottles and freezes for the trip . Reed is pumped when he sees the cranberry colored juice . Reed takes a drink , and John hands the bottle to me . As a new dad with a son in day care , I immediately think about catching a cold from the shared bottle . Then I remember I ' m on this trip to catch a tornado . If we screw this up , a cold will be the least of my worries . So , I take a swig . It tastes like vegetables . Hot vegetables ! Why didn ' t I bring a bottle of water ?
