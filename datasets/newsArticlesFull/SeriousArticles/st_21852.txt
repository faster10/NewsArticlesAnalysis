" I don ' t think age was an issue in the effectiveness of the intervention , in this study . Homocysteine levels were . Only people with elevated homocysteine in the study showed benefit from the intervention . People with the lowest homocysteine levels in the study saw no benefit . So , B vitamins if it shown to be effective in further studies are unlikely to be beneficial for everyone , particularly if you already have healthy homocysteine levels , " said William Thies , chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzeimer ' s Association .
