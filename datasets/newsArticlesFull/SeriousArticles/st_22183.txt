I ' m not arguing that Kobe Bryant finishing third on the NBA ' s all time scoring list should dampen or change how his career is viewed . The big picture is that his career has been unfathomably great . He ' s the second greatest shooting guard of all time . Jordan being third didn ' t take anything away from his career , even with 2 . 5 seasons missing due to retirement . A legacy goes beyond numbers . Yet for those who hoped Bryant passing Abdul Jabbar would add to the way he is viewed among the top 5 ( or top 10 ) in NBA history , they may have to settle for him coming up short in that regard .
