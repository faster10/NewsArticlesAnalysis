Under the supervision of Chavez ' s cousin , Manuel , UFW members tried at first to persuade Mexicans not to cross the border . One time when that didn ' t work , they physically attacked and beat them up to scare them off , according to reports at the time . The Village Voice said that the UFW was engaged in a " campaign of random terror against anyone hapless enough to fall into its net . " A couple of decades later , in their book " The Fight in the Fields , " journalists Susan Ferris and Ricardo Sandoval recalled the border violence and wrote that the issue of illegal immigration was " particularly vexing " for Chavez .
