Many of the other best picture nominees are great movies . ( I particularly found myself moved by Spotlight , about the Boston Globe s investigation into the cover up of pedophile priests . ) But Mad Max is more than just a really good movie . It s also a wildly innovative movie , one that plays with the very idea of filmmaking itself . The director , George Miller , tore up the book on how to make a movie , taking huge risks in doing so , and ended up making the movie that people could not stop talking about this year .
