Durant wants us to " take ourselves out of it and think about the game " when we write about Kobe , to excise our passions and biases ? something KD admittedly couldn ' t do here ? before we start typing . We don ' t always think about the game the same way , though . In this case , that difference and the distance between the two points led Durant to offer some perspective on his emotional response to cold , rational criticism . That doesn ' t mean his response is bang on , and it might not mean we " get " how players work now . It might mean we get him a little better , though . That ' d be something , at least .
