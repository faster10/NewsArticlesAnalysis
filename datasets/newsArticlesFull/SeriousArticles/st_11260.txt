" I was living in NYC , " she recalls . " I was miserable and overwhelmed with life . I was heartbroken and realizing that what had always worked for me in the past was NOT working at all . . . So , I did what every good user does and I prayed to a god I had never believed in . . . and then called my mom . Days later I was off to treatment , just like that . For the next four years I went to meetings , worked the steps , got a sponsor , found a god of my own understanding , prayed , meditated and basically grew up . "
