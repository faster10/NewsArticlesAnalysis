But Wogan s intention was to provide this personalised service . He wanted to feel like a faraway friend . While they lived and breathed , there were few times that David Bowie and Terry Wogan would be found in the same sentence , but now they ve both gone , I feel a peculiar sense of loss for their era of celebrity . Here were men from a time when life felt greyer and stuffier , who chucked out a joyous lifeline from beyond . They brought a subversive frisson to a drab Seventies landscape . We live , today , in an over stimulated , click addicted age , littered with grasping , self cheerleading famous folk and their sponsored content . Bowie and Wogan were part of a now bygone age of slowness , self deprecation and sincerity .
