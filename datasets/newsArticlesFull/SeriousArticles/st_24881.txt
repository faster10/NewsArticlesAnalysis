My dad was a product of the segregated South . Orphaned at the age of 12 , he pulled himself up by his bootstraps . After leaving Georgia for Washington , where he lived with a relative , he attended an integrated school , Dunbar High . Eventually , he earned his way into Syracuse University , where he was one of the first black men to graduate . In spite of his achievements , he and our family faced discrimination . Nevertheless , he kept his sense of humor , and worked hard to be a good provider .
