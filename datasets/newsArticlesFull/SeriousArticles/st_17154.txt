Cranston , meanwhile , feels that Gilligan and his writers crafted both a " very satisfying " and " unapologetic " finish to this unforgiving story . " It ' s fitting . It ' s complete , " he tells EW , explaining that the ending gave both characters an appropriate reunion and send off . " When I see Jesse , this involuntary sense comes over me , " he says of Walt . " He ' s been treated like a dog like a beaten dog and it just shocks me , and impulsively I protect him . He ' s going off into the sunset . It ' s fitting that the man who was so put upon and mistreated has a chance . And I like how it ends , because it ' s not like , ' Oh , he ' s got the money . ' No . He ' s just got his life , so he has a chance just a chance . " He believes the finale cemented the notion that Breaking Bad is " a tragedy of almost Shakespearean level . . . . Tragedy is not a bunch of bad guys doing bad things : ' Oh , they killed the good guys ! ' Tragedy is when the bad guys are sympathized , when you realize that it could have gone another way , " he notes . " There was hope for them at one time . Macbeth ! Oh ! In its truest sense , our story is a tragedy an American tragedy . It ' s not ' good conquers evil , ' it ' s not ' good guys against the bad guys , ' it ' s much muddier than that . Shades of gray .
