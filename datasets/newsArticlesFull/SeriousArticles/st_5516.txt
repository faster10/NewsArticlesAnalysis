I wrote a letter to Alan Rickman in the early 90s asking for an autograph , with a rather cheeky supplementary section asking his advice about a drastic career change I was thinking about . I d just finished university and was contemplating a career in economics and politics , or going off abroad to teach English . Little did I realize that within a couple of days I d receive the autograph in the form of a three page letter , where Alan gave advice about my possible career change based on his own experience . So I eventually plumped for the English teaching and have never had any cause to regret it . I ve lived in some lovely countries and met some wonderful people . It was such a remarkably generous and thoughtful act from a busy , talented person . He will be much missed .
