But , by the same token , for a lot of these people growing up , the experience of Europe , and World War II , and fascism , was a living memory . I think there was this kind of understanding that civilization can often be precarious . I think people knew that , and people saw that , and as ugly as some of these folks could be , whether it was Ronald Reagan going after welfare queens , or Richard Nixon calling anti war protesters bums , or George W . Bush basically engineering a conspiracy to get us into a war in Iraq , there was a certain kind of disciplining , an internal disciplining . I think that anyone who plays the game of American politics at that level knows this can be a very ugly country , that a lot of anger courses barely beneath the surface .
