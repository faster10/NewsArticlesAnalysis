" The biggest point to me is Stephen Curry , " Rivers said . " Two years ago , Curry asked for the ball . He wanted the ball in his hands more , and it didn ' t work . Steve Kerr comes in and convinces him , ' You need to have the ball less . ' And so when you look at the stats , last year , he had the ball less in his hands than the year before , and he won the MVP . That ' s a great lesson . You don ' t need the ball to be great . You need movement . I thought that lesson , for them , was huge . I ' m trying to get us to see that too . "
