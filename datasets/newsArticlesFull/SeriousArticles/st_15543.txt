Smith will have to keep playing at this level for the Chiefs to win in Houston on Saturday . He has thrown just 30 interceptions since the start of the 2011 season , spanning 75 games now including the playoffs . Smith s record as a starter in that same time frame is 50 23 1 . QBs who don t throw many interceptions while winning over two thirds of their starts are hard to come by in the NFL . Yet because he was the No . 1 overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft , Smith will never live up to expectations until he wins a Super Bowl ( or at least leads his team to one ) .
