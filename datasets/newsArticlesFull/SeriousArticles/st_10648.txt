You are really seeing these huge front lines open up , and a significant amount of bombing comes with it , said Sylvain Groulx , the head of mission for Syria for M decins Sans Fronti res . There is so much displacement . We are very worried . The United Nations said in a statement that at least 120 , 000 people have been uprooted in Aleppo , Hama and Idlib provinces this month . Most of the displaced people have found shelter near their home villages as they try to wait out the fighting , with few Syrian provinces considered safe and the border with neighbouring Turkey closed , for the moment .
