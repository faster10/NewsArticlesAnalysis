The score was tied at three in the bottom of the eighth : Lorenzo Cain stood at first base , Eric Hosmer was at the plate . Facing Toronto s young closer , Roberto Osuna , KC s first baseman lifted a ball to right field : an unassuming single that to Lorenzo Cain , looked like much , much more . The Royals outfielder , sensing an opportunity , went first to third and then streaked all the way home , sliding to beat the ball and a defense that was caught flatfooted . Cain had somehow circled the bases : an astounding , heads up , signature base running play that stunned the Blue Jays and pushed the Royals to within three outs of a pennant .
