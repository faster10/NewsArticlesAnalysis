Mattias Von Bismark comments : I thank you for this comment . It ' s a hard thing to say . It subjects you to this slander that you are , somehow , supporting the murder of that poor woman . It takes true courage and strength of character to stand up and say , " Yes , what this man did was awful , but there was something at the root of this tragedy which was unaddressed . If this man had received help , his life and the life of the poor woman would have been saved . " Those who have never dealt with mental illness need to keep silent on this subject . As we have seen above , they have nothing helpful to add , and denigrate the serious discussion we should all be having .
