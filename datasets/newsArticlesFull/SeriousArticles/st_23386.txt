While Bay has said that he envisions " Age of Extinction " to be the launching pad for a new " Transformers " trilogy to follow the one led by LaBeouf which included " Transformers " ( 2007 ) " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " ( 2009 ) and " Transformers : Dark of the Moon " ( 2011 ) the question critics have asked is whether there needs to be a new trilogy at all .
