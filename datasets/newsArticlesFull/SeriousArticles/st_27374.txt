' If Washington and Jefferson simplified their language when speaking to Native Americans , they must have seen some kind of gap , either in language or in shared cultural understanding ( or both ) , between themselves and their audience .

But when a live microphone or camera is in front of them , presidents are really speaking to everyone at once . So I don ' t imagine you ' d see this degree of variation today , ' says Shesol .
