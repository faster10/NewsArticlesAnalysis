The best team goal of all time . A sublime move began in the left back spot with Brazil ' s striker Tostao and it would pass through eight of the team ' s outfield players before ending up in the Italian net . Clodaldo dribbled mazily in his own half , he gave it to Rivelino , who passed it on to Jairzinho up the left . The winger fed Pele on the edge of the area , who held the ball up before laying it into the space to his right . There , the right back Carlos Alberto was approaching like an express train and he thundered the ball into the far corner .
