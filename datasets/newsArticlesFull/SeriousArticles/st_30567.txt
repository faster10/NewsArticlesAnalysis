JL : I think that s everybody is trying to wonder : you know , they have two questions about this election : first of all , Syria is in such terrible state who would go to the polls , who would turn up at these elections ? Could they possibly be fair in this situation ? And , secondly , would the outcome be any different from the past elections that we ve seen in 45 years , which have almost ended up with 99 vote for the President . And , that s why , I think , the opposition . . . there s such distrust between all sides , that nobody puts much faith in these elections . I think , what most people understand is that underneath the discussion of elections is really the question of can the Assad regime stay or not ? . And , with Russian involvement , it s quite clear the Assad regime is staying and will stay , so long as Russia and Iran are willing to back it up with arms and money and that s really , the West is Well , that s where we are , in the discussion , and how the West is going to somehow accommodate itself to that , is not quite clear .
