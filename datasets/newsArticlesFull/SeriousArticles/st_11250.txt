That probably won t win Rand any popularity contests , but he s already losing the presidential popularity contest , so he may as well go down swinging . And , even if Paul doesn t want to admit it , he does have better things to be doing than running for the White House . He s up for reelection to the Senate this year , and while there s no real danger of the Democrats pulling off an upset , Rand still has to tend to his political situation back home . As the New York Times reported last week , state Republicans are weary of what they rightly see as Paul s hopeless presidential distraction . He already stepped on some toes and churned up some bad blood in his push to convince the Kentucky GOP to change its presidential primary to a caucus ( which allows him to sneak past a state law prohibiting candidates from appearing twice on one ballot ) , and at this point it seems reasonable to wonder if Rand would even win the Kentucky caucus if he were to make it that deep into the nominating contest .
