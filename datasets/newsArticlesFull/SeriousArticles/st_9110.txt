? Bevin will be a bull in the china shop , but he is unlikely to govern as radically as many of the stories you ll read today suggest . ? I ve spent more than 24 hours with the governor elect going back to January 2014 , when I profiled him for Politico . Bevin is certainly an ideologue , but I ve seen him show signs of a profound pragmatic streak . He told me last week that he ll lead in the tradition of a former KFC CEO , a moderate Democrat , who was not beholden to anyone and cleaned up state government in the 70 s . ? His efforts to make nice with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , ? who attacked him fiercely ? last year , show that ? he s capable of becoming a serious politician .
