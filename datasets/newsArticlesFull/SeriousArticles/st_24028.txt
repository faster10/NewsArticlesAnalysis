Discussing Florida ' s " stand your ground " law which allows people to use deadly force in situations in which they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury Corey said , " our laws are very clear that it has to be a forcible felony and that a reasonable person would have to believe that deadly force is necessary as opposed to just physical force , fighting back and that sort of thing . I ' ve prosecuted a woman who shot her husband and killed him because he slapped her , and we argued that was not deadly force and she was convicted and sent to state prison . "
