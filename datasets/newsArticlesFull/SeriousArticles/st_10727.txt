My take is that this is going to be a tide if not a tidal wave . Why ? Because in most races , Democrats will stay home , Republicans will vote and independents will break heavily against the Democrats . Recent polls indicate the younger voters ( millennials ) are likely to break Republican after two massive victories for Obama in that age group . Latinos seem much more favorable to Republicans than many expected and much less likely to turn out for Democrats . Meanwhile , the margin for Democrats among women has shrunk dramatically , and in some races Republicans are now carrying both men and women ( and that really would create a tidal wave ) .
