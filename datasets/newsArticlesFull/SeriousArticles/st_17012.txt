The panic has been exacerbated by the contagion effect to be felt on US markets . The rout is quite different this time . A large part of the revenue of US companies estimated to be something close to 40 comes from China and a major fall in growth rate would have backward links on their prospects . With fears of their earnings being affected the US markets have also quivered and will continue to do so until there is some semblance of equilibrium in China . This has caused the stock markets across the world to tumble with India not being spared despite the fact that ours is still considered to be the fastest growing economy with brighter prospects . Hence in terms of stock markets there has been a contagion effect across all countries .
