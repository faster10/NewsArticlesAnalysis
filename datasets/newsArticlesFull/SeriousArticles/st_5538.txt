Representative Devin Nunes , the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , told us he was less concerned about the potential for an assassination than he was about the broader issue of stability in Egypt . " It ' s stating the obvious that all those leaders in the region are under constant death threats , but that ' s not what concerns me , " he said . Nunes , who visited with el Sisi and toured the Sinai this year , said he was more worried about the broader economic instability in Egypt and a young population that is increasingly falling under the sway of the Muslim Brotherhood and radical jihadi groups .
