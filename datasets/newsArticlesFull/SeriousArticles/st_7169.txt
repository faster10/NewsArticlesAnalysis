Let me try to put it this way . You know , at the banquet this year , I gave a speech about " thank you . " But there s a second part to " thank you " that no one ever thinks about , that when I was a kid , I was thanking my coach and my teams for whatever , and my dad was picking me up after practice , and he said , " You thanked your coach . That was really nice . But there s an IOU that goes with every ' thank you , ' which is , you owe them your best . " With this team , I thanked them for all their hard work , their togetherness , their competitive spirit , all that they were able to accomplish in winning the SEC championship .
