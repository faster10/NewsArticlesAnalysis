Ryan did not mention Trump by name , and he pledged to support the Republican nominee , whomever that may be . I m going to stand up for what I believe in , Ryan said . I m not concerned about lasting damage to the party I m concerned about standing up for our country s principles . These are first principles and our party is dedicated to first principles and that s why it s incumbent on leaders of our party like myself to stand up and defend what conservatism is and what the Republican Party stands for .
