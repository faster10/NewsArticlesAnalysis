The book , together with an ambitious " Lean In " social movement of monthly meetings dosed with inspirational anecdotes from other women , is all about bringing on the girl power and getting us out of the cubicle and into the corner office . " Lean In " comes ironically on the high heels of Marissa Mayer , the 30 something , newly minted Mama Bear CEO at Yahoo ! who pulled the plug on the flex policies that allowed employees to work from home . Mayer , who has a nursery for her own newborn in her office , is getting hazed for this seemingly retro and anti family move . Is Mayer the ultimate sellout or the quintessential feminist ? Well , depends who you ask .
