Sutherland may have been inspired by the classics , but the 3 D aspect of " Monsters " is as modern as movie technology gets . Under the command of DreamWorks Animation chief Jeffrey Katzenberg ( whom Witherspoon and Sutherland respectfully called " Mr Katzenberg " ) , the film was conceived from the beginning as a 3 D project . One early scene uses the process to bounce a paddleball out at the audience , but for the most part , the effect is used immersively , to bring viewers into the " Monsters " world .
