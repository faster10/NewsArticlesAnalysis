Good old fashioned books , of course , are great gifts too , especially if you can find one that relates to an experience you ' ve shared on vacation or to a place you plan to visit . Ask your local children ' s librarian for suggestions . Maybe you ' ve taken the kids to Cirque de Soleil or the Big Apple Circus , if so check out " The Painted Circus " ( www . kidscanpress . com ) , which features beautiful illustrations that play tricks on the eye great to read together on a plane or at a relative ' s house .
