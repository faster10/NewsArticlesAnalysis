Japan is participating in the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , a market opening deal that involves the United States and several smaller economies in the Asia Pacific region . The farming lobby opposes opening Japan ' s agricultural market and last year when former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda proposed joining the TPP , he was handed a " forget about it ! " petition with eleven million signatures . That ' s a lot of reasons to believe that the TPP ' s " no sacred cows " approach to market opening may prove a deal breaker for Japan . Agriculture may generate only 1 of Japan ' s GDP , but its aging , part time farmers are overrepresented in the Diet and are loyal supporters of the LDP .
