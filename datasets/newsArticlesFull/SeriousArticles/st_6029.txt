Timely effective action in 1929 30 might thus have prevented World War II . Yet the timeliest and most effective action in 1929 30 would still have left the United States much worse off in November 1932 than in November 1928 . Herbert Hoover would still have presided over the worst recession in 20th century history and would still have lost the 1932 election to Franklin Delano Roosevelt . No doubt Roosevelt , that supreme opportunist , would have slammed Hoover for his " bailouts " and " giveaways " to banks and foreigners .
