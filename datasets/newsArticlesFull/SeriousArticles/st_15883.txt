The Browns promoted Sashi Brown from executive VP general counsel to executive VP football operations and incredibly owner Jimmy Haslam gave him control of the 53 man roster . Haslam and his wife in addition to Brown , new chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta , and Jed Hughes , he of the search firm that convinced Woody Johnson to hire John Idzik , will hire a coach and then a general manger . So , the new GM won t control the roster and has no say in the coach . That actually sounds like the perfect job for Idzik Haslam is trying to get way ahead of the curve in analytics by hiring DePodesta from the Mets . But here s the thing : If you don t have the right coach and he doesn t have the right players , you can t win . Matt Harvey , Jacob deGrom , Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz can all probably throw the football better than Johnny Manziel . . . Todd Bowles did a very good job , but he is the Jets first rookie coach not to make the playoffs since Al Groh in 2000 . Then again , Bill Parcells didn t make the playoffs in his first year with the Jets in 1997 . Herm Edwards ( 2001 ) and Eric Mangini ( 2006 ) were the same 10 6 as Bowles and Rex Ryan ( 2009 ) was 9 7 and they all made the playoffs . The Jets are the first AFC team with a record as good as 10 6 not to make the playoffs since the Patriots lost tiebreakers at 11 5 in 2008 in the season Brady tore his ACL in the first quarter of the first game .
