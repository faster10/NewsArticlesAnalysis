The thing about Coldplay , though , is that they are very aware that they will never be cool Chris Martin has called his band the shit Radiohead . The challenge for them is that they re not quite silly enough to embrace ironically ? like , say , your average boy band ? nor do they cultivate an image of being above the fray , of being consummate artists who don t care what you think . They occupy a space somewhere in between , and that means the hip kids and the critics will never offer them unqualified admiration .
