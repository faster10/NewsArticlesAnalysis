On Tuesday , February 18 , about 16 demonstrators and 10 police officers were killed . We were shocked and mourned their deaths , while hoping and expecting the violence to ebb .

And , thanks to the Internet , we saw them being mowed down . The violence had come home . The criminal regime had insinuated itself into our lives .
