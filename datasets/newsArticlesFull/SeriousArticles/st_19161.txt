A few days later Hootie Johnson , then chairman of Augusta National , stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors , broadcasting the tournament without commercials . The boys had clearly made a deal that went like this : We ' ll " release " you as sponsors , you ' ll keep your mouths shut , and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back . Two of the three did not return ( IBM was the exception ) , but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male only policy at Augusta National .
