This has been understandable given the talent that has departed . They lost Stanley Johnson and Rondae Hollis Jefferson to the NBA Draft and graduated T . J . McConnell , an elite two way point guard . Arizona has also been consistently bitten by the injury bug since before the season started , losing four star recruit Ray Smith in October to a right knee injury . Senior center Kaleb Tarczewski went out for eight non conference games with an ankle injury and freshman guard Allonzo Trier broke his shooing hand at USC on Jan . 9 . The Wildcats are 3 2 without Trier , who is expected to miss one to three more weeks .
