Rabid discussion over the true identity of Christoph Waltz s shadowy bad guy started almost immediately after the character was announced with most convinced he was playing legendary Bond villain Blofeld . Mirroring the story of Benedict Cumberbatch not playing Khan ( but totally playing Khan ) in Star Trek Into Darkness , the big reveal in Spectre was that yes , despite reports to the contrary , Waltz was playing Blofeld . But we didn t get to see a lot of him in the film which , given how his character was left during the finale , seemed like a very deliberate tactic . It was essentially an origins tale for the character , but was it enough to make audiences want more ?
