Maybe these letters make me tired because I went to a college where couches were routinely set aflame after victories and losses , and occasionally because it was Tuesday so his form of celebrating is refreshingly benevolent . Perhaps they make me tired because in a country filled with mass shootings , poisoned water systems and an almost non stop rhetoric of hate and prejudice , there are many things that I would like to climb atop a soapbox about , but joyful dancing , exuberant fatherhood and celebrating winning a game just don t make the cut .
