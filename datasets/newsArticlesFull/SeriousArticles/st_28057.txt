Ukraine on Monday halted the movement of goods to Crimea , ratcheting up tensions with Moscow amid a relative lull in fighting in separatist eastern Ukraine that has claimed more than 8 , 000 lives since April 2014 . Tensions have spiked as Kiev ' s landmark free trade agreement with the European Union is set to come into force on January 1 , 2016 . Russia has vehemently opposed the agreement at the heart of the Ukraine conflict , saying it would damage its economic interests and threatening to respond by banning food imports from Ukraine . Kiev vowed on Monday to respond in kind . Ukraine ' s interior minister even suggested that Kiev cut power supplies to Crimea altogether .
