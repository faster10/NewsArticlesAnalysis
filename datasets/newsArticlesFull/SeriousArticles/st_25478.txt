Will Leitch , Sports on Earth : " Alabama ' s seniors , those who have spent a full four seasons plowing their way through just about every college football team that has crossed their path , won 50 games in their career . ( They lost six . ) They have won these games in just about every fashion you can imagine , from blowouts ( the most common ) , fourth quarter comebacks , 9 7 slugfests , 45 42 shootouts , home games , road games , bowl games , rivalry games . You name it , they ' ve done it . The one constant , the entire time , even in the losses , was that Alabama always looked like the best team on the field . It ' s not for nothing that , until the game at Georgia this September , the Crimson Tide had been the Vegas odds favorite for 72 consecutive contests , dating back to 2009 . ( They , of course , went out and hammered the Bulldogs , 38 10 , and haven ' t been an underdog since . ) Alabama being better than the team it ' s playing has been a given for nearly a decade now . The theories on how opponents can overcome this inherent disadvantage have been plentiful have a mobile quarterback , run a fast paced offense , be Mississippi but ultimately , it has often come down to pure chance and good fortune . Teams that beat Alabama generally need everything to fall exactly right for them on a particular Saturday . . . Which is why the most amazing thing about Alabama ' s 45 40 College Football Playoff National Championship victory over Clemson on Monday night Tuesday morning was that , for most of the game , Alabama didn ' t look like the better team at all . Clemson was doing everything right , on both sides of the ball . "
