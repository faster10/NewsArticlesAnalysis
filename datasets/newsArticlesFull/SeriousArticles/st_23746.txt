Star Wars : ? The Force Awakens , unsurprisingly , sweeped in the effects categories , but didn ' t nab a Best Picture nomination , and neither did ? Harrison Ford . The love for this movie knows no bounds , and the fans are already freaking out about its snubs . Sure , it got love with its effects , but the die hard fan base wanted some love for Han Solo and the film as a whole . What gives , Academy ? ! If we ' re going to give fan favorites such as ? Sylvester Stallone ? some love , then Ford could ' ve gotten thrown a bone .
