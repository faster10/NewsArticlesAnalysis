The legislation is named in honor of Kate Steinle , a San Francisco woman who , authorities say , was shot and killed in July by a Mexican immigrant with a lengthy felony rap sheet who repeatedly entered the country illegally . Steinle s death prompted a national uproar over so called sanctuary cities , where local officials decline to cooperate with federal immigration authorities , because San Francisco authorities decided not to notify immigration officials when the suspect , Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez , was being released from a local jail .
