As with any diversity issue , be it with African Americans , Hispanics , Asian Americans , women or the LGBTQ community , the only lasting solution to the problem is to hire writers from those groups to create stories that are authentic to their experience . As I ve said many times in the past , the main reason why Empire works is because it has a strong strain of black creativity behind the camera . Find talented Muslim American writers , directors and producers . And if they don t exist ( and I guarantee you that they do exist ) , then encourage and cultivate the next generation of Muslim film makers . The best , most helpful research is living . Until we open the doors of Hollywood to more varied types of people , we ll continue to have to have our presidents give speeches . We ll keep dealing with controversies like OscarsSoWhite . Howard Gordon can write a great thriller , but it remains to be seen if he can write a Muslim without a gun .
