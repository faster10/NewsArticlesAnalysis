Ogletree was another huge loss for St . Louis ' defense after suffering a broken leg in Week 4 , forcing the team to move safety Mark Barron into the third year linebacker ' s starting slot . As with the case with Quinn , the Rams ' run defense regressed following the injury to Ogletree , who led the team in tackles in each of his first two seasons . The 6 foot 2 , 245 pound Ogletree , a first round pick along with Austin in 2013 , appeared on his way to a career year . He had a team leading 42 tackles at the time of his injury , including 16 in Week 2 at Washington .
