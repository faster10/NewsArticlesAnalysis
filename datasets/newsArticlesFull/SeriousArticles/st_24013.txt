To our sister republics south of our border , we offer a special pledge to convert our good words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty . But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers . Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas . And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house .
