Sparkle uses some of the same imitation Motown numbers by Curtis Mayfield that powered the 1976 version , along with new songs by R . Kelly . The music is all highly competent and , frankly , just unmemorable enough to make you wish that you were hearing authentic period chestnuts instead . The trouble with Sparkle isn ' t that it ' s overwrought ( that ' s what ' s sometimes fun about it ) . It ' s that everything in the movie is derivative and third hand : a copy of a copy . The film is pulp that ' s been fed through a strainer , with bits and pieces squeezed out of a dozen other , better movies ( " What ' s Love Got to Do With It " , " Lady Sings the Blues , " and " Dreamgirls , " to name just a few ) . At times , it ' s like a Joan Crawford neurotic mother fantasy , and the gravelly conviction of Whitney Houston ' s performance proves that this could have been the first step not merely in a comeback but in a major re invention . She had the instincts of a superb character actress .
