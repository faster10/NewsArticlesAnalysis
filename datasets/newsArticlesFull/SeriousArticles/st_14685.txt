Speaking of last season , perhaps the biggest misconception about the Warriors was that their roster lacked defensive toughness and grit . After leading the league in defensive efficiency , they disproved that idea , and this side of the floor has been equally impressive this season . Golden State ranks eighth in field goal percentage against and first in 3 point percentage against . As a result , when they get up on teams , they bury them . It ' s why they have the best point differential in basketball , hovering around the unfathomable plus 15 mark , and it ' s why taking the foot off the gas pedal now simply wouldn ' t make sense . ?
