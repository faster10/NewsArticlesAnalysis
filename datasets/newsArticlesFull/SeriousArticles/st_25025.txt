This game was simply great , from tip to buzzer . Epic comebacks and big plays , too many heroes to count , all packed into a gym that can create atmosphere even against the likes of Pittsburg State . Back in 1992 , Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan walked into the media room after Christian Laettner hit the buzzer beater for Duke against Kentucky and declared : " We ' re not worthy . " Same holds true here . Kansas once led by 11 , Oklahoma stretched its advantage to as many as 10 . Regulation ended with a controversial foul call but two missed free throws , and the first overtime was knotted by trading 3 pointers .
