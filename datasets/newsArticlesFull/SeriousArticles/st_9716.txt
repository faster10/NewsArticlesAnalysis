Americans understand the human instinct of families that are facing torture and destruction by their own government to seek safety for themselves and their children . However , exporting Syria s population to foreign lands and forcing them to assimilate into American society is not the best answer for either America or the future of Syria .

We can and must protect Syrians at home , where they will be able to re establish that state once ISIS has been defeated .
