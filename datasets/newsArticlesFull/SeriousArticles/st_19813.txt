Police identified a man from France as the logistical mastermind . Police allege the man stayed at a luxury hotel in Dubai , but also booked a room at the al Bustan Rotana hotel where al Mabhouh was killed . The French suspect requested room 237 directly across from where al Mabhouh was staying in room 230 , police say , but the suspect apparently never stayed there . Instead , police say the rest of the group used the room to plot the killing and the alleged mastermind left the country before it was carried out .
