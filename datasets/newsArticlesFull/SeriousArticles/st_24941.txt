After an epic explosion rocks the Kremlin , the entire IMF gets ' ' disavowed , ' ' and Hunt and his team find themselves cut off , without backup . Suddenly they ' re rogue agents , like an espionage version of the Ocean ' s gang , only with far more important priorities . Their mission is to stop Hendricks ( Michael Nyqvist , dour costar of the Swedish Girl With the " Dragon Tattoo " films ) , a lone terrorist who has stolen the Russian nuclear codes , from launching a missile and kicking off a nuclear war . All because he ' s a nihilist nut who really wants to . Hunt ' s team , aside from Benji ( played by Pegg with impish timing ) , includes the terrific Paula Patton as the dangerously beautiful and ruthless Jane , and Jeremy Renner , all moody reticence , as a desk jockey named Brandt with a backstory that makes it look , for a time , like he ' s Ethan ' s ambiguous adversary .
