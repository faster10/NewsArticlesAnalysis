Iraq ' s borders were created at a conference in Cairo in 1921 , largely thanks to Winston Churchill and T E Lawrence ( aka Lawrence of Arabia ) , who were among about 40 British officials gathered at the Semiramis Palace on the Nile . They effectively invented Iraq , setting up Faisal bin Hussein as the king of a new country . Faisal was a Sunni and a Hashemite who wasn ' t even from Iraq . British policy was to promote the interests of the Sunni and other minorities as a counter balance to the Shia majority and expel troublesome Shia clergy , all tools that Saddam Hussein would find useful a half century later .
