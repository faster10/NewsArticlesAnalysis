The number one rule of conservative mass politics and virality is always punch down . If that s not possible , weigh the value of punching sideways . You don t even have to get into some abstract discussion of the Southern Strategy to know that constantly pwning noobs , enemies and the teeming Other in the Republican field gets you clickthrough . If the National Review is going to be mad at Trump for this , they should at least be honest and admit they re mad because he s so much better at it .
