I realised how much power the site had during a chat in 2008 with Larry Page , Google s co founder , who languidly said that he had followed the news of the Georgia invasion by watching the Wikipedia page about it . Why ? Because it was factual , updated quickly , and did not use that annoying newspaper style of trying to make stuff sensational . Wikipedia , the news source ? Sounds crazy , until you hear about people checking there on hearing that someone famous has died , to see whether it is really true . These days , you are not dead until you are dead on Wikipedia .
