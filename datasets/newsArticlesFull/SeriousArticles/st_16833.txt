And once we ' re scared , we need to " do something " even if that something doesn ' t make sense and is ineffective . We need to do something directly related to the story that ' s making us scared . We implement full body scanners at airports . We pass the Patriot Act . We don ' t let our children go to playgrounds unsupervised . Instead of implementing effective , but more general , security measures to reduce the overall risk , we concentrate on making the fearful story go away . Yes , it ' s security theater , but it makes us feel safer .
