Bays : I don ' t think it ever occurred to us . Honestly , exhibit A for us in the discussions was Cobie Smulders . In the pilot of our show , Ted sees Cobie Smulders ' Robin for the first time and without naming names the part of Robin was offered to a pretty famous actress and she turned it down and then we ended up going with Cobie , who was our first choice from the beginning . Thank God we did for a million reasons but among those is the fact that when Ted ' s seeing her for the first time , America ' s seeing her for the first time the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive .
