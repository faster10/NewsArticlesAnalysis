Although the National Hurricane Center knew a busy season was coming , they were careful to say that a busy season doesn ' t always mean extreme impacts on the United States or other countries . " We can have quiet seasons overall that are devastating to communities , and very busy seasons like this one with hardly any U . S . impacts , " said James Franklin , branch chief of the Hurricane Specialist Unit at the National Hurricane Center . " We want folks to be prepared each and every season regardless of what kind of activity we ' re expecting . "
