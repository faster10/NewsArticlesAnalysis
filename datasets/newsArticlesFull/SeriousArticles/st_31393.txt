Castor gave three reasons why he didn ' t bring criminal charges against Cosby in 2005 : it took Constand nearly a year to come forward the inability to collect forensic evidence and the fact that Constand contacted a civil lawyer in Philadelphia before going to police in Canada to file a report . He said that he found serious flaws in the case in 2005 and declined to bring charges . Schmitt testified that would not have allowed Cosby to give the deposition if he had not been sure it could not be used against his client .
