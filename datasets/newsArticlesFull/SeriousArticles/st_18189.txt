This is not to denigrate the dreadful sacrifices involved in any of the aforementioned wars ? just to say that the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial feels like a careful , considered moment which somehow looks forward hopefully , rather than back in sadness . It is laid out around a central sculpture of King ? created by the Chinese artist Lei Yixin ? seen emerging , semi carved , from a hard block of granite . This is a reference to one line from I Have A Dream : With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope . Further prescient King quotations are chiselled into a curve of stone which frames this statue ? We shall overcome , because the arc of of the moral universe is long . But it bends toward justice . Hate cannot drive out hate . Only love can do that .
