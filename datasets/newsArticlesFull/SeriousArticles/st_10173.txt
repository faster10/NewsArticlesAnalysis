Asked if technology is required , Mart nez said : My question is do we need it to get that call right ? If yes , we acknowledge it . Errors will be made but when you talk of calls being offside or the ball out of play my question is do we expect the calls right ? If the answer is yes we are wasting our time not bringing technology in . You don t go to Wembley because of that . It is not professional enough . I would expect a Premier League linesman to get that call right . If they can t spot that ? I would expect them to make sure that call is right .
