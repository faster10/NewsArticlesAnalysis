It started out just by accident , he said . Two years ago I didn t know what a Muslim was . I would see one and I would smile and say hi . It was like I was a ghost , they couldn t see me . It turned into a little project . Every time I got done with work I d go down to the strip mall , seek out Muslims , say hi and smile . I did this to over a hundred Muslims , nobody would even smile . He returned , then , to Trump . When he says that this ? Muslim immigration to the US ? could be a Trojan horse , he s holding back . He knows damn well it s a Trojan horse . They ve got these seed cells all over America , and they are not coming here to abide by us .
