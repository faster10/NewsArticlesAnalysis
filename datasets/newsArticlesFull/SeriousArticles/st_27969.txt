The Second Amendment states " A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . " But , what exactly are " arms " ? Only the weapons around when the amendment was adopted , so that Congress can ' t ban muskets but can ban anything else ? If the meaning " arms " changes over time , then where do we draw the line bazookas , tanks , or nuclear weapons ? Clearly , there is no constitutional right to own any of those . The language of the Second Amendment requires judicial interpretation to flesh out its limits .
