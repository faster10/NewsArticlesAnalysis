Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday that her National League for Democracy ( NLD ) party won about 75 percent of the seats in Myanmar ' s 664 seat parliament , but the official results from Sunday ' s election are trickling in slowly . As of early Tuesday , the government of the military backed Union Solidarity Development Party ( USDP ) has announced the results for only 88 seats , with the NLD winning 78 of those and the USDP just five . The slow pace has NLD officials nervous . The election commission is " delaying intentionally because maybe they want to play a trick or something , " said NLD spokesman Win Tien . " It doesn ' t make sense that they are releasing the results piece by piece . . . They are trying to be crooked . " Suu Kyi herself was more upbeat , telling the BBC that unlike after her party ' s landslide victory in 1990 , this time the military would respect the results . " I find that the people are far more politicized now than they were , " she said , " so it ' s much more difficult for those who wish to engage in irregularities to get away with it . "
