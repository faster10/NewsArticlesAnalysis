It ' s funny nearly 50 years later , only 47 percent of the American electorate says it could ever vote for a " socialist " ( does that include a " democratic socialist " ? . . . we may soon find out ) . This weekend , as evidence mounted that Sen . Bernie Sanders is posing a very serious challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination , a few folks on the right began sharpening their knives . Rupert Murdoch ' s house organ , the New York Post , ran a " hit piece " on Sanders career most of it stuff that ' s been in the public record for decades and covered thoroughly in my e book " The Bern Identity " . ( The most hilarious part is an accusation that Sanders named the minor league baseball team that he ' d wooed to Burlington " The Vermont Reds " in honor of his " Commie " political leanings . . . and not because it was a Cincinnati Reds farm team . )
