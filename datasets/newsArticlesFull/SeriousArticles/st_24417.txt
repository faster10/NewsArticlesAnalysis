Weir says there were times when the band members were worried about Jerry Garcia ' s drug use and considered holding an intervention for their frontman . Ultimately they decided to do what they could for him without that confrontation . Weir talks in the film about how he had to be Jerry Garcia ' s " bag man " for a time , holding Garcia ' s drugs . According to Weir , Garcia was doing heroin , marijuana and cocaine , and he would trust Weir to hold it because not only was the ( relatively ) health conscious Weir not going to use it , he would also limit how much Garcia could have at once .
