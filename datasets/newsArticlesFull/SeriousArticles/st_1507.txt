Look for the loos . Most folks don ' t get particularly psyched about toilets . But when they ' re the space age , self cleaning , pod like gray structures dotting the Parisian streetscape , you just might . You ' ll find 400 of these disabled accessible bathrooms scattered all around Paris ( they ' re open between 6 a . m . and 10 p . m . ) near major tourist spots , food markets and taxi stands . Each time a visitor uses these " sanisettes , " the toilet bowl and floor are automatically cleaned , dried and disinfected and they contain coat hooks , a mirror and sink . And with natural roof lighting , reduced water use and renewable source electricity , they ' re eco friendly to boot . Mother Nature must be thrilled .
