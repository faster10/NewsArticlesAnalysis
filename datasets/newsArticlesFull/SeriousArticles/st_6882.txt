With three weeks to go until voters will finally begin to have their say in the presidential nominating contest , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders look set for a photo finish in both Iowa and New Hampshire . Clinton holds a tiny three point lead ? 48 percent to 45 percent ? over Sanders among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa , according to the latest NBC News Wall Street Journal Marist poll . Clinton s lead is well within the 4 . 8 point margin of error for the poll . The slim margin between the two Democratic hopefuls is surprising because it s much smaller than other polls have suggested . The RealClearPolitics average of surveys puts Clinton s lead in Iowa at 10 . 6 points . ?
