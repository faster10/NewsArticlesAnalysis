Some of the longest distance migrants on Earth are various sandpipers , plovers and other shorebirds , many of which winter as far south as Patagonia and breed as far north as the high arctic . Perhaps a million cross the Gulf in May , and when they reach the U . S . coastline , they must stop to rest and feed . Problems with habitat and food supply have reduced many of their populations 50 to 80 percent in the past 20 years . And now this . When oil was just starting to smudge some of the birds on beaches now thick with it , I saw sanderlings , ruddy turnstones , black bellied plovers and other such northbound birds .
