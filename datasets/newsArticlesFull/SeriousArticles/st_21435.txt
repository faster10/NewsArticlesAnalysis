Our genes may influence not just our political point of view , but also whether we vote at all . In a study recently accepted by The Journal of Politics , Fowler found people with one version of a gene called MAOA were 1 . 3 times more likely to vote than those with a different version . In addition , members of religious groups who carried a particular version of another gene called 5HTT were 60 percent more likely to vote than members of religious groups with a different version of the gene .
