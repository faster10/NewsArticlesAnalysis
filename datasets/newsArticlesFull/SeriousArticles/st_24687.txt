Ephron : Death is scary . It makes people frightened , upset , angry , and sad . How could it not ? In Nora ' s case , I understood . . . if you don ' t tell a friend that you are seriously ill , how shocking and upsetting that discovery must be . ( Friends might ask themselves ) , " How close were we , should I have noticed ? " ( There is ) a sense of betrayal and a desire to have been of help . And when people read you and love you through your work as they did with Nora , in their hearts they have a relationship . Or maybe some people are just judgmental . I have noticed that people are a tad judgmental , myself included .
