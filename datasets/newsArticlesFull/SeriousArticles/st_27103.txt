And here s another parallel , which will sound deeply illogical at first : In both cases , the problem is not necessarily that we are trapped in a worsening cycle of violence as that we are trapped in a worsening narrative or spectacle of violence . Shocking events like the San Bernardino shooting or the Planned Parenthood shooting or the Charleston church shooting reinforce that narrative , and make it appear impossible to escape . It s a narrative that fuels ghastly and addictive media images and contradictory political agendas , which is why it s so powerful and so difficult to resist . But that doesn t make it true .
