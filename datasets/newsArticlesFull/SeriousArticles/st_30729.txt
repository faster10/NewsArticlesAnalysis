" Every time we play here we get to play with people we admire , " said guitarist Trey Anastasio , referencing the band ' s only other proper appearance at Bonnaroo in 2009 , when they brought out Bruce Springsteen . This time around , they invited Kenny Rogers onstage to sing " The Gambler . " It seemed like an odd pairing at first , but moments later Anastasio teased " The Gambler ' s " melody again on guitar , this time incorporating it into a jam out of " Possum " with a knowing wink to the crowd . As the band wrapped up their four hour enterprise with a " Tweezer Reprise " encore , a fireworks show erupted behind the stage , putting a wrap on Bonnaroo 2012 at large .
