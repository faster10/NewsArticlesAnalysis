In Iraq , Fallon says that we are cooperating with the regular Iraqi army , which he claims is very different from the one that ran away last year . He says that at the time in June 2014 , when 3 , 000 Isis fighters defeated at least 20 , 000 Iraqi army soldiers and captured Mosul , the Prime Minister of Iraq was Nouri al Maliki , who ran a highly sectarian Shia dominated regime . Fallon is encouraged by the fact that he has been replaced by a more inclusive government under Prime Minister Haider al Abadi . But inside Iraq this new government is seen as even weaker and more dysfunctional than its predecessor . Its main source of authority is its control of Iraq ' s diminished oil revenues , but otherwise it has little power outside Baghdad . Though heavily supported by US air strikes , its best military units fled Ramadi on 17 May . General Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , commented caustically that Iraqi forces weren ' t ' driven out ' of Ramadi , they drove out on their own . ?
