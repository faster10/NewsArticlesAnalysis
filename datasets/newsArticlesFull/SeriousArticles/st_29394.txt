On Tuesday , the House voted , 313 to 118 , to resuscitate the U . S . Export Import Bank , an 81 year old trade lending agency whose charter lapsed earlier this year . Free market conservatives and most Republican leaders opposed reviving the bank , but Republican supporters and Democrats forced a vote by employing a little used parliamentary maneuver to bring the bill up for a vote . A majority of Republicans and all but one Democrat voted in favor of the measure . A large bipartisan majority of the Senate also approved renewing the Ex Im Bank charter in July , overcoming a conservative filibuster , but that measure was attached to a transportation funding bill . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R Ky . ) opposes reviving the bank , but now that both chambers have backed it with large majorities , backers may prevail in getting the measure included in the final transportation bill .
