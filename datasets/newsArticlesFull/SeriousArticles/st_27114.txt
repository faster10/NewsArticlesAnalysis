In March 2014 , Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on route to China . The Boeing 777 200ER ( extended range ) still has not been found but is believed to be somewhere beneath the Indian Ocean . Months later in July 2014 Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 , also a Boeing 777 200ER , was shot down over eastern Ukraine , presumably by Russian backed separatists by mistake . Then in December 2014 , an Air Asia operated Airbus A321 crashed into the Java Sea . In all incidents all on board have or are believed to have perished .
