Griff : I ' m thinking it ' s because they do all the other voting for offense , defense and individual position awards , so they just wrap the coach of the year vote in there , as well . I ' m with you , I ' d like to see more awards done after the season . I ' m the chairman of the FWAA Freshman All American team and select that every year , and I wait until after the bowl games ? except the national title game ? to put the team out . I have advocated Dantonio should be a leading candidate for national coach of the year .
