The inquiry began on Monday with the testimony of Todd ' s friends in Singapore . Todd ' s girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento , a nurse in Singapore , was the first witness to be called . She had gone to his apartment on the night of June 24 , concerned when he didn ' t answer calls or texts , and discovered his hanging body . Sarmiento testified she didn ' t know the details of his work but said Todd told her " how much he hated " it . On one occasion he told her he was " working on something that could get him into trouble with the American government " and that " heavy hands " were coming after him , though he didn ' t elaborate .
