A US president should not easily dismiss public fears . It is not enough for Obama to simply say , The most powerful tool we have to fight ISIL is to say that we re not afraid . Fear of fear is only a first step out of fear . Rather , Obama does well when he points out , for example , that 99 . 9 percent of humanity does not support the ideology and methods of IS . In other words , humanity ? individual by individual ? must bravely and tightly embrace universal values such as freedom , equality , and openness . The walls of fear more easily fall when the trumpets of affirmation are sounded .
