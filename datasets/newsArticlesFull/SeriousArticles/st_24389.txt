The way that most women enter the United States is through the family based visa system . In fact , nearly 70 of immigrant women attain legal status this way . Unfortunately , the family visa system has an enormous backlog about 4 million people are stuck in it , the majority of whom are women and children . Some women are forced to wait for decades before being reunited with their families something that is unbearable even to contemplate for most parents . Comprehensive immigration must clear this backlog and keep families together .
