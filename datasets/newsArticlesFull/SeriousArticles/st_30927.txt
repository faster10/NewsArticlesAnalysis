The Royals lineup will get to Jacob deGrom : The Cubs almost never got a leadoff man on against the Mets across 36 innings of baseball , which allowed Jacob deGrom to knuckle through a game where he did not have his best stuff . The Royals will not let him get away so easy . They won ' t swing at pitches below the strike zone the way the Cubs did . If the Royals can force the Mets to make bad decisions , like bringing Bartolo Colon into an inning with a runner on third base and Eric Hosmer at the plate , or bringing in any reliever not named Jeurys Familia , they have a good shot of winning this series in six games .
