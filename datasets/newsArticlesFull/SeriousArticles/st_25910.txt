The Mets needed Matt Harvey to be dominant and he delivered . Through eight innings of work , he struck out nine , and allowed just four hits and one walk . Only once did a runner get as far as second base ( Lorenzo Cain after a two out single and stolen base in the first ) . He left the field after the eighth having retiring six batters in a row , but Terry Collins decided to lift him . Harvey was having none of it , as cameras caught him demanding he stay in the game . The Mets had a 2 0 lead , but Harvey walked the leadoff hitter , Cain , in the ninth . Cain stole second and Hosmer doubled , at which point Collins officially made the move and brought in Familia . After the game , Collins said , I let my heart get in the way of my gut , less confusing phrase if you assume he meant head instead of gut . Collins added that he loves and trusts his players and that he should be blamed for the result . It was a tough call with no right or wrong answer . Familia probably closes it out if he starts the inning , but sticking with Harvey seemed like the right thing to do , especially if Harvey felt strong and wanted to finish . Then again , is a competitor like Harvey ever going to suggest he come out in a spot like that ? It was just another example of a Collins decision backfiring ? even if it wasn t necessarily incorrect ? and the Royals taking advantage .
