Henry is a 6ft 3in , 245lbs bruiser who led the country in rushing yards ( 2 , 061 ) , rushing attempts ( 359 ) , and touchdowns ( 25 ) this year en route to taking home the Heisman . The junior , who will most likely declare for the NFL draft after the game , isn t particularly shifty , but has been dominant in the Tide s biggest games . Henry ran for a career high 271 yards against archrival Auburn , and took over late in Alabama s 38 0 semi final annihilation of Michigan State . Alabama quarterback Jake Coker was benched prior to the loss to Ole Miss , but has played better if not particularly well as the season has gone on . His main target has been freshman wide receiver Calvin Ridley , who caught eight balls for 138 yards and two scores last week against MSU .
