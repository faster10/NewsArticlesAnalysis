In New York , homicide is defined as " conduct which causes the death of a person . " But not all homicides are the same . Homicide is defined in several " grades , " ranging from criminally negligent homicide to manslaughter to actual murder . All share one basic requirement : intent to cause death or , at least , death arising from grossly negligent or reckless conduct . In layman ' s terms , that means you either have to mean to kill someone , or know there ' s a risk of death and don ' t care about it .
