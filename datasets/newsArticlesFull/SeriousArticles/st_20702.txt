The refuge includes islands , marshes , coastal wetlands , and 48 miles of the Detroit River . Because it is located so close to an urban area a rarity in the hunting world there are plenty of places to stay during a hunting expedition .

Rooms are simple but not inelegant , with kitchens and queen beds , and the house itself is an old brick beauty with a white columned porch . Rooms run from 86 to 96 per night .
