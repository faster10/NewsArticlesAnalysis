Facebook also needs more talent . When I visited Facebook ' s campus two days before its May IPO , the company had 1 . 5 billion users , 3 . 7 billion 2011 revenues , and less than 3 , 000 employees . That isn ' t lean it ' s anorexic . I believe that many of Facebook ' s stumbles , including its smartphone failure , are due to the simple fact that it has too few people to implement its current strategies . In this respect , Facebook ' s weak stock value is an advantage as it can offer new hires options at prices comparable to pre IPO rates .
