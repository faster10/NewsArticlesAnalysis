During his acceptance speech at the 1936 Democratic convention , President Franklin D . Roosevelt said , " Today we stand committed to the proposition that freedom is no half and half affair . If the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place , he must have equal opportunity in the market place . These economic royalists ( his opponents on Wall Street and in the business community ) complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America . What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power . "
