An infinity pool and a swim up sushi bar add to the sleek feel of this resort ' s recently renovated exterior . Even the buffet offers gorgeous sea views through full length plate glass windows . Two resorts exist here : the Oasis Tulum and the slightly more expensive Grand Oasis Tulum . The higher end restaurants and bars ( including a new wine bar ) , some of the pools , and a VIP roof bar with panoramic ocean views and private outdoor Jacuzzi tubs are reserved for Grand Oasis guests . An upgrade will run you about 5 more per person per day .
