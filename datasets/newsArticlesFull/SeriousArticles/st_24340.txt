Suu Kyi , who is tipped to win the elections , has another major road block ahead . Prime Minister Thein Sein , a former general , and others have drafted the constitution in such a way that she will be denied the top post of President even if she wins the polls . According to a controversial constitutional provision , those with foreign children are barred from the office of the country ' s top post . Suu Kyi has two British sons from her late husband . This is likely to set up confrontation between Suu Kyi and the junta which has ruled the country with an iron fist so far .
