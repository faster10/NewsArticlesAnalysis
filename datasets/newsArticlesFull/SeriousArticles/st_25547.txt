Most importantly , we should work to reverse the 1 . 9 billion in cuts and the loss of 49 , 310 public health jobs from state health departments that have occurred since 2008 .

They help inspect homes for lead paint ? and then help remediate those homes . Without the money to keep these people doing their jobs to stop lead exposures ? from all sources ? I can guarantee we ll have more tragedies like Flint s . ?
