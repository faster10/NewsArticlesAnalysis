I had noticed an interesting phenomenon : Increases in federal financial aid were not improving college affordability . Each year , federal financial aid outlays would increase , but college tuitions would continue to rise above and beyond the rate of inflation . Much like the effects of subsidies on health care and the housing market , increasing student aid was insulating colleges from having to make market driven cost cutting measures , like improving productivity or efficiency . It appears that this may still be true today .
