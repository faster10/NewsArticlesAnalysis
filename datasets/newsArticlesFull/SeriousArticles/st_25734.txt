Rushdie : Well , I was really worried because one of the things I felt is the real strength of the film is that we have a wonderful cast which turns in wonderful performances , and I didn ' t want to be the one who didn ' t . I didn ' t want to be like the amateur amongst a group of great professionals , and that worried me . One of the things I know about Deepa is that she is a great director of non professional actors . She ' s really good at guiding you at what to do a bit faster , a bit slower , a bit more of this and a bit less of that and I think all you have to do is be good at taking the direction and responding to it . I told her that if I was embarrassed by the results , I would want to fire myself and find an actor , but in the end , people seemed to like it , so it stayed in .
