Adapted from the David Constantine short story " In Another Country , " Haigh ' s 45 Years is a study in economy , in the beautiful symmetry of word and image and music . That the writer director has cast two icons of cinema whose careers were born in the British New Wave ( Courtenay in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and Billy Liar , Rampling in The Knack and Georgy Girl ) , gives the film even greater resonance : With its playlist of 1960s pop hits ( Kate has been asked to suggest songs for the anniversary fete ) , with its two principals forced to survey their respective and collective pasts , 45 Years is very much about lost youth .
