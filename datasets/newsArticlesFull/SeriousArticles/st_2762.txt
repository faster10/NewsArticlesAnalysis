ChillSpot Dog Bed : On a hot day , most dogs like to congregate on cool tile floors in the bathroom or kitchen . ChillSpot applies that approach to dog beds , pairing aluminum tiles with " chill pods " that you freeze overnight so that dogs stay cool while tailgating or hanging out at the beach . You can stock up now for next summer . " It ' s a great product for trainers to use in class , " says dog trainer Andrew Zbeeb , owner of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta , Georgia . To combat Georgia ' s sweltering summer heat , Zoo Atlanta even ordered a larger ChillSpot for its panda exhibit . A standard 24 by 36 inch dog bed is available for 169 at ChillSpot . biz .
