But they still need to improve the bullpen . In this day , the pen is more vital than ever , and that ' s especially true with a young rotation you don ' t want to overtax . But without a nice free agent relief list , they might have to canvass the other 29 teams for one more shutdown reliever . With Familia set as closer , it ' s hard to see the Mets getting involved for Craig Kimbrel or Aroldis Chapman or someone of that ilk but someone like J . J . Hoover , a teammate of Chapman ' s with the Reds , would suffice . Drew Storen , who ' s available , would be a plus , but he prefers to close . And of course they don ' t have to be reminded to stay awat from Jonathan Papelbon , who ' s eminently available .
