Spangler isn t a guy I would define as a Land Warrior , but his game isn t built on explosiveness or athleticism . He s strong and he s physical , but offensively , what he s most effective at is spacing the floor . He can set brutal ball screens and his ability to knock down threes makes him a nightmare in pick and pop actions . He s currently shooting better than 45 percent from beyond the arc this season . I say all that to say this : With the talent Lon Kruger has in his back court this season ? Isaiah Cousins and Jordan Woodard flanking Hield ? Oklahoma can play four around one and not have to worry about having a low post scorer all that much . Their guards are that good at playmaking . What Lattin provides ? or at least provided on Monday night ? was energy on the glass , a shot blocking presence defensively and a guy that could finish off dump offs and lobs at the rim .
