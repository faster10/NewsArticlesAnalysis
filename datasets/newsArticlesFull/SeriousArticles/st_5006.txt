The recent terrorist attacks in Paris , Istanbul and Jakarta clearly show that ISIS is a danger for our security and our way of life . We will have our F 16s be more efficiently deployed by also having them be active in the Syrian part of the conflict , particularly hitting , for example , training centers and other facilities which replenish the capacity of ISIL to be active in the Iraqi side of the conflict , above Syria , in particular to stop the pipeline leading from Syria into Iraq . I do believe it is important as a coalition that we are active in the whole area .
