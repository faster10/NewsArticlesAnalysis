History has shown there is a damning 39 year fault line that consumes even the best NFL passers . Manning ( 39 ) is already there . Brady ( 38 ) and Brees ( 37 ) are close behind . Even Roethlisberger ( 34 next season ) and Rodgers ( 33 late next season ) are marching toward the tail end of his prime . That ' s not just a massive burst of talent departing the NFL ' s most important position . It ' s a multitude of era defining artists who are poised to end their careers in potentially the next five years . That ' s a little like watching Miles Davis , Louis Armstong , John Coltrane , Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker all retire inside the same decade .
