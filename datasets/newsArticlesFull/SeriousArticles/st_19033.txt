While many were either preparing , or hearing endlessly about the massive snowstorm that hit the East Coast a few weeks ago one agency hunkered down . The Atlantic ? dives deep ? into the story of how NASA kept watch in the midst of a blizzard : On Friday , January 22 , as the first snowflakes of a historic blizzard began piling atop America s east coast , a team of more than twenty engineers and scientists hauled food , clothes , cots , and mattresses into a building at NASA s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland . The team would remain at the facility until well after the snow let up Sunday morning , keeping watch over a giant , humming Space Environment Simulator . The simulator is a cylindrical chamber and , as you might expect from its name , it simulates the conditions of outer space Sitting inside the Space Environment Simulator are the guts of the most far seeing camera ever built by humans . This camera will soon be launched into deep space , to image the first stars to flare into being after the Big Bang , and maybe , if we are very lucky , the exhaled gases of life forms that live in the atmospheres of distant planets .
