In truth , while there are plenty of good reasons to be critical of China , currency manipulation isn t one of them . The basic idea behind the charge is that China has bought up dollars and flooded the world with yuan to make the yuan less valuable , making Chinese exports cost less and blocking American imports . Years ago , this was probably true . In recent years , though , China s buying up dollars has probably done the U . S . more good than harm ( it has used them to buy U . S . Treasury bonds ) . And more recently , China has stopped doing it . In fact , if China has manipulated its currency at all , it has been to strengthen the renminbi and keep it from sliding too fast as China s economy cools .
