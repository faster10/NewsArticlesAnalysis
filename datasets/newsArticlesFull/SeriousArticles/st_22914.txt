He intends to reach out to all Central Africans , regardless of creed or ethnic origin . He is coming to comfort the population which is tired of this civil war which has brought nothing but death and destruction . He is coming to remind us that the CAR , like every country , must provide a home for all of its children , without any form of exclusion . His coming is an encouragement to the political world to serve the country rather than simply being served by it . His coming will serve as a reminder to all those who have filled their pockets and made themselves richer from the country s resources of their duty to stand by the Central African Republic and to pay something back through the building of schools , hospitals and by providing other opportunities for work .
