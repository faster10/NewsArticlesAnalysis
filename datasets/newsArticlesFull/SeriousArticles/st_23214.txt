Take a look at Smith ' s five last features : " Seven Pounds , " " Hancock , " " I Am Legend , " " The Pursuit of Happyness , " and " Hitch . " Yes , " Men in Black 3 " failed to compete with the likes of " Hancock " ( 62 . 6 million debut ) and " I Am Legend " ( 77 . 2 million ) . But if you averaged the openings of all five films , it ' d come out to 45 million or 52 million when adjusted for ticket price inflation . In that light , " Men in Black 3 ' s " 54 . 6 million debut isn ' t so disheartening . Disappointing for such a pricey sci fi action franchise ? Sure . But a stain on Smith ' s box office report card ? Not really .
