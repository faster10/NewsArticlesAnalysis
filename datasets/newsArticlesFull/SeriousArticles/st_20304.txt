First of all , I just want to state for the record that I ' m hardly dismissing Iowa ' s chances of beating the Spartans . Second of all , don ' t assume that the Rose Bowl , given its druthers , would prefer the Buckeyes to the Hawkeyes because they ' re a bigger name . The folks in Pasadena want to fill their stadium , and they know that Iowa fans , who haven ' t been there in 25 years , will flock west in droves , whereas some ( not all ) Ohio State fans may view the game as a disappointment a year after winning the national championship .
