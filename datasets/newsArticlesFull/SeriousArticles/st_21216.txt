Robert lives with a caretaker , Marilia ( Marisa Paredes , " All About My Mother , " " Talk To Her " ) , who is his willing accomplice in this macabre medical experiment and acts as a mother figure to him . She makes meals for Vera and is the only other person with whom she has any contact . Marilia also dotes on Robert , whose tireless albeit creepy work was triggered by the death of his wife some years before , the victim of a horrible car crash and subsequent burning , hence the flam resistant pigskin .
