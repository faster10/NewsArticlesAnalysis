We have a variety of institutions that can defend us when attacked : the police , the military , the Department of Homeland Security , various commercial products and services , and our own personal or corporate lawyers . The legal framework for any particular attack depends on two things : the attacker and the motive . Those are precisely the two things you don ' t know when you ' re being attacked on the Internet . We saw this on July 4 last year , when U . S . and South Korean websites were attacked by unknown perpetrators from North Korea or perhaps England . Or was it Florida ?
