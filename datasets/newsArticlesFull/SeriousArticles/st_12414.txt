Social Security s disability trust fund is projected to run out of money in late 2016 , which would trigger an automatic 19 percent cut in benefits for 11 million disabled workers and their families . The budget deal would add six years to the life of the disability fund by temporarily reallocating a small portion of payroll taxes from Social Security s retirement fund . The deal also includes changes to the disability program to fight fraud and to encourage disabled workers to return to work .
