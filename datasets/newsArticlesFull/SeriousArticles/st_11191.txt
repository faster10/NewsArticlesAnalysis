Yes , it ' s true . While we don ' t know if what Stephen Curry is doing can be sustained , if it can be , it ' s the best we ' ve seen . If the season ended today , Curry would finish with the highest ever PER , win share average , and points per 100 possessions . Basically , Curry is scoring at a rate higher than anyone ever , and doing so with the greatest efficiency we ' ve ever seen from a scorer ( 70 . 7 true shooting percentage ) . He has individually hit more 3 pointers than four NBA teams have . He has connected on 9 of 13 shots beyond 29 feet . It ' s happening . A player who just three seasons ago wasn ' t projected as a future superstar is now playing better than all the greats of basketball history . Not coincidentally , the Warriors are winning a lot .
