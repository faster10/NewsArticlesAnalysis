( Kathryn ) Bigelow ' s champions film of champions ( " The Hurt Locker " ) shows the Americans as the heroes , addicted to comradeship and the thrill of battle , and the Iraqis as the faceless aggressors resorting to cheap tactics and foul play . A rather disgusting narrative point of view , especially unnerving when you consider how determined Bigelow et screaming actors al were to create an apolitical discursive cocoon around their film . It ' s as though they were being willfully , culturally stupid , which is strange from a director that is considered , buy most accounts , to be an intelligent filmmaker .
