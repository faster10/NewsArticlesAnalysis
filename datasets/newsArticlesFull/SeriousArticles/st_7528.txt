Eighty nine of the 129 people who died in the latest attacks were at the Bataclan theatre , located in the same district as January ' s Charlie Hebdo shootings . The Bataclan theatre may also have been targeted because it had been owned for 40 years by two Jewish brothers who publicly supported Israel . They sold it in September 2015 , which was not so well known . Israel and Jews are a preferred target of most terrorist groups , but since Israel has made itself a hard target , attacking Jews and synagogues in other countries is a much easier option .
