Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy J . McGinty released 326 enhanced images Saturday showing a frame by frame analysis of the November 2014 fatal shooting by Cleveland police officers of Tamir Rice , a 12 year old black boy carrying a toy gun . The images seemingly back up reports released by the prosecutor suggesting Timothy Loehmann , the officer who shot Rice , may have believed Rice was armed with a real gun . The Rice family ' s attorneys are challenging that notion and asking the prosecutor to let their own use of force experts testify before the grand jury .
