1 . Saints at Bucs , Sunday , 1 : 00 , O U 50 . 5 : Drew Brees ( 36 ) on the road again against a hot team that s playing better defensively and is actually No . 1 in yards allowed per play and above average in yards per pass play , too . So this is not a good matchup . But a theme here all year is that you should not run away or toward matchups based on the opponent of your fantasy player because we re usually talking about a 5 percent expected boost in points from average to best or worst . There is a bigger effect for better players against bad defenses but we are playing the better players anyway . The Saints are an outlier defense on the bad side so beyond making this a tiebreaker for Jameis Winston ( 35 ) and other Bucs , you probably could justify something greater , like a tier bump . But this is the very rare exception to the rule .
