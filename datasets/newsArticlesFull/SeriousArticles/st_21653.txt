Indianapolis Colts : The Colts have turned to 40 year old Matt Hasselbeck at quarterback since Andrew Luck ( kidney abdomen ) is out . They ideally would like to ease some of Hasselbeck s load by establishing a running game with Frank Gore and Ahmad Bradshaw . That s a good idea and all , but the Falcons are third in the league in rushing yards allowed ( 88 . 9 ) . The Falcons have staggered to back to back losses , but they ve had two weeks to prepare for the Colts and they re playing at home , where they re averaging almost 30 points a game . That s not good for a Colts defense that s 28th in the league and could be without starting safety Mike Adams ( ankle ) and linebacker D Qwell Jackson ( hamstring ) . Falcons 31 , Colts 17 . Mike Wells
