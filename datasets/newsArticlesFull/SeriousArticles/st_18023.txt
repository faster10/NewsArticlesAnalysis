Testing , testing : The Broncos might be the league ' s tight game champs this season . Going into the AFC Championship Game , the Broncos were 10 3 in games decided by seven or fewer points including their AFC divisional round win over the Pittsburgh Steelers . While it means the Broncos didn ' t always finish teams off the way you would expect a Super Bowl team to , it also means when the chips are in the middle of the table they have usually found a way to win . Denver is a tough team that is used to making plays when the game is on the line . The Broncos have the league ' s No . 1 defense and two wins over Tom Brady since Nov . 29 . The Panthers played four games in the regular season against teams that were in the playoff field and were 4 0 but only one of those games was after Nov . 8 . And while the Panthers ' offensive muscle certainly contributed , the other three teams in the NFC South finished 14th ( Atlanta ) , 26th ( Tampa Bay ) and 32nd ( New Orleans ) in scoring defense this season .
