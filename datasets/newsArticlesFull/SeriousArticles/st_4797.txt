These are some of the most high profile spots in the chamber , and the guests usually reflect a message or policy priority that the president will discuss . This year , however , the first lady ' s box will be most notable for who is not there : The White House will be leaving a seat empty at Tuesday ' s event to honor people who have died due to gun violence . President Barack Obama made the announcement on a conference call with grassroots supporters Friday , where he discussed the steps he ' s taking to address gun violence . A White House official said the seat will be left empty to give victims a voice , ' because they need the rest of us to speak for them . To tell their stories . To honor their memory .

To remind every single one of our representatives that it s their responsibility to do something about this . ' " HuffPost
