First , in recent years , we ' ve seen a surge in climate and extreme weather events , along with analysis and other evidence that the world is on an unsustainable course . The most recent and tragic example was Super Typhoon Bopha that swept across the Philippines this week , killing at least 500 people and leaving tens of thousands displaced . Typhoons aren ' t unusual in the Philippines , but this one is the most southern on record and it arrived particularly late in the year . The storm , of course , comes on the heels of Hurricane Sandy , which swept through the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States , leaving hundreds dead , and thousands without power or property . These are the kind of extreme weather events that are becoming more common in a warming world .
