Louis van Gaal has used a back three several times in his career in his Ajax team that won the Champions League , at Barcelona and very successfully in the World Cup with Holland . But at Manchester United he hasn ' t been able to deploy it with the success that Rodgers has at Liverpool . The key for me is that your back three need to be able to accept the ball and move it even under pressure . Liverpool are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they ' ve been comfortable with that . That ' s why Emre Can , initially signed as a midfielder , has been so important . His technique on the ball gives them a safety valve in possession at the back .
