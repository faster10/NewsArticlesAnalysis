It is unclear how Hassan ended up in a Somali jail to begin with . When the State Department announced his detention , a spokesperson for the department said he had turned himself in to Somali authorities on Nov . 6 . But in his own telling , Hassan said fighters with al Shabab came to his home last month , where they blindfolded and terrorized his family . Hassan told VOA he was able to escape into the wilderness until about two weeks ago when he was spotted by villagers , who then turned him in to Somali authorities .
