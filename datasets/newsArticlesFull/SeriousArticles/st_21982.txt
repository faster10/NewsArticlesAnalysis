That doesn t diminish what they did Tuesday night , destroying the Lakers to become the first team in NBA history to go 16 0 to start the season . Which is insane . They are playing at a level a notch higher than anyone else in the league right now and their cruising speed can crush teams like the Lakers . LeBron James talked Tuesday about trying to savor the greats of the game ? that is good advice . We need to step back sometimes and soak in the moment when we witness greatness . And make no mistake , right now the Warriors are great . Nobody has an answer for their small ball lineup , nobody can slow the Stephen Curry Draymond Green pick and roll . Whatever happens this season ? start like this and don t win a ring and people will only talk about the latter ? ? right now the Warriors are simply a joy to watch . They play such a smart game . Seeing high IQ players working in unison is a joy for any true fan of the game .
