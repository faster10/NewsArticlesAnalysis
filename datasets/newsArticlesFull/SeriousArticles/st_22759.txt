Using classified and commercial satellite imagery , the United States estimates there are up to 40 , 000 Russian troops on the border with eastern Ukraine . Those troops remain positioned so close , and are so heavily armed , that the U . S . and NATO calculate they could " roll across " eastern Ukraine in three to five days , one official said . That ' s an estimate previously made by Gen . Philip Breedlove , the military chief of NATO . There has been no withdrawal of Russian forces other than perhaps small numbers , so the estimate remains in place , the official said .
