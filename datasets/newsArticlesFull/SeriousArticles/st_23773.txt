First , the ever expanding portions ( think " supersized " ) are one of the major causes of obesity . When portion sizes are smaller , individuals eat less but feel full . This works , even if a person can take an additional portion . ( Most won ' t because they are satiated , and it at least makes them think about what they are consuming . ) Second , sugar is high in calories , promotes fat storage in the body and is addictive , so people want more . The so called " war on sugar " is not a culture war , it is a public health imperative backed by science .
