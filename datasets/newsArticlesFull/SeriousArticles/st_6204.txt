The question facing Democrats in these early states are what kind of candidate and party do they want ? Sanders is seeking to lead a political movement that would upend national politics by using the federal government s powers to raise the standards of living of most working and middle class Americans by more aggressively taxing wealthy businessess and affluent individuals . In contrast , Clinton also seeks to expand federal programs that help these same slices of society , but she would be less aggressive in regulating corporate America and taxing the rich . She is also more hawkish on foreign policy , including the use of U . S . troops in major conflict regions overseas like Iraq and Syria .
