Bemidji best captures the Norman Rockwell glow of a summer lake town , with clean beaches , quirky annual traditions , and a packed social calendar . Its Fourth of July and county fair are pure Americana , while the Dragon Boat Festival and its competitive racing crews channel a Minnesota style Mardi Gras from August 1 to 6 . Book an afternoon with one of the guides at Tomahawk Lodges to fish for walleye , a flaky white fish that does nicely on the grill ( 800 452 8023 , call for price estimates ) .
