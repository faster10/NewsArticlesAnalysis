The questions flew back and forth , bandied about by Coalition members such as No H8 Campaign , the United Nations Association , Cartoon Network ' s Stop Bullying : Speak Up , the Anti Defamation League and GLSEN . At one point I stood back and looked around , equal parts grateful and amazed to be part of the discussion . Surrounded by people in elaborate costumes , listening to the noise and excitement , I recalled the moment 32 months ago when I was just another worried mom , wondering how to help my kid . That moment led me here .
