But after the release of that song , the entire group , and Jerry Garcia in particular , found themselves at the center of some outrageous behavior by their fans . In the film one story told is about how a fan purposefully tried to have a van driving Jerry Garcia injure him so he would have some connection to the star . After " Touch of Grey , " according to Weir , they were unable to go out in public like they used to and often were forced to stay in their hotel rooms on the road .
