( PT ) : Well , I think if you heard my speech today that I gave at the Jeddah Economic Forum . I described Saudi Arabia as a crossroads for trade and commerce , historically . Going back to pre Islamic days the Kingdom was always a passage point for goods and people coming from Asia to Europe to Africa and vice versa . With that situation being as it is , naturally change comes from outside , but also the Kingdom is very careful that its basic traditions and beliefs and values are improved rather than discarded by this change . If we have habits or practices that are not helpful we look forward to giving those up . If there are habits and practices that we can learn from others , then we will gladly espouse them . But our basic tenets and beliefs hopefully we will safeguard because they are the things that identify us as human beings .
