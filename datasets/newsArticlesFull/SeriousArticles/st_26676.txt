A selfish , unilateral approach to borders constitutes a repeat of the tragedy of 2015 , when EU member states individually spent about ? 40bn to address the crisis after it had reached European shores .

Unable to feed and educate their children , thousands of refugees ceded their savings to smugglers for a chance to reach Europe ? precisely what you and I would have done had we been in their place .
