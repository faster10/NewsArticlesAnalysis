Almost a week after the Paris attacks , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn t said what measures his chamber will consider to boost security in the U . S . McConnell , a Kentucky Republican , said he supports a " pause " on the refugee program to ensure the proper safety policies are in place , though he hasn t said if the Senate will take up the House bill when Congress returns Nov . 30 from a Thanksgiving break . Some lawmakers of both parties say a bigger worry is a program that allows visa free entry to the U . S . for citizens of about three dozen countries , including much of Europe .
