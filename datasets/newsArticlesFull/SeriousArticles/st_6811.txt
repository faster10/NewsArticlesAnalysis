Latter day Republicans have a tendency to get lost finding conspiracies in their own entrails , but the Benghazi weirdness seemed truly incomprehensible ? after watching for nine hours , I still have no idea what the interrogators were after . And Benghazi seemed a refraction of the increasingly bizarre Republican nomination race , in which Ben Carson seems to be levitating past Donald Trump . Indeed , I can t remember a time when I ve experienced the gnashing of so many prominent Republican teeth . Who would you vote for , a leading Republican asked me , Trump or Bernie Sanders ? Who would you vote for , I asked in return , Trump or Hillary ?
