China and Arab countries need to defend regional peace . The world could not be a tranquil place if there is instability in the Middle East . A study of history shows that force is never the right solution to problems , and the zero sum or winner takes all logic is inconsistent with the call of the times . The surest way to finding the maximum common denominator between the interests of different parties is to seek consensus and be understanding and accommodative . As always , China will continue to support the Middle East peace process . China supports the establishment of an independent State of Palestine with full sovereignty based on the 1967 border and with East Jerusalem as capital . China will provide more public goods , and work with Egypt and other Arab countries to safeguard peace and stability in the Middle East .
