During the economic depression known as the Panic of 1893 , workers for the Pullman Car Co . , one of the country ' s largest manufacturers , walked off their jobs when Pullman tried to cut wages , fire workers and evict them from their company owned homes . They were joined by hundreds of thousands of workers in a nationwide walkout . Facing a strike that would shut down America ' s railroads , Cleveland dispatched 12 , 000 federal troops on the premise that the strike interfered with the U . S . Mail . In the ensuing violence , at least 13 strikers were killed .
