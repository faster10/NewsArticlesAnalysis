Those are the " newsworthy " events , but they do little to explain what ' s happening . For example , with my Hat of Reasonability on , I ' m tempted to say " Of course no one gamer or not supports anyone threatening rape and mass murder . " But we don ' t really know that . Even if few would applaud such horrific acts of violence , the meaning of " support " is one of the questions raised by Gamergate : These women are being attacked for criticizing mainstream games ' diminishment of women , and some of the sites where these discussions have erupted have subcultures of misogyny . That is a type of support that can ' t be dismissed simply by disavowing those who threaten physical violence .
