If losing a celebrity like , say , Maureen O Hara ? known for her work in Miracle on 34th Street and The Quiet Man ? was once a small , if tragic blip on the radar , these tragedies are becoming ingrained into our cultural consciousness , hitting us harder than ever before . When film critic Roger Ebert ? who had been a personal hero to me ? died in April of 2013 , I was so devastated that I didn t leave my apartment for a week . I cried harder at the news of his death than about people I knew personally . But while those feelings are raw and real , there can be an unfortunate dark side to the constant wave of bad news in a media age where celebrity death becomes a business model .
