" Let me tell you , Coach Saban is smooth , especially when he and Miss Terry get out there and start doing the electric slide with everybody , " said Miller , who works now as a sports anchor for Fox 57 in Columbia , South Carolina . " He brings out that karaoke machine , and they crank it up . Everybody was singing and dancing . Coach Burton Burns was the DJ , and we ' re all out there sweating and getting down , and there ' s Coach Saban about 10 feet from you doing the same . It was a blast . "
