We found that sari cloth that comprised the dresses that women wear , if folded about four times , gave a very nice mesh filter , with small enough pore size to trap plankton . A three year study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and Nursing Institute that involved about 50 villages and over 150 , 000 people , and sure enough , by having women filter their water collected from the ponds and rivers every day , we showed about a 50 decrease in cholera . A very simple step , and very important .
