Robertson : Again , not being there , it ' s very hard to gauge . But when you listen to the desperation in people ' s voices , and you see the way that they ' re talking and the terms they ' re characterizing it in , yes , the situation is desperate .

When you have these kind of wounds coming in the survival rate is negligible . The young man who lost his face , he died for lack of treatment , nothing else for lack of treatment .
