Before then , in 2007 , Mitt Romney had said he would not move heaven and Earth to find Osama bin Laden . He did clarify his statements a couple days later and also in a debate , saying that getting bin Laden was important , but so was focusing on other top tier al Qaeda leaders . But the more damning statement came afterward , when he strongly criticized then Sen . Obama for saying he would go into Pakistan to get bin Laden without the help of the Pakistanis if he had actionable intelligence to do so . Romney called those statements " ill timed " and " ill considered . "
