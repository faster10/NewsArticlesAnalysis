Unlike those other inhabitants of Earth , however , we know something of how things work . This , too , was highlighted last week , when the Seattle Times reported on a study I did 15 years ago , one of many for the Hazel site , which had experienced recurring landslides .

As a scientist , I knew that material would someday be on the valley floor .
