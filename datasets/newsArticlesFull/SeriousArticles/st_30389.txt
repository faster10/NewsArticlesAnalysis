Many poor women do not receive information on how to receive reproductive health care . Our underprivileged women have to accept standards lower than what they need , want , or deserve . According to the Department of Health , the mortality rate for Filipino mothers increased to 221 per 100 , 000 live births in 2011 from 162 per 100 , 000 live births in 2009 . But not only do the women suffer , the children do , too . The children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices .
