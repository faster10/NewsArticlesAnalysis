" Well , we played slow basketball up to this point , " James said . " And we walk the ball up a lot . Every now and then , we ' d get out on the break and we ' d run off turnovers , but , you know , Coach , he wants us to get up the floor , made or misses , and that ' s the transition from walking the ball up . So , all of us , we need to do something different as far as our pace and our conditioning . If he wants us to play faster and you want to be out on the floor , you can ' t get tired , and if you do , you got to come out . Something that Coach Lue want us to do , and we all got to accept it . "
