Of course , my favorite gift of all would be a trip . Give those you love most the gift of an adventure together someplace new , or someplace that holds special memories , whether you are celebrating a special anniversary , birthday or simply a good year . Outfitters , cruise lines and resorts will help you arrange a custom itinerary and give you a good " reunion " deal too . Just make sure you get everyone on board with the idea before you fork over your credit card for those nonrefundable deposits .
