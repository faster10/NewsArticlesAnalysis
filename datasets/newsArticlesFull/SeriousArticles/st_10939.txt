Does the data network through which Kindle delivers my daily newspapers count as " the Internet " ? If it does , I use it quite a lot , as I get seven daily newspapers anything from The Wall Street Journal to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that way and perhaps a dozen magazines . But some of those I also read over my iPad . I used to be a heavy user of apps like Flipboard , but to quote the famous computer scientist Don Knuth , I find myself more and more inclined to get to the bottom of things , and spend more time with books ( I probably spend an hour a day on Amazon . com buying new books , many of them online ) and more long form writing .
