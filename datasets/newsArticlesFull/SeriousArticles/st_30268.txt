Bridgewater ' s targets over the last month : Stefon Diggs 18 Mike Wallace 17 Jarius Wright 15 McKinnon and Kyle Rudolph 12 Peterson 4 . . . . Although Diggs was not shadowed by Richard Sherman when these teams played in Week 13 , Diggs emerged with a 2 22 0 line on six targets and has failed to clear 60 receiving yards in six consecutive games . Diggs ' recent shortage of production may make it more likely he avoids Sherman ' s shadow in this rematch . The shortage of recent production also makes him a concerning , low floor fantasy bet . . . . Wallace may end up seeing the most of Sherman and hasn ' t hit 50 yards since Week 4 . . . . If the Vikings do change their game plan to become more pass heavy against the Seahawks , Diggs and Rudolph would figure to be the top box score beneficiaries . Rudolph is another extremely low floor dart throw his target totals are 1 , 3 , and 2 in Minnesota ' s last three games but his matchup is good on paper versus a Seattle defense permitting the 13th most yards ( 873 ) and ninth most touchdowns ( 8 ) to tight ends . Rudolph ' s outlook is still probably not entirely dissimilar from that of Richard Rodgers or a true hail mary like Texans TE Ryan Griffin . They aren ' t going to rack up receptions and will only help you if they score a touchdown . They ' ll hurt you if they don ' t .
