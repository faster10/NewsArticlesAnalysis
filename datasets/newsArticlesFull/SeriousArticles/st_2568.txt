A year ago , Palin spoke out about mental health issues and veterans , telling a Conservative Political Action Conference audience , As we gather here , we re safe , we re secure , we re having fun , four days together at a conference . In those four days , 92 of our veterans will have taken their lives . Whatever is really going on inside Track Palin s own head ? ? and we don t know because there s no prior indication he s been diagnosed with PTSD ? ? the mental health issues for veterans are serious , and affect ? not just them but their families and partners . But if you want to blame Obama for the undeniably far from perfect VA , you still can t say the president s one for dropping the ball on mental health funding in general , and mental health funding for veterans in particular . Mental services for vets expanded since Obama took office , including the signing of a 2009 bill to provide 4 . 6 billion for mental health care to treat the psychological wounds of returning combat veterans , including post traumatic stress disorder . Obama s 2016 budget includes 4 million for Veterans Mental Health First Aid .
