? Interception return by Luke Kuechly for touchdown : Despite Luke Willson s presnap motion , Carolina stayed aligned with its line to Seattle s left , leaving Star Lotulelei in a gap to be initially double teamed by center Patrick Lewis and right guard J . R . Sweezy . That created the matchup Carolina wanted : All Pro tackle Kawann Short isolated against Justin Britt . Short dominated with outstanding hand to hand technique ? for a moment during the play Short forced Britt s left arm raised straight skyward , as if line coach Tom Cable had asked his group , Who doesn t want to block Kawann Short ? ? then Britt left his post foot , that is his inside foot , anchored and he became a turnstile . Meanwhile , Carolina played a coverage termed quarter quarter half , with two defensive backs rolled to Wilson s left ? the cornerback in the flat and the safety deep and over the top to that side . Against this style of double coverage on the weak side , Wilson erred by keeping his eyes left for his entire five step drop . Had he looked to the strong side sooner , he had an opportunity to hit Tyler Lockett on a hook route , or at least throw the ball away . Regardless , his attempted checkdown to Lynch under duress was a critical error .
