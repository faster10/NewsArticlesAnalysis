So much of the anger towards LeBron for the past six years has focused on the optics of the uppercase Decision ? his arrogance in leaving Cleveland via TV special ? more than the lowercase decision itself ? going to Miami to win a couple of titles . Coming back to Cleveland in 2014 ? and the way in which he did it , via a heartfelt essay that served as an ode to the town ? pretty much healed that wound , for Cleveland fans at least . Even Raab , the King of the LeBron haters , responded to the news by re embracing James , with a quote from Woody Allen : Acceptance , forgiveness , and love . Even before that , the sports populace had forgiven James : He had returned to No . 2 in the Harris Poll of popular male sports figures by 2013 after winning back to back championships with the Heat . Everybody loves a winner !
