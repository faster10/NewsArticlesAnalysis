The troops responded , sending word to their superiors that they needed to help this baby . And help her they did . The troops brought Noor , her father and grandmother back to Camp Liberty while planning her transport to the United States for proper care . Childspring International , an Atlanta based Christian nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing sick children from the developing world to the United States for medical care , offered assistance in bringing Noor and her family to Atlanta for treatment at Children ' s Healthcare of Atlanta . Childsrping International also set up a fund for Baby Noor and are still taking donations through their website . There she endured several surgeries and began what would be a lifelong , uphill battle . But following threats believed to be from al Qaeda , Noor and her family were left with little choice but to return home . She is now a 7 year old girl in a wheelchair with serious medical needs that are barely being met and at high risk of complications from a urinary tract infection that could cost Noor her life .
