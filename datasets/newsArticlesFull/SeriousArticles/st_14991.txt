FourFiveSeconds , the singer s collab with Kanye West and Sir Paul McCartney , is perhaps her most memorable guitar tune , but despite being released last year , it s notably absent on ANTI . Enter Kiss It Better , a bleeding heart rock ballad on which Rihanna asks ? a lover to take her back . Nuno Bettencourt , formerly of Extreme , provides that killer opening riff , and Rihanna sashays through the chorus in such a way it begs for live performance . What are you willing to do ? the song asks . Well , for one , throw this on repeat .
