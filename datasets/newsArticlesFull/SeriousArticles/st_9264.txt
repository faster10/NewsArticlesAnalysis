The conversations between David Gest and Darren Day in the first few episodes began to reveal interesting details from their position of celebrity hindsight . Gest told a drastically altered Christopher Maloney ( formerly from X Factor ) that surgery was a bad idea and pointed to his own mangled features as an example . Day talked sagely of former addictions with Daniella Westbrook , herself only recently emerged from a recent relapse . This stuff might not interest you , but I was genuinely drawn in by their conversations .
