Again , these are cases chosen at random , excluding any stories where suspects had not been caught yet . Mass shootings , along with the similar crime of murder suicide , ? are usually personal in nature and not the random or politicized shootings that come to mind when we think of mass shootings . They usually happen after very little planning or even at the spur of the moment . In nearly every case , the assailant is a man trying to assert dominance over others , whether they are rival gang members , a woman he s trying to force into submission , or just some dude who said something nasty to him at a party . There are multiple victims because the shooter either had a problem with all of them , shooting them was a way to hurt the main victim ( such as when shooters kill children to hurt ? the mother ) , or because they were bystanders .
