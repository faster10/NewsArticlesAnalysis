Sanders points out : " Three out of the 4 largest financial institutions ( JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America and Wells Fargo ) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out . Incredibly , the six largest banks in this country issue more than two thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages . They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits . Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP . Enough is enough .
