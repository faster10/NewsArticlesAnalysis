In fifth place , Red 2 took in 18 . 5 million , 15 percent less than the original Red ' s 21 . 8 million opening in 2010 . The Summit sequel starring Bruce Willis , Helen Mirren , Mary Louise Parker , and John Malkovich , got a big budget boost from its predecessor , but like The Expendables 2 , that didn ' t grow the film ' s audience at the box office . While Red cost only 58 million and ultimately earned 199 million worldwide , Red 2 cost 85 million , and its weaker American debut suggests it won ' t climb nearly as high at the box office . Audiences gave Red 2 a " B " CinemaScore grade .
