The 45 year old s appointment was confirmed yesterday and though Yaya Tour , shown the door at Barcelona by him in 2010 , may not be so motivated , the club do expect competition for a place in his squad to intensify . Guardiola s presence at the Etihad is also likely to make City attractive for the players who have been on their radar : Everton s Ross Barkley and John Stones and Juventus s Paul Pogba . Though Guardiola may seek to strengthen City s goalscoring options by trying to bring Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich , Real Madrid have made him one of two prime targets if they avoid a transfer embargo . The Spanish club are favourites .
