Many people will mark the weekend holiday with a visit to the Misi n San Antonio de Valero in San Antonio , now known as the Alamo , which the Spanish first constructed and Mexican and Texas troops later occupied . The March 6 , 1836 , battle between Mexican troops and Texas revolutionaries is known among descendants of the Republic of Texas as a great fight against impossible odds . The Mexican troops crushed the revolutionaries , but the Texans fought back victoriously later that year , and the Republic of Texas was born .
