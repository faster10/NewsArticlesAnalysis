A . Basic idea that the R D is the key comes naturally to me because of the computer industry . The idea of this specific initiative had actually come in summer when ( French ) President Francois Hollande , ( French foreign ) minister Laurent Fabius , the UN people like Christiana Figueres and people in the US administration , including secretary energy , talked about it .
