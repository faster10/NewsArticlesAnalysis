While I appreciate the portrayals of black people during slavery and civil rights , our experiences are much more far reaching and diverse . It seems like studios think the only way to create tension or express the depth of the black experience is to tell the story over and over again of our enslavement or denial of rights . People of color have many varied experiences and deal with issues very similar to that of our white counterparts . The movie , " The Best Man 2 , " recently portrayed a close group of black friends who are touched by cancer . Personally , I ' ve lost a whole line of my lineage due to illness like cancer . We deal with death , financial setbacks , parental and marital strife , strained relationships , addiction and fertility issues just like everyone else in the world , but we also have the racial undertones and culture differences which could provide a new perspective , if we were permitted to share our stories .
