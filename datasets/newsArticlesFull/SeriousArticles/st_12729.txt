The Price acquisition also directly addresses one of Boston ' s primary weaknesses in 2015 , when it finished 78 84 and in last place in the AL East . Last season , Boston used 12 different starting pitchers , and none of them reached 200 innings . To put a finer point on it , the rotation leader in WAR , Clay Buchholz with a mark of 2 . 6 , made just 18 starts . The Red Sox ' s rotation also ranked 13th in the AL in ERA . Price will front a rotation that , absent additional moves , will likely also include Wade Miley , Rick Porcello , Buchholz and Eduardo Rodriguez .
