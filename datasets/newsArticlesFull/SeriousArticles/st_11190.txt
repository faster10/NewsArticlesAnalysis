Rousey and Mayweather s sniping first started in July , after she won the ESPY for Best Fighter , for which Mayweather was also a nominee . She certainly has a few more years of experience than Rousey , and seem determined to avoid hitting the floor where she would nearly certainly have been destroyed by Rousey s bone breaking armbar . I think she can watch the tape and see what she needs to work on . 50 Cent posted a picture of the scene from Rocky IV in which Rocky holds a dying Apollo Creed in his arms , but the rapper replaced Creed with an image of Rousey after she was knocked out . A true champion can take a loss and bounce back . I wanted to avenge my loss .
