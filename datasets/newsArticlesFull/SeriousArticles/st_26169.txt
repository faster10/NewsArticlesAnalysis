Some 50 years later , the town became known for whale watching and preservation . Dolphin Fleet has been operating whale watch tours since the 1970s , and summer tourists crowd the ships during the summer . The trips feature naturalists trained by the town ' s Center for Coastal Studies , which works to preserve marine life off the coast of Cape Cod . The center offers programs year round to educate adults and children alike on the wonders of humpback and right whales , seals and the area ' s magical tide pools .
