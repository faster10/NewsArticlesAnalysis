" When we looked at these reports they ran the gamut memory loss , memory impairment , confusion and they were occurring anywhere from one day after initiation of the statin to years after initiation . " Egan said . " We could not identify if it was age specific because it was across a range of age groups . We did not see it occurring as a drug interaction , where patients were also taking other medications that were reacting with the statin to cause the confusional state . But we really want to get the message out there that we do not consider this a major problem , and certainly it does not outweigh the tremendous benefits of statin therapy . "
