The Golden Globes are the fun awards show and they are the fun awards show because they are utter , complete nonsense . The Hollywood Foreign Press , the body that elects the nominees and determines the winner , is small , batty , singular , and very lobby able . It loves that which is new , shiny , sexy and or very famous . It lauds both TV and film , leaving no time for categories not populated by very famous people , who show up in droves because they can get drunk and curse and touch each other s faces , all while exuding a low level disdain for an award they totally want . The Globes is the awards show that gives the talent the space to acknowledge that award shows are ridiculous , without actually harming their chances of winning other awards . ( You get drunk and curse and touch each other s faces at the Oscars at your own risk . )
