COP21 stands for 21st Conference of the Parties , that is the 21st meeting of the heads of states representing an executive committee of the United Nations Climate Change Convention that came out of the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 . In Rio , not only was climate change proclaimed a serious and urgent global problem , but significantly , the developed countries accepted their historical responsibility for the current state of affairs , having been producing greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution . Many have since reneged this historical responsibility , and this has become a major point of contention .
