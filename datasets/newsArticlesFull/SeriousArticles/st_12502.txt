When did the collapse begin ? Maybe it was in late 2008 and early 2009 , when congressional Republicans decided to block anything Obama proposed . Maybe it was in 2010 , when they refused to compromise on health insurance reform or to agree on a plausible alternative . Maybe it was later , when they staged dozens of pointless votes to repeal the new law in its entirety , treating health care as a campaign issue rather than a problem to be solved . Maybe it was in the 2011 debt ceiling showdown , when they took the nation s credit rating hostage , or in 2013 , when they forced a federal shutdown to protest the health insurance law .
