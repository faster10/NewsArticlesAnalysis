A successful military strike on Iranian installations may degrade Iran ' s nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate Iran ' s nuclear capabilities . Iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability . A deal between the P5 1 ( the United States , China , France , Russia , United Kingdom and Germany ) and Iran is expected to include a 10 year ( or more ) " sunset provision " that is much longer than the period it will take Iran to get its program back on track in case of an Israeli attack .
