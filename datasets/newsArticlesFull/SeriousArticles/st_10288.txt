We paused at an overlook with a view west to the Hudson River , and saw ships heading north , seeking safe waters . In the open waters off Long Island , waves are projected to reach 40 feet or higher , and even in New York Bay they might crest at five or six feet . Conditions would be calmer further upstream . What impressed me was the large size of the wakes that the ships made as they rushed against the outgoing tide . The ships that travel upriver usually wait for an incoming tide to carry them . But these ships could afford no delay .
