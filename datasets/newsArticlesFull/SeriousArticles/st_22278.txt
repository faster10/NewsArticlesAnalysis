Denver Broncos : ? Just how much the Broncos needed a playoff bye was evident at Thursday ' s practice , when several front line players were held out of the workout , including linebacker Brandon Marshall , safety T . J . Ward , cornerack Chris Harris Jr . , linebacker DeMarcus Ware and tight end Owen Daniels . Of that group , Ware is the biggest question mark with a left knee injury . Marshall , Ward , Harris and Daniels are all expected to be in uniform for the Broncos in the Jan . 17 playoff opener , but Ware ' s status will bear watching in the coming week . ? Jeff Legwold
