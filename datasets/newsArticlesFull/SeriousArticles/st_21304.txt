My story is really not much different from millions of other Americans . Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America . They wanted better for their children than for themselves . That remains the dream of all of us , and in this country we have seen time and again that that dream is achievable . Today , we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory . During anxious times , it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices emphasis mine . We must resist that temptation . No one who is willing to work hard , abide by our laws , and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country .
