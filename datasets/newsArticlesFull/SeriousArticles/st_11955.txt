If Cruz and Clinton win the nominations , Clinton would win 38 percent of the vote against 25 percent for Cruz and Bloomberg at 10 percent . Rubio and Ohio Gov . John Kasich each have 11 percent . And , of course , basic probability theory says that the odds of both Mr Trump and Mr Sanders being nominated are far less than the chances of either one of them being chosen . That leaves just nine percent of Americans who say they ' d definitely vote for Trump and 14 percent who say they ' d consider it as an independent candidate . The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percent for the full sample and 6 . 5 percent for the primary results .
