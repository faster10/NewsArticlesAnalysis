Hallelujah ! The president also released a report detailing the failures that allowed a man to very nearly kill 300 people on Christmas Day , he has ordered the government to enhance screening and detection , to increase the use of federal air marshals and to improve the dissemination and integration of intelligence . In short , our president is taking his responsibility to protect us more seriously than his political instinct to protect his own backside . What a change , what a relief , what a difference .
