The prime minister defended retaining contact with Russia pointing out relations were needed for the Syrian talks to succeed . Speaking in Davos , Cameron said : Obviously we have real difficulties with our relationship with Russia because of what has happened , and it s right that we take the action we announced yesterday . But when it comes to Syria , difficult as it is , we have to discuss this issue with them . Because the crisis in Syria will only be solved when all of the players recognise that it s in their interest to have a settlement .
