Indiana ( 6 ) , West Virginia ( 7 ) and Notre Dame ( 8 ) will be bloodied . All three teams have played themselves into a prominent place in their respective leagues ? the Hoosiers are 8 1 and tied for first in the Big Ten , the Mountaineers are 6 2 and tied for first in the Big 12 , and the Fighting Irish are 6 3 and tied for third in the Atlantic Coast Conference . But now comes the hard part . Indiana has played the easiest league schedule in the Big Ten to date according to Ken Pomeroy , and now will close with six of its last nine games against likely NCAA tournament teams ? including Iowa twice . West Virginia , which has lost three of its past five , has seven games remaining against likely tourney teams , including consecutive Tuesday trips to Iowa State , Kansas and Texas and a regular season finale at Baylor . Pomeroy lists Notre Dame as an underdog in its next five games : at Miami , North Carolina , at Clemson , Louisville , at Georgia Tech . The Irish play just two home games this month .
