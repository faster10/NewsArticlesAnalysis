In fact , there s every reason to believe that this is what Carson is counting on . It s no secret that many of the candidates in the Republican presidential primary are not really running for office so much as they are exploiting the free airtime to build their brand . The end goal for many of these candidates is not the White House , but book sales , speaking fees , ? or maybe job offers from Fox News . In some cases , they may even go the Sarah Palin route , starting a PAC ? that fundraises on the claim that it s going to elect real conservatives to office , while mostly just being a way to funnel money to yourself and your buddies .
