Just a month ago , Modi ? steadfastly refused to mention Nehru in ? his speech at the India Africa forum summit even though the African leaders were gratuitous in paying tribute to India ' s first PM in cementing the relationship . So what changed in the interim ? One suspects BJP ' s defeat in the Bihar elections is one of the major reasons behind this change in tactics . The air of invincibility that ? Modi enjoyed , even after the Delhi debacle , is now gone . The ? BJP can ' t just win elections by having ? Modi turn up and whip up a mass frenzy . What it will need is strong groundwork and the ability to show tangible results on the ground . For that BJP needs the Parliament to function so that crucial bills like the ? GST pass . But the ? BJP is currently a hopeless minority in the Rajya Sabha . So it needs the Congress ' help to get crucial bills through . PM Modi ' s outreach can be looked at that context , as a way to mend fences with Congress .
