The chancellor s hopeless offers of assistance extend into the distance . He has also come up with the idea of allowing local politicians to somehow protect adult social care ? for elderly people , as far as anyone understands it ? by putting up council tax by up to 2 , and far too much of the media has fallen for the idea that this represents something credible . In Liverpool , the full 2 hike would raise ? 3 . 2m a year , but the city s annual social care bill is ? 172m . Even the government s plans to eventually give councils ? 1 . 5bn for social care via the so called Better Care Fund woefully fail to meet the scale of a mounting problem . The research charity the Health Foundation reckons that Britain s care gap will be ? 6bn by 2020 even if he is lucky , both of Osborne s measures would barely scrape together half that sum .
