Craig Thomas : We ' ve talked here and there about letting the audience see the mother before Ted . Would that be fascinating or let some air out of the balloon ? We were scared of it for a long time , but this past season , it came up , and it just fit in so well . Ultimately we view it like we ' ve been honing in on this mother mystery for so long . In season one , it was like a shot of planet earth from outer space . And we ' ve honed in and honed in and honed in , and we look at season nine as like now we ' re down to Google street view . We ' ve gone from a super wide shot to super microscopic tight , and it just felt right to see the mother ' s face and to give the audience that gift and that knowledge . There was something exciting about getting a little bit of her before Ted ever does . There was something that we felt like this audience who has stuck with us for all of these years we wanted to reward them with that .
