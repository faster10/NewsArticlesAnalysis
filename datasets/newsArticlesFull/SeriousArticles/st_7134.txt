Capuchin monkeys used as pets are typically torn away from their mothers at birth , whereas in the wild , they would naturally spend several months , if not years , by their mother s side . Capuchin monkeys are intelligent , curious , and highly social animals who naturally live in large groups . A human home denies them mental stimulation and opportunities for social interaction with other monkeys , which can lead to boredom and depression . Monkeys are wild animals , and as such , they can become frustrated , aggressive , and difficult to control as they get older ? and they can and will bite humans , Peet wrote .
