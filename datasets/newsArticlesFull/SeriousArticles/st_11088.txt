It is likely that the strains of a 13 day , seven game road trip finally caught up to the Warriors , especially due to the effort they expended in Friday ' s win over the Celtics . They fought back from several significant Bucks leads and trailed by three points entering the fourth quarter , but team wide fatigue saw Luke Walton turn to an early fourth quarter lineup with no consistent scorers and iffy spacing . Milwaukee began the final period on a 13 3 run and never looked back , absorbing the reintroduction of Stephen Curry , Draymond Green , and other key Warriors with little trouble . Thompson had little to give all night as he attempted to come back from a sprained ankle sustained earlier in the week ( 4 of 14 FG and 2 of 7 3FG , most of which missed short ) , and Golden State missed the presence of Harrison Barnes ( missing his eighth consecutive game with his own ankle sprain ) on a night when Andre Iguodala struggled ( 1 of 9 FG ) . Curry and Green were both fine overall , but that wasn ' t enough given the deficiencies elsewhere .
