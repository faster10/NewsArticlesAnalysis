Trump decided to walk his fans through this narrative on a series of indoor tennis courts in an upscale town in southern New Hampshire . He claimed 5 , 000 people were packed under the tents , both here and at an overflow set of green courts next door . ( The fire code document caps both rooms at a combined 3 , 000 , and there were open spaces in both spaces . ) That doesn t diminish his crowd prowess . There were fire pits places along the security lines , to keep supporters warm as they snaked through a parking lot . Tremendous ! Trump gushes .
