He added , " We chose to activate Safety Check in Paris because we observed a lot of activity on Facebook as the events were unfolding . In the middle of a complex , uncertain situation affecting many people , Facebook became a place where people were sharing information and looking to understand the condition of their loved ones . . . . This activation will change our policy around Safety Check and when we activate it for other serious and tragic incidents in the future . We want this tool to be available whenever and wherever it can help . We will learn a lot from feedback on this launch "
