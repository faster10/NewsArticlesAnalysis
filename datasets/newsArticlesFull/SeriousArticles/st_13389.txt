I think that part of what that scene is about is the violence inflicted on Glenn , but from a bigger perspective , I think it ' s really about his interactions with Nicholas . There ' s been a dynamic in the show since season one the Rick Shane dilemma and what I love about last night ' s episode is the fact that , watching Rick in the RV , he was Shane that was not Rick from season one , that ' s someone who ' s gone full Bernthal . He wasn ' t asking questions about who those people were outside his car , he picked up a friggin ' assault rifle and mowed them down without thinking twice . That Rick didn ' t exist in season one . . . he ' s really inhabiting that space , and Glenn has never gone there . And so in some ways , what I see last night as , he ' s always embraced the kinder , better Rick , the one who believes in everybody ' s humanity . He has forgiven and embraced and given Nicholas every opportunity in the show to do the right thing , and almost at every point along the way , has paid the price for it . I feel like , regardless of what happened to Glenn , he paid a tremendous price for having been human to Nicholas , and that , to me , from an emotional point of view whether or not Glenn is alive or dead or something else the Glenn that we knew , the one that believed in the better side of humanity , I think is dead .
