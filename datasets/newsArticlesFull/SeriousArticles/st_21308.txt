Just when the darkness seems to have gripped Anti , Rihanna gradually throws some light into the mix . Never Ending channels Dido s Thank You subtly into its acoustic melody , while Love on the Brain sounds like a lost girl group classic unearthed from Phil Spector s private archives .

Older fans will clutch these songs as comforting reminders of the good girl before she went bad , but Rihanna herself sounds less convincing in these moments .
