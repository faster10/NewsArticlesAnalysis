Panthers : Middle linebacker Kuechly . Arizona ' s best weapon at wide receiver is Fitzgerald , who lined up 51 percent in the slot this season . Look for nickel corner Cortland Finnegan to get help from Kuechly in defending Fitzgerald when he goes there . Kuechly had a plus 4 . 1 grade in coverage this past week against Seattle , according to Pro Football Focus . Russell Wilson had a 0 . 0 passer rating when attacking Kuechly . While Kuechly had a pick six that was impressive , no play was more impressive than late in the fourth quarter when he came out of nowhere to knock away a pass intended for wide receiver Doug Baldwin . Although it turned into a 70 yard touchdown catch for Atlanta during the regular season because of an amazing catch by Julio Jones , Kuechly was step for step with arguably the league ' s top wide receiver 52 yards from the line of scrimmage . Kuechly ' s not technically a member of the secondary , but he plays a huge role in pass defense .
