The S Pen works in other apps besides S Note , of course . I liked using it to crop photos and perform touch up work in Photoshop Touch , which Samsung throws in for free . The tablet includes a program that points you towards pen friendly programs in Google ' s Play store most of the ones I tried didn ' t support pressure sensitivity , but the S Pen is still a plus in any program that involves handwritten note taking , sketching or any gesture that ' s tough to perform accurately with a fingertip .
