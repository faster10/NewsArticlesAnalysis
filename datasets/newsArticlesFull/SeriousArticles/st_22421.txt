The inherent joke is , how could one offend the stately yet bawdy Dame Helen ? In fact , Gervais jibes , such as 2011 s It s going to be a night of partying and heavy drinking ? or as Charlie Sheen calls it : breakfast , aren t half as hard hitting as what John Oliver says on his HBO show . And Don Rickles would famously tell Frank Sinatra , Make yourself comfortable , Frank ? hit somebody . So perhaps it s not so much what Gervais says but the way he says it ? as Robert Downey Jr . described it , hugely mean spirited with mildly sinister undertones .
