Enhancing political mutual trust to cement the foundation for cooperation . Mutual trust ensures success while distrust spells failure . This is true for state to state relations as well as interpersonal relationship . Countries along the ancient Silk Road have built trust , deepened friendship and enhanced cooperation through their exchanges stretching over 2 , 000 years . Over the past 45 years of diplomatic relations , China and Iran have enhanced traditional friendship and achieved fruitful results in practical cooperation despite difficulties and obstacles . Today , we need all the more to build on this positive spirit to step up policy communication , accommodate each other ' s concerns , build more consensus and lay a more solid foundation for our cooperation . We will establish a comprehensive strategic partnership and increase exchanges between political parties , legislatures and at the sub national levels . We will deepen our cooperation under multilateral frameworks such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia ( CICA ) and the UN , to steadily increase political mutual trust and substantiate our strategic relationship .
