" I think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host , " says Harris , who previously celebrated Broadway ' s biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011 . " In the Emmys and in observing the Oscars , it ' s a bunch of individuals that hardly know each other that all work in their own business bubbles , and I think the opposite is true on Broadway . Most everyone is a ) thrilled to be there , b ) even more thrilled to be nominated but c ) and I think most importantly , they all know and are supportive of each other , so you end up with this great evening where it ' s not a lot of sour grapes .
