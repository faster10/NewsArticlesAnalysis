Why is that ? First , many believe that Cruz would be destined to not just lose to Hillary Clinton , but lose in spectacular fashion . He has always presented himself as an uncompromising ideologue , and his theory of the election is that rather than appeal to independent voters , the path to victory lies in offering such a rock ribbed conservative vision that millions of new conservative voters who haven ' t made it to the polls in earlier years will come out for him . Experienced hands believe the result of that strategy would be a repeat of the 1964 election , when Lyndon Johnson trounced Barry Goldwater by 23 percentage points and won 486 electoral votes . Even worse , Cruz ' s extreme brand of conservatism could turn off voters to the whole party . As a Republican lobbyist told The New York Times , " Trump won ' t do long lasting damage to the GOP coalition . Cruz will . " Or as Bob Dole , who emphasized that he actually very much hoped Jeb Bush would win , said on Wednesday , if Cruz is the nominee , " we ' re going to have wholesale losses in Congress and state offices and governors and legislatures .
