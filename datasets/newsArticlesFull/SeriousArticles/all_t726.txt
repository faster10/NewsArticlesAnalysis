Vince Gilligan: Stop throwing pizzas at "Breaking Bad" house
"Breaking Bad" watchers will remember that moment in season 3 when Walter White (Bryan Cranston) throws a pizza in frustration and it lands, perfectly, on the roof of his home. Apparently, some fans have tried to recreate that moment at the house used as the White family home on the show, and series creator Vince Gilligan is not happy at all about their pizza-throwing antics.PlayVideoCBS This MorningVince Gilligan: "Breaking Bad" was "lightning in a bottle"The famed creator of AMC's "Breaking Bad" discusses the finale of the show, its alternate endings, how Charlie Rose became a performer on the sho..."They're throwing pizzas on roofs and stuff like that. Let me tell you: There is nothing funny or original or cool about throwing pizzas on this lady's roof. It is just not funny. It's been done before. You're not the first," Gilligan said during a podcast for his "Breaking Bad" spinoff, "Better Call Saul."He added that some of those fans have also been rude to the homeowners, whom Gilligan described as "the two nicest people in the world," when they've asked people to stay off the property."People live in these houses, and they are trying to go about their lives day in and day out like we all are," Gilligan added.Actor Jonathan Banks, who plays enforcer Mike Ehrmantraut on "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul," echoed Gilligan's sentiments on the podcast, but channeled his no-nonsense character while doing so."If I catch you doing it, I will hunt you down," Banks said.
