EB : ? I think it ' s very hard to try to establish policy similarities between Sanders and Trump for two reasons . Number one , when you actually sit down and look at their policies , they are usually worlds apart . The ones that they are similar on opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership for example a lot of candidates are similar on . So yes , both Donald and Bernie were against the TPP . Hilary also came out against TPP . So did a lot of the other GOP politicians in the field . It ' s just not unique and you ' re not coming upon anything revealing when you say both of them are against TPP for example . So I think the majority of their policies are different and the ones that are similar are just kind of similar for typical reasons . And then I think the other reason people point out a similarity between Sanders and Trump is because ? Trump has a long history of being extraordinarily vague . So he doesn ' t really have policies . He ' ll just say ' We ' re going to to great on that . ' Or ' We ' re going to do good on that . We ' re going to beat that . We ' re going to win . ' And Sanders will also say we ' re going to take care of the American people vis a vis single payer health care or something like that . And when you look at them side by side and Trump says everyone will be taken care of and Sanders says we ' re going to cover everyone under national health insurance , they can look very similar . But you actually don ' t know what you ' re getting with Trump . And when you press him , he usually will come out and say his policy is similar to kind of a Republican establishment one typically . ?
