Why are other greener products still more expensive sometimes ? It boils down to the simple laws of supply and demand . Any new innovative product , whether it is " greener " or not , costs extra initially . It costs money to research and develop the product and to build the factories and supply chains it takes to make the product . Manufacturers try to recoup those costs as quickly as possible during the initial sales of the product . As demand increases , however , additional manufacturing efficiencies economies of scale begin to emerge that permit the prices to fall . In addition , high prices attract competitors with similar products , and the additional competition helps force prices lower .
