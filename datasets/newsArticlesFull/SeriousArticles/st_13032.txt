Kathleen Gerson , a sociologist at New York University interviewed young men and women about their perceptions of work family issues before the real juggle began . She learned that both men and women were planning on equally sharing their work and home requirements . However , there was a persistent gender gap between these young , still childless men and women . Their " Plan Bs " varied widely : Young men thought that if the equality ideal failed , their wives would be the ones to cut back on work . Young women agreed . Which brings us back to glass ceilings and shattered dreams .
