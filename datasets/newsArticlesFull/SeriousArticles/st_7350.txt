Here ' s the second problem with the hopes of the establishment : Who ' s the seasoned statesman they have in mind ? Is it Jeb Bush , who couldn ' t seem to figure out whether invading Iraq was a good idea , and has run the most disappointing campaign we ' ve seen in decades ? Is it Marco Rubio , the 44 year old senator who thinks we ' re in a " clash of civilizations " with ISIS , as though the group constituted its own civilization ? Is it Lindsey Graham , polling at the asterisk level , who is constantly peeing his pants over every threat , real or imagined , and wants to launch almost a full scale re invasion of Iraq ( and Syria ) because " there ' s a 9 11 coming " if we don ' t ? Is it Ted Cruz , who thinks we should bar all Muslim refugees from Syria and accept only Christians ? Is it Mike Huckabee , who says that the Paris attacks show why we should trash the nuclear agreement with Iran ?
