We all know that penalties and fines have had no effect on Burfict . He has been penalized 12 times in his career for unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness , the second most for any player since 2012 , and fined more than 200 , 000 . An ejection might not have a career changing impact on his behavior , but the threat of it might have curbed his edge enough to protect Brown on Saturday night . Over time , if nothing else , more frequent ejections will take players off the field who are on the path to playing the way Burfict did Saturday night .
