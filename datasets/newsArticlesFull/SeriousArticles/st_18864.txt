Between 1994 and 1995 , the Russians bombed the Chechen capital , Grozny , in what was then the heaviest bombing campaign in Europe since the second world war , with heavy civilian casualties . Grozny was bombed again in the 1999 2000 winter siege : most deaths and injuries were civilian the capital was devastated by tank and aerial bombardment , ballistic missiles , fuel air explosives , and thermobaric weapon warheads . These last are particularly horrific . First used in Vietnam , they have the longest blast wave and destructive force of any known weapon , destroying unreinforced buildings , killing and injuring people by inflicting severe burns , rupturing the lungs and internal organs , causing suffocation and severe concussion . And yes , Assad is alleged to have used these in Syria , too .
