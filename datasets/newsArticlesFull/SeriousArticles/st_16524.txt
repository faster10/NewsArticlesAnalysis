The Walking Dead ? sometimes struggles with balancing action and character . Occasionally , it gets way too wrapped up in the action and the violence , too engrossed in the zombie guts and gore to spend time really understanding the people who are fighting them . Starting in season four , after the Governor ' s assault on the prison , the show found a renewed interest in character driven episodes , spending a solid hour getting into the mind of Daryl or Rick or Carl or Carol or Tyreese or Beth ( RIP ) . That commitment to character building ? has paid off in spades , putting the show on the track it is now , where zombie violence and characters that feel real can live in harmony .
