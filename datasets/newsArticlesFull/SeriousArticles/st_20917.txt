Just hoping to see the beast one last time . Could be watching the last 4 quarters of him in a hawks uniform . Maybe 12 if everything breaks right for us . Also , the haters that are chiming in on chipper down in Santa Clara remember . There was a college coach that no one thought would work in the NFL about 5 years ago . His record . 4 out of five playoffs appearances . 9 3 in the playoffs 2 NFC championships and one world championship . Pretty decent run and I love him . I d have his baby . That s Pete Carroll . So anyone saying chipper can t win don t get to excited . You never know . I m just glad all signs are pointing towards kaperchoke staying which as a hawks is fun . He likes giving us 2 wins a year .
