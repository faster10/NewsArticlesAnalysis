Increased attacks by Taliban on government installations , their offensive to capture Afghan cities as well as the presence of IS in Afghanistan in the shape of Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are real threats to the Afghan government . There is a strong likelihood that Afghanistan might drift towards an unending conflict and struggle for ascendency among different power players after the departure of US NATO troops . To prevent this horrible scenario from re emerging , Ghani s government has no alternative but to join hands with Pakistan in forestalling the impending disaster . Similarly Pakistan also is in desperate need of Afghan cooperation in taking the war on terror to its logical conclusion , implementing its economic initiatives including CPEC and achieving its strategic objective in the region .
