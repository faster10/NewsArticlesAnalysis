? Strange to watch Peyton Manning and think this is his 17th and final battle coming up with Tom Brady . As we know , if he has to win the game for Denver . don t see that happening . If you look at where the Pats are banged up ( linebacker ) . pretty easy to guess that Denver will run the ball ( as they did to the tune if 179 yard and 3 TD s in first meeting ) with CJ Anderson and Ronnie Hillman and have Peyton throw off of that . If it were me , I would start Brock Osweiler . But then again , if Manning falters then you have a good player coming off the bench .
