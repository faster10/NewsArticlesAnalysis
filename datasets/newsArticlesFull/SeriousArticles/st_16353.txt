Iran itself holds title to an estimated 80 billion of international reserves . The Kirk Menendez sanctions passed by Congress at the end of last year , then reluctantly accepted by the Obama administration , have effectively denied Iran the use of these funds . Any bank anywhere in the world that deals with Iran will be cut off from the international payments system . If Iran earns 1 billion inside a sanctions busting country , it must either buy goods worth 1 billion inside that country or else find a way to physically move that much cash assuming the sanctions busting country has that much physical cash , which few do . ( A billion dollars in cash would fill all the carrying space on a large truck . )
