Crais : It could be any of the above , but it ' s usually an image , almost always driven by a character moment . In " Taken , " it was the notion of Krista Morales and her hunger to know more about her mother ' s experience that night in the desert . I just saw her . It was literally my first image in the book . I saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open eyed wonder , trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country . All I had was her face in the moonlight , staring out there , and I just knew whatever she ' s looking for , I want to find . That was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book .
