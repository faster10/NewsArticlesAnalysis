1 . Video recording capabilities . With the swipe of a finger , you can record a quick video . With another swipe , you can trim your recording . With yet another swipe , you can email it or upload it to your YouTube account . Even when it ' s transferred over AT T ' s 3G network , the A V quality is rather impressive . Based on my first mobile YouTube upload test , I know I ' ve sold a few more people on the 3GS . Apple seems to have integrated some kind of anti shake feature into its video processing , too .
