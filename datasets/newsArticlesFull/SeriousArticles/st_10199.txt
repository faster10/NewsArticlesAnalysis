The demo devices were all running the new version of Apple ' s mobile operating system , iOS 6 , which has Apple ' s first Google free maps app . The Flyover feature turns cities into interactive , 3 D images . You can drag a finger to spin around a skyscraper and zoom in and out of the city from any angle , not just the straight down satellite view . There is a bit of lag on the loading time when you move to a new area , but somehow the features still feel shockingly fast . Flyover is more fun than functional , but perhaps the stunning graphics and turn by turn directions will distract consumers from what ' s newly missing from the Maps app , like the very useful public transit directions feature .
