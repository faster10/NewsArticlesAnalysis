I d ask Trump whether he really means to treat all Muslims , regardless of their citizenship as Turks or Indonesians or whatever ? except perhaps U . S . citizens returning home from their military service or travel ? as nationals of the Islamic Caliphate , the amorphous and self declared government with which we are arguably at war , even without a declaration by Congress , let alone UN recognition of the Caliphate as a nation . In other words , I d ask Trump whether he really wants to accord that kind of significance and national recognition , of all things , to the territory in Syria or Iraq ruled by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi s bloody sword .
