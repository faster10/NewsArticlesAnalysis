Theme of the week : It s all about the South . For the second straight season , the South will come down to the final week , and it will come down to a rivalry game . It doesn t get any more simple than this : The winner of the USC UCLA game will win the division and face Stanford in the Pac 12 championship game . The Bruins have won all three games in the rivalry since Jim Mora took over in 2012 . And interestingly enough , he s seen three different USC head coaches . This week will be his fourth in four years . His Bruins have bested Lane Kiffin , topped Ed Orgeron and beat back Steve Sarkisian . Can Clay Helton get the Trojans over the hump ? And if he does , is a spot in the Pac 12 title game enough to drop the interim from his title ?
