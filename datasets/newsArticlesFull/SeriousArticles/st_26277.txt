All that sounds right up Modi ' s alley . The great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis , the likes of which he largely escaped in 2014 . How will he react to a major skirmish with Pakistan ? How will he balance his desire to boost Chinese trade with fears about Beijing ' s growing assertiveness in the region ? And what will he do if , in a big global crisis , he is pushed to choose sides between any of Russia , China and the United States ? Can India remain everyone ' s friend ? Will Modi develop a values based vision of India ' s place in the world ?
