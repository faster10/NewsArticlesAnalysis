So , yes , I will be looking forward to this Saturday ' s debate . The conditions seem perfect for a real political debate between two candidates who differ from each other on many key issues . Both viable candidates are now at the top of their game out on the campaign trail . With only three candidates on the stage , we ' ll have a good opportunity to hear what they have to say , in much greater detail than is possible with a crowded stage . We have a frontrunner already commanding majority support among Democratic voters , an underdog who isn ' t all that far behind ( flipping 10 percent from Clinton to Sanders would put them even ) , and one outsider candidate with virtually no chance of being at the top of the Democratic ticket . No matter who wins the Democratic nomination , however , debates like this will be excellent practice for when he or she has to face the eventual Republican nominee who will be hamstrung , by the softball nature of what passes for debates among Republicans .
