Colwell : Having done an enormous amount of research showing the ecology of the cholera bacterium , ( we found ) it was definitely tied to plankton . The cholera bacteria is part of their natural flora . It occurred to us that by simple filtration to remove the plankton , we would filter about 99 of the bacteria , leaving just a few suspended in the water . So then , we hypothesized , we could reduce cholera significantly by educating women who collect water for their household to use cloth filtration .
