I ' m pleased that this legislation is being introduced , Sanders said in the statement . As I have said for many months now , we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up . Sanders noted that ? the new legislation , proposed by U . S . Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Representative Adam Schiff of California , would leave in place the parts of the 2005 law that require child safety locks and ban armor piercing ammunition . " Those were important provisions that I did support , " said the senator . Sanders added that he will support the Blumenthal Schiff bill but would " work to make sure it includes a provision " requiring the government to monitor the impact on " small gun stores in rural America that serve the hunting community .
