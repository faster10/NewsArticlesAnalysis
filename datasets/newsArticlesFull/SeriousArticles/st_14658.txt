Soon , my husband made more money and mommy life got even better . My kids went to part time preschool for a few hours in the morning and spent the afternoons riding their trikes in the street of a nice quiet neighborhood filled with kids and other stay at home moms . They helped me shop for organic groceries that I would bring home to make a dinner from scratch . I taught them to swim in our pool , taught my daughter to read and my son to count . My mommy life was perfect . There were definitely tantrums and messes , but I was very happy with most of the pieces of my life .
