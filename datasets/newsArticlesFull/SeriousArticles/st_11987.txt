It is entirely reasonable at a time like this to reconsider the policies that make us safe and to consider any steps to minimize the likelihood of further bloodshed . But it is also essential to proceed carefully and rationally and not to succumb to the hysteria that sometimes accompanies national emergencies . A nation that detained its Japanese citizens after Pearl Harbor , and numerous Muslim citizens after the World Trade Center attacks on 9 11 , should remember the shame it felt in the aftermath of those misguided , racist actions . A nation that only this year felt compelled to end the bulk collection of Americans ' phone records after the program was revealed by Edward Snowden should be careful not to reverse course recklessly in a futile attempt to know everything , everywhere . A nation that went to war in Iraq in part based on an assertion that the regime there had cooperated with Al Qaeda should be a bit chastened as it considers its global strategy . In short , we should forge our response through prudence and the wisdom gained from experience , not fear .
