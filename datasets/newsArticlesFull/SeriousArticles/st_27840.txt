Levitt emphasized : However , we conduct as much training in advance as possible so the instance of confusion on caucus night can be held to a minimum . To that end , we will continue pre recruiting chairs until 1 February , and we expect to fill our slots in the final days . In the rare instances where a temporary chair is not identified ahead of time , someone with experience and knowledge caucusing will step forward to run the caucus . The caucus materials provided to our county chairs contain precinct packets with detailed , step by step instructions for the business of the caucus as well as the reporting process for results . The IDP Iowa Democratic party also has a fully staffed helpline all night to answer any and all questions on the caucus process .
