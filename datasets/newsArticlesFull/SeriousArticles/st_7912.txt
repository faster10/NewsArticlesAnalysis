While political scientists and policy gurus are divided on the definition of terrorism , there are a few points of general convergence : most agree that terrorism is politically motivated , violently executed , ideologically sustained and publicity reliant . This is what Daesh is . This is Anders Behring Breivik , Boko Haram , Al Shabaab , Ashin Wirathu , and Pierre Nkurunziza . These are the markers of their activity immaterial of their religion or ideology they are terrorists , plain and simple . They are similar in their action , immaterial of their belief systems .
