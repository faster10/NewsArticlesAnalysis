I have spent years , it seems , watching Police Supt . McCarthy at news conferences lamenting the lack of cooperation by civilians , which he claims has hindered law enforcement ' s efforts to curtail the gun violence on city streets . Well , his witnesses this time were men in blue and it took 13 months to charge the shooter . If police were cooperating , McCarthy , Emanuel and Alvarez have done them an injustice by waiting for more than a year to charge any crime . If the code of silence prevailed , which is certainly the public perception now , I have yet to hear McCarthy express any outrage .
