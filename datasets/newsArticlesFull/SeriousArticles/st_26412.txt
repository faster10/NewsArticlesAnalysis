In my own study I compared two teachers recovering after witnessing a school shooting . One was able to return within a week and had extended support from district and local mental health professionals for some time . A mental health professional checked in on him weekly , even a year later . The other teacher had no such support . She was not even offered counseling . Her world , demonstrating van der Kolk ' s assertions , descended into defensiveness and health problems . She was unable to function after a month back on the job .
