Rohde ' s jewelry line ranges from chunky bangles in cartoon colors to striking but ethereal pieces , such as a cluster of rose pink shards jutting out from the wrist . An iridescent blue ring with two bug eye " gems " foregrounds the artist ' s sense of humor , while a pair of shimmering earrings with scalloped edges is both delicate and flashy . Resin allows multiple color changes to be incorporated into one piece , so that a ring graduates from milky white to translucent pink , and a cuff shows shades of blue seeping into yellow .
