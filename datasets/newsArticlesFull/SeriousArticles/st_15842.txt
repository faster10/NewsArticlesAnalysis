In Africa , electing fresh , new leaders is not something people do often . Consider this : The 10 current longest serving African leaders have held their offices for a total of 252 years . Three of these leaders ( Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea , and Omar el Bashir of Sudan ) have not been invited to the summit because they are in poor standing with the United States . Of those receiving an invite , Rwanda ' s Paul Kagame and Uganda ' s Yoweri Museveni were unwisely hailed as " new African leaders " during the Clinton administration , while others came to power when Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office .
