PP : That doesn t happen very often , because this is a military command , after all , where people are taught to obey orders and not to speak out publicly . It didn t surprise me at all , quite frankly , because there was clearly a strong interest on the part of this military command , as would be true of any military command , to show that it s getting the mission accomplished . And , so there s a displeasure and a discomfort with any kind of judgements and evidence that would indicate the contrary . . We ve had a history of this , here in the U . S . . During the Vietnam war we had some cases that were very similar to this , with regard to attention between high level commands and what lower level analysts were saying or what was actually going on . So , I think , in terms of the basic facts , probably , there s a pretty good grasp of what s going on , and the military commanders know what s going on it s more a matter of how do we couch this judgement or that judgement , so as to make it appear that we re making progress or not making progress .
