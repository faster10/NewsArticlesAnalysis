Luckily my son s babysitter is a university student , so she was free to come and look after him while I worked from home . But by Monday morning , it wasn t only the Metro which was paralyzed . Some trams and 15 bus lines were also suspended . Those buses that were running had a reduced service . It wasn t clear why , but one driver told my son s babysitter that some staff had refused to come in because they were worried for their safety . So it took her over an hour to complete a journey which usually takes half that time .
