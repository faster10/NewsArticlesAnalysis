You re always looking for guys to grab the opportunity and embrace it and go , McFadden said . One of the things that we need to do as coaches is try to give guys different opportunities and see who s going to do that . It was great to see . I think he certainly did that in the role that he had mostly as a third down guy early on . I think you saw some really positive runs that he made after the catch in the game leading up to the Giants game . He really took full advantage of the chances we gave him and got better and better over the course of the game and really had a big impact on our offense . I keep bringing this up , but the way he finished runs . Go back and watch that tape and how he finished runs and was always playing downhill . That makes an impact on the defense .
