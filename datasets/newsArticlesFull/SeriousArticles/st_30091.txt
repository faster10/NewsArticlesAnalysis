" We got a team of experienced players , veteran players , that understand the moment or moments , " Blatt said . " We got a great leader in LeBron . We got some great guys like James Jones , who really , really understands what it is to be a team that wants to compete at the highest level . It ' s not about what I said , it ' s about what they did . I thought those guys came with a real purpose tonight . You saw it on them . You saw it in their approach . We lost some ground there in the third quarter , but first half , we were sharp and we were aggressive and we were physical and we were pretty tough . It ' s the guys . It ' s not what I ' m saying , it ' s what they ' re doing . "
