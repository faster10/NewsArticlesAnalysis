2 . Help the homeless and the less fortunate . Thanksgiving is all about giving thanks for what you have and helping those that don ' t have as much as you . This Thanksgiving enjoy giving the homeless and less fortunate your time and money . My family and I have spent the last Thanksgiving donating our time by helping several families into new homes in partnership with a charity known as Path . Trust me when I say donating your time and money during the holidays and really help you feel the magic of the holiday spirit .
