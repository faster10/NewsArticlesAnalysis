Hari Vamadevan , regional manager , UK and West Africa , with DNV GL , an oil and gas industry service company , said everyone cooperating is the only way that production can be cut : It s not so much oversupply of OPEC , it s really the rest of the world , the Americans , the Russians . Also the lifting of sanctions in Iran , the growth of Libya , Iraq . All those are new growth in production . The Saudis are pretty much pumping at the same level they have done for quite a while and can probably pump a little bit higher . Their unit cost of production is lower , so they can keep pumping , so to some degree they will carry on . The impact on their own economy is like all economies that are based on oil and gas is they re seeing a big reduction in their income and they are going to have to borrow more to balance their economies .
