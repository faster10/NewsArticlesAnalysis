This is 2015 when it s completely okay for a grown man to cry ( probably not after watching Katti Batti ) , but it s no longer seen as something to be ashamed . That being said , it s probably not a good idea to start the waterworks on live TV as Ram Vilas Paswan s son in law completely lost it as his brother in law ( and Ram Vilas son ) Chirag got a party ticket instead of him . Sadhu bawled that Chirag was a failed Bollywood actor ( he debuted in a film with Kangana Ranaut in 2011 ) who wasn t a Dalit leader .
