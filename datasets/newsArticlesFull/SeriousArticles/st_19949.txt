Specifically , ask the faculty to teach four classes per semester instead of two or three . Build few buildings but utilize them extensively , including on Fridays , weekends and summer months . Have a least two faculty members for each administrator ( the ratio now is often one to one ) . Prohibit faculty from teaching trivial courses in their specialty . Do we really need courses on " Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame " taught to students who are clueless about Beethoven , Shakespeare and van Gogh ? Limit the pay of all employees to no more than that of the president of the United States or less . Could existing universities do this ? They haven ' t , so state governments might have to create new institutions from the ground up .
