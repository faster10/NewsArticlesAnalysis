Krall : I think it ' s a lot of luck . I think I started in a very good time . When I went to see that film " When Harry Met Sally , " and I heard Harry Connick playing the piano , I though there ' s somebody who ' s my age and he ' s playing the music that I love . And I felt like there was a kindred spirit and it inspired me to go , " I want to do exactly what he ' s doing . " And I still owe a lot of thanks to Harry . I ' ve only met him like a couple of times , but he ' s still a favorite artist of mine .
