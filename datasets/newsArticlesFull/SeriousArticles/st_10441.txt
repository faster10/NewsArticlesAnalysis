Back on shore , the Gasparilla Pirate Festival is an annual event not to be missed . At the end of January , locals and tourists take out their finest eyepatches and polish their hooks in an event named after the swashbuckling pirate Jose Gaspar , who prowled the waters off the state ' s western coast during the late 18th and early 19th centuries . While hundreds of boats clog the waterways surrounding downtown Tampa , thousands of people enjoy a parade on land . I hear a little drinking goes on too .
