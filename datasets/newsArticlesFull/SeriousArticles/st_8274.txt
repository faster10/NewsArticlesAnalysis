There also have been at least 12 suicides involving former NFL players during the last 25 years , including perennial Pro Bowl defenders Junior Seau and Dave Duerson within the last 14 months . According to the suing players , such tragedies are related to the league ' s negligence in fully explaining the health risk of concussions to players . Not only that , the suing players claim the league isn ' t allocating enough of its estimated 9 billion in total revenue each season toward the proper care of its current and former players suffering from head trauma and other football related injuries .
