The self inflicted downfall of Colin Kaepernick this season gave Gabbert the chance to start at quarterback again this week , and surprisingly , he was remarkably improved . Whilst his performance was nothing to write home about , Gabbert most importantly got his team the win , beating Atlanta 17 16 . Gabbert finished the game with a 60 per cent completion rating , as well as two touchdowns and two interceptions . Considering Gabbert s average completion percentage was just over 50 per cent in his rookie season , he has evidently improved . ?
