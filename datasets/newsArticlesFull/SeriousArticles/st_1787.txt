LaRowe says nannies may actually have an easier time disciplining because they ' re not the mom . " While nannies genuinely love the children in their care , they aren ' t ruled by emotions when setting boundaries . It may be more convenient to give in , but due to experience , they ' re aware of the consequences , " says LaRowe , adding that busy moms might try to reduce multitasking . " The simplest of child care tasks , like bathing , diaper changing or feeding , can provide wonderful bonding opportunities . "
