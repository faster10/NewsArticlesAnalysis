But Mr Corbyn , in his aspiration to run the country one day , should be wise enough to remove himself of his own accord . Even putting aside the suspect alliances of StW , pacifism is not the answer to all today s problems , just as it was not in 1938 . Sometimes the strong must defend the weak , and compromises be made . Even Diane Abbott , the shadow International Development Secretary , admitted on Question Time that it was right to bomb Isis in Iraq , in defence of the Yazidis threatened with genocide . She had voted against such action in September 2014 , as did Mr Corbyn . But such instinctive pacifism does not travel well outside a small cloister of ideological soul mates , as Ms Abbott came to realise on live TV . ?
