He had that smile , the backward hat , the joy for the game . The electricity for every Griffey at bat was unlike anything us Mariners fans had ever felt . I still vividly recall the first time I saw him play in person . My friend James and I drove home from college in Montana after our semester ended in May that rookie season . The way I remember it , we drove all night , stopped off at my parents ' house to say hello ( and maybe borrow a few dollars for tickets ) and headed down to the Kingdome . I ' d say we were running on fumes , but like Griffey we were 19 years old . We somehow ended up with seats a few rows behind the dugout .
