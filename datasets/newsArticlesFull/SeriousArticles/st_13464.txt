At issue is a part of the ACA known as risk corridors . As MSNBC s Aliyah Frumin explained a while back , the argument goes like this : Under Obamacare , insurance companies must sell policies to everyone equally , regardless of pre existing conditions , so there is a chance that some insurers could wind up with a larger than expected number of unhealthy customers . The risk corridor provision provides protections from that possibility until 2016 . The cost is covered by other insurance companies , which pay into the risk corridor fund when they set their own premiums much higher than was needed to cover their expenses .
