These are just mechanisms acting on government insurance , though . The Affordable Care Act has some measures that affect private spending as well . The excise tax is one of those . Starting in 2018 , plans that cost more than a certain amount will have a 40 tax levied on employers who provide them . Let ' s acknowledge that such taxes will absolutely be passed on to regular people , so it doesn ' t matter who is stuck with the bill at first . It ' s also worth acknowledging that the levels where the tax kicks in are really high ( 10 , 200 for an individual plan and 27 , 500 for a family ) . Even so , many believe that this will eventually be one of the strongest levers the Affordable Care Act contains to rein in spending in the future .
