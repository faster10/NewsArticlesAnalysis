Wiggins , who showed glimpses of jaw dropping talent last season , should get every opportunity to become Minnesota ' s go to scorer in 2015 16 . After playing in all 82 games a year ago , Wiggins made a concerted effort to add muscle to his 6 foot 8 frame over the summer . The 20 year old averaged 16 . 9 points per game as a rookie and could easily increase his nightly output this season with even a slight uptick in his shooting ( 43 . 7 percent from the floor in 2014 15 ) . It ' ll also be interesting to see if Wiggins can evolve into a more assertive player as an NBA sophomore , especially in late game situations . ? ?
