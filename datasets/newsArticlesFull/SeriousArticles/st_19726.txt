AH : Malaysia is very well established . I think that ' s a very mature market and they are one of , I would say , the pioneers of this industry . So there doesn ' t seem to be that much further room to grow in Malaysia . But Indonesia is largely untapped . I mean , the Indonesian government is moving in that direction . They have passed some legislation , I understand , to try and facilitate Islamic banking . And some of the Malaysian clients that I work with , the Malaysian banks , they see Indonesia as the last frontier for them to expand their operations and grow .
