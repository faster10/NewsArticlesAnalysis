He was a changeling . Ronnie never liked to stick with anything . We made one of the greatest hard rock heavy metal albums of all time with that first Montrose album , and then he didn ' t want to do that anymore . " Nah , nah , we ' ve got to have better songs , we ' ve got to change our image , that kind of music is out . " Boy , he was just laying it on us . Ronnie really liked to change immediately . We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band after one more album , 1974 ' s Paper Money , but I carried on with that " first Ronnie Montrose " I saw . What I learned from Ronnie Montrose , I still utilize today when I step on a stage . I try to keep the energy up and the entertainment high .
