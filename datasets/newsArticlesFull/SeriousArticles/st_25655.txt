The home of the Mexican national team and to club side America , the Azteca really is an iconic football arena . It is the only stadium to host two World Cup finals , in 1970 and 1986 and has played host to undoubtedly the two greatest goals in football history Carlos Alberto ( Brazil v Italy in 1970 ) and Diego Maradona ( Argentina v England in 1986 ) . With a capacity of 105 , 000 , it is the fifth largest stadium in the world . If a stadium could write an autobiography the Azteca would wipe the floor with everyone else !
