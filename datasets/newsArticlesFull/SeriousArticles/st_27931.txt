3 . No harm , no foul for Ben Carson and Donald Trump . The two frontrunners in this race are Trump and Carson ? at least that s what the polling said . But they definitely weren t the main attractions last night . Trump even went 28 minutes at one point without speaking . They didn t flop , but no one is raving or even talking about their largely absent performances . They made no errors , but there were no break out performances either . It s status quo for the two contenders at the top of the polls . Will it matter to voters ? We will be watching the next slate of polls very closely .
