I am here to close not just a chapter of my life but a whole book . At various points , Maggie turned her back on me but I won ' t do that to her today . " I wouldn ' t give her the satisfaction , " I think to myself , and I feel oddly nostalgic . There ' s a definite sense of loss . Or is it release ? Grief or relief ? Maybe both . When Labour Party leader John Smith died I was heartbroken and this is certainly not that . But I do have some things to thank her for . I feel determined to show her at least some of the respect in death that she didn ' t show me , my family , or my community in life . So I stand with dignity as a small crowd forms .
