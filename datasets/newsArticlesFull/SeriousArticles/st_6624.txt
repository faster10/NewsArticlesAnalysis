So what are conservatives to do ? Not many are in positions of authority at major universities . But conservatives have the ability to ? pardon the expression ? name and shame , to expose the causes of the current debacle . They can make common cause with figures like Dershowitz to urge honest intellectuals on campuses to stand their ground and teach without fear of giving offense . They can press university administrators not to resign but to stay and fight for academic freedom . They can provide models of civil and robust intellectual discourse ( whether in print , at think tanks or in the professions ) . And they can go into the lion s den ? speak on campus and engage with students . Whether welcomed there or not , conservatives have something students vitally need to witness ? intellectual vigor and diversity and , most of all , civility .
