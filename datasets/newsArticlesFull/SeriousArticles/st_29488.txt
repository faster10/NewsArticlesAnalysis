In France , the National Front is now part of the political mainstream in Hungary and the Czech Republic , it s far worse . Not just particular far right wing parties but their ideas have become part of the mainstream . As U . K . Conservative Party politician Baroness Warsi put it , anti Muslim bigotry has passed the dinner table conversation test , albeit to do with refugees rather than Muslims per se . Even British Prime Minister David Cameron , when discussing his country s refugee issue , referred to refugees as swarms ? dangerously approaching the rhetoric of the populist right wing U . K . Independence Party . Prejudice against Muslims is no longer the domain of radical far right groups it has become acceptable from far more centrist political forces .
