I fell off a horse two years ago , and I broke my back . I ' d never been hospitalized before , so I never knew what it was like to be hospitalized . If you have a friend or family member who ' s in the hospital , bring them a blanket . They ' re always going to be cold , and the blankets they give you in the hospital don ' t cut it . And the nurses ? You need them they don ' t need you . A little batch of cookies or brownies goes a long way with the nurses . And you know what ? You ' ll have a lot better hospital stay .
