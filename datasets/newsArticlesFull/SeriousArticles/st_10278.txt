Osweiler already beat New England once in Denver a few weeks back and , assuming he is healthy enough to start and the youngster did miss plenty of practice time over the last few weeks before backing up Manning in the divisional round against this Patriots defense and this particular mastermind ( Belichick ) , I like his chances more . This week ' s challenge will be very different that surviving a Steelers team last week that had a middling pass rush and was bereft of its offensive stars either entirely due to injury ( Antonio Brown , Le ' Veon Bell , DeAngelo Williams ) or playing with wounded ones ( Ben Roethlisberger ) . It ' s going to take more points , perhaps many more , to win this Sunday five field goals and one big play following an attempted self sack ain ' t going to cut it and Manning is going to absorb more than the one crunching blow he shook off on a secondary blitz last week .
