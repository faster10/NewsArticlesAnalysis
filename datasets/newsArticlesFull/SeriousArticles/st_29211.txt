The Indianapolis quarterback situation has been an injury filled mess all year , as Luck has struggled with a shoulder problem , multiple rib fractures and a lacerated kidney . The kidney ailment continues to keep the Pro Bowler on the sidelines , but there is growing optimism he will be available for the end of the regular season . He has resumed throwing but a major hurdle remains . Luck will undergo a MRI in the near future to determine the extent of healing around the injured kidney . Any delay in healing would push back his timeline . Still , I ' m a bit skeptical that Luck will have much of a fantasy impact even if he does return this year . The injury won ' t directly limit his abilities , but the time off could affect his timing , and it remains to be seen if he ' s comfortable absorbing contact .
