Republicans want the election to be about external threats . Democrats want it to be about domestic reforms . Bernie Sanders fast pivot in Iowa reflected their faith that the way to keep the Republicans from hijacking the agenda is to stay on message . They could lay waste the feeble Republican case , but they so fear being painted as ? sissies they back off even when logic and the facts are all on their side . They trust in their consultants magic , but it isn t strong enough . To get the focus back where they want it , they must engage and defeat the Republicans on the issue of the hour .
