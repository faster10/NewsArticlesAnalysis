This week , we ' re going non partisan , because although ( obviously ) it will be Democrats who will fight for their goal , the organization itself is not technically a partisan entity . So instead of our usual MIDOTW award , this week we ' re changing it to the Most Impressive Progressive Of The Week . Our first ever MIPOTW goes to the Fight For 15 group , which has been instrumental in the fight to raise the minimum wage . Fast food workers across the country demonstrated this week , as they ' ve been doing for years . However , they ' ve been racking up some impressive victories , not least the fact that Democratic presidential candidates are now fully on board with a 15 an hour minimum wage for all .
