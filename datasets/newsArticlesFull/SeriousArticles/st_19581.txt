Vincent Rey should stick after free agency . From the outside looking in , it seemed this was going to happen anyway . An undrafted player , like Burfict , Rey climbed the Bengals ' defensive ranks the past six years because of his desire to make himself better . First he earned playing time on various special teams units , and that led to a reserve role at linebacker . Whenever Burfict or other linebackers suffered injuries in past years , Rey ' s reserve role turned into a starter ' s role . This past season , he played regularly , particularly at the start of the year while filling in for Burfict , who was finishing rehab from an offseason microfracture knee surgery . A more than capable backup , Rey proved his value in 2015 . He proved he was a dependable backup who can replace Burfict while he ' s unavailable . He may have to do it again .
