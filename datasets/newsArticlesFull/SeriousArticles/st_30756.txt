So what happened to the GOP revolt ? Reality has finally settled in as those with campaigns that are on life support began to realize they need all the cheap ( or even free ) exposure they can get . Let ' s see , a bakery in Manchester , New Hampshire or a major television audience was the possibility of millions of viewers ? Or how about a church on Sunday morning in Des Moines , Iowa or a major television network audience . For those campaigns on the brink of oblivion , the choice of playing and staying is obvious . However , it is also clear that the rank and file Republicans have had it with the media and consider it the enemy , and aligned to the Democrats themselves . Based on the temperament of average Republicans , fighting the media is about as sexy as it gets . Two of the biggest critics of the media in the GOP race Trump and Carson have thrived under the scrutiny and criticism of the press . The harsher the reviews , the better their numbers . The rise of Cruz is also linked to his recent and articulate attacks on the press .
