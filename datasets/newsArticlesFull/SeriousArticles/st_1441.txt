New Hampshire is crucial to the establishment because its voters are the most moderate of the three early voting states . It s not just that it would be best for an establishment candidate , like Sen . John McCain or Mitt Romney , to make an early show of strength by winning it . It s also important to stop the Iowa winner , typically an anti establishment crusader , from picking up any further momentum . If Bush , Rubio , Kasich , or Christie loses Iowa , they can soldier on . But their lack of consolidation opens the possibility that Trump or Sen . Ted Cruz ? now second in PPP s poll , at 13 percent ? could pull off the elusive Iowa New Hampshire double and head into the Southern swing , their more natural turf , with serious bragging rights .
