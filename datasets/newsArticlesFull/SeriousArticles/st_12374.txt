Mizzou basketball coach Kim Anderson : " I think Coach Pinkel has done so much for this school . He s won a lot of games , and that s probably what we all focus on . But Gary Pinkel the man has done a lot for this school . When you think about the winning of the games and the bowl games and all that I m going to miss him . He s been great to me . He s been very supportive of me when I needed support . My main thing with him , I just want him to be happy and healthy and for he and Missy to enjoy whatever they want to do . Certainly , I ll miss him , miss having him around . "
