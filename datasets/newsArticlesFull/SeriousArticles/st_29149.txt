Perhaps the Patriots strategy would have been different had Stephen Gostkowski not missed the extra point try after Steven Jackson s 1 yard touchdown run in the first quarter . But instead , the Patriots trailed the Broncos 7 6 and never caught up . After the Pats scored a touchdown with 12 seconds left in the fourth , they had to go for a two point conversion , and Brady s pass was intercepted . Had Gostkowski not missed the PAT , the Patriots would have kicked the extra point and forced overtime .
