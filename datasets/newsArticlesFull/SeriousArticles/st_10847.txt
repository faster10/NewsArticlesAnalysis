As one of the main centers of the auto industry , Flint played a central role in America s postwar rise to global economic dominance . It was rewarded for this by being promptly tossed on the scrap heap when deindustrialization swept across the country . Then , when Michigan s financial crisis began spiraling out of control , the state decided that Flint s citizens ? along with people in lots of other cities that just happened to have large poor , black populations ? no longer deserved even basic democracy , and handed power over to a string of unelected emergency managers . ( Among other things , one of those emergency managers ignored Flint s City Council when it voted to switch back to the city s previous water source . )
