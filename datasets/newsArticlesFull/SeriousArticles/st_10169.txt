Claire Noonan , vice president for Mission and Ministry at Dominican University in Illinois , suggested that we all might be inspired by their risk taking . Both men , she said , " moved through the world discerning where , when and how to act without fear . The possibilities of their lives were not constricted by desires for wealth , power or honor . That freedom makes way for the pursuit of truth , justice and love . " Noonan cites John Paul II ' s work against communist oppression in Poland and John XXIII ' s efforts to " free the entire church from the fear of modernism . "
