That brings us to Trump himself . As the pseudonymous blogger Billmon observes , Trump has instinctively discovered the Joe McCarthy sweet spot for maximum attention and momentum . It is pitifully easy to roll the mainstream media with a constant stream of insane , racist bile . Outlets are either too cowardly to call a spade a spade , or are simply wrong footed by Gish Gallop tactics . Left leaning media , meanwhile , has no purchase in the fever swamps . And conservative media , clearly taken aback at Trump ' s massive success with conservative base voters , are largely reduced to either studiously ignoring him , validating parts of his arguments , or howling about " illiberal " college students as a distraction .
