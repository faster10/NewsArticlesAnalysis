Let ' s be clear , though : The main reason anyone wants to see a movie like Pacific Rim is to watch robots smack the snot out of monsters and vice versa . And that ' s where del Toro hits the biggest snag . The problem is a matter of scale . Pan ' s Labyrinth cast such a spell partly due to the freaky details of a character like the Pale Man . The giant eye in the palm of his hand was designed with such jeweler ' s precision that it was seared into your dreams ( and nightmares ) after you walked out of the theater . Here , del Toro ' s monsters are so big , and shot in such unrelenting rainy darkness , that the audience never gets a chance to dissect and fetishize their monstrous anatomies and be swept away by their weirdness . And if you can ' t be transported by a humongous calamari leviathan with suction cup limbs projectile vomiting bioluminescent goo , that ' s an issue .
