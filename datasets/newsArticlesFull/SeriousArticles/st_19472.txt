John Avlon discussed the cowardice of the Republican senators who threatened a filibuster to prevent a vote on the proposed universal background check law , a point he also raised in his most recent column . Margaret Hoover a reasonable voice on the right ( almost an oxymoron ) agreed that Republican senators like Ted Cruz could cause the entire GOP to appear as extremists if they prevented a vote on this proposal via filibuster . I made the case that we need to stop calling these measures " gun control " laws and instead label them as " human safety " laws because the focus is on saving lives , not grabbing guns .
