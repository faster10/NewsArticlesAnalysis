The emergency brake proposal from Brussels includes key concessions to Cameron . When pulled , the brake would suspend in work benefit payments , such as tax credits for the low paid , to new EU workers in the UK . Authority over deciding whether the brake can be applied would lie not with the EU executive ( the European Commission ) ? something strongly opposed by Cameron ? but with the European Council grouping ? the 28 governments who would be less likely to block Britain . Both sides are negotiating how long the brake would last , with four years , Cameron s original demand , not yet ruled out .
