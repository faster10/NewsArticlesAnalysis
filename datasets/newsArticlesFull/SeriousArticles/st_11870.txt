We remember the Iowa Jefferson Jackson Dinner because of the speeches . In 2007 , a still struggling Sen . Barack Obama gave the speech that defined his message ? change we can believe in ? and transformed his campaign . But speeches are just a small part of this event . Overwhelmingly , the Iowa Jefferson Jackson Dinner is a test run for campaign infrastructure . Can you bring supporters to a full day of events ? Can you use that to expand your reach in the state ? Can you demonstrate enthusiasm by bringing those supporters to the dinner itself , where people holler and cheer for candidates like spectators at a game ( or teenagers at a student government conference ) ?
