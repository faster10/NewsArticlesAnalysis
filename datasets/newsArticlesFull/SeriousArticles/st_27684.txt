As should be clear by the fact we re talking about state delegate equivalents ? and fractions of them at that ? the Iowa Democratic caucus is not your typical primary . The ( simplified ) long version of what happens is this : Democrats show up at their local precinct on caucus night to elect a set number of county delegates ? the number of which is predetermined by turnout in the past two general elections , not by turnout at that year s caucus ? and then those delegates go on to elect their own delegates to district and state conventions that happen later . ( Those delegates then select delegates for the Democratic National Convention . ) The short version is this : The numbers we see this morning are the party s best estimate of what the state delegations will look like , but they are still an estimate .
