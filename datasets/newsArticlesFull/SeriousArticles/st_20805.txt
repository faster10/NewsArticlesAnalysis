The reality is that the Muslim world isn ' t just the leadership of Saudi Arabia and Iran , but also Indonesia and Mali . And it ' s worth pointing out that several Muslim countries have elected or appointed female heads of state , something the United States has yet to manage . And also that while much remains to be done on advancing gay rights , gay bars do still exist in Lebanon and in Jordan . Unfortunately , about 60 percent of Americans don ' t know a single Muslim , and so may only know about Islam what the media reports about terrorists .
