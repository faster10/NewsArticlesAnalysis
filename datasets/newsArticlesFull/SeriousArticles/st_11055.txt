Could that be Washington , which may have an opening at head coach and a scouting GM in Scot McCloughan ? Indianapolis , where Kelly could get to work with Andrew Luck if Chuck Pagano loses his own power struggle with Ryan Grigson ? Or Tennessee , which has an interim coach , an overdue regime change at general manager ( and or possibly new ownership ) and Kelly ' s former Oregon quarterback , Marcus Mariota ? Kelly shouldn ' t lack for suitors at the professional level if the Eagles want to move on , and the idea of a trade for a low level draft pick after the season might serve both parties .
