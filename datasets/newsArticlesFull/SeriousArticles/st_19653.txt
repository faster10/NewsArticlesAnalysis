I ' m trying to get a taxi to Coventry . Thanks for abandoning me . Don ' t ever ever ever think of me as your mate again . Do what you have to at the BBC because you are a loser on 27 grand a year . But don ' t ever ever encroach on me or my talent . ' ' Hi , it ' s me . I ' m in a taxi from Kenilworth to Coventry . Russell , don ' t ever count on me as a friend . I ' m going home . Please don ' t think you can rely on me you ' ve insulted me . You have left me stranded in Kenilworth . You are flaky , you are poor , you are weak . I don ' t want anything to do with you except on the radio . Goodbye . ' ' Hi , it ' s 9 . 21 . I ' m back at my car . Don ' t ever ever ever presume friendship with me again , all right ? Goodbye .
