CVS brought a critical additional tool to bear limiting access to tobacco and issued a clarion call for retailers to join the fight to change the culture around tobacco use to make it less socially acceptable .

We challenge other large retailers to take the same step and put their customers ' health and well being ahead of their profit margins .
