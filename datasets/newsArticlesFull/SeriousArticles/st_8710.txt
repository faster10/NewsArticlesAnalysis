Fundamentally , it is talent . But I also look for people who are willing to learn . How do you spot talent ? Is it just the GPA or the school ( university ) that you went to ? They are the traditional metrics . I look for commitment , willingness to learn . I think that ' s increasingly more important because things are changing so rapidly in technology . So , no one knows anything . Things may have changed by the time you have finished your computer science or engineering degrees . You have to have the curiosity and a work ethic that says I am willing to work on things till they get done .
