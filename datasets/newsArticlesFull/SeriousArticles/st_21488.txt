For director Gore Verbinski and Depp , who previously collaborated on the ultra successful Pirates of the Caribbean films , the terrible opening is particularly distressing . Depp ' s last two films , Dark Shadows and The Rum Diary , also severely under performed . The reality is , though , that westerns have always been a tough sell at the box office . The highest grossing western of all time , Dances with Wolves , earned 184 . 2 million in 1990 . The Lone Ranger ' s budget ( which does not include substantial marketing and distribution costs ) , was a full 41 million more than that so the bar for success was set incredibly high . And the financial setback for Disney will likely be incredibly high as well .
