Marcus Murphy returned Brad Wing s punt 24 yards , but coughed up the football , and his fumble was recovered by teammate Willie Snead , who was tackled immediately by Wing . In the process , Wing also grabbed Snead s facemask , even though by rule Snead could not advance the ball in the last two minutes . The additional fifteen yards gained by the personal foul penalty put the Saints in field goal range , so Forbath could stroke his first field goal in the Big Easy as time expired for the victory .
