Cruz got surprisingly little traction with an anti amnesty rant , but like Rubio he stood up effectively for a strong national defense . His worst moment of this or any debate was getting trapped on whether he would let Bank of America go under in a financial crisis . Insisting that he would gave Ohio Gov . John Kasich the chance to point out how unrealistic it would be to let all the depositors and the economy as a whole go under . Next to Rubio , Cruz ? seems stilted and his emotional displays appear contrived .
