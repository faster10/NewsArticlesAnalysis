When I ' d go see a movie , my friends would talk about the cool spaceships ( and later , the hot chicks ) . But for me , I would talk about how Jerry Goldsmith used the French horns instead of the English horns to signify a different character , or what Danny Elfman or Elmer Bernstein was doing . These were my heroes growing up , so it never occurred to me to do anything else with my life . It was predestined almost . I ' m very lucky that I got into it , because there ' s literally nothing else I would be interested in doing in my life .
