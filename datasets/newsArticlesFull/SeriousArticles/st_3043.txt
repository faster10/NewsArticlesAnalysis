They are 3 3 in head to heads , though Murray has won their last two , including a straight set victory last spring on clay in Madrid . Raonic has ? former world No . 1 Carlos Moya by his side , and he s hit more winners at net ( 88 ) than anyone in this Australian Open ( Murray s volleyed 35 of them ) , a sign that Raonic is of a more attacking , aggressive mindset . That s the game he ll need to work against Murray , who plays a buoyant , can t miss game and is one of the best offense to defense players on the globe .
