Atlanta Falcons : The Falcons have won six consecutive games following a bye week , which bodes well for their quest to end a two game losing streak . It helps that they ll face Andrew Luck s backup in Matt Hasselbeck , the fifth No . 2 quarterback thrust into a starting role the Falcons will have faced this season . But the 40 year old Hasselbeck has seen every type of defensive look , so he won t be easily rattled . For the Falcons , it comes down to how the offense will function after struggling with penalties and turnovers the past four weeks . Maybe a little no huddle sprinkled in will help , but it s all about Matt Ryan and the players executing regardless of the formation . An offense featuring Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman should be good for three touchdowns per game , and the Falcons have averaged just 16 . 7 points their past four outings . Falcons 24 , Colts 14 .
