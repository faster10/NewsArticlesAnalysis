Given the weather conditions , that decision made sense . But the Seahawks ' play call didn ' t make any sense . On fourth and 13 , Wilson threw a pass way short of the sticks , picking up just 7 yards . If they were going to throw short , why didn ' t they just punt to maximize field position ? And if they were going to go for it , why didn ' t they take a deep shot ? An interception wouldn ' t have hurt the Seahawks in that situation and it would ' ve given them a chance to score a touchdown or pick up a first down via a defensive penalty .
