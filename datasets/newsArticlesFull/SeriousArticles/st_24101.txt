Team Pacific : The John Scott led Pacific Division squad is surely an interesting one . They ' ve got the best 3 on 3 OT player in the league in Flames forward Johnny Gaudreau . He has three goals and five assists in the extra frame this year . There ' s also an exceptional trio of defensemen in Mark Giordano , Drew Doughty and the high scoring Brent Burns . Up front , they ' ve got two of the better goal scorers in the league today in Corey Perry and Joe Pavelski and they have the best story of the weekend in big John Scott . This could end up being the team everyone is secretly rooting for . For Scott , who is on a 575 , 000 contract this year , 91 , 000 is a pretty nice bonus .
