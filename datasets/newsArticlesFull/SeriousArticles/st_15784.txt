I don t know and don t want to attempt to get into the heads of the people who made that decision . Chris Rock is an excellent choice and it ' s not his first time hosting . I think he will speak honestly to the political climate both in Hollywood and otherwise . So , I definitely do not want to say that he is a token by any means because he is more than up to the task , but that s really the whole point of the hashtag . What we re saying is don t just choose one black person or one woman director just so that you can say that you have . Watch all of the films and then choose who you think is best that s on the academy perspective .
