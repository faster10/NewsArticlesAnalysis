Yatsenyuk has close ties to the Obama administration . During Ukraine ' s " Revolution of Dignity , " Nuland and Pyatt discussed getting " Yats " into the new government in a telephone conversation that was intercepted and leaked , perhaps by Russian intelligence ( " I didn ' t say it was inauthentic , " was how a State Department spokesperson described it ) . " I think Yats is the guy who ' s got the economic experience , the governing experience , " Nuland says on the recording . To Biden , and even to President Barack Obama , Yatsenyuk is as much of a negotiating partner as Poroshenko : They both have met with him on several occasions .
