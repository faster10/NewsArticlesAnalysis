It ' s interesting that Soderbergh couldn ' t get " Candelabra " made as a feature film he says it ' s because studios feared it was ' ' too gay . ' ' Liberace ' s fans were actually mostly straight women , the older , blue haired types . And for better or worse , that seems like the target audience for this movie , a glossy story of love gone wrong and then ( slightly ) redeemed at the end , without a whole lot of deep pathos in between . Those ladies might ' ve been comforted by Liberace ' s final words in the movie : ' ' Too much of a good thing is wonderful , ' ' he says . That ' s true but just a little bit more of a bad thing might ' ve been better . Grade : B
