That ' s a great run that ended with " Crystal Skull , " but in a new interview with Empire , Spielberg sounds pretty serene about the " Indiana Jones " fourquel . That ' s not to say he doesn ' t understand that people have a gripe with the central plot point of the film , which you ' ll recall forced Harrison Ford to run around the jungle waving a Crystal Skull and yelling " Crystal Skull ! Crystal Skull ! Crystal Skull ! " for 90 minutes . " I sympathize with people who didn ' t like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin , " says Spielberg . " George Lucas and I had big arguments about the MacGuffin . " Ah , but don ' t think for a moment that Spielberg is joining in the popular Internet sporting event of Hating On Lucas . " I am loyal to my best friend , " he says . " When he writes a story he believes in even if I don ' t believe in it I ' m going to shoot the movie the way George envisaged it . "
