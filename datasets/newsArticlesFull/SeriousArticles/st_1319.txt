Green Bay Packers : Despite coming off back to back losses , the oddsmakers say the Packers are the biggest favorites on the Week 10 schedule at between 11 . 5 and 13 points . Perhaps it ' s because the Packers haven ' t lost three consecutive starts by Aaron Rodgers since 2008 . Or maybe it ' s because the Lions never win in Wisconsin , the last time being 1991 . Better Detroit teams than this haven ' t been able to win here , so why would a 1 7 group do it ? Packers 32 , Lions 20 . Rob Demovsky
