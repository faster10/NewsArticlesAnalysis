What s being missed in all the hubbub over tonight s debate is the way in which Trump s move speaks to the average enraged Americans , on either side of the political spectrum , who often see the mainstream media as part of the problem . I get that . Monday night , when Hillary Clinton went on onstage for her turn at the Iowa Town Hall , she gave host Chris Cuomo , whose brother is the governor of New York , a big hug . He responded by giving her a kiss on the cheek . They were chummy , part of the in crowd that excludes practically everyone else .
