Lest we forget that this is a horse race , please keep your tallies of who ' s up and who ' s down on the Awards Season Big Board of Winnahs and Also Rans . The categories are all tight , but if Leonardo DiCaprio wins for The Revenant , look for him to spring to the front of the Oscar line ? and the same for Blanchett . If she wins for Carol it could mean that Brie Larson won ' t be the Oscar Cinderella . If Spotlight bests Carol , Mad Max : Fury Road , The Revenant and Room , then it sits way out ahead in the best picture race for the Academy Award . But The Big Short could be strong competition if it pulls away in its ( admittedly easier ) comedy category . In other words , when we stumble away from this awards show , folks , we might have a little something known as clarity . And a hangover .
