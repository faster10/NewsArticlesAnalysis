The problem with going negative on Sanders is that he ' s an honest , respectable , authentic and good guy . As most people recognize this , even if they don ' t agree with his stances , it plays a part in why attacks work to Sanders ' advantage . Usually , attacks in politics work because the receiving side has to defend themselves and their positions . But with Sanders , he plays fairly nice and doesn ' t attack or run negative campaigns . This results in the public seeing Sanders " take the high road " ( ie : ' her damn emails ' ) , while the other side is being negative . This just comes off as wrong to people . This effect could be why many people took Lance Armstrong ' s side when it came to steroids . This could also be why many people backed Joe Paterno throughout the Penn State investigations . This could also be why some people were wary of calling Bill Cosby a rapist . Now don ' t get me wrong , all of those people allegedly did incredibly appalling things , but it helps illustrate my point . So far , the Clinton camp hasn ' t done anything terribly negative , but if they do , keep in mind that history repeats itself .
