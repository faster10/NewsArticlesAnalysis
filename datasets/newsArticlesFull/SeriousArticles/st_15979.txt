There are very low tech ways to determine this , including feeling the wind on your face , and keeping an eye on " tell tales " small strands of yarn that are tied to the rigging . It so happens that cassette tape is commonly used for this purpose , as it is a very sensitive , durable material . As a kid I used to imagine that I could hear the sounds that had been recorded onto the tape wafting out into the air if the wind hit them just right maybe Beethoven , the Beatles , or Bob Dylan whatever tapes my family happened to have around the house . I thought it would be interesting to combine the idea of the Tibetan flags with the tell tails to weave a fabric quite literally imbued with sonic potential .
