There s just one GOP debate remaining before Republicans gather together next week for the bizarre quadrennial electoral ritual known as the Iowa caucus . And the big news heading into the debate is , of course , the thoroughly bizarre behavior of frontrunning Republican candidate Donald Trump , who has announced that he ll be skipping the event owing to poor treatment at the hands of the media outlet hosting the debate , Fox News . Trump s move raises a lot of questions ? why would he duck out of a debate in Iowa when he s locked in a battle for the state with Ted Cruz ? Why would he hand his opponents ammunition to attack him as a flake ? What logic is there in such a drastic PR move when he s already comfortably in the lead in most polls ? What the hell is running through this maniac s head ?
