Dallas Cowboys : In the season opener , the Cowboys needed Tony Romo s late game heroics and some atrocious clock management by the New York Giants to win . Before Romo was injured against Philadelphia , the offense contributed two field goals . There is no doubt the Cowboys will be better with Romo than they have been the past seven weeks , but they also need to be better than they were in the first two games with him . After missing three games in 2008 with a broken pinky , Romo completed 19 of 27 passes for 198 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in his return , a 14 10 win at Washington . There was some rust then and there will be rust now . But Romo will deliver . Cowboys 26 , Dolphins 17 . Todd Archer
