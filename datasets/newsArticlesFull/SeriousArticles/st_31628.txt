Jonathan Allen and the ferocious Tide defensive front sacked Connor Cook four times and allowed the Spartans only one trip into the red zone ? which ended with Cyrus Jones intercepting a pass at the goal line .

I ve been trying to get back to the national championship as a coach for 20 plus years now .
