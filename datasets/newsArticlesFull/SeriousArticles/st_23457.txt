" We had such a great team . To me , the greatest team that ever played in the NFL , " Brady said . " We won so many games against the toughest competition that year by big margins . Wes Welker and Randy Moss in the prime of their careers at the same time along with Jabar Gaffney . We had a good running game , a great offensive line . Rodney Harrison , Tedy Bruschi , Asante Samuel ? we had incredible talent and our offense was so prolific . It was an incredible year . Then to lose ? we lost to a really good football team who played really well that particular day and it took some pretty great plays to beat us . "
