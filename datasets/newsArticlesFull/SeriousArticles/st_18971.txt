The 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , COP 21 , convenes in Paris , and a large number of heads of state government , including Prime Minister Narendra Modi , are expected to attend . There is hope that this latest climate summit will avoid the failure and frustration of the earlier summit in Copenhagen , in 2009 . The assembled world leaders ought to be able to applaud a successful outcome on December 11 , the last day of the conference , barring unforeseen deadlock on some pending issues . There is consensus that the agreed outcome will incorporate the voluntary pledges of climate change action already made by the parties in the form of intended nationally determined contributions ( INDCs ) , which will then be subject to periodic international review , but with no penalties for non achievement . Setting the bar so low means a least common denominator result that all can live with . It is another matter that , taken together , the pledges do not , at all , add up to the scale and urgency of the threat posed by global climate change .
