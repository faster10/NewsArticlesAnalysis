Further , when this Act was reconsidered in a few years , Madison himself pointed out that Congress only had constitutional authority to naturalize aliens , not U . S . citizens , and reported a bill that amended the statute to eliminate the words natural born and simply state that the children of citizens of the United States born abroad shall be considered as citizens . ? This indicates that Madison s view was that children born abroad of U . S . citizens were naturally aliens , rather than natural born citizens , and thus could be naturalized by Congressional statute but should not be called natural born . ? Congress adopted this amendment in 1795 .
