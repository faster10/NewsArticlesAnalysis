We recently learned that U . S . intelligence agencies had at least three days ' warning that Syrian President Bashar al Assad was preparing to launch a chemical attack on his own people , but wasn ' t able to stop it . At least that ' s what an intelligence briefing from the White House reveals . With the combined abilities of our national intelligence apparatus the CIA , National Security Agency , National Reconnaissance Office and all the rest it ' s not surprising that we had advance notice . It ' s not known whether the U . S . shared what it knew .
