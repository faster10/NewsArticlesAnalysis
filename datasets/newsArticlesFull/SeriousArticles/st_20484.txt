The North American Interfraternity Conference stands ready to participate in a productive discussion . This is why I formed three commissions this year to study the most vexing problems facing colleges today : sexual assault , alcohol abuse and hazing . Over the next 18 months , these panels will come up with meaningful recommendations to address each problem . I will share these recommendations with university administrators and NIC members alike , with the explicit goal of overcoming these issues in the years ahead .
