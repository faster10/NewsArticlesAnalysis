Brooklyn , New York ( Motherboard . tv ) Last year , Motherboard went to Bent Festival , the world ' s premier meeting of circuit benders , music hackers , and broken Speak n ' Spells . We spent a day at 81 Front St . in Dumbo , where hackers young and old , expert and amateur , came to break electronics in order to put them back together again , in the DIY spirit of groups like NYC Resistor and musicians like Reed Ghazala and Morton Subotnick . At night , a healthy roster of chiptune musicians and others made music with their homemade gear .
