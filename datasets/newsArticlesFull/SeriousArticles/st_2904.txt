Rand Paul , reanimated . The Kentucky libertarian , in days of yore regarded as the most interesting Republican in the race , has disappeared almost entirely from the presidential political consciousness ? and his low polling earned him ejection from the main debate stage . Granted readmission in Iowa , he made the most of it . He spoke slowly ? and seemed to benefit most from Trump s absence ? to launch a series of razor sharp attacks on the character of Cruz and Rubio . And freed from the constraints of actually running to win , he reverted back to his heartfelt and idiosyncratic brand of Republicanism , speaking passionately about issues that almost never reach the GOP debate stage : poverty , discrimination against blacks , urban economic development , the evils of civil forfeiture and mandatory federal drug sentences .
