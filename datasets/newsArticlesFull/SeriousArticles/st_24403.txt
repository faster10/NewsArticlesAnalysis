Another problem with the emergency brake is that it may be illegal . It s perfectly possible that a newly arrived immigrant refused in work benefits could bring a case against the British government and the European Court of Justice would rule in their favour . So we might find ourselves having voted to Remain on the basis of this concession , only to discover the brake is completely ineffective the first time an attempt is made to use it . The same will apply to any attempt to withhold child benefit from newly arrived immigrants whose children aren ' t resident in the UK
