While movies like ' The Martian ' received a score of nominations , they did not have not many takers in India . However , cinema owners say they have to keep the niche audience , which will turn up for critically acclaimed films , in mind as well . Yogesh Raizada , corporate head of Wave Cinemas , explains , " We already know that there will not be a high footfall for the Oscar nominated films , but not all film screenings are for the masses . We have to think about the niche audience . Even if the film gets screened just once a day , at least the select moviegoers will have a chance to watch it . Movies like ' Birdman , ' ' 12 Years A Slave , ' ' The Artist ' and ' The King ' s Speech , ' which all won the Oscar for Best Picture in the last five years , did not perform too well revenue wise .
