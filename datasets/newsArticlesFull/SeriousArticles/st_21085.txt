SM : ? I believe they count more than everything on themselves , and their power and their people . Houthis want their share , their role they believe they have been removed from the power , they have been deprived from their own legitimate share , therefore military strike , military campaign would never resolve Yemen issue . You know thousands of civilians have been killed by Saudi strikes , still this is really a quagmire for a Saudi Arabia , in Yemen . I believe , like the nuclear deal , the diplomacy would work for Yemen . I believe they can Iran and Saudi Arabia , with other regional powers and international powers , they can immediately sit together to have a transitional government and to have a peaceful election and leave it to Yemenis nation to decide who should rule Yemen .
