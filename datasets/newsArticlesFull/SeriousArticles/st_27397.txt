The Rams were expected to have one of the best front fours in the game , but the production of their pass rush diminished following injuries to Quinn and fellow defensive end Chris Long . A back injury limited Quinn to eight games , ending his string of three consecutive seasons with double digit sacks , including an NFC leading 19 in 2013 .

Quinn could miss the beginning of the team ' s offseason conditioning program after undergoing back surgery .
