As it stands right now , I say that I am going to move out next year . But honestly , I have no reason to do so . Moving out on my own would mean that I would have to cook for myself , clean my place and go grocery shopping . I know that I can live on my own if I need to , but right now I don ' t want to . I am fortunate to have such loving parents , and I understand that not everyone is lucky enough to be in this same situation . Thankfully , my parents have not told me I need to move out by a certain point .
