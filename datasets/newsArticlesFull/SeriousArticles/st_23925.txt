Kim s next goals will be to work out how to fire his missiles from submarines ? allowing them to hit any target in the world while also being immune from a pre emptive strike ? and to maximise their destructive power by developing thermonuclear weapons , also known as hydrogen bombs . Last May , North Korea duly test fired a missile from beneath the sea on Wednesday , it claimed to have detonated a hydrogen device . Step by step , Kim is pursuing his nuclear ambitions and no country has the power to restrain him . We can only hope that one day his ossified regime will collapse of its own venality ? and that someone will secure his nuclear weapons when this happens .
