Writing a book is a long and difficult process for me . I ' m a slow writer , so I spend the year with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike in my head . I was thinking about this the other day . I wrote the first book in 1987 . Literally every day since that time , Elvis and Joe have been in my head . They ' re always there . I started these guys because I like them . I still like spending time with them , and I think that ' s probably the reason the readers have embraced Elvis and Joe the way they have . Whenever there ' s a new book , they want to refresh that friendship .
