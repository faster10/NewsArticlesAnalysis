Plus , when English speakers travel abroad , we tend to expect the world to cater to us . A couple years ago , I stayed at a Western chain hotel in Seoul , South Korea . The concierge gave me a business card that said something like , " I ' m lost , take me back to the hotel at this address " on it in Korean . The idea was that I ' d hand the card to a taxi driver and he or she would zip me back to the safety of a hotel with English speaking staff . Like I was a lost puppy with a business card collar . No need to learn a thing .
