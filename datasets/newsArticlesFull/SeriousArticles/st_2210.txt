For the White House , this could be a potential silver lining of a Republican controlled Senate . Two key trade deals are being negotiated . The Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) is an expansive free trade agreement between Asian and North and South America . The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) is a broad free trade agreement between the United States and the European Union . Republicans could make those negotiations smoother by giving the president " fast track " negotiation authority , eliminating the need for amendments Democrats are seeking on behalf of labor . While Republicans may be reluctant to hand President Obama what would be considered major accomplishments , both trade agreements could result in greater U . S . economic growth and jobs which are Republican priorities .
