It s just a touch too early for me to say he s done . A loss to the Lions , though , might change that . The Eagles , as bad as they have been the last two weeks , are still just one game back in the NFC East . There may be plenty of angst in Philly ? deservedly so ? but it will be hard to dump your head coach and the man with final say in personnel matters , if he wins the division and takes the franchise to the playoffs . What is clear , however , is that some changes are necessary for the Eagles to compete in the future .
