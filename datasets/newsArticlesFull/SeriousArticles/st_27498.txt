" You can ' t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars . You can ' t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums . You ' re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then . You are messing with captains of industry . Now this means that we are treading in difficult water , because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism . There must be a better distribution of wealth , and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism . "
