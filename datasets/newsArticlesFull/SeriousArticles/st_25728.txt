Opponents find it hard to adjust to Jamie s awkward geometry , as they do not come up against it very often , and for that reason he looks to those little faded volleys as his go to option . Also keep an eye on the chipped service return he plays , especially off the forehand wing , where he loops the ball over the man at the net and into the empty court . That allows him to rush forward and set up the classic doubles wall : two at the net will always have the advantage over two on the baseline .
