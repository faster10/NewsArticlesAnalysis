Chief among these is PRISM , an effort probably best understood by contrasting it to the telephone metadata program . PRISM ( authorized by the FISA Amendment Act of 2008 ) is about the content of communications , not just the fact that a communication has taken place . It deals with digital data , like e mails , not traditional phone calls . The subjects and activities related to PRISM collection are foreign and specific , not domestic and broad as in the metadata effort . Finally , PRISM is used for a number of legitimate foreign intelligence purposes , not just counterterrorism .
