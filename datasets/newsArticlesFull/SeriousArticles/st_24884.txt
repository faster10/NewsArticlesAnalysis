In response to request for comment , Yahoo issued the following statement : ? As noted in our Diversity Report , fairness is a guiding principle of our annual review and reward process . Our performance review process was developed to allow employees at all levels of the company to receive meaningful , regular , and actionable feedback from others . We believe this process allows our team to develop and do their best work . Our performance review process also allows for high performers to engage in increasingly larger opportunities at our company , as well as for low performers to be transitioned out .
