Buffalo Bills at New York Jets : As much as I feel for Geno Smith and whatever trauma he went through after being punched in the face back in August , I can ' t be too upset about Rex Ryan naming IK Enemkpali the guy with the mean hook as a Bills captain for this one . When I heard the news , I smirked , and have no shame in doing so now . Rex is a solid defensive coach , a great motivator , and perhaps most kindly to those of us in the sports media an entertainer . The Jets defense was looking stout , but got lit up by the Raiders and Jaguars the past two weeks . There are bigger concerns for New York than who is the opposing team ' s captain . Give me Buffalo in those hideous all red uniforms you ' ll all be tweeting about on Thursday .
