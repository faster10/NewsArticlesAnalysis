To me , that is the great thing about books , and I guess part of me is a little scared that if I let Hollywood get involved , and even if there ' s a really good movie made , that somehow once you ' ve seen the film , when you come back to the new book next year , that collaboration that you and I have is going to be a little bit different . Because then , the movie is going to have inserted itself . So I ' m really jealous and guarded about that . I want your Elvis and Joe to be a product of yours and mine and nothing else .
