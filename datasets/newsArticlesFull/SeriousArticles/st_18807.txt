I always thought of Thanksgiving as a forever holiday , something that endured from the time of the pilgrims . But according to Rayna Green , a curator at the National Museum of American History , Thanksgiving started out as an impromptu gathering of pilgrims and natives , to eat and hang out . All cultures understood what a good thing feasting was , so the First Thanksgiving participants brought what they had ? game , fish , squash , cranberries ? and gorged in peace . ? The pilgrims could officially give thanks to God too , for not starving to death in the New World that year , thanks to the guidance of the American Indians ? who taught them to farm indigenous crops .
