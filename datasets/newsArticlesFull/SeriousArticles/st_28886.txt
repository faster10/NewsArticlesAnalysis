Worse , because reality offends those ideological prejudices , it too must be forced into the fantasy . So instead of truthfully evaluating the threat , they tell us that ISIS is contained . Instead of admitting that we are at war with Islamic supremacism , they stage sanctimonious summits on all forms of violent extremism . And instead of being honest with the American people , they classify a man killing 13 U . S . military personnel at Fort Hood while screaming Allahu Akbar and carrying a card declaring himself a soldier of Allah as workplace violence .
