Of course , for all of his success , Brady knows postseason failure as well as anybody . He s been part of two Patriots teams that have lost their only playoff game ( 2009 , 10 ) and another that won a wild card game but lost in the divisional round ( 2005 ) . It was particularly stunning for that 2010 team , which went 14 2 and had Brady throw 36 touchdowns and just four interceptions . But that home loss to the Jets served as a shocking reminder that there s no such thing as a guaranteed win in January .
