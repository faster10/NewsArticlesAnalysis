One of the interesting things about the Flint story is the role of parents specifically , the mothers seeing there was a problem and looking at what was happening to their children and insisting tenaciously for action to take place . Officials in state and local government were saying basically that these are professional complainers upset about aesthetics and that there was nothing to see there . . . In the face of that sort of extraordinary lack of interest , these mothers did what parents are supposed to do , so they got the attention that was required . With the aging infrastructure in other cities in other parts of the U . S . , citizens need to be informed , tenacious and vigilant to make sure government officials respond to issues like this .
