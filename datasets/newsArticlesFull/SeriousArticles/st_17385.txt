In Hollywood , the relevance is the distinction between a black actor being chosen for a film like 12 Years a Slave , where his race is critical to the plot , and a black actor being cast in any given supporting role , as a result of the business decision that white actors are more bankable and have to be cast as the lead . This is manifestly more pernicious than hiring a Latin American tele marketer to serve racially profiled customers . It creates a set of cultural expectations in which , defying the evidence of our own five senses , we accept that the black half of any given duo is less likely to get the girl , more likely to be killed in a comical or tragic accident , less likely to say something deep or droll , more likely to have been disposed of by the end of the film .
