As we ' ve locked up more and more people , sentences have gotten harsher . Misguided three strikes laws have had the perverse result of sending people to prison for the rest of their lives for petty crimes like stealing a set of golf clubs . We are the only nation in the world that sentences children as young as 13 to die in prison . And we continue to have a death penalty that not only costs billions , but also produces unfair and unreliable results . For every nine people we have executed in the last 40 years , we have found one person on death row who was innocent . This error rate would be intolerable in any industry , yet where the difference is that of life or death , we are unwilling to speak up .
