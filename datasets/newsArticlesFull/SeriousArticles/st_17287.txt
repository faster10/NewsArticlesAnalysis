It s a shame , too , because there s actually a germ of an argument here that the biggest problem with Sanders is that his promise of transformative politics is undermined by his unwillingness , in many cases , to give the public and his followers especially a realistic path to actual change . The problem with his single payer healthcare plan , for instance , isn t that it s unworkable ? he s right that replacing insurance premiums with a generic tax that pays for every person ? probably would save most Americans money ? but that he might as well be promising everyone a pony , for all that this is ever going to happen .
