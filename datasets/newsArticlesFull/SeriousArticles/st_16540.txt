Entering the game , Golden State was beating opponents by an average of 14 . 4 points per game and Curry was on pace for 404 made 3 pointers , which would destroy his own NBA record of 286 3 pointers . No one shoots like the Warriors , no one passes like them and no one has anything close to their level of versatility . While the Brooklyn Nets , Toronto Raptors and Los Angeles Clippers managed to hang with the Warriors , they have always found a way to take over when necessary . There is no telling when this streak will end .
