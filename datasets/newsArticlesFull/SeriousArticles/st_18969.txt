Kraus : Speaking for myself , I was counting the days until my daughter was old enough to start daycare . They have a 3 month ( old ) policy . I love doing both . And I am so grateful that I have a career that I am deeply committed to and that brings me so much joy . And it makes me a happy person , which I think makes me a happy mom . I am so psyched when I get to pickup at 5 : 30 . And I try to make those hours with her as fun as possible because I ' ve had a good day . Even the tough days are good days . And I am grateful to have both in my life .
