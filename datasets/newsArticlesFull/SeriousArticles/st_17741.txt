Goffman : He ' s innocent of the charges he confessed to , so I think we ' re going to have to play out how he is able to get himself out of this situation because he ' s confessed to two murders that he didn ' t do . And he has very special knowledge that only a small handful of people do about what ' s happening in Sleepy Hollow . He ' s very critical to our group , but he ' s trapped in this situation with his family . But I think he ' s very clever and he ' s going to figure a way out . I hope . Laughs
