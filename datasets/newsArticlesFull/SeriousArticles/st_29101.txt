If Hillary is perfectly willing to use this tack against Sanders , a down the line supporter of the feminist policy agenda who has spent his adult life soaking in left wing pieties , just wait until she gets into a race with Donald Trump , Ted Cruz or any other Republican . No microaggression will be too " micro " to try to use to win a news cycle . Hillary will pretend to have the exquisite sensibilities of a campus feminist insisting she needs a " safe space " from the bristling hostility all around her .
