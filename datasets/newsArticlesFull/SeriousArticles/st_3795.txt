Back now with the best day of one young football fan ' s life bullied for being a Seattle seahawks fan . He had an experience Sunday that would make any football fan jealous . ABC has the story . Reporter : The biggest dream coming true for the smallest fan . Yeah , look who it is . 7 year old ade lewis is a third generation Seattle seahawks fanatic . But he has a big problem . They were all saying the same thing like ooh , seahawks that made me feel kind of sad . Ade lives in panther territory , Charleston , south Carolina . So when he started wearing his new green and blue hat to school every day , he got bullied by the other kids . On Thursday I asked him , you know , how are you going to deal with all the boos today and he said well I ' m used to it now . His mom posting this pic on Facebook last week . A smiling ade dawning his beloved seahawks ' cap . That post went viral . Over 200 , 000 likes and counting . Coach Pete Carroll sending S seaha seahawks ' gear and tickets to the game in Charlotte and the team posting this pic on their Facebook page with ade and his family at Sunday ' s game and the caption we got your back ade . Good for ade . Cheering for the team that you love regardless of where you are , that could be hard for adults . We have all been there before . You ' re cheering for the enemy . I would like to say I ' m still scarred by my experience at Ohio state . That ' s hard . How about the Seattle seahawks , class act by them and Pete Carroll . All that great gear and getting them four tickets . What can you share with viewers ? If you like a team , cheer for them . Stand up for your beliefs . Way to go , ade ! Beautiful . Yeah !
