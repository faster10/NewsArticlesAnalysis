For a movie that ' s basically all warmed over pseudo mythology and special effects , " Wrath of the Titans " is certainly more fun , in its solemnly junky way , than " John Carter . " It may also be a little more fun than its cheeseball predecessor , the 2010 remake of " Clash of the Titans . " A lot of the digital effects are quite good , though that prompts me to ask : Why do the camerawork and editing have to be so jittery ? In the old days , movies used to invite us to sit back and gaze at monsters , to really drink them in . The beasts didn ' t need to be photographed as if we were watching " Saving Private Kraken .
