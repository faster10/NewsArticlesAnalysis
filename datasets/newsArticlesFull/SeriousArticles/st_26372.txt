" Bachelorette , " a sloshed night before the wedding comedy , is a movie that ' s every bit as caustic and high strung as its damaged princess heroines . It opens in L . A . , where the sweet plus size Becky ( Rebel Wilson , who was Kristen Wiig ' s Cockney freak of a roommate in Bridesmaids ) informs her best friend , the platinum blond ice queen Regan ( Kirsten Dunst ) , that she ' s engaged , an announcement that Regan greets by just about choking on her salad with jealousy . That ' s what a petty vixen she is . Most of " Bachelorette " takes place six months later , in Manhattan , on the eve of Becky ' s nuptials , the perfect occasion for a bachelorette party that spins out of control . But this isn ' t a daffy clockwork farce like the Hangover films . It ' s a revved up pageant of naked feminine dysfunction , a comedy of values about young women who don ' t have any .
