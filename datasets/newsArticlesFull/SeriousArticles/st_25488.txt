Football pundits around the globe had forecasted that the 2015 Ballon d ' Or winner would be decided in Latin America ' s premier football competition Copa America . True to their words , Neymar started off in the best possible way , taking the Selecaos over the line against Peru in their first match . However , any chances of him anchoring his country to the final , fizzled out when he was handed a four match suspension for a brawl during Brazil ' s 0 1 loss to Columbia . The five time world champions made it to the quarters but lost 3 4 on penalties to Paraguay to see their campaign cut short prematurely . That was the end of Neymar ' s aspirations of being the third Brazilian ( after Ronaldo Lu s Naz rio de Lima and Kaka ) to win the Ballon d ' Or in the last 15 years .
