Honestly , I want Dallas to be as good and as healthy as possible when they host my Seahawks on Sunday . But I just hope that Dez is 100 . Because if he is not , he is playing a dangerous game and risks the rest of the season by pushing himself into this game too early . But , like I said , I hope he s 100 and plays well . To be the best you have to beat the best . And Dez is a great receiver . And Richard Sherman needs to step up his game . He can t do that by playing against scrubs . May the best team win .
