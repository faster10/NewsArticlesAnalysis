" The initial list that we were given , we have gone through and there are only 17 names on that list , " said Richard Griffin . " Our review to date and we have more work to do on this because we want to have more than one set of eyes look at all of the records but on those 17 , we didn ' t conclude , so far , that the delay caused the death . It ' s one thing to be on a waiting list , and it ' s another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list , that ' s the cause of death . "
