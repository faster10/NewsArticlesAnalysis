Former Mizzou athletics director Mike Alden : " He put Mizzou back in the national discussion . Whether it was the University of Missouri or the University of Missour ah , it really wasn t Mizzou back then . Most people didn t know what Mizzou was unless you were in the state of Missouri . What Gary did was transform us from a program that was being talked about locally or regionally to having a national profile . He did that with success on the field , no question , but he also did that by graduating his kids , being involved in our community , dealing with our student athletes when they made poor decisions off the field . He s going to be remembered as someone who always did it with integrity . They re going to be talking about him with a national platform , and they wouldn t have been doing that 15 years ago . That s because Gary has built something that s in the national discussion . "
