Trump doesn t just have a perfect memory of the past , when it comes to the terror threats facing our country , he can also see into the future ! Colbert said before playing a clip of a speech Trump gave about a book he wrote in 2000 where he mentioned Osama bin Laden . Yes ! Trump predicted that Osama bin Laden was threatening America alllllll the way back in the year 2000 . The same year Bin Laden was linked to the bombing of the USS Cole and only two years after Bin Laden was indicted for the embassy bombing in Tanzania and Kenya and only seven years after Bin Laden was implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing ! That s spooky ! It s like Trump has some kind of Fifth Sense that lets him see what s in newspapers and on TVs .
