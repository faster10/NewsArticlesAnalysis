Over our history , the United States has often been good at welcoming immigrants . In fact , it ' s part of what defines America . Reagan said it well , recounting the sentiments in a letter he received from a man before he left office : " You can go live in France , but you cannot become a Frenchman . You can go to live in Germany or Italy , but you can ' t become a German , an Italian . He went through Turkey , Greece , Japan and other countries . But he said anyone , from any corner of the world , can come to live in the United States and become an American . "
