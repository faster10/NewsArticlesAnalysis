A man in a suit standing on a ' British Media ' soap box gestures towards a white family wearing Union Jacks and St George symbols and says : ' As you can see , THIS is the problem that must be stamped out in our country . ' The cartoon , intended to stir up racial tensions , was drawn by a far Right artist based in South Africa who goes by the name Farstar88 . It was originally uploaded by the artist to the white nationalist internet forum Stormfront in 2008 under the heading ' my latest cartoon for the BNP ' .
