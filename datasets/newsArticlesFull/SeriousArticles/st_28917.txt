Yes , technically he ' s a quarterback in your game program , but he ' s also the best runner on the Carolina roster . He ' s big and fast ( I ' m pretty sure you ' ve heard that by now ) . But what makes him particularly dangerous with the ball is his combination of decision making in the read elements of the Panther offense , his short area burst to out leverage tacklers in the box , and his fall forward tendency to finish off runs a totally underappreciated aspect to his game that typically accounts for a couple extra yards on the tail end of nearly everything he does ( see below ) . ?
