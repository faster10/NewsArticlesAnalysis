3 . About 75 fans who filed into the Patriots Hall of Fame on Saturday were treated to a playoff huddle discussion with retired offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia , who offered insight on the team , the playoffs , and his 30 year career with the Patriots . I sat alongside Scarnecchia and one thing that stood out to me was when he was asked by an attendee if it s realistic to expect a return to some of the more aggressive schemes the team was running earlier in the season when it was winning 10 games in a row . Book it , he said . And sleep easy tonight . Scarnecchia , who was presented with a plaque from the Pro Football Writers of America as a 2015 Dr Z Award winner for lifetime achievement as an assistant coach , also shared how he s encouraged by what he s seen from Jackson , as he believes he can provide a LeGarrette Blount type presence for New England in the playoffs .
