Scary right ? If I tweeted that today , I might expect police at my door . In 1988 , though , there was no Twitter . . . or e mail . . . or " online , " come to think of it , when the rap group NWA came out with its ( famous ) " F Tha Police , " containing those very lyrics . People then were offended , of course . But songs on an album just don ' t seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today . There was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercially mass produced cassette tape .
