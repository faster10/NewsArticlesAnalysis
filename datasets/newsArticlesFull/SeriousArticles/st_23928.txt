" Just heard one of the toughest stories I ' ve heard in my life . Nakeyja , a resident of Flint , showed me how the government issued filter does not work . She tested it in front me and it was at 184 ppb . It ' s suppose to be less than 15 . Her 1 year old daughter is having seizures and tested very high for lead poisoning . And her 3 year old son is not speaking and is staring at one location for long periods of time . She is testing him this week , but he is not doing well . We have poisoned our own people . Our children . American children . And there is no cure for lead poisoning . Russell and I were brought to tears . And we are hearing this at every house we visit . Beyond belief . "
