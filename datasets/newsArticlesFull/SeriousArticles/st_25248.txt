Decades ago , the U . S . established the Federal Helium Reserve to provide a readily available supply of helium for defense , space , and scientific research needs . The reserve , located in the Texas panhandle , is the only long term substantial storage source for helium in the world . In the 1960s and 1970s , the U . S . bought and stored significant amounts of helium there . In 1996 , Congress directed the Bureau of Land Management , the agency in charge of the Reserve , to sell off helium in order to recoup some of the costs associated with its purchase .
