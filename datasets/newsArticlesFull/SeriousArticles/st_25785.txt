The Brown family called for peace in the midst of looting and violent protesting . Although the looting has stopped , clashes between protesters and police stayed heightened this week , with the Missouri National Guard , troopers and police in riot gear confronting angry demonstrators . The chaos is reminiscent of the Civil Rights movement . I was born and raised in Alabama and clearly recall the protesters armed with passion for change , protest signs , and their voice of power confronting police armed with batons , water hoses , shotguns and police dogs .
