When Bernie Sanders came to file for the primary last week , there were questions over whether he will run into any issues since it ' s a requirement to be a registered Democrat or Republican and he has been a long time Independent . Clinton was asked about that situation and her advocacy for her party , and responded , " I ' ve been a Democrat for a very long time . I also , as a Democrat , have not only worked on behalf of issues and causes that I believe in , but I ' ve supported a lot of democrats over the years . I ' ve campaigned for them , I ' ve raised money for them , I ' ve encourage them to run , and I will continue to do that . "
