There is a wonderful song by Bowie called It s No Game ? it s from an album called Scary Monsters ( and Super Creeps ) , and the first line is Silhouettes and shadows watch the revolution . There s this line later : So where s the moral ? People have their fingers broken to be insulted by these fascists is so degrading and it s no game . What you have in Bowie is a kind of post revolutionary situation ? the revolution has happened and it has led to a kind of disaster , and we find ourselves in that situation , and how do we cope with that .
