One of the more interesting segments of today s CMP video shows Ferrigno ? discussing the volume of Whole Woman ' s Health ' s ? Texas clinics . A week before CMP filmed the video , a federal court affirmed a Texas law that shut down any abortion provider whose facilities didn t meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center , leaving only eight clinics in the state . In the video , the Whole Woman s Health rep describes heightened demand on the remaining Texas clinics , which recent studies have linked to rising wait times and a potential spike in second trimester abortion . The Center for Medical Progress may find second trimester abortions abhorrent , but ? thanks to the successful efforts of their comrades in the anti choice movement ? they can likely look forward to more of them in Texas .
