MJ : To me , I ve always been consistent . I m a guy with tremendous faith . I had a dream to become a professional player , a dream to become an announcer and a dream to coach . I totally trust God . I believe if I was to die 100 years from now and never had the opportunity to coach again , I m at peace . I m not going to lose my mind . I m thrilled for the next opportunity . But it s not going to make or break my life . I m at peace and I m still going to enjoy the game . I m honored to be a part of it . ?
