The media reporting on the Saudi attack on the Yemeni hospital expressed a great degree of uncertainty , ambiguity , and even deception . ? While downplaying who was responsible for the bombing , media networks failed to convey the basic fact that only the U . S . backed , Saudi led coalition has an air force , not the rebels in Yemen . Although MSF and the U . N . made it clear that the coalition was responsible , headlines refused to name who exactly was guilty for the attack , and weasel words were ubiquitous ? recalling the same dishonest media equivocation after the Afghan hospital was bombed .
