Long story short , John Scott played in the All Star Game Sunday night . On the ice with the league s elite in an unforgiving three on three format , Scott s detractors expected him to embarrass himself . Instead , the opposite happened . Scott scored two goals . Every time he hit the ice , the building erupted into chants of MVP ! MVP ! He captained his team to victory , and the fans spoke once again ? voting him in as a write in candidate for the game s most valuable player . The superstars hoisted him on their shoulders and skated him around the ice in triumph . And his kids were never more proud of their dad .
