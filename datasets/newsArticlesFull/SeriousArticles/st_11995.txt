To be fair , it wasn t all bad . The moderators , particularly the Wall Street Journal s Gerard Baker , asked well informed questions on the economy . Oddly , Donald Trump s policy illiteracy seemed to bring out the best of some other candidates . I disagree completely with Sen . Ted Cruz s position on immigration , for example , but Cruz did offer a cogent economic defense for why he wanted to crack down on illegal immigration . It was far better than Donald Trump s WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS ! ! mantra that he invoked whenever he was asked about how he would implement his deportation policies . ( Trump s post debate explanations are even more disconcerting . ) Similarly , Sen . Rand Paul took Trump to town for ? his ignorance about the Trans Pacific Partnership . And the foreign policy portions of the debate did produce a genuine debate between Paul and everyone else on the stage .
