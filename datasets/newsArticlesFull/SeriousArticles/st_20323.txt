HB : It ' s that taste of success that you get after winning a championship . You hit that mountaintop , it ' s an amazing feeling . Coming into the season , you want that feeling again . Every night is a rehearsal for that big stage . Every little thing that you go through . If you mess around , and you don ' t take every game as seriously as possible , there ' s going to be a time you get to the Finals and say look , ' We re not sharp right now . ' At that point , there s nothing you can do . So I don t think anyone wants to end the season with regret . So we re approaching every night with a must win attitude . ?
