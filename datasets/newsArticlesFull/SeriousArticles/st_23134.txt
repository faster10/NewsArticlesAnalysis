The United States must bring back more than 100 , 000 Black internally displaced residents to New Orleans with jobs , housing , and medical benefits starting now ! In my forthcoming book , Katrina ' s Legacy I explain Ten Tactics by which the U . S . carried out a Genocidal Climate Crime in New Orleans by consciously driving more than 250 , 000 Black people out of New Orleans in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina and working to prevent their return . Now , there are still more than 100 , 000 Black Internally Displaced People , former residents of New Orleans , scattered and discarded all over the U . S . This demand has been raised by the Survivors Village and Advocates for Environmental Human Rights in New Orleans and is still an ongoing and real demand requiring presidential intervention . We plan to bring this to the UNFCCC to build international support for this demand and call on President Obama to take executive actions to make it happen .
