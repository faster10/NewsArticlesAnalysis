Although the House didn ' t vote on Boehner ' s tax measure , most Republicans did vote together earlier Thursday as the House narrowly approved , 215 209 , a related measure to alter automatic spending cuts set to kick in next year under the fiscal cliff , replacing cuts to the military with reductions elsewhere . The Congressional Budget Office said this would lead to 217 . 7 billion in cuts over the next decade , short of the 1 . 2 trillion in cuts that would go into effect in January if the fiscal cliff isn ' t averted .
