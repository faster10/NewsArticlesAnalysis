Trump s detractors on the right fear his unpredictability : The Wall Street Journal editorial page complained on Thursday that on politics and policy he is a leap into the known unknown . Well , yes . It s precisely Trump s lubricity that is allowing him to transcend the GOP s parochial ideological battles that would almost certainly lead the party to defeat in November . With his penchant for making a deal , Trump might well veer toward the middle once the primaries are over ? or even before then . There s no real evidence that he s a true blue conservative ? or much of anything other than a shrewdly calculating and pragmatic opportunist . Ted Cruz , by contrast , would take the party to the right and also pursue a more realpolitik foreign policy , but he wouldn t smash the crockery like Trump .
