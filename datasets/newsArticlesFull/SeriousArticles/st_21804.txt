Navy sailors have departed Iran and are now back in U . S . hands , he said , thanking Secretary of State John Kerry for his personal help in freeing the nine male sailors and one female sailor . Around the world , the U . S . Navy routinely provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress , and we appreciate the timely way in which this situation was resolved .
