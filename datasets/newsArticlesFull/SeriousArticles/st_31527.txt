Airline pilots in the United States are required by the Federal Aviation Administration to take a medical examination once every six months . The examination is mostly physical , but the doctor is expected to ask some basic mental health questions , most of them about depression or alcohol consumption . In addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months , the application for the exam also compels us to self disclose the use of medications , specifically for the treatment of depression .
