Meanwhile , make Rousey earn her title shot with a tune up fight whenever she ' s ready . That ' s an even better storyline than the immediate rematch : Fallen Star Begins Ascent Back to Top . ? With all the Rousey vitriol after the knockout at UFC 193 , do you really think that storyline wouldn ' t hold interest ? ? Who wouldn ' t tune in to watch Rousey tear apart whatever red meat the UFC deems fit to toss her ? Do you really think she ' d lose again ? Heck , main event a cable TV card with that fight and get yourself a record rating .
