Secretary General of the Rajya Sabha , Shamsher Sheriff , organised a workshop for some 250 directors and deputy secretary level officers in government who prepare written answers for MPs , who pose written questions in Parliament during Question Hour . Several officers sought clarifications on contentious issues . A valuable piece of advice from the Rajya Sabha secretariat was that officers should not club different issues together in a reply . Instead , they should list them separately . Bunching the reply gives the impression that the government is trying to circumvent the issue and avoid giving answers . Officers were advised that the common ministerial response , Let me look into the matter , is not a good idea . The response might sound innocuous but in Parliamentary parlance , it amounts to an assurance and therefore , the minister will have to follow up with an explanation of the actual position . If he does not do so , he could be hauled up before the Parliamentary Committee on Assurances , a powerful body .
