The first clearance , before the end of the 40 day mourning period observed by Russians , caused particular offence . Some people told me they felt as if Boris had been killed a second time , said Olga Lehtonen , 38 , who would later protect the site . Since that first clearance , on March 28 , around 30 unpaid volunteers have mounted a round the clock vigil . Sometimes braving temperatures of minus 20 Celsius , some have been arrested and assaulted . We don t have any other avenues to express ourselves , said Andrei Margulev , who spends 26 hours on the bridge a week . He was arrested for reciting poetry there in September and fined 10 , 000 roubles ( 130 . 93 ) by a court .
