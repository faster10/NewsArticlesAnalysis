Akin to Freddy My Love , Doody s guitar ode is one of those stage only standards only pithily represented in the 1978 film ( and not by Doody ) . Again through Kail and Rudzinski s creativity ( or , perhaps , by bookwriters Jonathan Tolins and Robert Cary ) , the doo wop ditty underscored a montage of Danny s attempts to change himself by trying his hand at a smattering of sport ball games . Magic Changes was grounded by Jordan Fisher s vocals , bolstered by Tveit s expediency , and made all the more impressive by the telecast s live nature , but most importantly , it was given a crucial and much needed sense of belonging in the story . The song that always felt like a throwaway effort to include Doody somehow seemed to work .
