" Incident commanders and emergency responders who are managing fires need to make decisions on where to focus air drops of fire retardants and other resources , " Johnson said . " With this new hotspot information , all of a sudden I know : down there in that canyon , not visible yet , there ' s a hotspot . So let ' s divert some air assets to hold it while it ' s still small and later deploy firefighters there . That ' s so much better than discovering the hotspot only when it busts out of a canyon , when it ' s strong and harder and more dangerous to fight . "
