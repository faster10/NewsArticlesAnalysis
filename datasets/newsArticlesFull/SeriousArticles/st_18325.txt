The father of what is now Black History Month , historian Carter G . Woodson ( pictures at the top of this post ) , created Negro History Week in 1926 . The week included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and Frederick Douglass birthdate on February 14 , and these dates were significant to black people as they embraced both men , per the Daily Kos . The former was known among many as The Great Emancipator , and the latter as a tireless abolitionist and later statesman . The goal and purpose was to teach the history of African Americans in public schools , thereby encouraging people of African descent and informing others on the accomplishments of blacks . Many statements in Woodson s classic , The Mis Education of the Negro , explain the necessity and urgency of instruction on the history and accomplishments of black people .
