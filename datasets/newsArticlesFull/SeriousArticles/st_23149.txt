Trump has returned to form , calling the Iowa caucuses a sham and Sen . Ted Cruz a fraud . After testing out the argument on the stump in New Hampshire yesterday , Trump unloaded on Twitter , accusing Cruz s campaign of stealing the election . Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus , Trump wrote , either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified . Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa , Trump added , he stole it . That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated . The state of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated ? a total fraud !
