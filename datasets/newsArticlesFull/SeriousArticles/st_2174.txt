Anyone who already has a Nexus ( like 2014 ' s impressive Nexus 5 ) will love Google ' s latest 5 . 7 inch model , which is made by Huawei . Its elegantly designed , unfussy metal body shows off its superb screen beautifully . Nexus models are usually known for two things : being around ? 100 cheaper than similarly specced premium rivals and using ' pure ' Android ( the latest version available ) without any manufacturer added complications or bloatware apps . This , again , is what you get with the 6P : if you want to cut through the treacle to get to your own stuff with blazing power , this smartphone will do it for you .
