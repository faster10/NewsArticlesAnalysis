I visited a health facility which typically serves about 700 people daily . Samer Makahleh , with the Jordan Health Aid Society , coordinates health care programs . " To fill gaps we go to outside partners like IOCC , " he explained . The hardest medical cases have to be transported elsewhere , and as many as 100 people are waiting for more expensive operations , such as heart procedures . For these " they need a special donor , " said Makahleh . Two people came up to me during my brief visit seeking financial support for operations .
