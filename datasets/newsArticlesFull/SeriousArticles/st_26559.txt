The sorriest part is that the fraternity itself is the most bleeding quarry of the rabid extremism of fanatical clans . No Muslim polity is at peace with itself . Almost all are in turbulence and turmoil to varying degrees . They are being ruined and ransacked by the ever widening sectarian divide and blighted by confessional antipathies being whipped up stridently by divided fanatical strands . Unfortunately , most Muslim countries are deviating from the ideological track and are following the shadows of opportunism or adventurism . And the present state of affairs is the result of the profligacy of unimaginative rulers in the majority of Muslim countries , who give overriding consideration to their personal interests over the ummah s ( community ) interest . One does not see a semblance of Islamic brotherhood so far as the foreign policy pursued by them is concerned . Sometimes they eye contracts and compete with each other instead of sharing with each other .
