Where Spectre does break from the past , it ' s only to conform to the rigid rules of 21st century film franchise governance , imposing a unconvincing and pointless interconnectedness onto the the events of the three previous Craig era pictures . This insistence that all the varied trials his world weary Bond has faced were the work of one man ? Christoph Waltz , who may or may not be playing a certain oft parodied international man of mystery who has long been absent from the series for exciting legal reasons ? strains our suspension of disbelief more than any orbiting death ray or submarine car ever did .
