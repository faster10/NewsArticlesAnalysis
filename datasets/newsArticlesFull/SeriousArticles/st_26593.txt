It is not only wrong , but it is undermining core Democratic principles . Since when do Democrats attack one another on universal health care ? I thought we were trying to realize Harry Truman ' s dream . I thought this campaign finally gave us an opportunity to put together a coalition to achieve universal health care . This is wrong and every Democrat should be outraged because this is the kind of attack that not only undermines core Democratic values , but gives aid and comfort to the very special interests and their allies in the Republican Party who are against doing what we want to do for America . So shame on you , Barack Obama . It is time you ran a campaign consistent with your messages in public . That ' s what I expect from you .
