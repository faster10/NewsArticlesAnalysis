For a few minutes during his epic ? and now deleted ? tweet storm Wednesday , Kanye West was just plain hilarious , in his uniquely Kanye way . ? Raging at his fellow artist Wiz Khalifa , who had committed the crime of publicly expressing a lack of enthusiasm for the new name of West s forthcoming album , WAVES , he issued proclamations seemingly begging to be turned t shirts . You have distracted from my creative process , he railed . Maybe I couldn t be skinny and tall but I ll settle for being the greatest artist of all time for consolation . But then , as ? a bonus , he ? went and proved ? himself a world class jackass when it comes to talking about women . ?
