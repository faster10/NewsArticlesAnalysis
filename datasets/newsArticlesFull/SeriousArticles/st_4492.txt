Our resident pangolin enthusiast : The video was shot at a studio in Brooklyn . I went in with the song , and the amazing team at maxanimal . com shot the video . Over the next couple of weeks , their editor , Grannell Knox , edited and sent out rough cuts , and we all weighed in on the best ways to visually entertain people while also preserving the integrity and message of the song . One challenging aspect was that it was nearly impossible to find high definition footage of pangolins that we could use on such a limited budget .
