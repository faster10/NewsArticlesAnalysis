I don ' t think there ' s any question , McNair said Tuesday , when asked if finding a franchise quarterback is the Texans ' top priority ( via the Houston Chronicle ) . I ' ve been saying that . The question is what ' s available , and what ' s the price ? How many draft picks might you have to give up ? You can ' t undermine the rest of your team while you ' re trying to get a quarterback . This isn ' t a department store where they have them on the shelf , and you just pick one up . It ' s a question of who ' s available . We ' re working on that . We think there are some good prospects out there .
