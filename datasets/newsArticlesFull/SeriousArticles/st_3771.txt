One wonders if the denial stems from the fact that most propagating such conspiracy theorist , apologist thoughts actually adhere to this radicalised , extremist mindset deep down or whether it stems from an identity crisis in an atmosphere of confusion where one is trying to retain the comfort zone way of living while at the same time desiring to earn in euros or dollars in a globalised economy . For those in denial , if you intend to choose the side of radicalisation , choose it rather than being in denial . For this delusional denial is crippling society and its narrative to complete decay . Unfortunately , in the world in which we live , fence sitting is not going to be an option any longer . Either one has to adhere to comfort zone living ideals or will have to embrace globalisation and integration . If you are going to choose radicalisation and xenophobia , the economic and social repercussions will pinch hard . In the case of Muslims , mostly living in under developed economies , the pinch will be felt instantaneously . And if the wealthy west chooses xenophobia the repercussions may be felt a little later but will be there . Modes of communication have pushed our world to integration and there is no turning back .
