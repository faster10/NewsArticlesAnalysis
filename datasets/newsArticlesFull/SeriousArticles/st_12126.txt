Just Friday , I bought Bowie ' s new album , " Blackstar , " on my lunch break . It was released that day ? Jan . 8 ? to coincide with his 69th birthday . Glowing reviews pour in . A music video for the single " Lazarus " is released the same day . It violates some cosmic sense of order and justice to have Bowie die in the midst of all this . Maybe if had died in the 10 year gap of near inactivity between 2003 ' s " Reality " record and his 2013 comeback " The Next Day , " it would have made more sense , y ' know , adhering to the whole fading away rather than burning out shtick far more common in the music world . To die as a new prolific period was dawning , that just can ' t be . That ' s not how it ' s supposed to be .
