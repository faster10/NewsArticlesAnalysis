Lastly , in one of my recent appearances on The Benjamin Dixon Show , I explain how Bernie Sanders won the first Democratic debate . Sanders will win the upcoming debate , not only because he voted against Iraq , while Hillary Clinton calls her vote a " mistake . " He ' ll win because America still has a race problem , and while Hillary Clinton accepted money from the prison lobby , others are undergoing hunger strikes . Yes , I ' m only voting for Bernie Sanders , not Clinton , because Supreme Court justices might indeed survive four years of a GOP presidency , but the Democratic Party won ' t survive a shift further to the right our two party system will eventually become one . Clinton leans to the right on war , foreign policy , Wall Street , trade , and also issues of race . If you don ' t understand the logic , you won ' t see how important Bernie Sanders is to the future our nation , or that as I explain in a Ring of Fire appearance , he ' s the only way to defeat Trump .
