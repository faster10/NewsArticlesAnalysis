Imagine that an anti Russian Ukrainian government gained power and actually won its legal suit . Then what ? In the best case scenario , Ukraine would win a legal declaration on its side , which might make Russia liable to compensate Ukraine for its losses . Russia could then refuse to comply , or it could do what the United States did to settle the illegal use of force suit that Nicaragua won in front of the ICJ . Russia could require that Ukraine relinquish its claim if it wants to receive its aid package . And Ukraine would have few options , since ICJ rulings can only be enforced by the Security Council ( again , on which Russia holds veto power ) .
