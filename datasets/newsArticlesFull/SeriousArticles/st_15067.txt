Months later , I wrote a personal letter to James that I never mailed . In it , I told him that the choice was his to make but his departure method had made me cringe . The mother in me wished he had gone to The ' Q to shake the hands of the security guards , custodial staff and the kitchen staff and to look in the eyes of Cavaliers leadership while thanking them for unwavering support . I wanted to tell him how much he had bruised our local children . I wanted him to set a better example . I wanted him to know there were still boys in Copley , Bath and Akron who were looking up to him .
