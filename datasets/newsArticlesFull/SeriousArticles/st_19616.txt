It ' s a shame that this is the Blofeld we ' re stuck with now , because there ' s never been a better time for the 007 franchise to bring Blofeld back . They just chose the wrong version of the character . In Ian Fleming ' s original novels , Blofeld ' s main arc is spread out over a trilogy . After Bond foils two of Blofeld ' s carefully orchestrated plots in Thunderball and On Her Majesty ' s Secret Service , Blofeld retaliates by gunning down Bond ' s car as he drives off to his honeymoon ? and Bond ' s new wife Tracy dies in the attack . The final Blofeld story , You Only Live Twice , is as dark a 007 novel as Fleming ever wrote . Shaking himself out of a near alcoholic stupor because of his even greater thirst for blood , Bond tracks Blofeld to Japan , then strangles him and blows up his castle .
