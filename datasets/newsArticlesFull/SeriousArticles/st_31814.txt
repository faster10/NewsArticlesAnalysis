The Obama s civilized world needs to understand that Syrian , Iraqi and Afghani people are as biological humans as are Americans and Europeans . Syrian women love their children as much as French ladies do . The pain , agony and misery of losing dear ones is equally realized by all humans . We are sorrowful at the loss of innocent lives of the western world in occasional incidents . But these incidents are the consequence of their aggressive interventions in foreign lands to cause regime change via dirty proxy wars or direct invasions . The more collateral damage the coalition forces cause in senseless bombing , the more recruiting grounds are they preparing for ISIS . The civilized world cries lurid and hoarse , lit candles and changes DP s over a few casualties in their homes , but remain callous and senseless over a MILLION deaths . Only French bombing reportedly killed many civilians including children while attacking ISIS hideouts in Syria after Paris attack . The double standard of the western world towards the sanctity of human life is pathetic . Quite recently , Tony Blair admitted overtly that Iraq war was a mistake and it was based on false intelligence . If there is an iota of honor and prestige left in the civilized world , they should trial Bush and Tony in war crimes .
