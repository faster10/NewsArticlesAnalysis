As a current taxpayer who spent a year loading trucks at a prison warehouse , eating food for which you , dear reader , paid , I can tell you two things . First , I did not want to pay to house , feed and clothe multimillionaire lawyer John Edwards . Second , the only person in this sordid mess whom prosecutors should have considered indicting is someone who was already granted immunity . That ' s right , Andrew Young , who defrauded the 99 year old Bunny Mellon by siphoning ( or , more precisely , stealing ) hundreds of thousands of dollars to build his dream house .
