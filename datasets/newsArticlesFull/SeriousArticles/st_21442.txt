Here ' s what we know : The president entered office skeptical of the very programs he is now defending . But after vetting them and adding some additional protections , he now thinks they are important , even integral , to our self defense . All of which makes sense to me personally . But it ' s hard to categorically decide something ( especially when it affects you ) without some more information . And if you ' re asking people to decide that Big Brother ism in some form is OK and to trust that you are doing the right thing you ' ve got to give them something to work with .
