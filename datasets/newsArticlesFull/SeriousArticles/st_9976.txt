Five years later the time has come for another strategic defence review . David Cameron presented it on Monday as if it was an innovatory response to the dangers of Isis in the Middle East and Russian assertiveness in eastern Europe . As a politician he can hardly be blamed for putting that slant on it . But in fact this review is not at all revolutionary . It proposes more investment in cyber defences , special forces , counter terrorism work , all obvious responses to recent threats and all already to some extent under way . It seeks to restore some of the conventional capacities unwisely removed in 2010 , and it emphasises the need for mobile and flexible forces ready to go where needed at short notice .
