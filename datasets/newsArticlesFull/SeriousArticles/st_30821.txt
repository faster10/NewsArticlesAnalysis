When I arrived at the camp . . . the situation is so jaw droppingly raw . They lack basic services . There ' s no running water . The water that they do have access to is not really safe for drinking , but they drink it anyway . There ' s certainly no water for showers or luxuries of that nature . The latrines are poorly dug holes . And people ' s accommodation is corn husks and sticks and sometimes UN issued sheets of plastic or ironically in one of my new friends ' homes a cardboard box that American made goods had been transported in . Her interior decoration was cardboard stamped with " USA . "
