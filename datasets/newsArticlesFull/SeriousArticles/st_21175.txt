Warner Bros . ' 250 million fantasy prequel was held out of the top spot from Tuesday until Thursday by " Les Miserables , " but over the traditional weekend frame " Hobbit " dipped only 11 percent to bring in 32 . 9 million , and its domestic total now stands tall at 222 . 7 million . After 17 days , " The Hobbit " is performing well ahead of 2001 s " The Fellowship of the Ring , " which had earned 189 . 3 million at the same point in its run ( though that number climbs to about 260 million after accounting for inflation ) , but it still trails the 17 day cumes of " The Two Towers " ( 243 . 6 million ) , and " The Return of the King " ( 272 . 8 million ) . Notably , those films did not have 3D or IMAX surcharges boosting their totals .
