The build and break model being studied by the two companies is also growing more popular . General Electric spent 10 billion buying ? Alstom ' s gas turbine business at the same time as spinning off its financial unit , GE Capital , and trying in vain to sell its home appliances division to Electrolux . Lockheed Martin said in July that it would buy the helicopter maker Sikorsky from United Technologies and would then consider spinning off or selling its own information systems unit . And don ' t forget Allergan , which ? will look at dividing into one business for new ? drugs and another for older , less profitable medications ? following its record takeover of Pfizer .
