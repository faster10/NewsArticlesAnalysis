There is a new game show in town , or back in town , called something like " Presidential Debate , " in which players are asked questions , and possibly answer them , while attempting to demonstrate by the force of their personality that they are qualified to lead the free world . It ' s a little like " Jeopardy " without the buzzer or correct answers ( there may be money , eventually ) a little like " America ' s Got Talent , " without the singing , comedy or magic and a little like a beauty pageant , without the swimsuits .
