In a 19 page legal letter seen by the Observer , CAAT warns that the government s refusal to suspend current licences to Saudi Arabia , and its decision to continue the granting of new licences for military equipment that may be destined for use in Yemen , is unlawful . The letter cites article two of the EU Council Common Position on arms sales , which would compel the UK to deny an export licence if there was a clear risk that equipment might be used in a violation of international humanitarian law .
