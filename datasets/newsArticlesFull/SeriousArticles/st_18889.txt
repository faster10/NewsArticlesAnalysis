Size is not a Jewish standard of measure . The Bible itself promises that we will be the smallest of the nations . But the loss of any Jew is nevertheless a tragedy . For at Sinai , the Jewish people were not only given a collective mission . Each soul that stood there or would descend from those who stood at Sinai was created with the potential to reveal , within the framework of the Torah ' s commandments , some aspect of God by virtue of his or her unique combination of talents and challenges to be overcome and particular familial and historical situation . The loss of that potential is a diminution of the entire Jewish people .
