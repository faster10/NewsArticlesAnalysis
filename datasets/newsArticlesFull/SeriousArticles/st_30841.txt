" One distracts her , another grabs the girl ' s arm . That ' s what they should have done , " Hanna said . " She had a kitchen paring knife , but hadn ' t cut . She was a kid throwing a tantrum . They should have made an attempt to grab the kid , not use a weapon to throw her into a wall . A Taser ' s not meant to kill , but it does kill . Many people have died after being hit by a Taser by cops . It never should be used on a little child . She certainly wasn ' t presenting a danger to officers . "
