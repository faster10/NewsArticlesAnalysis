Just a month ago , on the eve of New Year , news started coming in from Cologne , Germany , on how the refugees and asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin ( mostly from Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia ) had groped and sexually assaulted more than 100 German women in the city centre outside the central railway station of Haupt Bahnhof and in front of a church . Reportedly , more than 1 , 000 people had gathered there to celebrate New Year . The news was followed by an eruption of anti foreigner sentiment . Right wing Germans took to the streets and protested fanatically against the open door , pro refugee policy of German Chancellor Angela Markel . A hate campaign was launched in the media . Damage was done to the reputation of the foreigners of non German origin , especially Muslims , who are now derided across Europe under the slogan Rape of Europe .
