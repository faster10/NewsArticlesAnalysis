I do not know much about Islam , but I do know that all but a handful of the millions of Muslims in the United States are peaceful people . They are mothers and fathers , sisters and brothers , sons and daughters . I know that they live their lives of work , play and prayer , just like other Americans . I know they are appalled by violence done in the name of their faith , just like other Americans abhor violence done in the name of their religion . I know that thousands of Muslim clerics and hundreds of Islamic associations in this country and around the world have condemned terrorism . I also know , sadly , that this is not the picture of Islam that the media present in the daily news .
