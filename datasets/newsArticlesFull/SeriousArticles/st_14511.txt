8 . Hurry up , please . As this year ' s ceremony was running over its three hour limit , an announcer told the ballroom crowd at a commercial break to keep the last speeches brief . But DiCaprio ( accepting lead actor in a drama for " The Revenant " ) took his time , which caused the announcer to get back on and tell the best picture drama team whichever it may be to deliver a quick speech , because the show was out of time . " The Revenant " won the last award , and film ' s producers took the stage with a 56 second speech , delivered mostly by Inarritu . As the credits rolled , DiCaprio tried to take the mic again , but there wasn ' t any show left . Oh well there ' s always the Oscars .
