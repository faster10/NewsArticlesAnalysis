So how do you get better at doodling ? It ' s a delightfully easy task . Learners can start with the Visual Alphabet , a series of six flows " the point , line , arc , angle , spiral and loop , and the six forms " the oval , eye , triangle , rectangle , house and cloud . With these 12 " letters , " prospective doodlers can articulate any visual representation of any concept they can imagine . All it takes is a commitment to learning this language , native to our brain ' s visual cortex , and applying it to challenges either at work or at school . Rather than talking in circles about a complex subject , try doodling it using words and pictures . Show your teachers and colleagues another way to see information . The insights and aha moments will arrive naturally in the process .
