A war hero , a decent man , and a witty fellow , Dole also ran for president three times . In dismal campaigns in which he was sarcastic and caustic and at times seemed angry , Dole lost the nomination to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and to George H . W . Bush in 1988 . And in 1996 Bill Clinton , running for reelection , easily beat Dole . That year I did focus groups and I probed the issue of Dole ' s age ( he was 73 , a year younger than Bernie Sanders is now ) . " We don ' t care about his age , " panelists told me . " It ' s just that he acts old . . . He seems old . . . He thinks old . . . His ideas are old . "
