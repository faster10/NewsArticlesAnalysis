Henderson : You know what , Josh ? That ' s one of the most exciting things for me is to be able to videoconference because I have a son and his wife and two children that live in St . Louis . I have a daughter in Florida . And they have two children . And now I can actually see them . I have a new granddaughter who is just a year old . I can watch her grow , and I can talk to them . To me , that is the most exciting thing . And so I ' m encouraging older adults to really stay connected and use your brain .
