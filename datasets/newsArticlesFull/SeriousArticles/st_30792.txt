5 . This game matters . Yes , it ' s a regular season game . Duncan ' s out . This decides nothing in the grand scheme of things . But it matters . Remember , last year one game dropped the Spurs from the two seed to the sixth seed and a matchup with the Clippers in the first round , which they lost . The stakes are unlikely to be that drastic this year , but if you look ahead to late May and a potential Western Conference Finals between these two , you realize how vital a Game 7 at home could be . You need every advantage if you ' re going to face either of these teams in a playoff series . These two will play again a few more times this year , but you need this game for the record , you need this game for tiebreaker , and you need this game to put yourself in the best position for a title . The regular season never matters . . . until it does .
