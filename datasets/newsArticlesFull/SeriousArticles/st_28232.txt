I remember sitting at the Chicago Cubs series , Wright said . And we score runs early ( in Game 4 ) and you re thinking , Ok , this can t be going like this . Something has got to happen . And you re kind of waiting for some of those speed bumps , which we ve experienced plenty of the last few years . You go out there and you play good baseball and you re prepared . You have good players and good clubhouse guys . . . I just think that a lot of the year we ve caught breaks , we ve had things go in our favor . . . So I guess fate s somewhat of a strong word , but we ve definitely gotten some good bounces , gotten some breaks , we ve had some things go our way .
