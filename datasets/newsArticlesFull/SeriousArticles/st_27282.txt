A blog post ? on the company ' s website earlier this month emphatically noted that its nanotainer " has ? already been cleared by FDA for use with our HSV 1 test . FDA had to review and clear all our proprietary systems , ? including the nanotainer ? tubes , ? in order to clear even this one test . Why ? Because we re innovative . Because we are doing things differently . Now we re working with them on clearance of just the nanotainer tubes across all tests . But it s the same tube . We ve already met their rigorous standards in our first submission on our systems , and we ll continue to do so . "
