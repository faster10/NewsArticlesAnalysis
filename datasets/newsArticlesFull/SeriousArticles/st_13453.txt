Ease of communication and a generous democratic impulse mean that information originally designed for decision makers , now gets routinely sent via the media to very large numbers of people . It is as if a dossier , with the latest news from Kiev , which might properly arrive on the desk of a minister has accidentally been delivered to the wrong address and ends up on the breakfast table of a librarian in Colchester or an electrician in Pitlochry . But the librarian or electrician might quite reasonably turn round and politely point out that they can ' t do anything with this knowledge and that , surely , the files have come to them by mistake . They don ' t , but only because habit has closed our eyes to the underlying strangeness of the phenomenon .
