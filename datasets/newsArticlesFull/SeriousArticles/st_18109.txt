RuPaul : We had to because this show was so near and dear to so many people ' s hearts , and we ' re really changing the level that people come to expect from drag . During the Bush era , drag really had been the step child of the gay right ' s movement , even though we were the ones who got things rocking at Stonewall . So , I love drag , I love the art of drag , I love people who have the chutzpah to really get down and do drag because it takes a lot of balls to do drag and it takes a lot of courage for someone to get out there and say , " You know what ? I know what society expects of me , but you know what ? F you , I ' m going to do it anyway . "
