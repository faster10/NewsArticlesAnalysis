Trump s strategy is nearly perfect . On the one hand , he s tapped into a vein of resentment in the country , and in a way no serious politician could . And on the other hand , he s free to say whatever he wants , no matter how controversial , because doing so breathes more oxygen into his campaign . Even more advantageous , he s entered the race at an ideal time . The public ? for good reasons ? no longer trusts Washington . Trump is a hack who can t fix anything , but people make bad decisions when they re anxious or angry , and Trump is offering them an alternative to the status quo . This is what demagogues do , and it usually works .
