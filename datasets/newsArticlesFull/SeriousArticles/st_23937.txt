Both Rep . Hunter and the Peralta family have challenged the Washington Post article , which they insist contains inaccuracies and factual omissions . While admitting in a letter to the Post that the eyewitness accounts " have always differed , " Hunter accused the newspaper of ignoring " the full body of evidence " and inaccurately describing the situation that day in Falluja . Moreover , according to Politico , the allegation that Peralta ' s fellow Marines concocted an alternate narrative had already been reported in the Marine Corps Times . Yet a colonel assigned to investigate the case found no evidence to back up that claim .
