I have what is called familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Only 5 to 10 of ALS patients have this genetic disposition . My grandmother Marie was diagnosed when I was in middle school . She passed away six years later . My mother , Catherine , was diagnosed when I was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years . Although most of my mom ' s muscles have atrophied away , she ' s the longest living ALS patient in her clinic . She is the most beautiful and inspirational person you will ever meet .
