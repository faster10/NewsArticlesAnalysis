The movie begins , not unpromisingly , with Ed Gein murdering his older brother and Hitchcock stepping in to the frame to deliver one of his mordantly witty teasers . It ' s a cute joke , but it soon turns sour in facile scenes featuring the tormented and delusional Hitch confiding to an imaginary Gein , presented here as a soul mate , confessor and psychiatrist all rolled into one . It ' s a terrible idea , and all the more insidious because of the casting : Hopkins ' most famous role remains Hannibal Lecter , and " The Silence of the Lambs " was influenced by Gein ' s macabre penchant for taxidermy .
