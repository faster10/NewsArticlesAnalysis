And then on top of that , what people are looking at is a campaign finance system that is corrupt . They re going to turn on their TV and there s some super PAC telling them why together candidate is the worst candidate in the history of the world . And billionaires are spending unlimited money on campaigns . How do you think people feel about that ? The message that we have is a message for the middle class working families , low income people all over this country who are hungry and crying out for a very significant change in the current economic and political system .
