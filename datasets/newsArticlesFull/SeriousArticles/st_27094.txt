It is just plain wrong that anyone in the U . S . government leaked the name of the CIA asset in Pakistan , Dr Shakil Afridi , who was recruited by the agency in its quest to find bin Laden . This information first surfaced in a story in the Guardian newspaper in July 2011 after Afridi was arrested by the Pakistani intelligence service , ISI . It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the Americans but the Pakistanis who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid , which embarrassed them considerably .
