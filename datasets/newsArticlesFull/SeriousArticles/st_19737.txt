The good news is that social media give us all the ability to be content curators , media makers and rabble rousers . If you want to fill your feed with messages of body acceptance , you can choose pages and accounts to follow that will deliver those messages . Sure , I still have to report spammy " belly busting " advertising , but the content I see and share through social media reflects my values and interests and I have no interest in seeing anything related to weight loss or body shaming . Rather than consuming and internalizing media toxicity , we can use social media talk back to a culture that makes us feel like we ' re never good enough .
