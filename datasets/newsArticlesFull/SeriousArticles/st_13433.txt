America has been through big changes before ? wars and depression , the influx of immigrants , workers fighting for a fair deal , and movements to expand civil rights . Each time , there have been those who told us to fear the future who claimed we could slam the brakes on change , promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control . And each time , we overcame those fears . We did not , in the words of Lincoln , adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past . Instead we thought anew , and acted anew . We made change work for us , always extending America s promise outward , to the next frontier , to more and more people . And because we did ? because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril ? we emerged stronger and better than before .
