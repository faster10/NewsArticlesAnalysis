The point was clear : Neither president , nor any other sane leader , wants to go to war with Russia over this single , if unnerving , incident . Obama made the point explicitly : My top priority , he said , is to ensure that this does not escalate . He has good reasons . First ( though he didn t say as much ) , a brief aerial border crossing is no cause of war . Second ( and he did make this point ) , Russia s role is crucial in the settlement of Syria : The question is whether Putin will impede or promote that goal . There is ? as Obama said ? a potential convergence of interests between Russia and the West to promote it , so it s worth trying to make that so .
