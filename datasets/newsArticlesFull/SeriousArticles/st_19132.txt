Obama ' s speech was never going to satisfy critics and those convinced they know the better route . But the fact of the speech alone appropriately solemn in recognition of the fact that the killings in San Bernardino , Chattanooga and at Fort Hood were terrorist attacks spoke volumes . And though he identified the California terrorists as Islamic State inspired , he surely disappointed those insistent in their own cultish fashion that Obama refuses to name the enemy and , therefore , can ' t defeat him . An absurdity . A dead terrorist is a dead terrorist by any name .
