Miller : It will be set on a solid piece of granite that ' s in the shape of a pentagon . Not just to symbolize that building alone but the military and country . And having that . . . phoenix wing coming out of the ashes with that piece of the trade tower there , that wing can incorporate some of the emotion of the planes that were hijacked . And then we ' ll have flight markers made out of granite . Four , one for each flight , with a timeline of all of the events for each flight on each marker . So the whole site is in a 52 foot circle in front of DeKalb County police and fire headquarters .
