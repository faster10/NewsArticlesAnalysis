Sanders plan also calls for a small tax on financial transactions , called a Robin Hood Tax by National Nurses United and international campaigners , that would downsize and stabilize high speed , high volume trading and at the same time raise an estimated 350 billion a year . Some experts think this reform may bring bigger benefits to the U . S . economy than other aspects of Sanders ' s plan . " In many ways the financial transactions tax is more fundamental . It would dramatically reduce the size of the industry . Tens of billions of dollars that are spent each year creating complex financial instruments and rapidly trading stocks , bonds , and other assets would instead be diverted to the productive economy , " said economist Dean Baker . Sanders says he would use the money to provide for free and universal higher education .
