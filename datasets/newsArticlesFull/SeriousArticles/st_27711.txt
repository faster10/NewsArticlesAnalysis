The Clark Theater is long gone , but today each person has far more movie programming choices than the Clark ever offered . You are able to routinely stumble across movies that haven ' t seen the inside of a theater in years , but that can jolt you with their moments of brilliance and insight into the human condition and the mysteries of the yearning heart . Or you can just sit back and enjoy the talent and artistry in front of you each motion picture , by its nature , offers its own enchantments , and the fact that people today can so easily make individual choices about what to see democratizes the viewing experience in a way that simply was not possible until recent decades .
