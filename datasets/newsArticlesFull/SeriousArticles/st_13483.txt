' David Bentley was also my partner in crime when it came to taking the p out of Mr Capello . I remember looking at the gaffer on my first day and thinking , ' I can ' t believe how much he looks like Postman Pat it ' s him ! ' Bentley obviously loved it ' Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ! ' and when we were on the team coach , we sat at the back and started singing the Postman Pat theme tune . A few of the boys joined in I think Rio , Ashley Cole and Jermaine Jenas might have had a quiet little sing along but most of the other dry lunches weren ' t really up for it . '
