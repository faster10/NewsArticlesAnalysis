Alabama and Clemson have more in common than one might think , especially on the coaching side . Former Clemson coach Frank Howard , the sainted patriarch of the program and the namesake of the Tigers tradition surrounding Howard s Rock , played his college football at Alabama . Howard ran the Clemson program from 1940 to 1969 when he retired and was replaced by Hootie Ingram , another Alabama grad . Ingram went on to be the least successful head coach in Clemson history , but the Crimson Tide also gave the Tigers their two most successful leaders . Charley Pell , a defensive tackle at Alabama from 1961 1963 , revived the program in the late 70s . And when he left to go to take a job at the University of Florida , he handed the reins to Danny Ford , an offensive tackle at Alabama from 1967 1969 . Ford went on to deliver the Tigers their only national championship in 1981 , and is the winningest coach in program history not named Frank Howard . No3 on the list of coaching wins for the Tigers is current coach Dabo Swinney , an Alabama boy who was a walk on receiver for the Crimson Tide from 1990 1993 . Swinney could bring the Tigers their second national title Monday night , but he will have to go through his alma mater to do so .
