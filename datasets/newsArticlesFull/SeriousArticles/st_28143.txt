Some monsoons are more active than others , and there can be a myriad of reasons for this . I think the monsoon rainfall was enhanced in September by numerous tropical systems interacting with the monsoon trough . But other reasons could be much more complicated . There could be interactions with other large scale weather and climate variables , such as El Nino or La Nina ( in the case of this summer , La Nina was in place , and this does normally lead to higher than average precipitation in South East Asia ) . Sea surface temperatures that are slightly above or below average can also lead to a variation in monsoon rainfall . Scientists will need to look into how all of these potential ingredients came together to produce these flooding rains .
