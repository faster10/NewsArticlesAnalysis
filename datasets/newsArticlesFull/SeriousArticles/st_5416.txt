Military radar can cover areas not covered by civilian air traffic control . But without the plane ' s transponder working , that target tracked by radar is only " skinpaint , " or the reflection of a dense object . It can ' t identify the plane or give an altitude . And even the radar can only provide so much information . It ' s possible for a plane to literally fly under the radar because coverage usually doesn ' t go all the way down to the surface . In that case , a plane could continue undetected even in areas covered by radar .
