While at least the more abrasive aspects of the American presence in Iraq are likely to diminish , I believe that in the eyes of all three groups of Iraqis , the withdrawal will be regarded as cosmetic rather than real . In this event , it seems likely that the current friction among at least America , the Sunni Arab rebels and the Shia government will not abate much while the Kurds will continue to cultivate their close but covert relationship with Israel . And if America ' s relationship with Iran worsens , the Kurds and Americans will draw closer .
