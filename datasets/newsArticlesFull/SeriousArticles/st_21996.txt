New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday , " It ' s hard to believe , given the coverage that all of the press has given this situation , that any voters in his district aren ' t familiar with the situation , what happened , whatever , and they will have an opportunity to express themselves in one year and four months from now . In the meantime , you know , I keep saying , this country has lots of very big problems that maybe we should all focus on and Congress should certainly get back to work and focus on . "
