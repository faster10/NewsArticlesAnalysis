Willimon : It ' s sort of yes and no . When I first began season 1 , we had not made a decision that we would release all 13 episodes at once . So I wrote it thinking it has to be able to work both ways . What affected the writing most was knowing we had two seasons guaranteed before I even started . I knew we had 26 hours , and there were things I could lay into the very beginning of season 1 that wouldn ' t boomerang back to the very end of season 2 . So it ' s knowing you have such a large canvas to paint on .
