As the film makes clear , gone are the days of cops vs . robbers , heroes vs . villains , good guys vs . bad guys . It shows the difficult to swallow reality that criminals are sometimes very likable , otherwise upstanding people whose ethics ( and their commitment to them ) often puts the rest of us to shame , law breaking perhaps being the major exception . The film also points to the notion that what constitutes " illegal " is ever shifting , as the increasing number of states legalizing marijuana seems to equally point out . Drug dealers once viewed as social pariahs can now legally sell their goods in states like Colorado . And as the families of Michael Brown , Eric Garner , Freddie Gray , and the 13 African American women sexually assaulted by rapist and former police officer Daniel Holtzclaw know , what constitutes a " good guy " is heavily determined by your vantage point .
