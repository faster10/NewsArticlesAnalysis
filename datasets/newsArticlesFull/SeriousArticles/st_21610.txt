This isn t the breathy , prettily recessive ? Sia of the early aughts , a sometime singer for ? downtempo British duo Zero 7 and solo ? starlet whose Breathe Me , a . k . a . the Death ? Montage Song from HBO s Six Feet Under , ? became her American calling card . Her move ? to Los Angeles and subsequent years spent ? crafting stadium scale anthems for the Hot ? 100 varsity squad ( Katy , Kelly , Britney , ? Beyonc ) seems to have amplified her reach ? and range . Nearly every track on Acting is ? built on what the singer herself has dubbed ? victim to victory themes ? tales of triumph ? over hardship , drawn in Sharpie and ? slathered with self love metaphors : She is a ? bird set free , a house on fire , a Porsche with ? no brakes ( two of the three of those sound ? like they will seriously affect her insurance ? premiums , but anyway ) . One Million Bullets ? and the bombastic Unstoppable pile ? on the can t hold me down analogies , and ? Footprints is basically a pastor s office ? poster set to synths ( Only two footprints in ? the sand Thought you d abandoned me and ? let go of my hand But you were carrying me , ? carrying me to safety ) . Somehow , though , ? broad strokes suit these songs Sia s ? unabashed aim is uplift , and her feel for ? sing along until your neighbor bangs on the radiator hooks rarely falters . Her less ? introspective side ? the one that penned ? Vegas pool party jams like David Guetta s ? Titanium and Flo Rida s Wild Ones ? emerges too , on the stuttering , Thong ? Song riffing Sweet Design and Major ? Lazer ish rave up Cheap Thrills .
