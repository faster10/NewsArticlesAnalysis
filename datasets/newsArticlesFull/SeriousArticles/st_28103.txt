I think the leaders can ' t come from the political sphere , because any political opponent was murdered a long time ago , suppressed , chased out of the country and so on . People from other professions must become politicians quickly , overnight . That ' s something what we have experienced . I believe that the younger generation , students , etc . will offer , will create , and will form such personalities . Five days is enough . In the modern media era , a few days is enough so that a person becomes generally known and viewed as someone who really cares about freeing people , about democracy .
