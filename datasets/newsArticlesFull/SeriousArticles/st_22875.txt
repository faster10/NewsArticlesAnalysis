What most people don ' t realize is that if federal funding for PBS were cut , much of the loss would be on the local level . The vast majority of taxpayer funds for PBS ( 1 . 35 per person per year ) goes to local stations , many of which serve rural areas , where losing funding would mean stations going dark . We remind Mr Romney that when small businesses go out of business , not only are their products no longer available to the public , people lose their jobs . Where is the gain in saving the 1 . 35 a year ? We see only loss .
