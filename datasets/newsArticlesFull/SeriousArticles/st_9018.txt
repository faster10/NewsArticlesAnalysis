These sorts of issues tend to blend over on good teams as the year continues . If you recall , anyone could ve written similar blurbs about last year s Clippers , who got off to a 5 4 start and looked lackluster for basically the first three quarters of the season before getting hot at the end of the year and eventually beating the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs . But this year s team was supposed to have some of those plagues cured , especially with the edition of Pierce , whose production has sunk thus far this season and whose crunch time defense along with Jamal Crawford s led to a bunch of those fourth quarter 3s .
