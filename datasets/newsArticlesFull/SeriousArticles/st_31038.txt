In sticking to this strategy , Cruz has demonstrated a protracted display of tactical restraint . He has relentlessly embraced Trump and avoided opportunities to attack him . Normally , Cruz is not shy about calling out apostates . He s done it on the Senate floor and at countless conservative gatherings . He s made a career of it . Were he running against Sen . Trump and not Front Runner With Lots of Money Trump , Cruz , it s not hard to imagine , would be fileting Trump for his shifting positions on issues from taxes to abortion . ( He s doing a version of that now to Sen . Marco Rubio . )
