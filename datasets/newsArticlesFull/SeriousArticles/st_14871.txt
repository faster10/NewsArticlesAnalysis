When I think about the suffering that I have seen of women around the world ? I ve been in hospitals in Brazil where half the women were enthusiastically and joyfully greeting new babies , and the other half were fighting for their lives against botched abortions . I ve been in African countries where 12 and 13 year old girls are bearing children . I have been in Asian countries where the denial of family planning consigns women to lives of oppression and hardship . Family planning is an important part of women s health . And reproductive health includes access to abortion .
