You could tell DeAndre Brackensick was a shoo in for the wild card before he ' d even begun " Georgia On My Mind " pretty much because of his hair . You just cannot NOT put that hair in the Top 13 when the hair owner in question also has this super high , very pure voice which , as of yet , he has no idea how to handle . The vocal coaches will help him , and he ' ll either figure it out in the near future or he ' ll crash and burn like the fire Eben Franckewitz never quite set to the rain . DeAndre is an adorable , sweaty , unpredictable sweetheart and I love not knowing what crazy hairography or misguided vocal gymnastics he ' ll try to pull off next . I ' m into it .
