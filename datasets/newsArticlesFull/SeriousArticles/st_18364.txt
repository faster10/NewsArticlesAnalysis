But there are limits to how much the Bond films can change without destroying their DNA . Nowadays , some ask why 007 can t be portrayed as a gay man , or be played by a woman . That probably won t happen . As Roger Moore said , That s not what Ian Fleming wrote . Of course , Fleming s original novels ran out a long time ago , and many other writers have been called on to continue his iconic character in films . So anything is possible , but some changes are unlikely . Judi Dench may have taken over the very male role of M , Bond s boss , but the Bond girls will always be sexy and beautiful , even as their roles become more textured . The Bond action scenes will always be awesome , and his gadgets ever intriguing . And I think Bond should remain the alpha male ? the man we ve grown to love . Some things are best left unchanged for the survival of a species .
