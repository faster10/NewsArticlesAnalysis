The Vikings are moving into a beautiful new indoor stadium on the site of the old Metrodome next season , which doesn t do the Vikings , Seahawks or the fans any good Sunday for the wild card game outdoors at the University of Minnesota . The high is expected to be 4 degrees with a low of minus 4 and a wind chill of minus 11 . Who has the edge ? When it s this cold , nobody . This will be the coldest playoff game since the 2007 NFC title game between the Giants and Packers when it was minus 1 at kickoff with a wind chill of minus 23 . The Giants won in overtime and Coughlin s cheeks have never been the same . The Packers also lost to the 49ers at Lambeau in a 2013 wild card game when the temperature was 5 degrees with a wind chill of minus 10 .
