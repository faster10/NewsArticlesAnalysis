Jon Hamm : Unlike the SAGs and the Emmys , the Globes have no problem dumping you and never calling back . Hamm has been MIA from the Globes drama lead actor field the past two years , but the HFPA found some room for him for Mad Men ' s final season . ( The afterglow of his first Emmy win sure helps too . ) Though Hamm has never won an individual SAG Award , he does have a Golden Globe for Mad Men but he won it the year of the writers ' strike , so this is the HFPA ' s chance to get him onstage and deliver a charming , funny speech . If he does prevail again , he ' d be the fifth actor to win the category twice .
