In his opinion , there is no opposition , really . What you have are about four main groups of the right wing parties : you have Trotskyists under Jean Luc M lenchon ? absolutely ridiculous when it comes to foreign policy they supported bombing of Libya right wing neoconservatives with dressed up in socialist language . Then you have Francois Hollande , a neoconservative , utterly discredited politics . You have Nikolas Sarkozy ? a gangster , basically , he should be in jail and Marine Le Pen . So , you don t have a choice in mainstream politics . I don t really think any of them are going to change France .
