Darren Rovell , ESPN . com : " For the last two decades , Los Angeles was valuable because the threat of going there allowed teams to leverage their cities to the max . But now that the Rams will be there , is it really the golden opportunity it has been made out to be ? Kroenke will start with an undisclosed franchise fee probably worth at least 500 million . He ' s also privately financing the Inglewood stadium to the tune of 1 . 8 billion . And what does he get in return ? A lot of uncertainties . Sure , the Rams might have once been in the area , but they don ' t have a ton of fans there ready to spring up and buy season tickets they ' ve lost an entire generation during their time away . Plus , they have the added downside of relocating and then having to wait three years to open their new stadium . And remember : The Rams aren ' t exactly putting the best product on the field right now , having endured nine losing seasons in a row . That could be a tough sell in Los Angeles , whose residents are all about being at the ' in ' place . I think you ' ll see people buy tickets on a one off basis rather than get season tickets . Just wait and see what Staples Center is like once Kobe Bryant leaves town . "
