What stood out for me was the almost universal opinion among my Pakistani colleagues that Prime Minister Modi was actually NOT interested in peace with Pakistan , that Pakistan is not on his agenda . I don ' t agree . It is Prime Minister Modi who took the initiative to invite Nawaz Sharif for his swearing in , surprising everyone in the process , and it is Mr Modi who decided to reach out again and ask for a meeting in Ufa , Russia earlier this year . Ufa fell apart because Pakistan did not honour what was agreed on in the joint statement to discuss terrorism .
