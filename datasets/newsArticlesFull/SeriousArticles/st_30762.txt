This faith in torture as an interrogation tool is prevalent within the Republican field despite the fact that the Bush administration s torture program was a brutal and ghastly nightmare that operated without oversight and swept up innocent people while providing no intelligence gains . As The Week s Ryan Cooper has assiduously documented , scientific investigations and other inquiries have determined pretty conclusively that torture is a worthless interrogation tool . It also harms intelligence gathering efforts by alienating law enforcement personnel who have moral objections to torture . There exists no practical or moral justification for employing torture . But Republicans either defend the practice or refuse to rule it out because it s part of the Republican national security legacy and they believe it makes them look like tough , responsible stewards of national security .
