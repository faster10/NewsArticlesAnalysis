Harris ' injuries are horrific , and he ' s on multiple medications . In an early scene , his wife is driving the pair on a shopping trip and he ' s going through his meds ( OxyContin , Dilaudid , etc . ) . It ' s a pharmacy of addictive painkillers . Later in the film , one of Harris ' doctors explains the process of weaning him off the drugs , including withdrawal and the risk of dependency . It ' s clear that Harris doesn ' t want to have to use the drugs forever , as he continuously complains of being nauseated and out of it , but he is also is just as clearly becoming dependent on them .
