But fortunately , none of this was necessary : Coldplay fans already have a safe space . Concerts were my refuge , my sanctuary , the place where I could belt out the oh oh ohs of Viva la Vida with no fear of social calamity . ( At the last show I attended , we fans really pushed our luck , continuing to sing the refrain en masse between the Emirates Stadium and Arsenal station . Miraculously , no one beat us up . ) A Coldplay show forges an alliance of the uncool . Given the adversity we face as Coldplay fans in the outside world , it s all the more moving to join voices it s practically all we can do to keep from joining hands and bawling together at the sheer beauty of it all .
