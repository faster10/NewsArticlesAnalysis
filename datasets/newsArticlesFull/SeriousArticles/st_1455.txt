With seven men in front of him instead of five , Newton has more time in the pocket , which is why Carolina s aerial attack is one of the league s most vertical . The Panthers are very consistent in how they tactically employ their max protection , too . If Newton diagnoses a blitz , the protection almost always involves what s called a full line slide , with all five linemen sliding in one direction , and the two extra blockers ? often Dickson and the running back ? sealing off the backside in the other direction .
