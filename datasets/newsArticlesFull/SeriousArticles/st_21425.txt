The better response than " who knows ? " is " who cares ? " One ' s theological views just don ' t tell much about a person ' s competence to perform a civil office . Voters should care most about how a candidate would deal with Social Security ' s insolvency , end America ' s constant warring in the Middle East , craft U . S . policy toward a rising China , address dependency as well as poverty among the poor , encourage children ' s access to safe schools which educate , and deal with other serious policy issues . Where the candidates stand on a literal resurrection , baptism by sprinkling , and the nature of the host doesn ' t matter much for being president .
