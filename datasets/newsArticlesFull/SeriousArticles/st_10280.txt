Standing at the line for 30 seconds and rifling off " Omaha " 15 times before snapping the ball into a counter play or a bubble screen isn ' t going to cut it . Brady will throw the ball 50 plus times on dinks and dunks , pushing the pass , attacking that defense , mitigating Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware with the three step drops , and establishing a pace I simply do not believe Manning can maintain at this stage . If the Broncos can ' t hold New England to taking three points instead of seven , I don ' t see this version of Manning being able to operate to the degree the game may demand . An early Pats lead of two scores or more , and the Broncos had better be willing and able to execute at a tempo they never even flirted with reaching in their opening playoff game .
