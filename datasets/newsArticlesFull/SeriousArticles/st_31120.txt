This argument is obviously problematic . For if Snowden is allowed to break the law whenever he likes , then why shouldn ' t others ? Should we allow a fiscal conservative in the military to reveal a nuclear weapons programs he deems too expensive ? Should a Secret Service officer who supports Greenpeace be allowed to disclose the use of a decoy Air Force One because the increased carbon emissions hurt his conscience ? What these hypotheticals make clear is that when officials break the law they must be able to give reasons why we the public would want the secret exposed , not why they would want the secret exposed .
