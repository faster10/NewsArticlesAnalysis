What I remember most in this moment of painful leave taking is his humour , intelligence , wisdom and kindness . His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word . The intransigence which made him the great artist he was ? his ineffable and cynical wit , the clarity with which he saw most things , including me , and the fact that he never spared me the view . I learned a lot from him . He was the finest of actors and directors . I couldn t wait to see what he was going to do with his face next . I consider myself hugely privileged to have worked with him so many times and to have been directed by him .
