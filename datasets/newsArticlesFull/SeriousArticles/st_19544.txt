President Pe ? a Nieto could probably still issue an executive order to extradite Guzm n before he faces trial in Mexico , and given what happened last time , he may be under strong pressure from the U . S . to do so . The arrest comes at an awkward time in U . S . Mexico relations . In October , the U . S . State Department cut some anti drug funding to Mexico over human rights concerns , following heavy criticism over Pe ? a Nieto s handling of the disappearance of 43 students ? a rare case of the U . S . criticizing Mexico s handling of the drug war . Giving up a public enemy of El Chapo s stature would be embarrassing for the Mexican government , but perhaps not as embarrassing as seeing him waltz out of jail a third time . ?
