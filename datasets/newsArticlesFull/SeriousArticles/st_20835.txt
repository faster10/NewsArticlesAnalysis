The business of Hollywood movies has increased from Rs 22 , 762 crore in 2014 to Rs 43 , 779 crore last year , according to a trade magazine . The films that scored an Oscar nomination , however , either did not do well in India or are yet to be released . While films like ' Spectre ' and ' Star Wars : The Force Awakens ' did well at the Box Office and managed to bag a nomination , these were not winners in the major awards categories , but for Best Original Score , Best Animated Feature , etc .
