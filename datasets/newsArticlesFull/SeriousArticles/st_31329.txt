Sometimes in life , we all make decisions we ultimately regret . If Gene Chizik had to do it over , I ' m sure he wouldn ' t have worn that hideous leather jacket back in 2010 on the National Championship trophy stand . I bet Brian Kelly wishes he hadn ' t violently attacked one of his own assistant coaches on the sidelines a few weeks back ( although let ' s be honest , haven ' t we all wanted to attack a co worker every now and again ? ) . Crap , I bet Michigan would like a do over for the entire last decade prior to this season .
