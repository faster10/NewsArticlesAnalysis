" We understand that in carrying out this task with the maximum preparation and efficiency , we will be protecting our people , and our brothers in the Caribbean and Latin America , and prevent its spread , which sadly has been introduced and could spread further in the United States , which has so many personal links and interchanges it maintains with the rest of the world . We will gladly cooperate with American personnel on this task , and not in search of peace between the two countries that have been adversaries for so many years , but , in any case , for world peace , an objective that can and should be sought .
