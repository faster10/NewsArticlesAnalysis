Perhaps . But it ' s more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies . Demonic tales have made a mini comeback in the last few years starting with the success of 2005 s " The Exorcism of Emily Rose , " which earned 75 . 1 million domestically . Since then , similar titles like 2009 s " The Haunting in Connecticut " ( 55 . 4 million ) , 2010 s " The Last Exorcism " ( 41 million ) , and 2011 s " Insidious " ( 54 million ) have all proven lucrative thanks to their tiny budgets . " Insidious , " for example , cost just 1 . 5 million to make . Of course , the " Paranormal Activity " movies ( the fourth of which was just announced this week ) are the biggest success stories of this whole trend . A total of 8 million has been spent making the three " found footage " movies , yet they have earned 296 . 7 million domestically .
