The painting is described as being on an engraved background , decorated with gold , dating from about 1285 to 1290 . Sotheby ' s had described it as sharing " an affinity with models by Duccio di Buoninsegna " ( a painter of that time from the Tuscan city of Siena ) but concluded that it was more likely the work of a Florentine painter influenced by Cimabue ( a pioneer in the post Byzantine style who was a contemporary of Duccio ) , according to documents cited in a forfeiture complaint filed this week in the Manhattan U . S . attorney ' s office .
