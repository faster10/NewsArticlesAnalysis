" You can walk away knowing you ' ve always played with everything you have , babe . I ' m so proud of you . I ' m proud of everything you ' ve given to all of your fans even when you weren ' t feeling your best . You ' ve always pushed through it because you played for those fans that sacrificed so much to see you play in person . You mean so much to us all . I ' m so excited to see what God has in store for us as a family now that one chapter is closing and new ones are opening . We love you ! ? ?
