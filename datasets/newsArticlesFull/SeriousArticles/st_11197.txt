But wouldn ' t Trump do just as poorly as Cruz in a general election , if not worse ? He well might . On the other hand , Trump could move to the center in the general , since his ideological beliefs are very flexible , to say the least . Whether this would work is another question , but there ' s at least a possibility that Trump ' s appeal to blue collar whites could work in swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio , which would probably be completely out of reach for Cruz . And there are some who believe that even if Trump loses , he ' s such a unique character that his fortunes would rub off on Republicans running for down ballot offices .
