Once again , Grease is the word ( a phrase and song that never did make any sense , but never mind ) . Fox jumps into the musical arena with this live ( in the East ) version of the popular Broadway hit and movie . There s talent in the cast , which includes Vanessa Hudgens as Rizzo , Aaron Tveit as Danny , Julianne Hough as Sandy and Carly Rae Jepsen as Frenchy . But the most encouraging hire may be the director : Thomas Kail , who guided Hamilton to Broadway . If he can bring ? a touch of that magic to this camp chestnut , Grease could really be something to see .
