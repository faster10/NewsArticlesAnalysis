The Pacers , amid their stunning 12 5 start , have made swingman Solomon Hill available via trade , according to league sources . A first round draftee as recently as 2013 , Hill is out there after falling out of favor in Indiana despite playing in all 82 games last season and averaging 29 . 0 minutes in 2014 15 for the old , plodding Pacers . . . .

According to one trusted scout , Smart s hounding perimeter D makes him the new Tony Allen he simply refuses to be screened . . . . With the recent release of Martell Webster to open up a roster spot for Ryan Hollins , Washington is now paying 5 , 623 , 500 to players this season who aren t on the roster . That equates to 6 . 8 percent of the Wizards current 82 . 2 million payroll , which puts them at No . 3 in the league s dead money standings , narrowly ahead of Brooklyn . Detroit is at No . 2 , with 9 . 4 million or 12 . 2 percent of its 76 . 7 million payroll going to five waived players , most notably Josh Smith ( 5 . 4 million ) and Danny Granger ( 2 . 2 million ) . No team , of course , can compare to the 76ers , who are paying 25 . 9 million this season or 43 . 2 percent of Philly s 59 . 9 million outlay overall to eight players who were let go before the season started . JaVale McGee and Gerald Wallace , acquired by the Sixers in deals that cleared cap space for other teams and released soon thereafter , soak up 22 million of that total .
