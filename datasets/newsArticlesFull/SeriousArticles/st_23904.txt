You can t rush timid because if you do that , he s one of those pocket quarterbacks that can get the ball deep down the field , " Broncos linebacker DeMarcus Ware said . You have to be able to get pressure on him , but you have to be decisive on how you re rushing . You can t be a wild rusher with big , wide B gaps or let him run in the A gap and do what he wants to do because he s actually a running back himself . He can get yards and make big plays so you have to make sure the pocket is tight when you re rushing against him , but you still have to be aggressive . "
