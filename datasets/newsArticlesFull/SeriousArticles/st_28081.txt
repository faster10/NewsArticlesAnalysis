Zakaria : When the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , declared the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a " divine assessment , " he was indicating it was divinely sanctioned . But no one bought it . He was forced to accept the need for an inquiry into the election . The Guardian Council , Iran ' s supreme constitutional body , met with the candidates and promised to investigate and perhaps recount some votes . Khamenei has subsequently hardened his position but that is now irrelevant . Something very important has been laid bare in Iran today legitimacy does not flow from divine authority but from popular support .
