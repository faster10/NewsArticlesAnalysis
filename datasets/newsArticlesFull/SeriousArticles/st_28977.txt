As in other modern dress Shakespearean adaptations , there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production , which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights . The notion of the warrior hero who can carry battles single handedly doesn ' t really jibe with modern warfare , and it ' s been a while since we had a military man as president . Shakespeare ' s play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield , it ' s no qualification for success in politics .
