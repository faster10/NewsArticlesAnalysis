And if you think about , oil doesn ' t even have to stay at the 90 plus dollar level it is even at levels in the 70 ' s , 60 ' s , 50 ' s , 40 ' s , a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market . Yes , the investments are going up globally , but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region . And so over time , you ' re really going to see . . . I think continue to see . . . a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia .
