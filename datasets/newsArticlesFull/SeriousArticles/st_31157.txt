" Words can ' t express how grateful I am to the University of Missouri and all of the amazing people who make it up , from the administration to the students and our fans . Obviously , I ' m so appreciative to all of my coaches and athletes . Leaving them makes this decision so tough , but I do so feeling good that the Mizzou Football program is in a better place than it was when we came in 15 years ago . I feel that Mizzou is a great job at a great school and has so much going for it that they ' ll find an outstanding coach to move the program forward . "
