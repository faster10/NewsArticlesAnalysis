Monte Irvin s affable demeanor , strong constitution and coolness under pressure helped guide baseball through desegregation and set a standard for American culture . His abilities on the field as the consummate teammate are undeniable , as evidenced by World Series titles he contributed to in both the Negro and Major leagues , and a richly deserved plaque in Cooperstown . He was on the original committee that elected Negro League stars to the Hall of Fame , something for which the Museum will always be grateful .
