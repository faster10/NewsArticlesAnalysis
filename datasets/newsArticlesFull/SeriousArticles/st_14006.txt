Fitzgerald looks to be starting on another monster postseason run with his eight catch , 175 yard performance vs . Green Bay , highlighted by his 75 yard Hail Larry in overtime . Ideally the Panthers would put shutdown CB Josh Norman on Fitzgerald all game . But Fitzgerald plays more than half his snaps in the slot , and Norman does not play inside . That puts the onus on 5 10 , 190 pound nickel corner Cortland Finnegan . Fitzgerald ( 6 3 , 218 ) will have a big size advantage on Finnegan , not only in the passing game but also when blocking . Fitzgerald is a tenacious downfield blocker who could spring WRs John Brown and Marcus Floyd for big gains after catches if he takes Finnegan or another defender out .
