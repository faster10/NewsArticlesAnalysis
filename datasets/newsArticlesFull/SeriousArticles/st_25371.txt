" I used to tease him all the time , " Kobe Bryant said of Walton , his former teammate . " I told him he was the next Phil Jackson because he was an average player with a messed up back . I said , ' Dude , if this is not Phil I mean , you ' re a hippie , 6 9 ' or whatever he is . I used to rib him all the time about that . But honestly he always had a really brilliant mind and understanding flow and tempo and spacing and how to manage a team the right way . I couldn ' t be any happier for him . He looks very comfortable in that role . "
