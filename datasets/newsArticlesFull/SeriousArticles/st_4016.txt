" I don ' t mind a DNA test at all . No matter what I believe , public sentiment matters more because the person in question is someone as big as Netaji . Whether it is the ashes at Renkoji or a sample that was kept by Rama Murthy ( the chief of the Indian Independence League ) , a DNA test can definitely be conducted . However , one has to remember that the high heat to which the DNA of Netaji was exposed might have completely destroyed it . The fact that the DNA test on the Romanov family ( the last Tsar ) brought to rest a controversy does not mean that the same will be applicable to Netaji ' s ashes , " reasoned Bose . Much of Bose ' s inference on the Netaji mystery , which he writes in his book ' His Majesty ' s Opponent ' , is based on eyewitness accounts , he said . " I have carefully studied eyewitness accounts and I have not based my inferences only on the Shah Nawaz Commission or what Habibur Rehman had to say . Historian Leonard Gordon , the writer of the famous book ' Brothers Against the Raj ' has been my reference point , for example , " Bose said , adding that he had studied the 1979 account of three Japanese survivors who had deposed in great detail in front of Netaji ' s only progeny , Anita Pfaff . " They gave graphic details about Netaji ' s severe burns and the great pain he suffered in his last hours . Only yesterday , Anita , my grand aunt , vouched for that eyewitness account , " Bose said .
