We get it , bro . You want college players to get paid actual money . I guess a full ride on a 70K college degree and having zero debt after college isn t enough . Half of these players ( that s being generous ) couldn t get into these schools if not for sports , yet they get free educations from some of the most respected educational institutions on the planet . Once they blow through their money 5 years after they leave the league the degree s and education they would have earned had they stayed would have set them up for life , probably more so than the money they blow through . Seems legit .
