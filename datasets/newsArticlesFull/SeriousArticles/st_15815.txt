My reaction in all of politics is , talk is cheap , that you know where someone is based on their actions . As scripture says , You shall know them by their fruits . We had an epic battle , in Congress , just a couple years ago ? we re not talking about ten , twenty years ago , this was just a couple years ago ? on the question of amnesty . And , the argument that we need to secure the border first was an argument I was making over and over again , it was an argument that you were making over and over again , it was an argument Jeff Sessions was making over and over again . And , all the folks on the other side dismissed it , said we were wrong headed and anti immigrant for believing we should actually secure the borders . I have a deep and genuine disagreement with that view , so I ve got to say , as a voter , when politicians saying the exact opposite of what they ve done in office , I treat that with a pretty healthy degree of skepticism .
