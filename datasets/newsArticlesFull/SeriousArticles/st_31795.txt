In the 16th century , drawers became a common term for both men ' s and women ' s underpants . Made of linen , the items were no frills and looked more or less interchangeable ( this being well before Victoria ever had a secret decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century ) . Most likely , underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables drawing them up and over the lower part of the body .
