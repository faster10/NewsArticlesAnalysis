There is also the question of what do with Sunni areas like Ramadi once the militants are driven out . Jihadist fighters abandoned their last stronghold in Ramadi on Monday . They swept through northern and western Iraq in June 2014 and declared a " caliphate " to rule over all Muslims from territory in both Iraq and Syria , carrying out mass killings and imposing a draconian form of Sunni Islam . Anbar , including Ramadi , were major focuses of that campaign at the height of the 2003 2011 USA war in Iraq .
