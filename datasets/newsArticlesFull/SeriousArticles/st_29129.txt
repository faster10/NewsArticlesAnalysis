At the time , Coldplay were still small enough to be considered something of an indie outfit , but it was already clear that they weren t cool ? their songs were too easy to enjoy , too uncontroversial , for them to be seen as boundary pushing artists . Already , I found myself suffering some trepidation when telling friends I d been listening to the band . But it wasn t until after their third album , X Y , was released in 2005 that being a fan really became a liability . It was that year that Jon Pareles offered his case against Coldplay in the New York Times , in which he labeled them the most insufferable band of the decade . Since then , anti Coldplay fervor has only grown , with a review of last year s Ghost Stories in the Q uietus dubbing it one long stagnant f ing pool of premium grade f ing cockwash ( asterisks theirs ) . A commenter noted that the review was too lenient .
