That ' s frightening , of course . But how should the United States respond ? There will be all sorts of calls to action . Some have already said the U . S . should not let any Syrian refugees into the country ( even though neither Farook nor Malik were refugees or Syrian ) . Some will demand greater domestic surveillance and more policing of mosques . Some may urge sterner action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq ? no fly zones , more airstrikes and additional U . S . boots on the ground . Pressure may rise to curtail domestic liberties in the name of security . With a presidential race heating up , grandstanding candidates will weigh in with all sorts of notions .
