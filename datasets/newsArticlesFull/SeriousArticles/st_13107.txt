The Giants executed a very aggressive game plan on offense , and the Patriots defense had trouble handling it in the first half . On New York s first offensive possession , Giants quarterback Eli Manning hit wide receiver ? Odell Beckham Jr . for an 87 yard touchdown pass . New England cornerback Malcolm Butler was beaten on the play and safety Devin McCourty was late in providing help . Butler also picked up a pass interference penalty later in the game , but he otherwise covered Beckham extremely well after that touchdown . Beckham didn t score again , and he caught only three more passes for 17 yards .
