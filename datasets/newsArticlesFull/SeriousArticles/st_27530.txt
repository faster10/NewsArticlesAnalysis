In Libya , ISIS is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand . Last autumn it established a foothold in eastern Libya , bolstered by the return of 300 Libyan ISIS veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al Baghdadi . It is now the dominant force in Derna , has a presence in Benghazi and controls part of the town center in Sirte , on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen Egyptian Christians in February . It also has a growing presence in Tripoli , where its fighters in January carried out an attack on the five star Corinthia hotel that killed several Westerners .
