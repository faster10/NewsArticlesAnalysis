If Trump evinces such public enmity for Black lives , Mexican lives , and Muslim lives , then surely , he can be trusted to govern in a way that is overtly adversarial to all these groups . In floating the outrageous idea to register and track all Muslim Americans , he has explicitly declared his intent to govern in just such a way . My god sister and god brother are Black Muslims . I care about such policies because they are anti American but I care even more that such animus would do harm to people I love .
