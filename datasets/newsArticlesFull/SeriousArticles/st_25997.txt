The UN Under Secretary General and UN Women Executive Director Ms . Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka , said in a press release , Violence against women and girls remains one of the most serious ? and the most tolerated ? human rights violations . It is both a cause and a consequence of gender inequality and discrimination . Its continued presence is one of the clearest markers of societies out of balance and we are determined to change that . The focus must now be on prevention , and although there is no single solution to such a complex problem , there is growing evidence of the range of actions that can stop violence before it happens .
