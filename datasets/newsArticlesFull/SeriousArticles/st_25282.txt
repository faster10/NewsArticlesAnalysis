Dubai comedian Ali Al Sayed explained by email that there are limits on comedy content in much ( but not all ) of the Middle East when it comes to jokes about religion , sex and politics . Some of the restrictions are based on laws , while others are imposed by comedy show producers in the hopes of not offending audience members ( it ' s bad for business ) . Of the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo , Sayed wrote , " this ' gangsta Muslim ' response needs to stop , it has no place in our religion and is no way justified by the Quran . "
