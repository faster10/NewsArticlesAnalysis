When I was in Jordan , I met a man named Mohammed , who had fled after being threatened by militants . His life as a refugee was nothing like what he left in Syria . Like many refugees , his life wasn ' t too different from a middle class American ' s . " We had everything , " he told me on my visit to Za ' atari last year . He had a good job , a nice home and regular vacations with his family . Hanah , Mohammed ' s wife , told me , " Helping my children with homework was the most difficult part of my day . "
