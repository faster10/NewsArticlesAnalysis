The acquittal of Mubarak is further evidence that rule of law in Egypt is a mere illusion . What the courts of Egypt are telling us is that they have no intention of indicting anyone for the deaths of an estimated 846 civilians and the injuries inflicted in the thousands during the January 2011 uprising against Mubarak . Contrast this to the five year prison sentence slapped on pro democracy activist and blogger Alaa Abd El Fattah for participating in a protest opposing an anti protest law introduced under Sisi . Or with the three year sentence handed down to Amr Nohan , who was charged with attempting to overthrow the regime . His crime ? Posting a picture on Facebook of Sisi with Mickey Mouse ears .
