DiOrio : Based upon just what I ' ve read on the shootings , it appears that at least a couple of them are mentally disturbed in some way and they had access to these weapons . When the Assault Weapons Ban expired , people were allowed to purchase them again . When the mentally ill have access to them , it ' s inevitable that these tragedies are going to happen . It ' s very sad to me that not even Aurora took us to these discussions . It took the murder of 20 children before we were again willing to look at our gun laws and wonder whether or not we should make changes .
