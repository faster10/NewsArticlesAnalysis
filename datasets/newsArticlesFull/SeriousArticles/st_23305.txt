But the very fact that we have to gain entry to the conversation by stating our bona fides like this disturbs me . Culture is based on shared values and beliefs . Having to state that you ' re against the killing and maiming of families and the loved ones they were cheering on creates a rift where there isn ' t one , as if this value were not a settled part of what binds our culture . Could we even come up with a stance that more quickly and surely means that you ' re not a part of the lives we share together ?
