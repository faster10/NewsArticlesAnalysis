TRUMP CATCHES TED CRUZ IN A FLIP FLOP ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP . In the latest exchange of attacks between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz , Trump tweeted a video Tuesday morning showing Cruz flip flopping on the issue of birthright citizenship . ABC s JONATHAN KARL and HAYLEY WALKER note the video highlights a stark contrast between Cruz s support for the policy in 2011 compared to comments he made in 2015 , when he claimed that he has been against the policy for many years . Cruz is considered an American citizen because of his mother and many legal scholars have come to the consensus that he is a natural born citizen . http : abcn . ws 20cHcMb
