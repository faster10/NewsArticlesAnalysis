The contradictory representations in the Government Ethics Office and SEC filings are at best evasive and at worst a violation of federal law . A federal statute 18 U . S . C . 1001 provides that anyone who " in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive , legislative , or judicial branch of the Government of the United States , knowingly and willfully ( 1 ) falsifies , conceals , or covers up by any trick , scheme , or device a material fact ( 2 ) makes any materially false , fictitious , or fraudulent statement or representation " shall be fined or imprisoned . Violations of federal securities laws , including the making of false statements in a 13D filing , are independently punishable under the securities laws .
