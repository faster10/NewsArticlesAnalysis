Democrats have shown themselves little better at defending their own policies . Obama s handling of foreign policy and defense topics is far too casual , as when he drew a red line over Assad s chemical weapons , called ISIS a JV team after it took Fallujah and assured the nation multiple times in the fall of 2012 that Al Qaeda was on the run . If you want to be the adult in the room you can never indulge in juvenile tough talk . If you want to call out those who play politics with foreign policy , you can t play politics with it either , not even in the waning days of a close election . If you want us to trust in your protection , you can never be heard to underestimate our enemy .
