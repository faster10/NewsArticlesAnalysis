Four years ago , according to the Campaign Finance Institute ( my source for all these numbers ) , by September 30 Paul had a little more than 7 , 000 itemized individual donors the people who give between 201 and the top individual limit , which was then 2 , 300 ( and is now 2 , 500 ) . This time around , he had more than 12 , 000 itemized individual donors at the end of September . ( By comparison , Mitt Romney only had 19 , 700 itemized individual donors this past September 30 , compared to 29 , 700 four years ago . )
