Eliminating the two pilot conspiracy , then only one would have commandeered the airplane . But how would that pilot have disabled the other ? A struggle ? Would the commandeering pilot have prevented the other pilot from reentering the cockpit after a lavatory break ? Then what ? Both the captain and co pilot were equally qualified to fly the 777 . If the erratic climbs and descents reported concerning the plane are credible , why the gyrations ? Although transport category airplanes are sensitive to hand flying at high altitudes , only an amateur would demonstrate that lack of skill . And to what end would one of the pilots want to seize a 777 ? Once again , would the purpose really be to run the airplane out of fuel in the middle of the Indian Ocean ?
