Blake Griffin starred with 12 points on 10 shots , but it was Chris Paul who took over in his first game since the team ' s loss at the Dallas Mavericks last Wednesday . Whether Paul was really iffy to play with his sore groin is an open question , but he looked to suffer no ill effects from the injury by hitting his first seven shots for 18 first quarter points . He also added four assists as the Clippers took a 41 25 lead after 12 minutes . It was on balance an excellent game for Paul , who finished with 35 points ( 13 of 22 FG , 5 of 9 3FG ) , eight assists , and four steals .
