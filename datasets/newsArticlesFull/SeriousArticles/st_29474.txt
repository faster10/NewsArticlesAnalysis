The Obama administration has left many progressives cynical about real change , and this is , perhaps , one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders has managed to put up a fight against the inevitable candidate , Hillary Clinton . Unlike Obama , who was young and relatively new on the national political stage when he became president , Sanders has been fighting for progressive ideals for many decades , and there is almost no chance he would suddenly become a status quo preserving centrist if elected president . Clinton , on the other hand , would almost certainly govern this way .
