As the professor of many university students and the mother of a girl and a boy who thankfully made it out of their 20s with no sexual and emotional scars , I worried about both my students and my kids in these years : I feared my daughter might get in a tough situation with a sexually aggressive date or that my son might be wrongfully accused by someone he didn ' t want to date any longer , or by a partner who changed her mind about what happened after a big night of partying . My fears were not baseless : I heard many examples of these kinds of situations .
