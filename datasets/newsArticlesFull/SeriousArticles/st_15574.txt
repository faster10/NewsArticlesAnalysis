Imagine today ' s Congress passing , by bipartisan majorities , legislation on two controversial issues : taxes and immigration reform . Impossible , right ? Well , it was done in the mid 1980 ' s . The tax measure lowered rates and eliminated some loopholes ( many , alas , have crept back into the code , but that ' s another story . ) And the immigration bill legalized certain illegal immigrants while punishing employers for hiring illegal immigrants . ( And of course we are back at that issue again ) .
