Others weren ' t , but I was shocked by the video . This , in 2015 ? In my home state ? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma , but at a different university . I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement . What happened on the bus at OU doesn ' t negate their positive experiences . But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion . Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life , in theory , because they ' re seen as uncool or don ' t " fit in " with a particular chapter . But we ' d be kidding ourselves if we didn ' t realize that , often , a person ' s race or sexual orientation , for that matter factors into this you ' re in , you ' re out process .
