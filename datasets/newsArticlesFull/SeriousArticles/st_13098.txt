What has evidently failed in western military strategy is the training programme to build up an effective force among the moderate opposition to President Assad . The immediate problem has been that these groups were not so moderate , and not an effective opposition ? they have been losing . Western programmes are fine when they train evolving forces , while not in the midst of an immediate war , and over a long period of time they have tried and failed to rapidly train effective armies in Iraq , in Afghanistan and now on Jordanian territory to fight in Syria . Western military intervention in all these operations was intended to buy time for local forces to be trained to preserve order and security . In none of these three cases has it so far worked .
