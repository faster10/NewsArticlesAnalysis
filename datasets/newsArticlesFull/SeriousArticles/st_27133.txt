But I would also say that there ' s caution , because everyone knows what American involvement looks like here . For example , one Sunni politician we talked to said that if the Americans come in , they would have to put right what they did wrong last time . What they mean is they left a sectarian leader in charge of the country , so if there ' s any chance of keeping Sunnis onside if there are airstrikes against ISIS , then it will have to involve getting rid of al Maliki . The Americans have got to be seen to be giving something to both sides , if you like .
