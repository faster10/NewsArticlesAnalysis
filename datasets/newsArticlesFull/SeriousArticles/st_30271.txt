One point road favorites in D . C . , the Packers ' team total is 23 points in the Wild Card Round . . . . The metrics point to a plus draw for Aaron Rodgers against a Redskins pass defense that ended 2015 ranked 19th in Football Outsiders ' pass defense DVOA with the NFL ' s ninth most touchdown passes allowed ( 30 ) . The recent ineptitude of Green Bay ' s offense is obvious cause for concern , however . Aaron Rodgers ' weekly fantasy finishes to close out the season were QB18 , QB28 , and QB29 as Green Bay managed offensive point totals of 13 ( Minnesota ) , 8 ( Arizona ) , and 23 ( Oakland ) in Weeks 15 17 . Even against a weak Redskins defense , a leap of faith is required to forecast Rodgers for a big box score game . I do like the matchups for Green Bay ' s pass catchers enough that I ' ll certainly have exposure to Rodgers in DFS tournaments . . . . The Packers ' backfield devolved into a three way RBBC during last Sunday ' s loss to Minnesota , with Eddie Lacy logging 32 of the snaps and James Starks 35 , before John Kuhn surprisingly took over as Green Bay ' s lead back in the fourth quarter . Rodgers seemed to feel most comfortable with Kuhn riding sidesaddle next to him in the shotgun . Kuhn played on each of the Packers ' final 26 offensive snaps . The matchup is good against a sub par Redskins run defense , but the usage distribution could go any which way . Kuhn might actually be the best DFS gamble considering his minimum cost and penchant for scoring annoying goal line TDs .
