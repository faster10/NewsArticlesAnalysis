whodatinhollywood ? first off , congratulations on the win . Brees and Payton proved again their offensive genius . However , I respectfully disagree with your assessment that it was exciting and that fans pay to see offense . When I go to games , especially if I m paying to sit down close , I want to see big people hitting other big people . This game was just a bunch of dudes running around . The only halfway decent hit was the one DRC put on Snead to cause the fumble return . There wasn t even any great catches . I imagine that this game was no different than Eli s offseason passing academy at Duke . Just not my cup of tea .
