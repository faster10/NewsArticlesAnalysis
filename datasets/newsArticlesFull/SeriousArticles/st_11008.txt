Domestic violence usually takes place behind closed doors that ' s because batterers typically hide the abuse . No surprise that Rice didn ' t assault her in the lobby but waited until they were alone in the elevator before he punched his wife . Victims are afraid of their batterers , and now that you ' ve seen the video , you understand why . I ' m sure Palmer was terrified of getting him in trouble with the police or the NFL , but thankfully Ray Rice was wrong : They weren ' t alone , the world was watching .
