I do not think that the media should ignore Trump when he says crazy things . Ha ! I would say that , right ? But really . I am of the school that thinks it is the media s duty to cover a presidential candidate when he or she says crazy things , intentionally or not , and to provide the coverage , even if they crave the attention . Because doing so does not help Trump to the extent that he believes it does . It has , instead , likely helped to seal his doom at one stage or another in the process .
