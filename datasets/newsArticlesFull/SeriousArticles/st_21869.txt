We never had cable growing up ( another way my parents abused us ) but I encountered his music as a stranger in motel rooms when the younger half of us eight kids piled into the family Nissan and took one of my sisters on a road trip to medical school . Whenever we arrived to that place in the in between , there he was an omnipresence with his electric voice and his neat pressed neon suits . The music was so overproduced and shiney , it was like rich silk fabric spun with precious metals and we would sit on the edge of our beds and watch him sing for eternities .
