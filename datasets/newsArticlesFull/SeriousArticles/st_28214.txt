Harvey : I hate to sound like a broken record , but again , health has been the key here . Although he played in all but one game his rookie season , Eifert was still nagged a bit that year with injuries . Forget the fact he was a first year player who had to live up to his first round hype , Eifert was having a tough time feeling settled because he had to play through rather serious pain late in the year . Of course , last season , an elbow dislocation knocked him out of the first game , and he never returned . With those upper body issues no longer lingering , Eifert has been a key force for Cincinnati . Once injury prone , Eifert is now an iron man , rarely leaving the field .
