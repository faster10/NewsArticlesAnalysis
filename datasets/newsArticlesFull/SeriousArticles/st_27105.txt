I suppose the zombies and ghouls of the 21st century Republican Party have a point , in ass backwards fashion : If our entire nation of 300 million odd people was conducted like Dodge City , where every public disagreement or altercation risked becoming an all hands shootout out of a Tarantino movie , social life would certainly have a different character . This is where ? Wednesday s ? Los Angeles Times editorial arguing that we seem to have a conscious or half conscious national death wish comes in ( I ve held that view for years ) , not to mention Nicholas Kristof s startling observation that Ronald Reagan once made a White House speech arguing for moderate gun control regulations that might reduce the alarming rate of firearm homicides . Today s GOP has left its supposed revolutionary hero far behind , and embraced a platform built on death . It draws ever closer to the all encompassing position of Cthulhu , the Lovecraftian Elder God turned presidential candidate : NoLivesMatter .
