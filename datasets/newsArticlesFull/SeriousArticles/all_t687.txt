The report says Ford -- the plane's pilot and sole passenger -- was "seriously injured." Once he saw trouble, Ford alerted traffic control of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport, according to the findings."The pilot initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course, about 800 feet southwest of the approach end of runway 3. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage," the NTSB report says. The 72-year-old actor, who was hospitalized following the crash, is expected to make a full recovery.
