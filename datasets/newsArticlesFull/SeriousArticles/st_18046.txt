Yes ! It is interesting . We have this weird thing in the U . S . Corporate profits are at record highs , profitability of firm is high , so you can t argue about American competitiveness . Our companies are doing very well . But wages are really stagnant . It is funny how you see it . If you are a company CEO , you see wages as a cost on your balance sheet ? which is reasonable and I get that . But for the worker that is his income , that he needs more . And that is the challenge for the Republican party , because most people think the party is for the rich because that is their go to place . Our companies are all focused on cost saving , but then we have a serious demand problem in the country . But everything that you can do about wages in the country ? better equality of education , increased unions , all of these things . . everything that you can do about , Republicans are opposed to it . They are in a quandary .
