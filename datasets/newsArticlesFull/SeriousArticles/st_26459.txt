" Celebration Day , " which will be commercially released in various audio and visual formats on November 19 , is nothing more or less than Zeppelin ' s entire two hour performance on December 10 , 2007 , at London ' s O2 Arena . The concert , a benefit and tribute to the late Atlantic Records chief Ahmet Ertegun , was the first full Zeppelin show by Page , singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980 . Bonham ' s son , Jason , took his father ' s place for the night , which is shown without backstage footage and includes minimal shots of the ecstatic audience . Instead , director Dick Carruthers who shot the concert with more than a dozen cameras provides extended close ups of the band members in action : Plant in bluestrance moan during " Since I ' ve Been Loving You " Jones threading the folk rock gallop of " Ramble On " with low end countermelodies everyone turning to Jason in admiration during his volcanic solo at the end of " Rock and Roll .
