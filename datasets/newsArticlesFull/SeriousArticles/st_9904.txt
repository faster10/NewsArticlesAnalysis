Whatever the results of COP21 , Pakistan needs to find an effective and sustainable path , leading towards increasing the resilience and adaptive capacity of communities and natural systems , as well as contributing to global mitigation targets by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions . Renewable energy , sustainable agro forestry , water and coastal management and clean and sustainable urban development need to be at the forefront of its climate policy . It is extremely important for an agrarian economy and natural resource dependent country like Pakistan , to invest in adaptation options , as well as to increase its disaster preparedness . Because it is a natural resource based economy , Ecosystems based Adaptation should be an important consideration for its future climate planning . Most importantly , all of this needs to be undertaken , in the backdrop of improving its governance structures . Without that , no efforts towards implementing adaptation and mitigation options will provide optimum results .
