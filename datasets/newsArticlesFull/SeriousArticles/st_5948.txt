Women , including the fictitious Bond Girls , are perfectly capable of climaxing on their own or indeed with other women , without a Cosmo recommended slinky lingerie set in sight , and without a man to help them . I would even hazard a guess that Bond isn t very good in bed ? he s always in a rush and he s never held down a relationship long enough to find out where the clitoris is , plus most of the time he s stewing in about a litre of booze . Anyone who s ever gone to bed with a man can tell you what this combination generally leads to : a mediocre half hour of thrusting ( at most ) with a vacant guy who s more likely to shout out his name at the end than yours .
