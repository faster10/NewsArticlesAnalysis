Deserved winners of the night and most articulate were Matt Damon as Best Comedy Musical Actor for The Martian and my favorite , now three time Golden Globe Winner and odds on favorite for a long overdue Oscar Leonardo DiCaprio , Best Dramatic Actor for The Revenant . It ' s hard to believe DiCaprio is already 41 , having first been nominated 22 years ago for What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape , but he has grown so much and delivered the most eloquent acceptance speech of the night . Clearly memorized but flawless as he described the conditions he and others met during the brutal shooting of his film , he thanked a good many of his co workers and spent the last few moments giving praise and making us think about the way indigenous people are portrayed , and of course pitched support for our environment . A class act indeed .
