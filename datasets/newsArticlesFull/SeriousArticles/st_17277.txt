Host : It ' s pretty amusing that the candidates regard a cable channel pitched to wealthy businessmen and that includes Lawrence Kudlow and Rick Santelli as lamestream lefties . . . not to mention that their questions reflected the concerns of even many Republicans privately that some of their candidates are indeed cartoonish . But when Cruz effectively dressed them down especially since they couldn ' t respond and implied that only questioners who are Republicans should question them he showed an authoritarian mindset about the nature of journalism in America . Putin too doesn ' t like an independent media . But if the GOP want to ' privatize ' their process so Hannity replaces Harwood next time and the sponsoring station wants to provide pillows , beer , snacks and conjugal visits during breaks well that ' s not the way the first amendment was intended to operate .
