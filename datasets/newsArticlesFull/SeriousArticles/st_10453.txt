" It ' s a tough , hard fought game against familiar opponents , " Tomlin continued . " It ' s just part of football . We ' re moving on . We have to . We can ' t waste one iota of time living in the past . It ' s not gonna help us beat the Denver Broncos , so I ' m not gonna address it in anyway , because addressing it just leads to another question , whether it ' s to me or someone that plays for us and that ' s not gonna help us this week . So I respectfully decline any of those questions . I ' m sure it ' s interesting for you guys . There ' s not enough ball going on this time of year so you ' ll continue to chew it , but we ' re not going to participate . "
