I was about to go around it but I noticed that the lady in front of me ? she kind of was jumping around the car , passenger seat , back seat , Fleming recalled . Then I noticed the car started to smoke and I didn t really think much of it . I just thought she was trying to get out of the car then I realized the smoke was building up inside of the car so I was like You know what , I probably should get out of here and try to assist her a little bit . I tried to open the doors . It wouldn t work so then I was just like I ve got to get her out of here because I don t know if this lady can breathe or what .
