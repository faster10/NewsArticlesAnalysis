A 9 7 season and the division title seemed way out of the realm of possibility after the Week 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins . The defense gave up over 500 yards that day , but it recovered to be tough as nails over the final nine games of the season . The Texans went 7 2 in those contests to win their third division title in five seasons that kind of season is never a disappointment . For O Brien , he s going to have to solve the offensive challenges in the offseason , which starts with the QB position . Even when QB Andrew Luck returns to the Indianapolis Colts lineup in 2016 , Houston should still be favored to repeat in the division , although the schedule will be much tougher next year .
