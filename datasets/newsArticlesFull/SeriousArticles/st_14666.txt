Denver Broncos : The Broncos are dealing with enough quarterback issues without adding a project such as Manziel . Peyton Manning ' s future is uncertain after an injury marred season , but Manning is under contract for 2016 with a stratospheric salary cap hit of 21 . 5 million . The Broncos asked Manning to take a pay cut before this past season 4 million and if he were to play one more season and the Broncos wanted him to do it in Denver , the Broncos would feel like they have to give that contract some attention . They also would like to re sign Brock Osweiler , who was 5 2 in his seven starts in relief of Manning and is an unrestricted free agent . Jeff Legwold
