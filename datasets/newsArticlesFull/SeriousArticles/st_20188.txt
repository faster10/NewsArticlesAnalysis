I believe it was God who gave me another chance at life with the flood rescue and I wasn ' t going to waste it . I was determined to show this disease who was boss and that I would not let MS define my life ' s journey ! I wanted to show the world that MS looks different for everyone and that MS does not mean you have to give up on your dreams . A diagnosis with any disease can be overwhelming , scary and confusing . Before , I , too , was scared and worried about how the world and the music industry would look at me if they knew I had MS .
