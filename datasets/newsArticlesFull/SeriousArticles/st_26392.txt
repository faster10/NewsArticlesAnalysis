" Everything is real , " Bruckheimer said . " Gore doesn ' t like to do it with the visual effects , so those guys are really on the train , the train is actually moving , it ' s not a CG shot so everything you see here is real . So it had to be built . You can ' t imagine how many people it takes just to keep the train running to get the stunt guys to keep the guys on top of the train the rigging so they ' re all safe and the amount of extras to be the people in the background it ' s just a lot .
