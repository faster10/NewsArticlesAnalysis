For anyone who grew up quoting Basil Fawlty , watched " Doctor Who " when only the math geeks did , or gambled on the color of Mrs Slocombe ' s hair with their dorm mates ( pink was a safe bet ) , there has never been a more exciting time for a British TV invasion . PBS period charmer " Downton Abbey " is a cult phenomenon , Idris Elba ' s " Luther " kicks down doors as a new style of gritty detective , and " Doctor Who " is oh so very cool now . " Top Gear " host Richard Hammond is even filming a new show in America , for America as part of an original programming experiment by BBC America .
