Things have definitely gotten better . Waters and his colleagues found that in 2006 2007 , 73 percent of people had their LDL cholesterol in an acceptable range . This included 86 percent of people at relatively low risk of heart problems , 74 percent at moderate risk , and 67 percent at high risk . But just one in three people , or 30 percent , who already had heart disease and at least two other risk factors ( such as obesity and smoking ) had their LDL cholesterol in the healthy range . About 75 percent of the patients in the survey were taking statins , 16 percent were treated with only diet and exercise , and the remainder took a cholesterol lowering medication that was not a statin . Statins include brand name drugs like Lipitor , Zocor , and Crestor , among others .
