Accept that you ' ll have to let go of some treasured tools For years my main productivity tool has been OmniFocus pricey but excellent task management software with a pricey but excellent iPhone app . Unfortunately , OmniFocus syncs only via Apple ' s MobileMe service , which really only plays nice with Apple devices . After trying several options , I decided to switch to the Web based service Toodledo , which syncs with a pretty good free Android app , Got To Do Lite . This doesn ' t replace all the functionality of OmniFocus but for me , it will suffice . Again , your mileage may vary .
