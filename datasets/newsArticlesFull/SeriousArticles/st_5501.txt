SVdR : The biggest influence on me was Buckminster Fuller who was a peripatetic character who would show up at schools . He really provided a larger vision that was far more than just designing a building . And that for me was the kind of Satori moment learning from him that the issue was much larger than the building . I never forgot that . He was thinking in " whole systems " terms and I have been ever since . And then my work was always involved in socially orientated architecture when we still cared about that in this country . I worked on migrant farm labor housing , I built a lot of prefab systems based on Fuller ' s work .
