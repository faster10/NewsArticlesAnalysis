The Senate might actually be the best place for someone like Rand Paul to advance the cause of liberty . If he stays for many terms , accumulates seniority , inches his way up committees , and influences and moves legislation , he could become one of the most important people in Washington . The case for , say , greater civil liberties in spying programs , or criminal justice reform , needn ' t be advanced through presidential campaigns alone . It will take many years of debate and of legislative blocking and tackling . Rand could be this country ' s great champion of civil liberties ? and he could do it all from the Senate .
