Sanders appears to be doing well in some polls in Iowa and New Hampshire . His rallies are nearly all white with many young people . It seems many attendees are not heavily involved in politics but responding to his call to change the system . Students love the idea of free college . Poor people feeling anger at the establishment might love the idea of Medicare for all which they often misunderstand to be free healthcare . Sanders knows nothing is free . Two hours before last night ' s debate he released another healthcare plan differing little from the nine he has previously introduced in Congress . One see ' s right away taxes go way up on everyone to cover its cost .
