In much of the heartland of Burma , known officially as Myammar , political fealty is paid to opposition leader Aung Saan Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose National League for Democracy ( NLD ) is considered the frontrunner in Sunday s ballot ? despite a lack of reliable pre election polling . After all , a quarter century ago , the NLD won a landslide victory in nationwide elections . The country s military rulers ignored that result , however , and locked up Suu Kyi for most of two decades until her release in late 2010 . A victory for the NLD on Sunday could help absolve the sins of history .
