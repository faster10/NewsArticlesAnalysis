" I am very , very sad to hear the news about Steve . He was a great man with incredible achievements and amazing brilliance . He always seemed to be able to say in very few words what you actually should have been thinking before you thought it . His focus on the user experience above all else has always been an inspiration to me . He was very kind to reach out to me as I became CEO of Google and spend time offering his advice and knowledge even though he was not at all well . My thoughts and Google ' s are with his family and the whole Apple family . "
