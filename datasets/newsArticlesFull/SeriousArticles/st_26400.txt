As with every team , the biggest issue for the Spurs came in trying to stop Stephen Curry . The league ' s best offensive weapon scored 37 points ( 12 of 20 FG , 6 of 9 3FG , 7 of 7 FT ) in only 28 minutes . Curry sent several Spurs defenders scrambling on possession after possession , devastating Tony Parker so thoroughly that Gregg Popovich had to turn to Kawhi Leonard to keep him under wraps within the opening few minutes . The Defensive Player of the Year did a solid job for a bit , but that success proved shortlived . Curry found space in transition and the halfcourt , made his usual set of shots only he can make , and created opportunities for his teammates with his movement and mere presence .
