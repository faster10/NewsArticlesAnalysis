For a totally African experience , I would recommend Moyo . This large restaurant and special event venue is situated in one of the oldest nature reserves in Pretoria . Here you can order not only South African food but also experience tastes from other parts of the continent . Before digging into your food , though , you will be invited to wash your hands in traditional African style or get your face painted . Depending on which day you choose to go , you may also be treated to the sweet melodies of the Moyo Beauties or a live band .
