This is a personal note , so please move on to the next item if you ' re looking for trenchant analysis . There are times when I remain delusional about getting old . Then I am hit by a realization like this one : I have witnessed Detroit Lions home games in three different stadiums ? Tiger Stadium , the Pontiac Silverdome and now Ford Field . No , I did not cover any games when the Lions were originally founded as the Portsmouth Spartans across the Ohio border and played at Universal Stadium there . But overall , this item is a markup rather than a markdown because I give myself credit for covering so many bad games involving the Lions .
