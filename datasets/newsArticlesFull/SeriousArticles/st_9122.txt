Of course some of the mess we are witnessing in the metropolitan region is unique to us . For largely historical reasons , New York ' s power system is run by private utilities answerable to state regulators . Its subway system has also been run by the state in the form of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ever since going bankrupt in the 1960s . So any criticism regarding the lack of investment or preparedness for a hurricane event , at least in terms of power or transit , needs to be aimed squarely at Albany , not at City Hall .
