India and France are confronted with similar threats : we are attacked by murderers who pretend to act on religious basis . Their real objective is widespread hate . They want to undermine our democratic values and our way of life . India and France are united in their determination to act together against terrorism . France strongly condemned the attack on Pathankot . India is fully justified to ask for justice against perpetrators . I congratulate Prime Minister Modi for his diplomacy reflecting both a sense of proportion and a strong determination . He recently took important steps to engage in a dialogue with the political leadership in Pakistan .
