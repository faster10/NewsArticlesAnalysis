Jessica Georgia is one of those travelers who is always searching for a vintage or " Old Americana " place to explore . It ' s what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz , a relic theme park , sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina . Georgia stumbled onto the theme park while doing an online search for interesting places to visit with her family . There wasn ' t much information she could find on Land of Oz , except that it once operated in the 1970s before closing its doors .
