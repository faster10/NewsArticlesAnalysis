JP McManus , Racehorse Owner and long standing employer : ' I get enormous pleasure from AP riding . If he is on one of my horses then it ' s a bonus but if it ' s somebody else ' s I still get a thrill out of it . We ' ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup . There ' s never a right time to retire , but it ' s nice that he ' s picking a time of his choosing . He ' s an ironman and a lovely man . I ' ve grown to love him more and more , as my family have . There ' s something deep and great about him . '
