For David Cameron , there is a choice to be made about priorities . In his recent speech to the Mansion House , he twinned national security with economic security . But his definition of the one ? which involves a lot more austerity ? is now in contention with the demands of the other . The greater emphasis on security in the national conversation has changed the atmospherics around this week s financial statement from George Osborne and made it even harder for the chancellor to make his sums add up . Several well placed government sources confirm that Theresa May has been immensely strengthened in her fierce battle against the Treasury s desire to take large lumps out of the Home Office budget . No chancellor , certainly not a Tory chancellor , and even less so a Tory chancellor with ambitions to lead his party , wants to be attacked as weak on security and especially not at a time like this .
