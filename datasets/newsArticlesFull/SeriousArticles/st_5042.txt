" We ' re doing everything we can to get things out there . It ' s been a shift in thinking since Bob Greenblatt came aboard , " NBC exec Sanders said . " These days you have to do it all . . . . When you ' re competing with four other networks and there ' s 15 new shows all premiering within one week , it becomes very difficult to get attention and , in some cases , convince people to check out your show , whether it ' s a new show or a show that they ' re loyal to . We ' re really hoping that by doing this not as a traditional launch , but just as a chance to get people to sample the shows , that we ' re getting to have a leg up on our competitors , perhaps , and to have a leg up on a more traditional launch .
