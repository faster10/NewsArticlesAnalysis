Please note that there is no evidence that Hillary actually did enable Bill s philandering . Nor , contrary to accusations , is there any evidence that she slut shamed Paula Jones or any of the other women who accused Bill of sexually aggressive behavior . ( James Carville and other men close to Bill did make a few choice remarks . ) Yes , Hillary told her best friend , Diane Blair , that Monica was a narcissistic looney tunes , and Blair recorded that in her private diary . What is so terrible about venting to a friend ? As for covering up , Juanita Broaddrick , who claims Bill Clinton raped in her 1978 and Hillary tried to silence her by uttering a political platitude and pressing her hand in a particularly meaningful way , it seems much more likely that Hillary did what she did thousands of times at political gatherings .
