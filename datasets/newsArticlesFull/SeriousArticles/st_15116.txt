Playing a second round match against African American James Blake , Hewitt made his controversial remarks , which were picked up by the on court microphones . Outraged that he had been called for a foot fault , Hewitt said to the umpire about a line judge , who was black : " Change him , change . I ' m only getting foot faults at one end . Look at him , mate , and tell me what the similarity is . I want him off the court . " Hewitt later denied that his comments had been racist , telling a news conference : " There was nothing that was said out there that was racist . I didn ' t say it in that way . You can think what you want but at the end of the day I wasn ' t making a racist comment . It was just between me and the umpire , a conversation between two people out there in the heat of a tennis match . "
