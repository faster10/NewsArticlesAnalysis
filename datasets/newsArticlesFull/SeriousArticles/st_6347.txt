The same is true for land . Because growing vegetables is more land efficient than growing meat , we would need to eat far less meat in order to avoid taking over more forests for farms , said Robert Howarth , a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University . To be sustainable , America needs to eat about half the meat it does today , he said . That would return us to about 1940s consumption levels . Per capita meat consumption in the United States appears to have peaked around the year 2000 at more than 180 pounds of meat per person per year , or about half a pound each day , according to the Earth Policy Institute .
