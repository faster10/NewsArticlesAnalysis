There are those who say that if you don ' t have anything to hide , you have nothing to be afraid of . But the fact is , when a government agency can monitor everyone ' s phone calls , we have all become suspects . This is one of the most frightening aspects of our modern society . And even more frightening is the fact that we have gone so far down the road , there is probably no turning back . Unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin , totally off the grid , there is simply no way the government won ' t have information about you stored away somewhere .
