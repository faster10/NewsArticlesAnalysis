As the president noted today , the president certainly gave Sen . Toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue . I think there are a lot of other things on which the president and Sen . Toomey disagree , Earnest said . So it s hard to imagine a scenario where the president is willing to campaign for Sen . Toomey , given the significant differences they have on a whole bunch of other issues that the president also feels passionately about . The other think single issue voters do is they give credit where it s due . Sen . Toomey , to his credit , did step forward three years ago to put forward bipartisan legislation to close the gun show loophole .
