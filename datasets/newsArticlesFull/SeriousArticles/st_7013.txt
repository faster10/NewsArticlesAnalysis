This is a design for a root vegetable salad using heirloom carrots and autumn celeriac . Amber said wanted to use ' boring ' ingredients like celeriac ( pictured in white ) and make them look interesting . She was inspired when she found the multi coloured carrots at a stand in her local market . She said : ' He stocks veg by garden enthusiasts . You get an array of colours . This is where the carrots came in . I made it into two salads . Made a cashew mayonnaise and a julienne salad with a poppy seed dressing . '
