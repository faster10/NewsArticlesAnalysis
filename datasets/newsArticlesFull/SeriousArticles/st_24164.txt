Still , I m not expecting much media bashing . The GOP candidates threw their tantrum on the CNBC stage exactly because doing so allowed them to dodge questions about why their respective delusional tax cut proposals simply don t add up . But with the Fox and WSJ logos plastered on stage and on the screen on Tuesday , they can t play the liberal bias card again . If Bartiromo and Baker ask good questions in a less aggressive tone , the candidates won t be happy ? but they ll have to grin and bear it . After all , if they turn on Fox , they won t have any other major network to turn to next .
