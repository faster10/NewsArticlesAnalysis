Since Sandusky , each time I go to a game college , pro or high school I can ' t help but wonder if any of those young men have ever been abused by a coach . At least one study indicates that one out of every six boys is sexually abused by the age of 14 , a shocking statistic . Recently , I watched with happiness as LeBron and D Wade won their first NBA Championship together . But I couldn ' t help but wonder if they , or their teammates , had ever been preyed upon by a coach when they were young boys .
