Hasselbeck has performed admirably in Luck ' s place but took a step back Sunday against the Steelers . He was held to 196 passing yards and threw two interceptions before leaving with multiple injuries . After the game , the veteran quarterback was diagnosed with a stiff neck and a mild rib separation . Both injuries are considered minor , though they can be quite limiting . The term ' stiff ' indicates his neck injury is muscular in nature and could therefore limit his range of motion in the area . As a result , Hasselbeck might have difficulty looking down field to locate receivers and effectively read a defense . Couple that with what is likely a very painful rib injury and it ' s hard to imagine the 40 year old quarterback being a reliable option to lead your fantasy team into the playoffs . Charlie Whitehurst would be the next man up for the Colts , though he too remains an unappealing option .
