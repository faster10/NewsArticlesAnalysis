There s one more Trump related point we d like to make : Politics and security abhor a vacuum , and Trump fills it . And after the San Bernadino shootings , that fact raises an important question for President Obama ( and Hillary Clinton by extension ) ? how do Democrats try to fill that vacuum ? The country is nervous the anxiety over security is real . To be sure , we STILL don t have all of the facts yet about the San Bernadino shootings , but every new detail seems to point to radicalization and terrorism . And after Paris , after Colorado Springs , and now after San Bernadino , Americans are growing scared . Obama s own remarks yesterday were striking ? he was much more somber and cautious when speaking about Wednesday s shootings than he was right after the news ( when he focused on gun control ) . It was almost as if he found out the same new facts about the shootings that we later learned publicly , and they shook him . As for Hillary Clinton , NBC s Monica Alba reports that she called the San Bernardino mass shooting an act of terrorism during her remarks at a Dover , NH town hall tonight , going further than what she said earlier in the day in Hooksett , NH .
