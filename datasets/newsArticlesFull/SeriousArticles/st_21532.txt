This is the political quicksand where some want to bring another Western invasion , in a region where anti Western sentiment is already at an all time high . Throw into this mix the vastly differing political interests of Russia . Will the Russians collaborate ? Will they budge on the issue of Assad ? Or will the man whose regime has killed and tortured far more people than ISIS itself remain in power and escape accountability ? Russia ' s focus on bombing the anti Assad Sunni rebels of the Free Syrian Army stands in direct contradiction to the American policy of arming and training " Moderate " Sunni rebels against ISIS and Assad .
