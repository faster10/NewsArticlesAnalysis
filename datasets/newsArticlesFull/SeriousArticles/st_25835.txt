As I read all of the above , this race has seen a dramatic crumbling of the establishment ? so dramatic that it s taken down the old would be outsiders every bit as much as it s taken down the establishment pillars . Rubio is the only one remaining in his category , which is really a source of strength , but 5 poll running totals for that block peaked at 31 . 4 in early May , and Rubio owned less than half of that : 15 . 2 . He d drool over such numbers today ? almost twice his 8 . 8 pre debate 5 poll average ? and the thought of getting Walker s voters then as well ? It s hard to imagine , given how the outsider s support has grown , from 8 . 8 back then to 57 now , in the last pre debate 5 poll average .
