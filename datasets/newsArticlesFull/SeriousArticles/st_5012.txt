Irons : It ' s strange because it ' s always the experience of making it that ' s the great thing . Making " The Mission " was fantastic , making " Dead Ringers " was a great experience , making " Lolita " was a great experience . Making " The Borgias " is a great experience . We have a lot of fun , great crew , great cast , shooting in a fantastic city , Budapest . I get up and I ' m really pleased to work and that ' s what I ' ll remember . In a way , it never has much actually to do with what the movie ' s like .
