I believe that some time next year , with the election in the past , when either Barack Obama has started his second term or Mitt Romney has finished unpacking in the White House , Americans , too , will discover that budget debates are not just academic exercises or political theater . It ' s a good bet that just as Europe has come up against the reality that deficits cannot grow forever , so too will America . Investors , who have taken losses in the European debacle , will start looking at America ' s books , questioning its solvency , and demanding change .
