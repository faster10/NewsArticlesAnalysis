Though he has shown some intermittent signs of life at times , there doesn ' t appear to be much gas left in Alfred Morris ' tank . He has just one game of more than 100 yards , and has topped 5 . 0 yards per carry in a game just once as well , in Week 10 against the New Orleans Saints . In three games since , he has just 90 yards on 31 carries , and seems unlikely to provide any help in the final few games . Unfortunately , his backup Matt Jones , doesn ' t seem to have much upside either . Jones , the team ' s third round pick in this year ' s draft , has shown flashes of being a real difference maker , especially in the passing game , but the overall track record continues to disappoint . With the exception of one massive , 187 yard game also in Week 10 against the Saints , which tells you a lot about New Orleans ' defense Jones has topped 10 Fantasy points just once since Week 2 ' s big breakout . Most concerning , 30 . 8 percent of his total rushing yards for the season came in that Week 2 performance , and he is averaging a putrid 2 . 74 yards per carry in his last nine games . Washington continues to split carries pretty evenly between three backs add Chris Thompson to the mix and no back has played more than 36 percent of the team ' s snaps this season which continues to make this a Fantasy black hole . Whatever upside Jones might have seems unlikely to turn into tangible Fantasy value at this point .
