This town on the northeastern side of Lake Michigan may be sweet but not cloyingly so : after all , it boasts of being the tart cherry capital of the world . Readers found the most romance in outdoorsy endeavors , such as hiking at the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore or embarking on a fall color drive . For an extra shot of romance , stay at Chateau Chantal . This small , European style inn offers its own wines , big breakfasts , and water views and was founded by a former priest and nun who later fell in love .
