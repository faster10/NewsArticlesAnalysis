It was a cold night in November 1938 . Hard men with hatred in their hearts and bats in their hands set about smashing shops belonging to Jews . At the end of the night , some 267 synagogues were destroyed , the windows of 7 , 500 Jewish owned businesses were shattered and several Jewish cemeteries were desecrated . At least 91 Jews were killed in the mayhem . Up to 30 , 000 Jewish men were rounded up and sent to concentration camps . Glass from smashed storefront windows lay strewn across the streets . That night of infamy is notorious in history as Kristallnacht the " Night of Broken Glass . "
