All it requires is that our generation be willing to do what those who came before us have done : to rise above the cynicism and rise above the fear . To hold fast to our values .

To remember that our freedom is bound up with the freedom of others , regardless of what they look like , or where they come from , or what their last name is , or what faith they practice .
