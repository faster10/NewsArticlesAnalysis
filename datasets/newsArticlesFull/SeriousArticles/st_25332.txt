" The North Vietnamese soldiers had us surrounded on a little hilltop and everything started getting kind of quiet , " Adkins is quoted as saying in an Army report . " We could look around and all at once , all we could see were eyes going around us . It was a tiger that stalked us that night . We were all bloody and in this jungle , the tiger stalked us and the North Vietnamese soldiers were more afraid of the tiger than they were of us . So , they backed off some and we were ( able to escape ) . "
