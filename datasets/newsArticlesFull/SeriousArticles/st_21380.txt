Of course , it is undeniable that some Muslims butcher others in the name of Islam . But there are also Christians who do the same in the name of Christ .

The Lord ' s Resistance Army in Uganda , for example , specifically cites its Christian faith as inspiration for the group ' s terrorism . Or what about Anders Breivik , who in 2011 killed 77 people in Norway , after writing a 1 , 500 page manifesto citing Christian inspiration for his slaughter ?
