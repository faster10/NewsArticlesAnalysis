Senator Ted Cruz ' s victory in the Iowa Republican Caucus was built upon the strong support of white , evangelical Christian voters who made up approximately 60 of those participating in that contest . Cruz ' s victory came as a surprise to some students of Iowa politics , because the final poll published by the Des Moines Register , which is considered the most reliable in the state , had Donald Trump ahead . There seem to have been three problems with that survey . First , not enough evangelical Christians were included in the statistical sample . Second , the poll was done sufficiently far in advance of the voting that it missed late deciders choosing Cruz . Third , and probably most important , media reporting of the poll failed to note the problems with using it to predict the outcome on caucus night . The result was embarrassing , both for the pollsters and the media coverage that relied on their work .
