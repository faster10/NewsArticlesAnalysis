Pretty much every starting pitcher suffers a significant decline when facing the opposing batting order for the third time in a game , but that ' s especially the case with Ventura . For his career , batters have an OPS of . 612 the first time up , . 687 the second time facing him in a given start , and . 786 the third time . Maybe with an established veteran hurler , you defer to his competitive instincts and let him keep going , but with the 24 year old Ventura there ' s less of a need to do that . Yost in Game 6 would do well to go to the bullpen early and in a preemptive manner .
