Jason La Canfora , CBSSports . com : " Follow the money . The big money . It was the key to toppling Watergate and it was the critical element to the NFL finally solving the Los Angels labyrinth . Rams owner Stan Kroenke has the most of it and he was willing to contribute the most toward a project that stands to make the most . And so , for as popular as Chargers owner Dean Spanos is , and for as many votes as he had for his Carson proposal with the Raiders , and for as much good will as he engenders among his peers , and for all of loyal years or service , he got , at best , to ride in the sidecar while Kroenke brings a tricked out new toy to Los Angeles . And Mark Davis ends up the third wheel as he frankly always was in this project , without the economic means or industrial currency to execute a deal of this magnitude . Money , and the opportunity to make much more of it , trumps all in the world of business , and make no mistake , this is business of the highest order . The Los Angeles market has always been about making all 32 pieces of the league ' s ownership pie more robust , and with Kroenke ' s state of the art facility now under construction which means impressive new digs for NFL Media among others times are very good in the NFL . Anyone surprised at the fan bases left in limbo , or , like St . Louis , left in the lurch , somehow wasn ' t paying attention the last 30 years to what ' s occurred in Baltimore and Cleveland and Houston and St . Louis . "
