Panthers : This has to be the four game stretch in which the Panthers beat Seattle ( Russell Wilson ) , Philadelphia ( Sam Bradford ) , Indianapolis ( Andrew Luck ) and Green Bay ( Aaron Rodgers ) . The Panthers had five of their league best 24 regular season interceptions against these top quarterbacks . The combined average passer rating among them was 75 . 6 . That the Panthers got good pressure up front in each of those games is no coincidence . They had 16 of their 44 regular season sacks in those games . A big reason Carolina was the best in the NFL at shutting down wide receivers remember , its Total Quarterback Rating of 56 . 7 on passes to wide receivers ranked first was the front seven did such a good job of getting quarterbacks out of their comfort zone . It ' s not just matchups . Carolina plays more zone and matchup zone than man to man . It ' s about the scheme working hand in hand .
