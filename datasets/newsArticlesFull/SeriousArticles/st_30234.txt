Outsiders like Bhupendra Yadav , Dharmendra Pradhan and Ananth Kumar will not be allowed to call the shots as in Bihar . There may be posters of Modi , but Shah will no longer be projected , as was the case in Bihar . While the purse strings in Bihar were held by the central leadership , and publicity material and infrastructure were organised by Shah to prevent leakage of funds , it has been decided that in Assam , each candidate will have a greater say over how the budget is spent in the constituency . The prime minister will address far fewer rallies this time , than he did in Bihar .
