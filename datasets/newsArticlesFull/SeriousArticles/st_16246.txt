I d escaped the public school system for what I thought would be the gentler environment of an all boys private school in Dallas . But cruelty in adolescent boys proved ubiquitous . They told me I was a faggot . They knocked me to the ground , held me down , and whispered it into my ear . I wondered if it was true . I didn t know what I was . I would sit in my room and study the album cover of the U . S . release of Bowie s The Man Who Sold The World . He looked so beautiful lounging on a chaise with his long hair and his brocade dressing gown . Was I what they said ? I decided that I was different from them regardless of whom I wound up wanting to sleep with . They were mundane and ignorant . I had so much more in common with this bold , strange artist to whom I devoted so many hours .
