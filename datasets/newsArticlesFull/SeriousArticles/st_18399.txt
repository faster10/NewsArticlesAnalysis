Fortunately , by the time of a general election , voters would see through Bernie . He would alienate what is left of the political middle and lose . That ' s why Karl Rove ' s Crossroads USA SuperPAC is running attack ads in Iowa on Hillary ' s ties to Wall Street : he wants Bernie to win or at least prolong a more divisive Democratic primary . Karl is taking a page from the Democrats ' playbook . In 2002 , Gov . Gray Davis paid for a huge ad campaign in the Republican gubernatorial primary against former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan , because Davis felt Riordan would be a stronger general election opponent . Although Bernie and Hillary both attack Karl , Karl ' s anti Wall Street ads against Hillary will still resonate in Iowa .
