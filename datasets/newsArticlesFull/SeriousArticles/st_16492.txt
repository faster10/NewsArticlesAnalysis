Since the beginning of January , seven national pollsters ? CBS New York Times , NBC Wall Street Journal , Fox News , CNN ORC , ABC Washington Post , Investor s Business Daily TIPP , and ? Monmouth University ? have examined the state of the race . In these surveys , when Republicans and Republican leaners were asked which candidate they supported , the percentage who picked Trump or Cruz ranged from 52 to 60 . ( The Iowa results fell at the low end of this range : Cruz and Trump together drew 52 percent of Republican caucusgoers . ) So most Republicans don t just find Trump or Cruz acceptable they prefer at least one of these two candidates as their first choice . When second choices are factored in , Cruz and Trump do even better . In the four polls that have asked that question , Trump got the first or second choice votes of 46 percent of Republicans . Cruz got the votes of 41 percent .
