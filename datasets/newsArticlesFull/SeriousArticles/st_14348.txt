When a 7 year old , straight A student is removed from class and told that she cannot go to her school any longer simply because she wears her hair in a culturally specific hairstyle , there is a big chance that her reflection on herself , and perhaps even her culture , will be negatively impacted . Rather than run the risk that little Tiana might look in the mirror and see something wrong , I wanted to manually , if not emotionally , insert a positive reflection for her , one that I myself didn ' t get until I was well into my adult years .
