Kim said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel . She said : ' I ' ll be remembered by my mom and kids for how much I care about everybody . And I show it a lot because I think you should . I don ' t think you should hold something like that back because we don ' t know how long we ' re here and if you love somebody you should tell them . They don ' t have to love you back but I think that if you love somebody that they should know it because you never know you don ' t know what ' s going to happen tomorrow '
