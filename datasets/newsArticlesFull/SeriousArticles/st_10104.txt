I also have intensified senses touch , taste , smell , sight , and sound so I am attuned to lights , noise , textures , and smells . In a " busy " environment , I will eventually go into sensory overload and my mind will go blank . When this happens , I have to " go away " mentally for a brief period to regain focus . When I " return , " I have to piece together what occurred while I was " away . " The additional mental processing I must do to function every day is fatiguing , and I don ' t handle " ad hoc " very well . Being asked to respond quickly in the midst of all this other processing is difficult , sometimes impossible .
