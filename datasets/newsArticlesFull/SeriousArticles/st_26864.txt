Yet Katniss Everdeen does not get her hands dirty . She competes in ruthless kill or be killed contests using her speed and wits , but she never has to do anything too ugly or brutal or , for my money , too surprising . There ' s a ritualistic quality to these films that ' s key to their appeal , but it also limits their capacity to truly wow us . " Catching Fire " is more energized than the first " Hunger Games " movie it ' s been directed , by Francis Lawrence ( I Am Legend ) , with a darkly sustained verve . The Quarter Quell is more openly a contest between Katniss and the Capitol powers , and in its gimmicky way it ' s more gripping a lethal jungle fun house , with Katniss and her allies facing down a toxic fog , a vicious tribe of baboons , even the arena itself . As newcomer Johanna , Jena Malone delivers her lines with a scene stealing screw it all nastiness , and Sam Claflin nails the role of the wicked smart former champion Finnick . As for Lawrence , she more than holds her own , turning her face into a dreamy pale Valkyrie mask . You react to every wave of sadness and fury roiling around inside Katniss , even when Katniss isn ' t allowed to show it .
