What if diarrhea is a problem ? " There ' s a real concern about becoming dehydrated . So be sure you ' re drinking plenty of fluids and that those fluids don ' t have caffeine , " says Doyle . Broths , diluted juices , sports drinks even Popsicles or gelatin can help get some liquid into the system . Foods such as applesauce , rice and bananas can help slow down the digestive tract , as can oatmeal and canned peaches or pears . Avoid greasy , fried or very sugary foods because they can be irritants .
