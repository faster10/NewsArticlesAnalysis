Let me , at the beginning , thank the governments of : Turkey , Kazakhstan , and China , the previous chairs and conveners of this conference , and to thank the government of Pakistan for their excellent arrangements and the hospitality offered to us . Let me also thank the people of Pakistan for having hosted millions of Afghan refugees over decades . Our bonds are deep , people to people sets of relationships . Unfortunately , recent events in Pakistan have forced us to host close to 350 , 000 to 500 , 000 of Pakistani refugees on our soil . The refugee issue is a common issue , like other issues that confront us . I had began with Allama Iqbal s poem , so instead of reading it in English , I will need to read it in Dari .
