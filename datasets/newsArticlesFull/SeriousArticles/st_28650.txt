In thinking about families whose lives fall outside the church ' s norms , the synod ' s initial document took its cues from a theological model first developed at Vatican II , a model that at first had to do with interreligious dialogue . But here , instead of teaching that other religious communities have only partial access to the truth about God , the synod claimed that nontraditional families only partially reflect God ' s intentions for human relationships . These families have " seeds of the Word of God that have spread beyond the church ' s visible and sacramental boundaries , " the document stated . In thinking about them , the synod said it turned " respectfully to those who participate in her life in an incomplete and imperfect way . "
