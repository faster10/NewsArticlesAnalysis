But I made a very different decision . I chose instead to stand shoulder to shoulder with Sen . Jeff Sessions and lead the fight against amnesty . I chose to honor the commitments , the promises that I made to the men and women of Texas . And I ll tell you the reason why : I wasn t willing to go back to Texas and stand in a town hall and look the people who elected me in the eyes and say , I broke my word to you . That mattered more to me than the adulation , than the money , than the praise from the media , from the donors , from the Washington cartel . I remembered who I was working for , which is the people who elected me to fight for them .
