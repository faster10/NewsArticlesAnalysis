Communist Party officials are under pressure to clean up or perish . " The life or death of the party depends on whether or not we have a strong will to punish and prevent corruption , " Chinese President Hu Jintao told a meeting of the party elite last September . Party leaders pledged to attack the " acute problems " of corruption , the gap between the rich and the poor , and the lack of democracy within the party ' s own ranks . At the meeting , they outlined an anti corruption directive that would compel officials and their families to disclose their property holdings and investments . " The new transparency rules are meant to curb abuse of power , " says political analyst Wenran Jiang . " It ' s also aimed at appeasing public discontent over corruption . "
