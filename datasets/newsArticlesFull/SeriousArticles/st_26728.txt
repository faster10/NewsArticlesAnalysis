In another failed rescue attempt , Linda Norgrove , a 36 year old British aid worker in Afghanistan , was killed when American commandos tried to free her from her Taliban captors on October 8 , 2010 . American forces arrived in helicopters in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan , but because of the remote location they lacked much of the element of surprise . In the ensuing firefight , a SEAL threw a fragmentation grenade killing Norgrove . The SEAL was later disciplined for throwing the grenade .
