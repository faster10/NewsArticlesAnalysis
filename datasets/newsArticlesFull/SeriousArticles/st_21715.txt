We may have gotten it a little better in 2007 , when we informed the president that Syria had built a nuclear reactor with North Korean assistance . However , we cautioned him that we had low confidence that it was part of a nuclear weapons program , not because there was an alternative explanation that made much sense but simply because our body of knowledge on the other parts needed for such a program ( like a reprocessing facility or weaponization work ) was pretty thin . In that instance , the president rejected pre emption . ( The site was bombed by Israeli aircraft . )
