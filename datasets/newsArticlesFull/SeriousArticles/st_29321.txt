On that crisp and glorious morning , I drove away from our home in Bayside , Queens . I dropped off Zeshan at Queensborough Community College , then continued on to Catherine Count Basie Middle School 72 , where I taught English . When Zeshan and I left the house , at about 7 : 15 , Salman was still sleeping . He had been up much of the evening , first polishing up his medical school application , then providing medical care to his father , who was feeling ill . Finally , Salman went up to bed at 3 a . m . in the bedroom he shared with Zeshan .
