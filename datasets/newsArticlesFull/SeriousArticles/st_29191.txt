On the day of the meeting , the two girls wore the same outfit a pink sweater and jeans . The girls were the same height , which was unusual because they were both tall for their age . They both had brown hair and wore it in the same style . They both had 3 year old black Labrador retrievers at home , as well as gray pet rabbits . They both brought their guinea pigs , which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters . It was almost as though these two Laura Buxtons were the same person .
