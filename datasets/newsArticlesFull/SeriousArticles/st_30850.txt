Wogan wasn t just being rude . He had a wonderfully patriotic theory about Eurovision , and about what made it so much fun . Pop , he believed , is an Anglophone invention . The continentals just can t do it , any more than Brits can dance flamenco . He d ask : have you ever heard a decent French pop song ? Or seen the German idea of a crowd pleaser ? While British pop can be universal , he said , continental pop is trapped in its own culture . And when it tries to break out , hilarity ensures .
