Overreaction now would involve sending large numbers of American ground troops to Iraq and Syria and establishing a no fly zone in Syria . Putting large numbers of U . S . troops on the ground , rather than relying on indigenous forces like Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi army , would only enhance the ISIS claim about this being a struggle between the West and Islam for the future of the region . And establishing a no fly zone would do nothing to help the struggle against ISIS since the group does not have an Air Force .
