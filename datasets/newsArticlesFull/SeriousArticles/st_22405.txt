The first official day of the conference Monday , November 30 , is to be dominated by the meeting of the heads of states , who are expected to set the mood for real negotiations . The French hosts are attempting to get a joint statement out from the meeting as well though questions remain over whether that would be possible in the short duration when more than 100 heads of states gather . Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be accompanied by power minister Piyush Goyal as well besides Javadekar . The foreign secretary S Jaishankar will too be there while the PM is in Paris .
