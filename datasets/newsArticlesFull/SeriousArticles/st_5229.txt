Zuckerberg ' s strategy to promote his IPO is to present Facebook as a technology company that exists for the public good . " There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected , to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future , " he wrote in the SEC letter . But this is a fallacy . Facebook is a privately owned , for profit enterprise that exists for the benefit of its shareholders and employees . Connectivity benefits the company rather than us . Openness , we need to always remember , is a self serving Silicon Valley ideology rather than a self evident public good .
