What position should be the Steelers top priority in the draft ? The Steelers have a few potential needs , but cornerback is a good place to start . They ve invested in linebackers in the first round of the past three drafts . It s time to add a rangy , athletic corner that can help advance coordinator Keith Butler s speed and strength vision for the defense . They took Senquez Golson in the second round last year , but he seems destined for slot corner duties . They need a momentum altering corner on the outside with size . Tight end and nose tackle also will be needs for Pittsburgh , along with possibly safety .
