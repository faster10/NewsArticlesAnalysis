The militant gains in Mosul and other cities of the north and Anbar are the direct result of the removal of the Iraqi security forces commanders and local Sons of Iraq leaders who had turned the tide against al Qaeda in 2007 2008 . Those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with al Maliki loyalists from Baghdad who , when the bullets began to fly , had no interest in dying for Sunni and Kurdish territory . And when the commanders left the battlefield this week , their troops melted away as well .
