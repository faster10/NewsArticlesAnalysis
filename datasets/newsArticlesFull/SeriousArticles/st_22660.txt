" Behind the walls , the police found a scene that one report described as ' little short of medieval , ' with hundreds of workers literally trapped inside the compound , living in squalid conditions , forced to work long hours , and subjected to physical , emotional , and sexual intimidation and abuse . Workers who angered the employer were often ' put to shame ' in front of others by having their hair cut or shaved in patches . Women and girls were stripped naked and publicly beaten as a form of discipline . "
