Peet : One needs good writings and there are many comedians that I ' m friends with that aren ' t apart of the comedy scene it ' s very hard to break in and be taken serious as a comedic actress . It just takes one good role and some eye traffic and that ' s hard to come by . Oftentimes you ' re just the setup for the joke . Like in volleyball set and spike . That involves some comedic skill , but it ' s also frustrating . On " Bent , " I really feel like Tad Quill , creator threw me the ball . If we get a chance to go , it would get funnier and funnier . If you take " Cheers " and " Seinfeld " and watch the early shows , they ' re kind of awkward . It took a while for the writers and everything to gel .
