He ripped into me once for a headline that he didn t like on one of my stories . When I explained that writers don t write their own headlines he said That s a lie and it always has been . ( No , it s not ) . He once talked about a kid playing cornerback , and I asked him to clarify that he was really talking about Sam Madison , who was then 32 . He snapped at my innocent question , and was so bothered by it for some reason that he came back down to the locker room later and snapped at me again .
