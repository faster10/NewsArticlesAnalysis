The Bengals linebacker recorded six tackles , one sack ( which knocked Ben Roethlisberger out of the game ? more on that later ) , one interception ( after which he ran 85 yards into the tunnel to celebrate ) , and a forced fumble . Great game , Vontaze ! He also nearly killed Steelers receiver Antonio Brown ( also more on that later ) , incurring the first of two 15 yard penalties that contributed to the Cincinnati loss . At his locker after the game , Burfict channeled Marshawn Lynch , refusing to explain his actions or answer any questions . He did , though , take a moment to blame Porter for being on the field ( more on that later , too ) .
