Consider this . No film has won best picture at the Oscars without a Screen Actors Guild ensemble nomination since Braveheart back in 1995 . So what do today s nominations tells us ? Spotlight is there , of course ( a real ensemble film ) . But The Martian , The Revenant , The Hateful Eight and Steve Jobs fail to make the final five . Spotlight is accompanied by four films that few pundits have in their top 10 for the Oscars : Straight Outta Compton , The Big Short , Beasts of No Nation and Trumbo . Bizarrely , that last film , a study of blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo featuring an impressive Bryan Cranston , ended up topping the nominations chart with three . Have a tall one if you saw that coming .
