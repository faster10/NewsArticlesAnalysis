Theme of the week : It ' s all about the title game . Stanford and USC have a fantastic history of back and forth games , and Saturday ' s championship will hopefully live up to the drama . The obvious sidebar is the future of USC interim coach Clay Helton , and whether simply getting to the title game is enough to warrant giving him the full time job . Or does he have to win it ? Also , fun storylines involving the legacies of senior quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Kevin Hogan , plus super sophs Adoree ' Jackson and Christian McCaffrey . This matchup gives us plenty to talk about this week .
