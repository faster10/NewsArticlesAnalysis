Paisley and LL Cool J recorded a song in the hopes of easing racial tension and fostering more understanding . Instead , their song was met by almost universal criticism . Some said the lyrics are culturally insensitive , others said it ' s just bad . All three of us agreed that some of the lyrics were ridiculous , such as LL Cool J ' s line : " If you don ' t judge my gold chains I ' ll forget the iron chains . " Was LL really saying that if a White man doesn ' t judge his choice of flashy jewelry , then Black Americans should forget slavery ? But the bigger point we discussed is that it ' s almost impossible to talk about race in America without being attacked by people on both the far left and far right . I also tell a joke about " White people " that I had performed last month on a TV show that generated an avalanche of angry tweets and e mails . Just shows , we ' ve gone a long way to go .
