The presidential race has been going on for an exhausting amount of time already ( since last summer , really ) . During this period , we ' ve seen several improbable things happen . The political pundit class has been wrong about most of them so far . When Iowa votes , we ' ll finally have some real ballot box information to digest and the pundits will ( if history is any guide ) likely proudly state the wrong conclusions from the results . The time when political junkies ( and I do include myself in that category ) have lots of fun obsessing over a race that few are paying attention to is almost over , and the time for the voters to actually have their say is almost upon us . The only prediction that can now be made with any hope of being accurate is that February is going to be a fascinating month to watch , as it could define the rest of the primary season . Whether you ' re praying for a foot of snow or clear skies in Iowa next Monday night , we ' re all finally about to find out what the voters truly think of this year ' s slate of candidates . One week to go , and counting . . . .
