Speaking at the party headquarters in Yangon , Suu Kyi was quoted by Myanmar Times as saying , Myanmar needed humble winners and good losers . It appeared she was trying to make the defeat as palatable as possible to the generals who have dominated the country s politics . If the military rulers allowed the democratic system to survive , that s only by keeping the NLD out . But the times when the military could simply overturn a democratic victory have passed , with the balance of power having shifted towards the NLD . Though the generals have no option other than accept the present verdict , they have still not opted out of the political process . Twenty five per cent of the seats in Myanmar s parliament are reserved for the military . In addition , the military class controls the security forces , owns huge economic holdings ? not to mention the support they enjoy among large swathes of social constituencies that are outside of this unformed class . ?
