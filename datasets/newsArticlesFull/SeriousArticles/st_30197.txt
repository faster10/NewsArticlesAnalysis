Herein lies the promise of this moment . By harnessing the considerable financial and social loyalty it has built over the years , the Komen Foundation has an opportunity to do much more than reverse one small , but significant funding decision they could take the lead in constructing a radically different approach to the breast cancer epidemic . This new approach would prioritize not political interests or corporate sponsors , but women ' s health . Along the way , it might also bring us closer to realizing the Komen Foundation ' s vision of a " world without breast cancer . "
