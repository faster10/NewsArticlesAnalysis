Not at all . Chuck Robbins is great . We were good friends and he was my peer when I was there . He is absolutely the right CEO for Cisco . Chuck and I are still great friends . We talk and text often . For me , it was my own passion of wanting to do something different . What does happen is that if you are in a senior leadership position , you have to choose the right time to make a transition . It was important that my team was stable , that the company ' s position was well since I had a huge responsibility .
