Here ' s a bigger thing . Does it matter ? I ' m not sloughing off the statistical significance like many will . It ' s easier to just say " count the rings . " But there are a lot of guys with rings , if only few with that many . Bryant ' s ethos as a player , his notoriety and identity were built upon his scoring ability . That ' s what makes him the Mamba . No matter what , he goes down as the greatest scoring guard of all time , and that ' s a feat in and of itself . Coming up nearly 6 , 000 points short of the top , however , does stand out to a degree , though he ' ll obviously close that gap at least this season , and perhaps in the future . ( It also completely blows your mind as far as how amazing Kareem Abdul Jabbar ' s career was , both in longevity and output . )
