Technology also is critical . A " great bubbling " of innovation is at work all across the energy spectrum , conventional as well as alternatives . In the case of renewables , much of the focus is on cost reduction . And certainly the technological advance is evident . A wind turbine today is a far larger and more sophisticated machine than a wind turbine of the 1980s , and it may produce as much as a hundred times more electricity . The costs of solar energy continue to come down , and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions .
