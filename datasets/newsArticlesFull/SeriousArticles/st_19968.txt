Action could have gutted corruption out of the U . S . political system but the 2012 election will be like all the others , bought by millions of dollars , abandoned by millions of voters . Iran could have rejoined civilization , but , instead , the irrational alienation of Iranians has continued . Imaginative initiatives could have helped to reverse the clash of civilizations , but inter communal violence has gone on accumulating . I relish unmemorable years : They make it easier for me to update my textbook on the history of the world . They absolve me from further work . But , on the scale of those of 2011 , missed opportunities are bad for all of us .
