Can t wait for the pictures to surface of Manziel s reported visit to Las Vegas the night before the Browns finished the season . The report said he was wearing a blonde wig , mustache , glasses , a hoodie and was going by the name Billy . Manziel was out with a concussion but was still required to be examined by the Browns doctors on game day as part of the league s protocol . Clearly , Johnny Football has no interest in being an NFL quarterback . Not only does he stink on the field , he s worse off the field . The Browns new regime must get rid of him . But I wouldn t be shocked if Jerry Jones brings him back home to Texas and believes he can keep the Cowboys offense running if Tony Romo gets hurt again next year . Jones had to be talked out of drafting Manziel in 2014 Last year when Darrelle Revis was with the Patriots , he received the most votes of any cornerback on the AP All Pro team with 42 out of 50 . This year , back with the Jets , he was tied for eighth with just one vote , one fewer than Malcolm Butler , who replaced him as the Patriots top corner this season .
