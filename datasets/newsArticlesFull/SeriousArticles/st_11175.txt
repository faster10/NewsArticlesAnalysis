So what ' s the appeal of a flatter COLA for beltway budget cutters ? It ' s a stealth benefit cut masquerading as a technical fix . The rationale is that the current price index overstates inflation because it doesn ' t fully account for the ability of consumers to change their buying habits in response to price changes . In other words , if the price of oranges goes up , people will buy more apples and fewer oranges , and this change isn ' t fully reflected in the CPI W even though the consumption " basket " evolves over time to put more weight on apples and less on oranges .
