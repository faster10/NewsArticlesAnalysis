The Chiefs defense completely shut down Philip Rivers and the Chargers offense . Before Sunday , Rivers ' lowest total of the season was 241 yards , he threw for 178 against Kansas City . Rivers was under relentless pressure which led to three sacks and a pick 6 to Justin Houston . Oddly enough , Houston wasn ' t the only defensive player to score for Kansas City . Defensive lineman Donatri Poe scored on a RUSHING TOUCHDOWN in the first quarter . The Chiefs have now won 4 in a row to get back in the AFC playoff race .
