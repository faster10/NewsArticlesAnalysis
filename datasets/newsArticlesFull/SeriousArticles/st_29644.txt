Enshrined in the NFL Code of Conduct is a call to higher standards : " While criminal activity is clearly outside the scope of permissible conduct , and persons who engage in criminal activity will be subject to discipline , the standard of conduct for persons employed in the NFL is considerably higher . It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime . Instead , as an employee of the NFL or a member club , you are held to a higher standard and expected to conduct yourself in a way that is responsible , promotes the values upon which the League is based , and is lawful .
