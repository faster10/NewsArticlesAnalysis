As do Sanders and O ' Malley , Clinton proposes to strengthen our health care system lower prescription drug costs improve support for reproductive care . Set aside for now Obamacare versus single payer versus something else again , my point is not about specific policies but overriding purpose . Is there any doubt that a healthier country is stronger and more prosperous ? That the needless deaths caused by failures in preventive care have economic as well as social costs ? That catastrophic illnesses which bankrupt families also drain our human and financial capital ? Or that using ERs as the healthcare of first resort places heavy burdens on our health system that all of us wind up paying ?
