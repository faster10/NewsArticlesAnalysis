" You know what , I ' m glad those high profile figures are out there , and they ' re putting the pressure on the governor and holding him accountable for some things . What I ' ve said is , we have an investigation going on and I can ' t wait to hear the results of that investigation because everybody that should be held accountable needs to be held accountable . We want to know who knew what and when they knew it . And that ' s from the governor , all the way down to if it includes local officials . We want everyone to be held accountable and if it means they have to be removed , so be it . "
