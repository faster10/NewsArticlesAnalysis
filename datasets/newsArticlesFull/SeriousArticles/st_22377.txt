Recovering in one of the wards is 17 year old Naweed Tanha . He was badly injured on September 8 when a teenage suicide bomber blew himself up outside ISAF Headquarters in Kabul . It was the 55th suicide bombing in Afghanistan this year . " We were all selling bracelets in that place , " explains Naweed , quietly sitting on a bench outside , happy to get out of the crammed hospital ward . His right hand is thickly bandaged after the explosion tore a chunk off his palm . His legs and back were also badly injured after being flung ten meters by the force of the blast .
