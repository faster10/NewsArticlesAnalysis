Ohio Gov . John Kasich predicts Trump will soon fade from the top of GOP presidential polls as voters look for " somebody who has the experience . " In an interview with CNN ' s Jake Tapper on " State of the Union , " Kasich said doesn ' t buy polls that show Trump in the lead including a new CNN ORC poll that puts the real estate mogul ' s support at 36 percent , more than double any other contender , among Republicans . Kasich said those polled weren ' t necessarily likely voters and he ' s not convinced many who say they back Trump will ultimately vote for him . " We think , at this point in time more than any other time , we need to have America united , and we need to have an American president that ' s going to unite us and not divide us , " Kasich said : CNN
