Want to spend the night in the slammer ? Why not make it a jail haunted by the spirits of former inmates and deemed unsuitable for prisoners in the early1970s due to appalling conditions ? Opened in 1862 , the Carleton County Gaol was in operation for over a century , but it was hardly a hit with the prisoners who complained of cramped conditions and sanitation problems . It might not have been suitable for prisoners at the time , but if you ' re a traveler on a tight budget and don ' t mind that your room happens to be a prison cell and your bunkmate might be spectral , it ' s perfect . As a ' prisoner ' today , your punishment includes parking , wifi , and a games lounge .
