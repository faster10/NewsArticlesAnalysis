When Alibaba listed , it paid an estimated 300 million in fees to the banks and other advisers working on the deal . Saudi Aramco will no doubt pay a lot more , and not just because it is bigger . It will be doing everything it can to ensure that the IPO is a success , and that difficult questions are dismissed , and that rarely comes cheap . A billion in fees ? That is hardly an extravagant sum to spend when you are selling an asset for a trillion or more . Investment banks will be falling over one another for a slice of that pie .
