One of Lessig ' s heroes is Henry David Thoreau , and he likes to quote the American philosopher as saying , " There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root . " Lessig sees the role of money in politics as the root of the country ' s current ills , from health care to education to the economy . He also thinks it explains why the parties appear to have grown closer in economic ideology where the concentrated corporate lobbying money is while growing more polarized in social ideology , for which more extreme viewpoints yield a bigger haul . He is quick to note that this corruption is " not the product of evil " it leads to " great harm , " but is the result of " no bin Laden . "
