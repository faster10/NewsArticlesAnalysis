Cruz should not be underestimated , though . He is a shrewd , Nixonian tactician who probably has had his path to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination mapped out on a county by county basis since he was 12 years old .

If that reversion to the norm continues apace , then Cruz begins roughly around where he started : a factional candidate representing the hard right who will have a difficult time amassing a majority of delegates .
