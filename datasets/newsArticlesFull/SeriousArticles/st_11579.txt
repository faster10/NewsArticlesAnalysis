" Steve Jobs was an extraordinary visionary , our very dear friend and the guiding light of the Pixar family . He saw the potential of what Pixar could be before the rest of us , and beyond what anyone ever imagined . Steve took a chance on us and believed in our crazy dream of making computer animated films the one thing he always said was to simply ' make it great . ' He is why Pixar turned out the way we did and his strength , integrity and love of life has made us all better people . He will forever be a part of Pixar ' s DNA . Our hearts go out to his wife Laurene and their children during this incredibly difficult time . "
