Fiorina fires at Trump : Carly Fiorina fired at Donald Trump Thursday after the billionaire likened Ben Carson s pathological temper as a young man to the mental issues of a child molester . The Hill writes Fiorina wrote on her Facebook page : Donald , sorry , I ve got to interrupt again , in a reference to a moment from Tuesday s Republican presidential debate , when Trump chastised Fiorina for interjecting . You would know something about pathological . How was that meeting with Putin ? Or Wharton ? Or your self funded campaign ? Anyone can turn a multi million dollar inheritance into more money , but all the money in the world won t make you as smart as Ben Carson .
