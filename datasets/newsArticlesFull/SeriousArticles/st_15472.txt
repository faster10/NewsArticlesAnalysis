This argument has been strongly questioned by other scientists , including myself . It is certainly counterintuitive , in that it implies that weaker temperature contrasts globally cause stronger temperature contrasts locally . I don ' t think the research to date justifies such a conclusion . But the research on both sides is all still new and hotly debated . Events like the current one highlight some of what we still don ' t understand about the relationship of long term climate changes to short term extreme weather .
