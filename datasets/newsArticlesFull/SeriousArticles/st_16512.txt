We took out the enemy target with the last remaining missile on our aircraft . Several months later , I was talking to a Marine . When he found out I flew Cobras , he started to recount an experience he had in Iraq in which a Cobra shot a missile and saved his squad . Turned out , it was the same mission the missile came from my aircraft . He stared at me and said , " Ma ' am , you saved my life . " Did it matter that the one who fired that missile was a woman , or that she was black and gay ? Absolutely not !
