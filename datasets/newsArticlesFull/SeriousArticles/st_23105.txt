The Nuggets are headed in the right direction . Mike Malone was a good hire and Emmanuel Mudiay was a freaking steal . That said , getting anywhere near 40 wins in the West is going to be tough . Denver s starting lineup is anchored by young players . Mudiay , who will start , is joined by Jusuf Nurkic , a vibrant defender rebounder who is still recovering from a partially torn patella tendon . The Nuggets have played a slightly faster pace in the preseason and Kenneth Faried looks like someone breathed new life into him . I like Denver s pool of young talent ( including guard Gary Harris ) and if that group matures faster than expected the Nuggets could be a . 500 team . Realistically , though , I think anywhere between 30 and 34 wins sounds right .
