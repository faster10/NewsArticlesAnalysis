When JAMA told us : " OK , come up with a name you have 24 hours , " our solution was the term IDLE , which actually sounds like what it is intended to convey . The IDLE condition is an Indolent Lesion of Epithelial origin . ( Epithelial is the type of cell that lines all the ducts in the body and is the cell of origin of many solid tumor types . ) We intend the term to be used when a lesion does not pose an urgent threat , where observation over time is an acceptable alternative to an invasive procedure , and may in fact be the best course of action .
