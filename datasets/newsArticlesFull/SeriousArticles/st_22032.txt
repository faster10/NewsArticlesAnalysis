For the official opposition to respond to terrorist atrocities of such gravity by feuding with itself has presented a terrible spectacle ? and despairing Labour MPs know it . This makes it more likely that a considerable number of them will vote with David Cameron , providing that he frames his case in a persuasive way and argues for air strikes as a component of a broader and plausible plan of political , diplomatic and humanitarian action . They will back the prime minister over their own leader even if Mr Corbyn tries to whip them . Some of them will be frontbenchers and they will vote against him on this even if they have to resign .
