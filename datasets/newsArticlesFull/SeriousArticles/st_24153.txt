Last year I decided that I wanted to share my story with people across the country , so I wrote a book , Jeb said , delivering the setup . Well , really , I didn t write it , not in the traditional sense . I emailed it ! There s your punch line , which in turn set up the conclusion : They used to call me the e governor . I checked this out and , yes , it is true : Jeb Bush was referred to as the e governor back in the days of the Internet s youth when every word had an e crudely soldered to it to make it sound internetty . What we have here is Jeb Bush reliving his glory days as a totally cutting edge public servant from the late 90s . He was an early user of something literally everyone uses now , and he demands recognition of this fact . Jeb is a hipster .
