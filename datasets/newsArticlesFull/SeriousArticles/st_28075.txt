Talking of self deportation , there ' s a question as to whether Kris Kobach , the Kansas secretary of state who advocates the concept and is credited as the architect of Arizona ' s controversial SB1070 law , is an adviser or a supporter to Romney . Which is it ? Romney has not publicly embraced Dreamers , but he ' s had no difficulty embracing the guys who give us nightmares , such as Sheriff Joe Arpaio , U . S . Rep . Steve King of Iowa and Kobach . How should Hispanics feel about that and what role , if any , would any of them play in a Romney administration ?
