The Clinton campaign s messaging on the issue has been muddled : While it insists that Clinton herself supports the goal of universal health care , Clinton has attacked universal health care from a conservative direction , warning it would require major tax hikes on the middle class without mentioning the cost savings that would come with the elimination of premiums and deductibles . Chelsea Clinton went the furthest , bizarrely claiming Sanders wants to end Medicare , Medicaid and other programs , while throwing " millions and millions " off their health insurance .
