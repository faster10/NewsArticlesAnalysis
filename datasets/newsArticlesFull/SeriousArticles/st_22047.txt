I don ' t think the Cowboys offensive line will be able to neutralize everything the Seahawks front brings to the table . Michael Bennett can disrupt a team in so many different ways , and Cliff Avril quietly has had an outstanding season . Dallas has three of the best at their respective positions ? in offensive tackle ? Tyron Smith , guard Zack Martin and center Travis Frederick . But this doesn ' t look like the completely dominant unit it was last year . All Seattle needs to do is rattle Matt Cassel on occasion , and it should be able to do that .
