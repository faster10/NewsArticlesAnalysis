Maher said that if there s one thing this election has shown us it is that amateur is the new black . If there s one thing republicans can agree on , it s that the less the head of our government knows about government the better , Maher said . Perhaps this comes from their secret hatred of government and the desire to reduce the government as much as possible . How else to get someone on the side of smaller government than to make the public agree that a leader they just elected is a moron . Oh , if only they were that smart . Experience ? Republicans avoid that stuff like a gay son ! Maher declared .
