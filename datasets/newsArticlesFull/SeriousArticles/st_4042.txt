The health department said it may be hard to connect the legionella cases to the Flint water crisis since there is a lack of bacterial specimens from these patients . The EPA made inquiries about corrosion as early as February 2015 , at which time MI state officials replied that Flint had an optimized corrosion control plan .

People can get sick if they inhale mist or vapor from contaminated water systems , hot tubs and cooling systems , but the bacteria don t spread from person to person .
