Bullock ' s one two punch demanded a fair amount of give and take from the actor . When she signed on to The Heat Bullock didn ' t expect to be playing straight man to McCarthy ' s firehose blast of a performance . " Once I realized that that drove the film I had to step back , " she says . " Otherwise I would ' ve been fighting for something that would ' ve ended up on the cutting room floor . It wasn ' t what I was hoping for but the end result was the success of the film and people liking us together . " While Bullock nixes any talk of The Heat 2 , she says she ' s keen for another project with her fast friend McCarthy . ( Hollywood , get on this ! )
