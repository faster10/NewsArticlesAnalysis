So the IMF now says : We are now only going to follow our rules and act on behalf of the dollar area . Countries that owe dollar debts to the US and its satellite currencies like the euro will have to pay . But if your owe debts to Russia , China , Iran , or any country not in the orbit , it is ok not to pay we will lend you the money , the US will lend you the money , the IMF will lend you the money . You can now split the world into two currency groups : the dollar group and the BRICS group . So this essentially is a declaration of financial war by the US against all countries that are not using the US dollar in foreign trade and are not basing their own domestic currency on the US dollar as the euro is doing . This is a radical change that is the most important change in half a century .
