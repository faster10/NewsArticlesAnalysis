Another Bush vs . Rubio fight sets the stage for tonight ' s GOP debate : Tonight ' s fourth Republican presidential debate picks up where the last one left off with Jeb Bush in desperate need of a strong showing , and with his team ( this time his Super PAC ) picking a fight with Marco Rubio . The Right to Rise Super PAC " has filmed a provocative video casting his rival Marco Rubio as ultimately unelectable because of his hard line stand against abortion , " the New York Times reported last night . " That group , which has raised more than 100 million , has asked voters in New Hampshire how they feel about Mr Rubio ' s skipping important votes in the Senate . And the group ' s chief strategist has boasted of his willingness to spend as much as 20 million to damage Mr Rubio ' s reputation and halt his sudden ascent in the polls , according to three people told of the claim . " In response , the Rubio campaign has released a brand new online ad in response to the New York Times article , and it ' s full of instances where Bush has praised Rubio . " I ' m a huge Marco fan , " Bush says at the ad ' s end .
