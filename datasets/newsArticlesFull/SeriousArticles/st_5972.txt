I picked the Broncos to win it all in preseason and midseason predictions , so I ' m going to stick with them as the AFC team that makes it ( though I wouldn ' t be shocked if the Chiefs pull it off ) . But the best teams all reside in the NFC , and despite the Panthers incredible season and the Seahawks end of year surge , the Cardinals have an intimidating , versatile defense , a variety of weapons on offense and , in my opinion , the best coach in football right now in Bruce Arians . Those three things will win you a championship .
