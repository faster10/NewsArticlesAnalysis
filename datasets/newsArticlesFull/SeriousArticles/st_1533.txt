Early in high school , McCarthy was a preppy jock : a cheerleader and a student council member . But when puberty hit , she dyed her hair blue black , wore weirdo fishnets on her arms and snuck out to Chicago , where she ' d frequent a club called Medusa ' s and dance on scaffolding . " I turned slightly nuts , " she admits of the years she drank wine coolers and cheap beer and did a little shoplifting . " We ' d wrap sweaters around ourselves and walk out . " ( She also owns up to stealing a Chunky when she was five . )
