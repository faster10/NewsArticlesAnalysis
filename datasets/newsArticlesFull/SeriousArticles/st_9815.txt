? The Chiefs pass defense is no joke either , at both levels . On the front end , they have two excellent edge rushers in Hali and Houston , who combined for three sacks against the Patriots last year and will be tough matchups for Vollmer and Marcus Cannon ( although Hali has lost a step after 10 NFL seasons and Houston s knee is not fully healthy ) . Poe and Howard might be even bigger worries , as they were consistently in the backfield against the Texans ( Poe s pressure caused Brian Hoyer to throw an interception on the goal line ) and could cause problems for the Patriots shaky interior line .
