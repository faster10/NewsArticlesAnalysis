The Fox payroll was soon packed with potential 2012 contenders like Sarah Palin , Mike Huckabee , Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum , with the latter two jumping from Rupert Murdoch ' s team into the presidential primaries .

Now , Herman Cain , who left the race under a cloud after denying allegations of sexual harassment and an extramarital affair , has joined the Fox team . In his first outing the other night , Cain said 51 of Americans were " misled " into voting for Obama , prompting a dissent from Bill O ' Reilly . Is this the kind of unvarnished analysis we can expect from Cain ?
