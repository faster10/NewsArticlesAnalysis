In his stump speech he talks about economic equality and hollers to the crowds he will raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires . He neglects to mention he will ask everyone to pay higher taxes . Reminds me of speaking to college students on marriage equality . Two guys said they were going to marry the moment it was legal . I asked if they understood they would be responsible for each other ' s loans they were shocked . No one ever told them of the responsibilities that come with marriage . Sanders is intentionally leaving out the costs each person will bear if his programs could ever be implemented .
