Rather , I enjoy taking and posting photos from my phone using services that also let me specify a check in location , in order to provide context and connection . This lets me easily find other people ' s photos from those places , and they can easily find mine . So I use Instagram ( and before that was available on Android , PicPlz ) to check in to Foursquare as well as Twitter and Facebook when I post a photo . This way , I can easily share not just pictures and information but also a sense of place with my friends and others .
