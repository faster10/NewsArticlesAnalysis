The running game seems to be going in reverse , as the Giants had a paltry 71 yards on the ground ( 3 . 1 yards per carry ) , with Orleans Darkwa s 23 rushing yards leading the team . Manning was inconsistent all afternoon , completing just 53 percent of his passes ( 18 for 34 ) with a touchdown and an interception . Quite frankly , the Giants seem to play better with Pugh at the left tackle spot , while Bobby Hart was not a liability on the right side subbing for the injured Marshall Newhouse .
