Rob Gronkowski has had a dominant season , but the Patriots might ask him to reach superhero status with Dion Lewis done for the year and Julian Edelman likely gone for the regular season . Danny Amendola will obviously be asked to do more , especially in clutch situations , but it s a promising sign that Amendola has been outstanding since December . Coincidentally , that stretch started at the end of the 2014 regular season when he caught 12 balls for 87 yards during Edelman s two game absence . The question now is whether Amendola can be that guy for seven games and , potentially , more if Edelman s return takes longer than expected . The Pats could also use plenty of LeGarrette Blount tonight , as the Bills have surrendered an average of 108 . 1 rushing yards over their last seven games . Efficiency will be important as the Patriots won t be expected to keep up their pace of scoring a league high 33 . 7 points per game .
