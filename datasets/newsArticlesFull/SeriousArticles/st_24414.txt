I trust players , especially veteran players , but it wasn t like he didn t practice , " head coach Gary Kubiak said . He did practice on Friday . I watched him practice Friday . I watched him make all the plays , all the throws . I felt good coming out of Friday . I guess my point that I m trying to make is that when Saturday there was more , that s when I felt like I should have said , OK , no . That s my point . Guys want to play . That s why he s a great player . That s why he s going to be a Hall of Fame player . They want to compete . They want to do everything they can for their football team , but as a football coach , sometimes you have to say , No , I don t think this is the right thing today , like I said . "
