The first hour of Friday ' s season finale , aptly titled " 2009 , " was a retelling of the first episode , which included a memorable performance of Journey ' s " Don ' t Stop Believing " by the original members of William McKinley High School ' s glee club . Instead of telling it again through Finn ' s perspective , the finale showed what led the other characters to join New Directions , culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring Monteith .
