The EPA , however , did not act publicly on del Toral s findings . Susan Hedman , the EPA administrator who resigned this week , has argued that her office could not legally make that information known . That claim was based on an interpretation of federal law that the EPA is responsible for establishing standards for states to follow , but doesn t necessarily have the ability to force states to comply with those standards . As a result , Hedman says the EPA tried to apply behind the scenes pressure to get the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to take action .
