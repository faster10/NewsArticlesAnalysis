I think Goldman has been pretty good and let s remember he s only a rookie , a player that should take a major step going into his second season . I always start with the line and then work my way back on defense , so I d look for help on the line before being concerned with the play at inside linebacker , where they can also use some help . You can t go wrong adding a playmaker in either spot . But let s keep one very important factor in mind : Sometimes the best players are not available to fit your needs . So you can t be fixated on just one position . You have to consider what is available in free agency and the draft and make it fit as a big puzzle .
