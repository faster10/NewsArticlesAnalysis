This year featured a number of notable movies starring or directed by people of color , including " Lee Daniels ' The Butler , " " Fruitvale Station , " " 42 , " " Mandela : Long Walk to Freedom " and " 12 Years a Slave . " But of that group , only " 12 Years " got any support from the Oscars , with nine nominations . " Mandela " picked up a nod for a U2 song " Fruitvale " despite showcasing rising talents Michael B . Jordan and director Ryan Coogler got nothing . And despite a 100 million box office and raves for performers Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey " The Butler " also came up with zero . During the Globes show , there was a Twitter hashtag protesting the lack of diversity : notbuyingit . You ' ll probably see it again on Oscar night .
