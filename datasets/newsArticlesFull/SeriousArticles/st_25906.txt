The Royals came back in all four of their World Series wins , the first time to do so since the Angels in 2002 . And for the most part , they trailed late . The Mets scored first in three of the four Royals wins . The Royals trailed going to the ninth of Games 1 and 5 and entering the eighth in Game 3 . Mets closer Jeurys Familia ends up on the wrong side of history , becoming the first player to blow three saves in a single World Series . He gave up a solo home run in the ninth inning of Game 1 , a mistake that is solely on him and yet something that is going to happen now and then against even elite relievers . In Games 4 and 5 , he did little wrong . He entered in the eighth on Saturday , after Tyler Clippard had walked two , and faced four batters . Three of them hit weak ground balls . And yet , three runs scored . He entered with a runner on second a 2 1 lead on Sunday and induced three groundouts . The Royals deserve a lot of credit for their resiliency ? and they have a trophy to show for it ? but Familia must be looking at the BS next to his name in the box score and considering its alternate meaning .
