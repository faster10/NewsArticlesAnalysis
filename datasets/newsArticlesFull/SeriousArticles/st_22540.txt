Ag ero was dispossessed by Ramiro Funes Mori near the Everton area and the visiting centre back passed to Leon Osman . This was along the left and when Ross Barkley received inside City s half he had work to do , and he was about to do it excellently . The midfielder cut infield , outmuscled the hapless Nicol s Otamendi , and drilled a low 20 yard shot that beat Caballero easily . This was a bit of magic to light up any semi final and had Roberto Mart nez punching the air . It gave Everton a 3 1 aggregate lead and meant City s away goal from the first leg at Goodison Park was cancelled out .
