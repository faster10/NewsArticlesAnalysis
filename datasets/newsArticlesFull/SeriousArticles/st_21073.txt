Boko Haram has evolved from a local terrorist group to a regional and global security threat . Involved in low level conflicts since its creation in 2002 , Boko Haram intensified assaults against the Nigerian state in 2009 , when it launched a series of attacks against police forces in Bauchi and then in Borno , Yobe , and Kano . Since then , Boko Haram has increased its frequency of terror attacks in Nigeria , pledged allegiance to the Islamic State , and expanded geographically to launching attacks in other West and Central African countries , such as Cameroon , Chad , and Niger . Boko Haram has killed at least 15 , 000 people and displaced 2 . 1 million in Nigeria alone . In 2013 , the U . S . House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security warned against underestimating Boko Haram s willingness and capacity to attack the United States .
