E victory : That s evangelicals over ethanol . Cruz s win came after the renewable fuel industry launched a bus tour against him and sent enough attack mailers to wallpaper my kitchen . Governor Terry Branstad even rolled up the welcome mat , saying he hoped Cruz lost because of his record of opposing renewable fuel mandates and subsidies . While the ethanol industry is important to the state , I thought it was inadvisable for the governor to put any special interest over his own pledge to remain neutral for the sake of fairness to candidates .
