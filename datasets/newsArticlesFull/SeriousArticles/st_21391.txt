The top trending track on Twitter when the album came out , Kiss It Better is an early fan favorite , and you can count me among its fans . Co written and co produced by Jeff Bhasker ( Run This Town , All of the Lights ) , who knows how to make a song sound huge , Kiss It Better is an 80s power ballad with a mind as dirty as Prince s . Over booming synths that reminds me of , of all things , Berlin s Take My Breath Away from Top Gun , Rihanna pleads for her lover to do what the song title says . What s it ? The lyrics leave that open to interpretation , but the song is way too sexual for the plea to be as innocent as a child s request .
