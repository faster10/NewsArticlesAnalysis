The cost to swap for a new phone was 229 , or just a little more than I paid for the phone outright on contract . The cost to repair the screen was 149 : 99 for AppleCare plus 49 for the screen replacement . I chose to replace the phone outright , because it nearly a year old , I ' m on contract and so wouldn ' t have been eligible to upgrade to the iPhone 5s ( then unannounced , but presumptive ) , I didn ' t have AppleCare and I figured the fresh battery I ' d get with a new iPhone 5 was worth the bargain .
