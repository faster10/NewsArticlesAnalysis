In October 2001 , Abdul Haq Wasiq , another of the five , traveled to Ghazni province for a clandestine meeting with the CIA and Afghan warlords in an attempt to strike a deal . Wasiq worked with the Taliban ' s spy agency , and he was negotiating on behalf of his boss , according to the memoir of Harry Crumpton , then deputy chief of operations at the CIA ' s Counterterrorism Center . The CIA , however , was not interested in reconciliation , only in intelligence leading to bin Laden or other top al Qaeda figures . Wasiq could not deliver this because he , like most Taliban members , did not actually have access to the Arabs . So the American team bound and gagged Wasiq and his companion , eventually shipping them to Guantanamo .
