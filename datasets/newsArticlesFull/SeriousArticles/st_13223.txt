The 53 year old Stratofortress , tail number 61 1007 , nicknamed the " Ghost Rider " had been in storage at the desert in the care of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group ( AMARG ) since 2008 . Thousands of aircraft are stored at the Boneyard , where the dry desert environment helps preserve them . Some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet . Others are brought back into service . Ghost Rider , after upgrades , will become the first B 52 to return to duty from the Boneyard .
