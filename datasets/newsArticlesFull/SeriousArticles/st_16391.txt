A : It ' s very hard to say what John Lennon would say now if he knew that the pope had forgiven him or the Catholic Church had forgiven him because on the one hand he wrote to an American evangelist called Oral Roberts and said he had been very sorry . But in a book he said he was very glad that it had happened because it effectively ended the Beatles . Because that tour was so bad that it became the last tour the Beatles ever did . So he thought , " Thank you Jesus for causing this to happen because you gave me a solo career . "
