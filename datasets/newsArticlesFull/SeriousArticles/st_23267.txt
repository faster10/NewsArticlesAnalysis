The Seminoles had been largely untested throughout the 2013 season until the BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl against Auburn . The Tigers led by as much as 17 points before FSU rallied in the second half . Whitfield , who had five catches as a true freshman and was mostly a kick return specialist , returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to give the Seminoles a 27 24 lead with 4 : 31 to play . Florida State won the game , 34 31 , when Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston threw a 2 yard touchdown pass to Kelvin Benjamin with 13 seconds left .
