I did not go to where the attacks happened , nor did I mourn the fallen in one of the numerous gatherings that were organised in spite of police instructions . I did walk down the streets on Sunday though . It was a beautiful , sunny day . I was glad to see many Parisians having coffee or dinner outside . Even some kids were on the streets with their parents , tirelessly speaking about wonderfully different matters ( the snow that will fall again this year , the Christmas presents list that changes every minute or even the latest James Bond movie at some point ) .
