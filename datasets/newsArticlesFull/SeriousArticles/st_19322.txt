About an hour before kickoff , Edelman was the first Patriots player to take the field . It was the first time all day that the New England crowd stood and roared . And then they roared again when Brady targeted Edelman four times on the Patriots opening drive ? including an 11 yard third down conversion , and a 13 yard quick hitter on the following first down play . That drive ended in a Gronkowski touchdown , after he split wide left and saw single coverage . ? How does Gronk see single coverage in the red zone , you ask ? Because Edelman , lined up in the slot to the tight end s right , had already proved he was not there just to be a decoy and forced the Chiefs to send safety help his way . Order , restored .
