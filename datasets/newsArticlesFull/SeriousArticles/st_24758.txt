As the primaries draw near , these extremist groups will eventually cast off all lingering pretenses to supporting an African American , a Hispanic , or a woman for president . Donald Trump had a chance but lost it with his continued posturing and blustering , creating suspicion and distrust of his motives . Support for Ben Carson is just a smokescreen . Eventually , they will all throw their votes behind a safer haven , perhaps not a perfect one , but a dull and comfortable candidate who offers a more familiar platform of conservatism who comes from the " right " type of people and that person is Bush . They will forgive him for having a Mexican wife , as long as she knows her place and stays quietly behind her man .
