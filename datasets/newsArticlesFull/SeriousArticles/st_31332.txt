James Esseks , director of the American Civil Liberties Union ' s Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender AIDS Project , said , " One of the things that ' s really important about the DOMA decision is that it gets rid of the core of the last federal law that requires discrimination against gay people . The country used to have a lot of laws that required discrimination against gay people , " including an executive order signed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 that banned gay employees in the federal government and all its contractors ( an order that remained in effect until it was vacated in 1975 ) . " Until 1991 , federal immigration law actually barred gay people from entering the country , " Esseks recalled .
