The 2012 trail covers approximately 945 miles , so spectators must first determine which portion of the race they aim to see . The ceremonial start of the race is , by far , the most popular choice of fans seeking access and convenience . There are a number of events in and around Anchorage leading up to the Iditarod start , such as the Mushers ' Banquet , various Iditarod educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials , and even a competing annual festival and parade in Anchorage , the Fur Rondy .
