Modi , who returned from the Climate Change summit in Paris on Tuesday , rendered a 40 minute speech in the Rajya Sabha in the debate on the making of the Constitution and the contribution of BR Ambedkar that ran for an extra day as the Opposition wanted to hear his views . The PM took off from where he had left the debate on the making of the Constitution in the Lok Sabha last week and though he repeated some of the points made on November 27 , he refrained from reiterating the consensus and not majority line .
