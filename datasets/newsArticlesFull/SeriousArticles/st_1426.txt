Gordon Levitt proves a natural filmmaker , nimbly staging Jon ' s highly amusing Catholic confessions , along with porn montages that mimic the dopamine charged editing of " Requiem for a Dream . " He also gets a terrific performance out of Tony Danza as Jon ' s hilariously blinkered brute of a dad . The bond between Jon and Esther ( Julianne Moore ) , the troubled older woman he meets in an adult ed class , isn ' t as deftly drawn . She ' s there to teach Jon lessons , and does . But Gordon Levitt ' s intuitive performance makes even this part of the film work . Jon is a guy who needs to quit his porn addiction , but to do that , he must understand that what he ' s really been having is a dysfunctional relationship with porn . It ' s the mistress he ' s devoted to and has to break up with if he wants to start living . Grade : B
