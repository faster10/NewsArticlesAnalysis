Kate Winslet : We are all so devastated to lose Alan . He was loved enormously by so many . He was an exceptionally warm and giving man and an utterly phenomenal actor and gifted director . I remember being so intimidated by him when we worked together when I was 19 , because he had such a powerful and commanding presence . And that voice ! Oh , that voice . . But the reality of course , was that he was the kindest and best of men . Had the patience of a saint . He was a warm hearted puppy dog , who would do anything for anyone if it made them happy . He was a loving and devoted partner to Rima , and like so many of us in our vast industry , my life was enriched by knowing him . My heart goes out to his family and those he loved .
