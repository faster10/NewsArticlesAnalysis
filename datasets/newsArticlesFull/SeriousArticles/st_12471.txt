Stand up and turn around : Sometimes the most powerful speech comes in the form of silence . At the start of the commencement address , stand up and turn around . Ideally make sure you ' re not the only one that there are 20 or 200 people scattered throughout the graduating class who will start popping up one by one and stand silently , back to the speaker , in quiet but powerful protest . Especially if a large number of students oppose the speaker , this is a great way to put that on display .
