It s not as if the plot could or should be taken seriously except by perfectionists who grumble at Bond s choosing to drink a Negroni instead of a martini before he beds Jeopardy Lane , a Secret Service agent who is more serious about her work than Pussy Galore . The author gives only fleeting attention to the notorious Pussy although she has her moment of fame when two bad guys paint her a lethal shade of gold which will clog her pores to the point of painfully asphyxiating her . Rescued by Bond , she survives and ungratefully runs off with a glamorous English lesbian whose charms apparently appeal to her even more than those of Mr Bond .
