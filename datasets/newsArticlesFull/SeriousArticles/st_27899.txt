Even the great performances from Eric Church , who launched a surprise album during the show called Mr Misunderstood that is seriously wonderful ( at least upon first listen ? I m sure I ll have more to say about it soon ) , Miranda Lambert , who played her ever excellent new single Bathroom Sink , and Dierks Bentley , who sang Riser with an entrancing conviction , couldn t hold a candle to the sheer feeling of the night s most riveting performance that had already transpired . Heck , Luke Bryan s win for entertainer of the year felt like footnote .
