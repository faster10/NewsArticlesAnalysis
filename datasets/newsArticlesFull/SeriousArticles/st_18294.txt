Much less fortunate were the weekend ' s two other newcomers , " Homefront " and " Black Nativity , " both of which got the cold shoulder from ticket buyers . The Jason Statham vehicle " Homefront " grossed 2 . 8 million over its first two days and may only find about 9 . 5 million in its first five . " Black Nativity " fared even worse , with 1 . 1 million combined on Wednesday and Thursday , which may result in a 3 . 8 million five day start . Given the talent involved " Angela Bassett , Jennifer Hudson , Forest Whitaker , Mary J . Blige " and the proximity to Christmas , that ' s a major disappointment .
