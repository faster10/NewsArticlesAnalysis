Indeed , as much attention as there has been on the impact of the influx of refugees on Europe , the fact is that Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan which have less resources or infrastructure to deal with such a demographic burden are caring for far greater numbers of refugees , both proportionate to their populations and in absolute numbers , than any European country . Turkey is hosting nearly two million refugees . Lebanon , whose total population is only 4 . 5 million , has taken in 1 . 2 million Syrians . Jordan ( population 6 . 4 million ) is hosting 650 , 000 . Indeed , these countries and other Middle Eastern states have taken the majority of Syrian refugees .
