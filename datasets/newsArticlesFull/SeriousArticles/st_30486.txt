It ' s amazing that after five rings for Popovich and Duncan , four for Manu and Parker , and one for Kawhi Leonard , Boris Diaw and Danny Green , that they would be this hungry . But this does feel different . The Spurs aren ' t going to be radically different in approach ( despite how much different the team will be around LMA ) , but they need this to work , and need it to work quickly . That in and of itself will be fascinating to watch , like putting Einstein , DaVinci and Sun Tzu in a room for a project and starting a clock on them . We ' ll see what comes out of it .
