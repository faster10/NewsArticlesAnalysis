The study ' s results may not have been groundbreaking : Fewer than half of patients were fully following the recommended exercise regimen ( the equivalent of brisk walking or stationary cycling for about two to three hours a week ) by the end of the study , and the effect of exercise on mortality and hospitalization risk was small . But these benefits shouldn ' t be dismissed , given the poor quality of life many chronic heart failure patients have , says Clyde Yancy , M . D . , medical director of the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute in Houston , Texas .
