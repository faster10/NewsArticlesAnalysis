Needless to say , these attitudes have a direct impact on how Marvel shapes its entertainment products . As the hacked Sony emails revealed , Marvel and Sony signed a contract in September 2011 that explicitly required all cinematic representations of Spider Man to be Caucasian and straight . A few years later , Perlmutter sent an email to Sony CEO Michael Lynton explaining why he was opposed to creating so called female movies with Marvel characters , citing outdated and critically panned examples like Catwoman , Elektra ? and Supergirl . ? This mentality even effects Marvel s merchandise , which has drawn fire for underrepresenting or downright excluding female characters amid leaked reports that Marvel employees secretly acknowledge they want Marvel to appeal only to boys . As a result , despite its global appeal , Marvel continues to churn out movies that disproportionately star white , male , and heterosexual characters , with no end to that trend in sight .
