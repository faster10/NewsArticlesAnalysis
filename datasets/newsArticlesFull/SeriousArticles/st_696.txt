Arena Racing Company , who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures , still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham , even though it is not one of their tracks . ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers , the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks . Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers , who are never seen at the races .
