NOTES : Bowles on the Jets ' eight penalties , including three on one fourth quarter drive by the Giants : " We have to clean them up . A lot of them were hot head penalties that we know we can ' t have . Going forward , if we want to win ballgames and be consistent , we can ' t have those types of penalties . It ' s been a while since they ' ve flared up , but they flared up yesterday . " . . . NT Damon Harrison on the postgame excitement of the Jets ' win : " It was a moment I ' ll never forget . "
