But Perry s social media driven support is a very modern kind of political stumping and protest . She s starting a dialogue in places where her fans congregate , utilizing the communication methods and platforms they use she s not doing a glossy television sit down or a benefit concert to discuss her love for Hillary or her political convictions . Her method is more one to one and direct , which makes it feel more personal . The Clinton campaign has adopted a similarly open voice for Hillary s social media accounts : Her Instagram account features everything from vintage photos to Halloween costume ideas , while her Twitter account is a seamless mix of casual slang and more pointed political notes . Of course , the Obama campaign used social media to great effect in both successful 2008 and 2012 elections , and so it s logical that Clinton would adopt some of the same tactics . However , it s a savvy , candid approach that makes the advocacy and campaigning feel more organic and sincere .
