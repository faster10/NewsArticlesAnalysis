At Yale University ' s School of Medicine , Meghan Morean , a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry , has been studying substance abuse in adolescence and early adulthood for nearly a decade . While she agrees with Clark that early drinking is associated with " heavier drinking as children age , " Morean says what could be a key in helping children avoid alcohol related trouble is often the willingness of their parents to talk . " The piece of the puzzle that ' s likely missing is arming underage drinkers with real , concrete information . It ' s too easy to say ' Don ' t drink and drive , ' and that ' s generally where parents stop talking . Instead , they should be quizzing their kids to see if they really understand how many drinks it takes to get drunk . Do they know what binge drinking really is and what it looks like ? These are the type of questions that need to be talked about openly and honestly . "
