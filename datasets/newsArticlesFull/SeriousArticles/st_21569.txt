This is easier said than done . The Warriors are likely the greatest shooting team in NBA history . This season , Golden State leads the league in 3 pointers made and is second in attempts , yet on defense they allow the fewest made 3 pointers and the second fewest attempts . Because the Warriors obliterate most opponents in the 3 point battle , the ideal opponent has to at least keep up with them but preferably win the fight . Your defense must be dedicated to running them off the line consistently , even if it means potentially giving up an open mid range look . Even then , it s almost impossible to stop them from generating 3s , so you need to make sure you re finding high percentage looks yourself . The Warriors are too disciplined defensively to give up treys against iso heavy or rudimentary offensive sets , however , making stellar ball movement a necessity . You want a lot of screen and roll action , some trickery off the ball , and high IQ passing to bend and , ultimately , break their defense .
