Guantanamo Bay is still open . So I have no doubt that he would have wanted after taking over to have visited a mosque , to reassure the Muslim community particularly when he would have been reminded that President George W . Bush , after 9 11 , actually visited a mosque several times , and made some good statements . He said , ' America is not the enemy of Islam , our problem is not with the religion , it s with certain people , ' et cetera , which was very reassuring . It did not check or stop the Islamophobia , but it was reassuring .
