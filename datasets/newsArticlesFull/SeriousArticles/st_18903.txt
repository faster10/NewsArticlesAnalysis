Pistorius assembled his own legal and scientific team and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport . Further tests showed that Pistorius uses energy at the same rate as other elite runners , and that the Cheetah legs are not more efficient than human legs . Also , while his artificial limbs are lighter than human legs , he must push off the ground harder to get the same thrust , which cancels out any advantage . The International Association of Athletics Federations decision was overturned .
