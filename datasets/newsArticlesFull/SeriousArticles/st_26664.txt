With their team reputation of taking cheap shots at opposing players , and a coaching staff willing to jump in and help , I was sort of relieved to see teams give them a taste of their own medicine this season . For too long I ve watched my pathetic Browns sit back and take the concussions from Steeler head hunters without fighting back . Tomlin and the Steeler way have only themselves to blame . I can t stand the bengals but I did love the way they fought back after the shazier hit . It cost them the playoffs , which I could care less about , and I think a message was sent .
