Players take on the roles of Guardians of the last city on Earth in a story that spans the solar system . The shooting action is trademark Bungie , but where this game stands out is the seamless blending of cooperative gameplay into bigger public events like taking out a giant alien boss with other players who are also exploring the world . There are community spaces for players to prepare for their next missions and connect with friends , as well as competitive multiplayer ( although Bungie is keeping mum on details ) . The developer has mapped out a franchise worth of adventures for this new world , and the first reveal looks promising .
