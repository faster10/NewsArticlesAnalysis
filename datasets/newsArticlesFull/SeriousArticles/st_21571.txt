Opposing defenses face a crucial decision when playing the Warriors : Do you focus on stopping Curry and making his teammates beat you , or do you let him get his and limit everyone else ? There is no right answer . The only correct answer is not letting both go off , which is far too often the case . If you pay too much attention to Curry , the other Warriors will make you pay . But if you divert your attention from Curry for even a moment , you re done too . Again , no one has figured out the right way to stop the Dubs offense . You just have to focus your attention on one or the other and pray . Whatever you do , however , do not trap Curry . If you do , and if there is a single crack in your defense as the rest of the Warriors play 4 on 3 , Draymond Green is going to get the ball in his hands , and he ' s going to make a play , and you ' re going to be left shaking your head as the ball goes through the net .
