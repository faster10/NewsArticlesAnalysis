While two attacks within such a short space of time is sadly not atypical for Boko Haram ( in July this year , Borno state came under multiple attacks which left more than 200 people dead in 48 hours ) , what makes these latest attacks more chilling ( and perhaps more embarrassing for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari ) is that they come only a few days after Buhari s visit to Yola . His visit was to decorate soldiers for bravery in the fight against the terrorist group , and while there , he declared that his government was close to defeating Boko Haram .
