Rushdie : I actually have taught a course in that at Emory University , where I have a part time professorship . I think you could name certainly the ones you mentioned : Ruth Jhabvala ' s adaptations of Forster . Actually , I thought Martin Scorsese ' s adaptation of Edith Wharton ' s " Age of Innocence " was really very successful . I really thought it was a wonderful film . I think one of the great examples is Visconti ' s film of " The Leopard , " a great Italian novel , which is actually one of the films we thought a lot about ( in making " Midnight ' s Children " ) because it does something that we were also trying to do , which is to take big historical events revolution in Italy and against that quite epic background , set the intimate story of a particular family .
