About the Panthers : They nearly became the second team to complete a 16 0 regular season . However of the seven teams that have won at least 15 regular season games , only three reached the Super Bowl , and just two ( 1984 49ers , 1985 Bears ) won it . MVP frontrunner Cam Newton triggers the league ' s highest scoring offense ( 500 points ) . Newton established career highs for TD passes ( 35 ) and passer rating ( 99 . 2 ) despite losing No . 1 receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a knee injury in training camp . A dual threat , Newton also rushed for 636 yards and 10 TDs . Carolina hopes to have Pro Bowl RB Jonathan Stewart back from a foot injury that has prevented him from playing since Dec . 13 . LBs Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis and CB Josh Norman are the stars of the defense . However Carolina surrendered 345 . 8 yards and 20 . 6 points per game over the last five weeks , numbers that are more worrisome ( 374 . 8 , 25 . 8 ) when a Week 14 shutout of the Atlanta Falcons is thrown out . The Panthers are 3 2 in playoff games in Charlotte .
