Is this proof that Baalke and York are admitting their mistake on Harbaugh and willing to let Kelly do his thing without meddling ? Has Kelly learned that he perhaps was not ready for such major personnel control with the Eagles and that he should focus his primary energies on coaching ? If so , this pairing has the potential to be potent in time . Perhaps Kelly already having a connection with 49ers personnel executive Tom Gamble , who was with Kelly in Philadelphia , could be the proper intermediary to make this experiment work in harmony .
