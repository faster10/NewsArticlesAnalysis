HRC s endorsement comes as no surprise . A staunch LGBT rights advocate , Clinton celebrated the Supreme Court s decision last June to make marriage equality the law of the land . As secretary of state , she prioritized the elimination of violence and discrimination against LGBT people , famously declaring in a 2011 speech in Geneva that gay rights are human rights . And as a senator , Clinton repeatedly co sponsored the Employment Non Discrimination Act ( ENDA ) , which at the time would have barred discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation . ( A later version of ENDA also banned employment discrimination on basis of gender identity it has never cleared Congress . )
