That sounds like bad news . And , in some respects , it is . The situation at some polling places didn ' t make it easy to vote . More than two dozen of them on the island of Oahu alone ran out of ballots on Election Day . A polling place volunteer at one elementary school told me he had to start handing out Japanese language ballots to English speakers just to keep the line moving . The state should institute same day voter registration and other reforms that would encourage new voters to go to the polls .
