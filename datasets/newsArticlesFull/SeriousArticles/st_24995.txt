Try this analogy ( thanks to Veritasium . com ) : if the Earth were the size of a basketball , the moon would be a tennis ball about 24 feet away , and the Sun would be like a house nearly two miles away . To the sun , the Earth is a tiny speck : its diameter is less than 0 . 01 of the Earth sun distance . But the size of the Earth is a few percent of the distance to the moon , which translates to about a 7 stronger gravitational pull on the near side of the Earth than the far side . That ' s why the moon dominates the Earth ' s tides .
