Partly it s aspirational . If they wanted to make a case that they are somewhat less likely to regulate the market than liberals or progressives are , that s a plausible case . Indeed , they have tried and succeeded in some cases ? in some cases Bill Clinton signed the bills in deregulating the financial market and transportation , which Ted Kennedy was involved in . There is a sense in which there is a truth here that they re espousing , but where their claim on truth breaks down is when it comes to the core functions of government . The tend to define this problem as ? I talk about this problem in relation to Mitt Romney s announcement speech ? if government reaches a certain percentage of GDP , if it goes over that then suddenly we ve lost our freedom , and that s pretty much what Mitt Romney said in that speech . And that s just not true that s never been true .
