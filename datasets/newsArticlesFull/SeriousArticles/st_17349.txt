As an investor , Jackson is also a newcomer to the media sector . For instance , as he tells it , he got the idea to poke around Viacom after he started poking around Disney , which he was prompted to do because Disney s ESPN subsidiary in May 2015 declined to renew the contract of its star columnist and podcaster Bill Simmons . It raised some questions in my mind about what might be going on at Disney , Jackson said . And so I wrote a post in July saying Short ESPN . That s a little like becoming a rock critic because you dug 10 , 000 Maniacs cover of Because the Night .
