India is home to lakhs of Nepalis and shares a unique bond with Nepal s Army . It also shares 1 , 750 km and three of four boundaries with the land locked nation . In particular , Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen , just a year back , as the most charismatic man in Nepal he visited the country twice in 2014 . If with all of this capital , India today stands in danger of being shut out by its Himalayan neighbour , regardless of whether it is all of Nepal or just the government in Kathmandu that desires it , it is necessary to ask one basic question : why ? Why has its diplomacy and power failed so miserably ?
