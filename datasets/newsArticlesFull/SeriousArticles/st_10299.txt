President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing , like education , is a function of state and local government . And it ' s true that his options are limited . And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities . How ? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards . In contrast , while the Department of Justice provides more than 1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country , those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training , data collection or other measures with an explicit anti racial bias focus . That must change .
