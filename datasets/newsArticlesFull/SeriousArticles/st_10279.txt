Given his physical limitations , the array of pass rushers he is going to face this week and the lack of mobility , I ' m not sure Manning gets through this game , one way or the other . Having a moving pocket , having to fear a quarterback able to run with the ball some and having a more live arm might prove to be far more important against the Patriots than it was against the Steelers . Manning ' s singular focus , mental acumen and checking into the perfect play might not be nearly enough this coming week , especially if Brady moves the ball through the air in the cunning and meticulous manner I suspect he will against a tough Denver defense .
