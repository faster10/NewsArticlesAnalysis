Totally fascinating . And very insightful . It ' s not just that people are sick of politicians . ( We knew that . ) It ' s that Republican voters feel like they were sold a bill of goods . They were told that if they voted Republicans into majorities in the House and the Senate , things would change . Then they didn ' t or , at least , not as much as they had hoped . There ' s a sense of betrayal that undergirds the anger . That makes for a toxic brew that wants everyone at every level in both parties out .
