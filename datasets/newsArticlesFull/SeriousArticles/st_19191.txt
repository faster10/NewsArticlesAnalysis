Theranos is a white hot biomedical startup that has become the tech success story darling of the decade , founded by a bright Stanford drop out named Elizabeth Holmes . Theranos , which began in her dorm room , was designed to simplify and disrupt the very lucrative field of blood testing . Instead of having to fill several vials with blood extracted by needles in a doctor ' s office , Theranos would only need a finger prick at a local Walgreens . From that , their unique ( and proprietary ) technology called Edison would use a minute sample of blood to generate up to 240 tests . On its face , Theranos would revolutionize medicine in a fashion unseen in generations . Best of all , they would get the tests back faster and maintain a high degree of accuracy .
