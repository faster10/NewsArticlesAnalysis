2 . There have been 11 special teams returns for touchdowns in the NFL this season and three have come against the Bears . Opposing return men have to be licking their chops when they throw on tape of the Bears and see massive lanes with no defenders to even juke . Marcus Sherels became the latest to burn the Bears in the first quarter when he returned a punt 65 yards to the end zone . The Vikings effectively walled off the West side of the field for Sherels . Pick your player on the coverage unit . He probably screwed up . The gunner on that side of the field , Josh Bellamy , got blocked out of the way . Chris Prosinski , signed off the street to help shore up special teams after two kickoff returns were run back against the Bears for scores earlier in the season , took a poor angle that led him around Bellamy . Running back Jeremy Langford was walled off . Same goes for linebacker LaRoy Reynolds , another veteran added to help special teams after the early season miscues .
