Another candidate is Adnan Shukrijumah , 36 , an American citizen born in Saudi Arabia who spent much of his youth in New York and South Florida , who joined al Qaeda around the time of 9 11 and rose up the ranks to become a planner for the group ' s external operations . But the envoy appears to have fairer skin than Shukrijumah . And then there is Jude Kenan Mohammed , 22 , from Raleigh , North Carolina . He is believed to be still at large in Pakistan after leaving the United States in October 2008 to allegedly wage jihad . Just after he arrived , he was arrested by Pakistani officials , charged with weapons possession and released on bail . The following year , he failed to show up to his court hearing , suggesting he may have slipped into tribal areas .
