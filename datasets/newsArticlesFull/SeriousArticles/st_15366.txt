Bell : We don ' t shoot until October . It premieres in January . We left season two on a real cliffhanger between Don ( Cheadle ) and my character . I know that they ' re currently breaking story lines and everyone ' s pitching ideas I don ' t really have much contribution other than being excited about it . The characters are definitely going to start off with a lot of tension because there were confessions of love at the end of the last episode , which just makes for a really interesting first episode of season three .
