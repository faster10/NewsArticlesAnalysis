The sources of misunderstanding and pain for Americans and Muslims are actually not so different : They arise out of fear and trauma . So , too , the sources for healing are shared , and can be found in dialogue , compassion , and community . I see my purpose as guiding members of these groups to realizing these commonalities , and from this basis developing relationships that mitigate and prevent violent manifestations of conflict . Through my hybrid identity as a Muslim American , I strive to provide one of many examples of how it is indeed possible to move past fear of the other and toward mutually beneficial relationships .
