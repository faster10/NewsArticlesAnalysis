In isolation , almost everything here would be a solid example of the songwriter for hire s art : if nothing bowls you over with its originality , it s hard not to be impressed by the pitilessness with which the songs sink their hooks into you . But taken collectively , you notice the big flaw in Furler s approach . It s meant as no disrespect to people who grittily triumph over the odds to say that there s only so many songs you can hear about people grittily triumphing over the odds ? the moody , low key , dejected verse supplanted by a strident chorus in which they reveal themselves to be invincible , unbreakable , a bird set free , ready to face the test , prepared to take a million bullets ? before you become gripped by the urge to listen to Pick Yer Nose ( And Eat It ) by Peter and the Test Tube Babies , on the grounds that even someone singing Go on and pick it , it ain t rude Then eat the bogies , they re good food is preferable to another bellowed message of stoic empowerment .
