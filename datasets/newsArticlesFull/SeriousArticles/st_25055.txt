The political headline of the morning is that Donald Trump is now leading the Republican presidential field by 20 points , according to a new ? CNN poll . Trump stands at 36 in the poll ( up 9 points since October ) , while Ted Cruz is at 16 ( up 12 ) , Ben Carson at 14 ( down 8 ) , Marco Rubio at 12 ( up 4 ) , Chris Christie at 4 ( unchanged ) , and at Jeb Bush 3 ( down 5 ) . It s Trump s biggest lead in any live telephone national poll . And here s the thing : He s likely to only get stronger , given that this poll was taken BEFORE the San Bernadino shootings . Why do we say that ? According to the poll , more Republicans ( 46 ) think he can handle ISIS better than his closest competition ( Cruz at 15 ) more Republicans ( 48 ) think he s better on illegal immigration than his closest competitor ( Rubio at 14 ) and more Republicans ( 30 ) see him better on foreign policy than anyone else ( Cruz at 17 ) . Now we have two important caveats : One , CNN s GOP screen here consists of registered Republican voters and GOP leaning independents . Trump s numbers have always been higher among GOP leaning indies than core Republicans . Are these independents going to turn out in Republican caucuses and primaries ? Are these independents going to turn out in Republican caucuses and primaries ? Two , we recall when our national Dec . 2011 NBC WSJ poll had Newt Gingrich up 17 points over Mitt Romney . Then again , Newt Gingrich isn t Donald Trump
