Down three points with 2 : 27 left in regulation , the Warriors looked out of character . Stephen Curry had gotten his shot blocked twice within a minute and had stepped out of bounds in between . Draymond Green had missed a long jumper within the sequence . It seemed as though this was the streak s end that the undefeated Warriors would run out of gas and good decisions against an energized , well coached opponent . Who could blame them , really ? Klay Thompson and Harrison Barnes were both out with sprained ankles , and the Warriors faced a back to back against the Bucks the next night . This was a logical time for a letdown .
