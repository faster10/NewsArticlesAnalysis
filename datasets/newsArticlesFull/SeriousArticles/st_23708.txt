In May 2013 , a North Korean court sentenced Kenneth Bae , a U . S . citizen , to 15 years of hard labor for committing " hostile acts " against the state . North Korea claimed Bae was part of a Christian plot to overthrow the regime . In a short interview with CNN in September 2014 , Bae said he is working eight hours a day , six days a week at a labor camp . " Right now what I can say to my friends and family is , continue to pray for me , " he said . After months in detention , he and fellow American detainee Matthew Todd Miller were released in November .
