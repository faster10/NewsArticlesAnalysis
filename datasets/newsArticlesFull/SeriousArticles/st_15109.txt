With action on Uganda ' s anti homosexuality bill looming , the lives of the nation ' s LGBTI are threatened . These are not nameless faces , but real people like my girlfriend , who trembles at the prospect of coming out . People like one trans woman who in September was brutally beaten in public by friends who discovered her identity , and another who was dragged to the police in full glare of the public . Even heterosexual Ugandans including family and friends who fail to disclose LGBTI loved ones to authorities would face criminal charges if this bill were to pass .
