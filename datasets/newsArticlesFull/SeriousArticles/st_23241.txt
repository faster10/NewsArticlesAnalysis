I have no doubt that this piece is causing many women across the country to think about their own health and chances of developing the disease .

A person of Jolie ' s stature publicly discussing such a personal and difficult decision will likely weigh on the minds of many women who have similar concerns . Breast cancer is a real disease , it ' s not rare , and it can potentially strike almost anyone . I have no doubt that her op ed in The New York Times will help many women who would not have considered this procedure to do so now .
