In other ways , this was vintage Serena . She did what she does best , hanging in the match , overcoming some loose patches and elevating her game when the situation demanded it . At 5 5 in the second set , Giorgi blinked , and Serena served out the match . We ve seen this movie hundreds ? literally , hundreds ? of times before . ( If we ever develop metric to quantify a player s ability to summon their best stuff when it matters most , Serena s GOAT credentials will be burnished still further . ) If she projected relief , not elation , after the match , so be it . She was through to round two . Everything else was details .
