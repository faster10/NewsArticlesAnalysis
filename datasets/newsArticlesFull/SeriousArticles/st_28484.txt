Lincoln said in one of his debates with Stephen Douglas , " It ' s not that I ' m about to marry a black woman , it ' s not that I think blacks should serve on juries . " . . . He then comes back and says , " But this black woman , in terms of her right to eat the bread she earns from her own hands is every bit my equal and the equal of every person here because if you ' re referring to the Declaration of Independence , all men are created equal . " Even the most radical abolitionist would probably not have granted social equality between blacks and whites .
