Enter Tony Mendez ( Affleck ) , an " exfiltration " specialist ( who knew ? ) who doesn ' t think much of the State Department ' s plan to send in bikes and road maps . Challenged to come up with something better , he concocts an improbable scheme about a phony movie : posing as a Hollywood producer , he ' ll connect with the six under the guise of scouting locations . It ' s far fetched , but that ' s the beauty of it . Who would make up something like that ? Anyway it ' s the best bad idea they ' ve got .
