Obviously , this did not happen by accident . And the world economy is not exactly doing well . This success , is the result of a series of well thought out policies . Many of the purely macro economic reforms we have undertaken , are probably well known to this audience . We have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation . We have entered for the first time into a monetary framework agreement , with the Reserve Bank to curb inflation . Even while cutting the fiscal deficit we have substantially increased productive public investment . This has been made possible in two ways . Firstly , we have imposed , carbon taxes on fossil fuels . We took the bold step of de controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies . We have replaced them with taxes . The coal cess has been increased by four times from Rs 50 per ton to Rs 200 per ton . Globally , there is much talk of carbon taxes but much of it is just that TALK . We have actually acted . Secondly , we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods like the use of technology . Some of the methods , are part of your agenda , such as using Aadhaar to target subsidies to the deserving . These are reforms that you are probably aware of . But our reforms are far broader , and far deeper , than is generally recognised .
