Mullen : I didn ' t want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations I wanted it to be set in the here and now . I liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but I think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now , all the tensions in our society , the issues of race and ethnicity . To him he ' s coming from many , many generations later . I was influenced by this Time magazine cover story , the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces , many generations later after all the races have mixed , this is what people will look like .
