As expected , Mad Max : Fury Road took the apocalyptic action picture genre out of the B movie doghouse by landing 10 nominations , including Best Director for George Miller , who spent 15 years developing the project . The Martian , about an astronaut stranded on Mars , took seven nominations , including Best Actor for Matt Damon . But the lack of recognition for director Ridley Scott , who has never won an Oscar and was not nominated , implies the film will have to settle for technical awards .
