Why they ll lose : The Cardinals gave up a little more pressure than usual against the Packers last week , and that ' s a concern against a Carolina team that did a good job getting to Russell Wilson in the first half last week . After playing very well for 15 games , the Cardinals were drubbed in the regular season finale by Seattle and struggled to put away the Packers in the wild card round despite being big favorites . Palmer suffered a dislocated finger late in the season , and maybe that ' s affecting him a bit . If Palmer is not the MVP candidate he was all season due to his finger , the Panthers pass rush or whatever reason , it ' ll be hard to beat a Panthers team that has won 16 of its 17 games .
