They are called " older rookies " or " late bloomers , " these young men who today arrive well into their twenties or beyond , who grow into their bodies or their lives after most . We applaud a spirit that kept them plodding ahead through the bus rides and the 50 50 raffles and host families ' pullout sofas , and then who see something better through all that haze . That right there is determination , we say . That ' s why this game is great , because it ' ll wait ' til you ' re ready , within reason , long as you can hit or throw . Long as you believed . And it ' s true . Today , it ' s mostly true .
