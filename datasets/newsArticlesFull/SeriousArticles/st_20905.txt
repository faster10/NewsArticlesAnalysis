So my issue with Femen , and any other such organizations , is less to do with the mode of protest , and more the gaze and rhetoric behind it . Femen purports to know , in an almost patriarchal way , what is " best " for these poor , oppressed women in Africa and the Middle East . Their problem is religion , and their naked protest is there to " help " free them from the " tyranny " therein . Yes there are huge chasms between the rights of men and women all over the world , and perhaps more visibly in these communities . But there are also women ( and men ) in those communities working to remedy this , using different tools , ( some more blunt than others ) and in all likelihood just as effective or even I would argue , more so , than Femen ' s methods .
