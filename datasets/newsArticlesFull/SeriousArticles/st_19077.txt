I am honored to serve as the 17th head coach in the history of the New York Giants franchise , McAdoo said in a news release . I am thankful to the Mara family , the Tisch family and Jerry Reese for this opportunity . I am appreciative of the support of my family , my wife Toni and our two children ( Larkin and BJ ) and my parents , brother and sister and in laws back in Homer City , Pa . I have been very fortunate to have a lot of great coaches , administrators and players take an interest in me and my career . It has been a privilege to work and learn under Coach Coughlin .
