President Franklin Roosevelt helped to fire up the dream during his second term in office . Coming off a massive landslide in 1936 , he believed that it would be far better for governing if the Democrats became the liberal party and Republicans the conservative one . In the 1938 congressional elections , he barnstormed across the South trying to purge the Democratic Party of several incumbent conservatives . His efforts backfired the incumbents won and were sore at FDR but the dream became a staple of politics .
