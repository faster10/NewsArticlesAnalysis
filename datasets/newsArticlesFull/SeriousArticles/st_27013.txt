Donald Trump stopped being funny quite some time ago , but for a while , he was comical . Sure , his words have been obnoxious and derogatory from the very beginning , but his campaign seemed to be little more than an absurdity of our time : a buffoonish reality star making a go at the White House and saying whatever unfiltered nonsense came to his mind . He was the antithesis of the arid establishment politicians ? the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios of the world ? and he was so filthy rich that he didn t have to worry about pleasing the donor class . For a brief period , ? he even promoted some policies , such as taxing the rich and ? defending Social Security and Medicare ( while also ? condemning corporatist trade deals ) that made him seem , in certain not insubstantial regards , like the least terrifying GOP candidate , as I ? wrote ? back in ? early ? September .
