The GOP presidential campaign has now shifted away from the heartland evangelical wonderland of Iowa to live free or die state , New Hampshire , where the elbows are notoriously sharp and a whole bunch of Republican establishment candidates are hunkering down to stage their last stand . It remains unlikely that any of them will be able to dislodge Trump in the number one slot ? it s much more his kind of electorate than the pious social conservatives of Iowa . There are lots of angry white right wingers and independents there who aren t as concerned about their religion as they are about their guns and the threat of Mexicans and Muslims pouring over the border to make them eat ? mole ? and follow Sharia law .
