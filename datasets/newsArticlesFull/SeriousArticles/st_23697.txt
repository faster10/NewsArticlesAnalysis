" I grab the car door and I ' m trying to open it , but I can ' t get it open , " he says . " Knight keeps coming up on my back , so I ' m pointing my gun at him . I ' m pointing it at the car . I ' m yelling , ' You guys lay down ! And you , get the f k away from me ! ' And every time I ' d point the gun at him , he ' d back off and even lift his hands up , like ' All right ! All right ! ' So I ' d go back to the car , and here he comes again . I ' m like , ' F ker , back off ! ' This guy is huge , and the whole time he ' s running around at the scene , he ' s gushing blood from his head . Gushing blood ! I mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head , but he had all his faculties . I couldn ' t believe he was running around and doing what he was doing , yelling back and forth . "
