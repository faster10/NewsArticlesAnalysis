It ' s also important to keep in mind that in the early stages of the voting ? including contests at which a large portion of the delegates are selected ? a politician can be disliked by most of the party ' s voters and nevertheless keep winning . In 2012 , Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucus with 25 percent of the vote , meaning that three of every four Republicans chose someone else . A week later , Mitt Romney won New Hampshire with an emphatic 39 percent , easily outdistancing his rivals ? but that meant six out of 10 voters rejected him . Then Newt Gingrich won South Carolina with 40 percent and Romney won Florida with 46 percent . Finally , in the Nevada caucus , Romney cracked 50 percent . He sealed the nomination on Super Tuesday , winning six of the ten states voting that day , and passing 50 percent in three of them .
