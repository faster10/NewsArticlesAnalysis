Marco Rubio If the 2016 race stays on this trajectory , it s very easy to imagine Rubio ending up in at least the final paring and perhaps even as the nominee . And he did nothing to diminish that . Rubio took a tough line with Sen . Rand Paul on foreign policy when needed and managed a great soundbite on the necessity of welders versus philosophers . But most significant was that even as his nemesis Jeb Bush and antagonist Donald Trump wanted and maybe even needed to take Rubio on , they gave him latitude . Their deference is telling . Rubio s rapid fire eloquence and debate chops give him clout on stage that will help in the future and help make him sound like the authoritative spokesman for his party . Donors and voters wondering when to make the leap got a good reason on Tuesday .
