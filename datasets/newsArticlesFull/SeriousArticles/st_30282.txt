I row across oceans to inspire people to take action on environmental issues . Something the ocean has taught me is that any challenge , no matter how huge , can be tackled if you break it down into little steps . Crossing the Pacific has taken me about 2 . 5 million oar strokes . One stroke doesn ' t get me very far , but you take all those tiny actions and you string them all together and you get across 8 , 000 miles of ocean . You can achieve almost anything , if you just take it one stroke at a time .
