My question to those 100 pastors is this : If you feel that the Obama administration has not been able to address the issues of the African American community , what have you done in helping out the communities that your parishioners come from and represent at your church ? What have you done to rally the community in teaching and empowering them to understand why it ' s important to vote on the local , city and state levels ( which is far more important than the presidential election for their policies impact their neighborhoods directly ) ? What have you done to promote African Americans to become homeowners , entrepreneurs or increase pressure on businesses to employ African Americans ? What have you done to encourage your congregation in creating policies to present to elected officials and to make sure that they provide funds to help our communities thrive ?
