At the risk of damning Cavill with faint praise , the 30 year old Brit makes a better Man of Steel than the milquetoast Brandon Routh did in 2006 ' s Superman Returns . But he isn ' t exactly Mr Charisma either . And I suspect that Superman aficionados will be disappointed by just how joyless most of Snyder ' s reboot is . During a prologue that goes on way too long setting the bloated tone for the film , Superman ' s father Jor El ( Russell Crowe ) squares off against General Zod ( Michael Shannon ) on Krypton . The planet is on the verge of destruction , and Jor El ships his newborn son off to Earth to save him , prompting the maniacal Zod to roar about his plans for revenge . With its shock and awe barrage of sci fi fire and brimstone , the opening act salvo should dazzle and transport us . Instead , it just gets weighed down by CGI overkill and thickets of exposition about a Kryptonian codex .
