The Republicans seem to have talked themselves into believing their own hype that the country is in dire straits , the terrorists are coming in droves to kill us and everyone in the nation is angry and frightened to death about well , everything . There s a certain political utility in making this case in a presidential primary but at some point reality is going to intrude . No , everything isn t perfect . America is still emerging from a very difficult economic crisis and there is a terrorist threat abroad . People are frustrated by student debt and police violence and any number of other problems . But the Mad Max version of the United States these Republicans are talking about doesn t really ring true for more than a limited faction who ? think the world they knew is disappearing and they will not be able to adjust to the new one .
