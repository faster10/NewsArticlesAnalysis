Sanders did vote for the " Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) in 2001 to grant the President the authority to use all " necessary and appropriate force " against those whom he determined " planned , authorized , committed or aided " the September 11th attacks , or who harbored said persons or groups . " That resolution is still in force and what President Obama uses as authority to send troops to the area today .
