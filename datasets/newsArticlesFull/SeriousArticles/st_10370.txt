Bush acknowledged that the anti Trump attacks that have become the staple of his campaign events may not be the perfect message for his own candidacy , but said they are more important than his presidential aspirations . My case against Trump is the case to protect the conservative cause because I ve lived it , I love it , and I believe in it , and I ve spent my adult life advocating for it in all sorts of ways , he said . And so , this goes beyond my campaign . I don t know if it s good for me or bad for me .
