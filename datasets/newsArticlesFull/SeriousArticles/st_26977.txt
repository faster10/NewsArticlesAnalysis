But it ' s also probably the " right " move to go with Manning . ( Or at least the one with the least amount of risk from Kubiak ' s perspective . The potential blowback of benching Peyton for Osweiler and losing is undoubtedly worse than the other way around . ) Peyton hasn ' t been healthy all year and there ' s no way of telling whether or not we ' ll ever see the " real " Peyton Manning again , but the upside that he does find that stride is higher than what you can get with Osweiler , at least for now .
