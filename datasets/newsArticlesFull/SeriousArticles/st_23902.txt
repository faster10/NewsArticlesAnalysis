The Force Awakens will also make its last international opening on Saturday , debuting in China , the second largest movie market in the world . Part of the reason The Force Awakens success has been so impressive is because it s hit some pretty huge global milestones without a Chinese release . The Force Awakens may have only narrowly squeaked by Jurassic World s 524 . 9 million global opening weekend record with 529 million , but nearly 100 million of Jurassic World s opening total came from China alone .
