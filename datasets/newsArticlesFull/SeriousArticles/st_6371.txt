Bloomberg would do the same thing to a race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump : ? Chip off just enough votes from Clinton that , if the race is tight at all , it could throw it to Trump . ? Yes , at first glance , it seems like Bloomberg , who is business friendly style conservative , ? would be taking votes off the Republican nominee . But the blunt fact of the matter is that Bloomberg is mostly known to Republican voters as an anti gun , pro bike politician who passed a law making it a little harder to guzzle gallons of sugary soda in one sitting . He doesn t read as Republican or conservative to them , and so won t get too many people who would otherwise vote for Trump to switch off .
