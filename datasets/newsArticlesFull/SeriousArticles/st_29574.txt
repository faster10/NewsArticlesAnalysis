Despite rumours of scrapped albums and suggestions this final version is not the one she s been working on for what s seems like decades , James Joint ? a frustratingly short interlude ? first appeared back in April last year . Opening like a lost Stevie Wonder song from the 1970s , it marries a filtered organ part and some vintage atmospherics with a tale of getting high and getting off ( at one point she describes how her and that special someone were too busy kissing to notice the police ) .
