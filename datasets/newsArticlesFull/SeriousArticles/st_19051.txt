Sanders is too smart not to understand this , but he is not brave enough to face squarely the inescapable connection between foreign and domestic policies . At Consortium News , David Swanson just reviewed a book called The Bern Identity , by Will Bunch , and makes a persuasive case that Sanders is essentially unserious about a constructively alternative foreign policy posture . He stays safely clear of any suggestion he supports the Palestinian cause ? strike three right there in my book ? and is happy enough to back weapons contractors for the sake of a few jobs in Vermont .
