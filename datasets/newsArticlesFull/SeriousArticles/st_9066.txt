Frederick Douglass once said , " Power concedes nothing without a demand . " Douglass knew of what he spoke . Because black people and poor whites weren ' t even allowed to vote in the early days of our Union , slavery could only be ended through protest . Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries , black and white Americans launched protests and outright revolts against the system of slavery . Many of those protests were peaceful . Sadly , some were not . But looking back , we don ' t condemn Harriet Tubman , Nat Turner and John Brown for their " riots " just as most Americans don ' t condemn the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr . and Ella Baker , even though at the time , all these great heroes were attacked and tarnished for their protests .
