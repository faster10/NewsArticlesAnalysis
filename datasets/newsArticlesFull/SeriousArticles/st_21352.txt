With ten minutes ' til the top of the hour , a helicopter appears overhead . At exactly 10am , and with surprising speed , Maggie ' s hearse , flanked by half a dozen police on bikes , exits the chapel at Westminster . She ' s punctual and impatient in death as in life , I think . Big Ben stays silent but the Abbey bells peal incongruously . People tutt loudly at this . There are more police than mourners their backs facing the coffin , not in protest but so they can keep their eyes on us . There are no jeers , or tears . That ' s that . Done .
