So it ' s a relief to find that on her blissed out sixth album , " Talk That Talk , " she ' s stopped trying to play it so tough . ' ' I ' ll let you in on a dirty secret , ' ' she purrs on ' ' Roc Me Out , ' ' ' ' I just want to be loved . ' ' And apparently , love ' s never come so easily to RiRi , whose new song titles include ' ' We Found Love , ' ' ' ' We All Want Love , ' ' and ( yes ) ' ' Drunk on Love . ' ' Is she finally admitting that being young and crushed out on someone might feel , y ' know , kind of fun ?
