Once again , Kate Winslet has picked up metal , this time a best supporting actress prize , playing the long suffering Apple executive Joanna Hoffman in the intriguingly theatrical study of the Apple founder Steve Jobs , directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin , who picked up best screenplay . It was an extremely engaging performance from Winslet , self aware , amusingly fluttery with mannerisms , in tune with the bravura jazz of Sorkin s writing . Winslet is in a fascinating stage of her career : she can still carry off a romantic lead , but is more than capable of a withdrawing to a supporting character role , which she can turn into a scene stealer .
