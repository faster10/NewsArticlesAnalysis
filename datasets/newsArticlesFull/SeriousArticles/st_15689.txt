SAMA ' s net foreign assets totaled 628 billion in November , down from a record high of 737 billion in August 2014 , when the government started drawing down assets to pay its bills as falling oil prices saddled it with a huge budget deficit . The assets , some of which are handled by global fund firms , are mainly securities such as US Treasury bonds and deposits with banks abroad . Equities are believed to account for only a small fraction of securities holdings , perhaps 20 percent . The bulk of assets are believed to be denominated in US dollars .
