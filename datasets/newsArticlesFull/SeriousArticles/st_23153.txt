In a written statement , Cashman said , " As early as Friday , July 12 , when I suggested to Alex that we move his rehab from Tampa to Triple A Scranton ( at Buffalo ) , Alex complained for the first time of ' tightness ' in his quad and therefore refused to consent to the transfer of his assignment . Again , last Sunday , Alex advised that he had stiffness in his quad and should not play on Sunday or Monday . We sent Alex to New York Presbyterian Hospital for an MRI which evidenced a grade 1 strain . "
