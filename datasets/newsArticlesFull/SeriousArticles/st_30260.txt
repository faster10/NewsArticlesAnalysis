Hoyer ' s targets in his Week 17 return from a concussion : DeAndre Hopkins 12 Jaelen Strong 7 Grimes 5 Hunt , Ryan Griffin , Keith Mumphery , Nate Washington , and C . J . Fiedorowicz 3 Polk and Blue 1 . . . . Hopkins will run most of his routes at Chiefs RCB Sean Smith and rookie LCB Marcus Peters , who finished 19th and 47th , respectively , in Pro Football Focus ' coverage grades among 118 qualified cornerbacks . Although Smith and Peters form a strong tandem , neither is individually shutdown caliber . With Washington nursing a hip injury and Cecil Shorts battling back from a multi week hamstring strain , only Antonio Brown has a higher target projection than Hopkins among Wild Card receivers . . . . Shorts hasn ' t caught a ball in nearly a month and has topped three catches in a game once since Week 6 . Only in play if Washington sits , Shorts would be a WR3 flex punt with limited upside against steady Chiefs slot corner Ron Parker . . . . Should Washington miss this game , late blooming rookie Strong is the preferred Texans complementary receiver . Strong closed out 2015 with snap rates of 71 and 80 accompanied by target totals of 5 and 7 . The fact that Strong ranked second on the Texans in targets ( 7 ) and receptions ( 6 ) in Hoyer ' s first game back after his concussion bodes well for their rapport . Strong recently earned coach Bill O ' Brien ' s praise for improved conditioning and knowledge of the playbook . Don ' t be surprised if Strong is a significant part of the offense . . . . If Washington does play , fading Houston ' s complementary pass catchers is probably the best approach .
