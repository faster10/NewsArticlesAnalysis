The center of power in the eurozone has clearly moved to Germany , but France has always been the pivotal country in the European project , from the Treaty of Rome in 1957 , to the Maastricht treaty in 1992 , and the launch of the euro in 1998 . So it may well be France , not Germany , which holds the key to the future of the euro . If France stays the course and commits to sufficient fiscal rigor and pro competitive policies , then the euro has a good chance of survival , in whatever bruised form .
