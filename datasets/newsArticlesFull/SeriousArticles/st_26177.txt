Sure , Gaga is known for her elaborate , over the top performances ( and costumes , and props and makeup and choreography ) , but her Oscar nominated song ? from the documentary The Hunting Ground , about the alleged incidents of sexual assault on college campuses ? is a deeply personal one for Gaga .

That being said , she ' s still Gaga , so we a symbolic , elaborate performance outfit will blend the drama she ' s known for with the gravitas fitting of such a powerful song .
