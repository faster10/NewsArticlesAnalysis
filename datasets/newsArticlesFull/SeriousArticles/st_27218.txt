Translated to internet humor : Compared to Sanders , Clinton isn t as evolved in her tastes and approaches . And so graphics popped up which imagined what the candidates might say about Olive Garden ( Sanders : Only when I m high . Clinton : An authentic Italian restaurant for the whole family ) or lizards ( Sanders : covered in lizards Hell yeah ! I love these little guys ! ' Clinton : No ) . The meme s absurdity wasn t quite as successful ( or humorous ) once it ventured into pop culture territory , however : Clinton was portrayed as being oblivious to the nuances of Star Wars , anime and Harry Potter , as well as a ? philistine ? when it comes to jazz ( It s not Christmas until I put on Kenny G s Christmas album ) , Iggy Azalea , industrial music ( Marilyn Manson , Rob Zombie , the list could go on ) , Radiohead ( I love Creep ' ) and the Grateful Dead ( I like Touch of Grey ' ) .
