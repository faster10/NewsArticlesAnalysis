I had not been in Tehran for the past 38 years , but had been a frequent visitor of the country when I was in charge of the Middle East for my bank , Societe Generale de Banque , in Belgium . As the lifting of the Western sanctions against Iran was approaching , I undertook the journey back to Tehran this weekend . I wanted to evaluate what could be done in the field of finance to facilitate the reintegration of Iran in the global world of finance . I had published a post here , in September 2015 , advocating the reintegration of Iran in the world community .
