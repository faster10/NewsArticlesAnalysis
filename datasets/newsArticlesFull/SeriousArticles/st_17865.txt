In contrast , Hollande has been seen as a lightweight , a consensus candidate who won the socialist nomination after the favourite , Dominique Strauss Kahn , fell victim to carnal excess .

A steely eyed and resolute Hollande has emerged as a statesman who understands brute power ( as in the case of Mali or Syria , where France has deployed troops or is conducting intense bombing raids ) but one who is also a fine tactician , decimating his right wing enemies by occupying the space both right and left of centre through market friendly reforms . With less than 18 months to go before the presidential polls , Hollande is working towards his re election .
