As I remember it , we responded to questions from the moderator and from the floor with general agreement on most matters : No texting at family dinner . No texting at restaurants . Don ' t bring your laptop to your children ' s sporting events , no matter how tempting . ( Your daughter looks up from her star turn at lacrosse , and you are deep into an e mail to your supervisor . The game was boring until then , sure . But e mail can get so engrossing that you ' ve got to be careful you ' re playing with fire ! )
