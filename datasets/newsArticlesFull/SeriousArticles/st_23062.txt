Even staffers and donors I talked to at the time didn t buy it : the email server issue , they knew , had occupied much of Clinton s time for months ? and despite her self styled high tech ignorance , she is a famously fast study who tends to demand granular detail from staff . The storm of the emails has abated , at least for now , but her tendency to make light of questions about her integrity ? and provide only as much fact as she wants to ? is a problem that will almost certainly bedevil her campaign again .
