I told the guys that it was really inspirational watching them , Romo said . Even though we didn t win over the last seven weeks and I know that s ultimately what we are all defined by : how you perform and play on Sundays is really a direct reflection of who you are . I told them that the wins and losses are what people talk about , but the way that they played was inspiring . I know that the media couldn t write every time that you look for someone laying down or not playing hard . I doubt that you can ever find that . Our football team never let up . The tough part is when that doesn t produce results , because then it gets tougher each time .
