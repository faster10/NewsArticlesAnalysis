Kerr and Mullin , who both spent time playing and traveling with Michael Jordan , said the nation ' s infatuation with Curry is getting to that place where comparisons are warranted . " I was around Michael during the summer of ' 92 , " Mullin said . " So yeah , I think it ' s at that level . " " Michael would just draw crowds everywhere he went , " Kerr said . " When we ' d get to a hotel in the middle of the night , there ' d always be 50 100 people waiting out there at 2 a . m . , hoping for an autograph . People come before games to see these guys warm up it happened with Michael , and it happens now with Steph . There ' s sort of a fascination with Steph that reminds me a lot of people ' s infatuation with Michael . "
