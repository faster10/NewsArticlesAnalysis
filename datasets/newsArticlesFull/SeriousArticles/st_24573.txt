The possible financial ramifications of the Occupy Central movement could cause Beijing to seek a quick conclusion to the demonstrations . After all , with traffic bottlenecked by protesters , business as usual in one of Asia ' s financial hubs and China ' s financial center is in question . A number of banks reportedly temporarily closed some of their branches and asked employees to work from home . Investors , too , are waiting to see the outcome of the protests in Hong Kong before continuing projects . Should the demonstrations linger , Beijing might therefore need to reassess its tactics though this could result in an even more aggressive crackdown .
