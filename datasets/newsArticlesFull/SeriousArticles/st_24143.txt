Washington doesn ' t need to wait for an answer to that question before it starts responding to this uncertain situation . In fact , it can already start helping to shape the future of the Arab world by strongly promoting the ideals it supports . The Egyptian people have not studied democracy the way Americans or Europeans have . President Obama and his counterparts in other liberal democracies should help explain the West ' s vision of democratic principles and tolerance . They should talk about how democracy does not just mean majority rule it also means protection of minorities , equality for women and for people of all religions . It means rule of law and an independent judiciary . The West should make clear that those leaders who help preserve peace and build that vision of society in the emerging Arab democracies will have its support while those who don ' t will not have its backing .
