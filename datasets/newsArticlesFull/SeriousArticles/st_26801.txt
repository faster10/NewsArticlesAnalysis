' I trust in the players and the squad deserves more credit . We are more than just Kun ( Aguero ) . This team is more than just one player . We have a lot of different critics . We are not trying to send messages to people . I think Roma are a good team and played well but against them in Manchester it was the worst we played and we still drew . Here I knew if we played as we have in the Premier League then we had a good chance to qualify . This team deserves a little more credit than it gets . '
