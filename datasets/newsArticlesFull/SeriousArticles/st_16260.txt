I haven t listened a lot to Bernie Sanders , and to me ? I don t think I d vote for him , said Jacqueline Owens , a 60 year old librarian from Irmo , South Carolina , ? on Monday at the statehouse , where the three candidates spoke at the King Day at the Dome event celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr . after debating on TV the previous night . He doesn t appeal to me . I don t think he d be that strong a supporter of black votes and black issues . I d have to do more research on him , though .
