Here ' s how this applies to Cosby ' s situation . If in 2005 Castor did no more than unilaterally announce that he had decided not to prosecute Cosby , it ' s highly unlikely that that would be binding , either on him personally or on the prosecutor ' s office . A nonprosecution decision is typically non binding , and the same prosecutor or a different prosecutor can reverse course and bring charges anytime within the statute of limitations . ( A version of this happened in the George Zimmerman Trayvon Martin case . )
