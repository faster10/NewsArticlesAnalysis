Four of the five songs featured in the Record of the Year category were expected , as they ' re major hits out of T . Swift , Ed Sheeran , Bruno Mars and The Weeknd . But the fifth song , " Really Love " by D ' Angelo and the Vanguard , was a bit out of left field . Another artist who caught us off guard was ? Courtney Barnett in the Best New Artist category . While her album , ? Sometimes I Sit and Think , received amazing reviews from critics , do people ? really know her just yet ? She certainly isn ' t a household name , but the 2016 Grammys seem to be honoring truly quality music over pop stars .
