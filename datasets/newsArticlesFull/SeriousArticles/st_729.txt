Look , if you are going to credibly defend freedom of expression , it requires that you be consistent . You can ' t just defend the words or images you agree with . That ' s not how freedom of expression works . And deep down , I know that King and the pundits on the right know this . But too often they are playing to their political base or the consumers of their media outlets at the expense of intellectual honesty . ( And to be candid , some on the left are just as guilty , though typically not in the area of freedom of expression . )
