The big implication in this category is Oscar ' s best picture . Since the Motion Picture Academy expanded beyond five nominations in 2009 , the SAG Awards ensemble prize has been highly predictive of Oscar ' s top prize . It ' s matched at least four out of five every year but one , and even in that one year , it landed three out of five . ( The reason is simple : The acting branch is the academy ' s largest . ) Yet none of the long shot quartet were thought solid favorites to land a nom . The idea that two or three of them will end up on the list ? It ' s wacky , and should send shudders down the spine of all bubble picture contenders that didn ' t end up with an ensemble slot .
