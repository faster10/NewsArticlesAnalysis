I wouldn t defend any of the remarks above , but the story does demonstrate how fast a ? thinly thought through remark can become a pocket scandal in the social media era . It took minutes before somebody thought to post a picture of Rampling dressed in Nazi regalia from The Night Porter . She has got to the age where she probably doesn t care too much what people think of her , but Rampling still felt the need to issue a semi retraction . ? I regret that my comments could have been misinterpreted , she said . I simply meant to say that in an ideal world every performance will be given equal opportunities for consideration . Diversity in our industry is an important issue that needs to be addressed . I am highly encouraged by the changes announced today by the academy to diversify its membership .
