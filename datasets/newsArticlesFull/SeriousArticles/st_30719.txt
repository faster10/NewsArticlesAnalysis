What were they thinking ? : Markus Wheaton should not be returning punts anymore . He muffed two of them in replace of the injured Antonio Brown , but he got bailed out both times . In the third quarter , Wheaton tried to field a punt after the bounce . A Denver gunner knocked the ball loose inside the Broncos 10 yard line . The ball went out of bounds . Early in the fourth , the punt bounced off Wheaton s hands and rolled into the end zone , with teammate Ross Cockrell recovering . The Steelers actually gained 20 plus yards because of the touchback .
