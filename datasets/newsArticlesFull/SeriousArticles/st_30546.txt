A : Sexual misconduct is a common reason why law enforcement officers lose their licenses to work , in a process known as decertification . Of some 9 , 000 decertification cases assembled from 41 states , the AP found about 1 , 000 officers who lost their licenses for sex related conduct from 2009 through 2014 . Most certainly there are even more than that , because some states did not provide records and others , including New York and California , said they did not decertify officers for misconduct and kept no official tally of officer wrongdoing .
