Not only does Vote Leave ( the group which has fancied itself as the front runner to lead the Out campaign ) seem to be falling apart in bitter internal strife , but its leading figures seem so confused as to what they are campaigning for that some even cling to the hope that , if Cameron pulls off a satisfactory deal , they could somehow argue for us to remain in the EU as an associate member . This , though , would firmly rule them out of being designated for the lead role , since the law is clear that any group so designated must be committed unequivocally to the proposition voters are being asked to support .
