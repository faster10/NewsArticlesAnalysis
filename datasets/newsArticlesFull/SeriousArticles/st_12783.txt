Moreno : It ' s surprising to the ( English ) speaking people and Hispanic people because both of them have always seen me as a very strong personality . You know the Latinos ( have seen me as ) el orgullo de Puerto Rico ( the pride of Puerto Rico ) . El orgullo de los Latinos , de la comunidad Latina . And Americans have always seen me that way , too . So ( my ) struggle is a huge surprise to everybody . They just think you got this way overnight . And I keep telling them , you know what ? It took me 81 years to reach this Rita Moreno !
