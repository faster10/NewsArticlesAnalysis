These include facilitating the exchange of Peter Moore , a British national kidnapped by Shia militiamen in Baghdad in 2007 , for Qais al Khazali , former spokesman for Shia cleric Muqtada al Sadr , who was implicated in the killing of U .

And then , of course , there was the Bowe Bergdahl exchange in 2013 for five Taliban officials , a deal that the Obama administration insists wasn ' t negotiating with terrorists , in part because the Taliban is an insurgent rather than a terrorist group . ( But as Peter Bergen has pointed out , the Haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organization ) . Direct or indirect , insurgent or terrorist , these are for the most part distinctions that don ' t really amount to real differences . And if you push the argument too far , they make the United States look inconsistent and hypocritical .
