Most observers seem unaware that the new climate deal currently in the making is likely to have the opposite effect of its intended purpose . A shifty Paris agreement is more likely to result in slowing down and rolling back Britain s climate policies rather than accelerating decarbonisation . The agreement will likely remove all legal obligations for governments to limit CO2 emissions . A deal with no binding CO2 targets , however , will be toothless . Instead of decarbonisation we would see a continuous rise in global CO2 emissions for decades to come .
