Ms . Clinton is also working , albeit more subtly , to undermine Obama s position on Iran . The day the U . S . and Iran celebrated finally lifting sanctions that had crippled Iran for years , Clinton proposed more sanctions to appease neocons in Washington and look tough on Iran . And , again , what kind of message does this send the Iranians ? whom Ms . Clinton says she s proud to call enemies ? while Obama is finally putting an end to the years long row . Clinton does nominally support the Iran Deal ( not doing so would certainly be too far ) but she has taken many opportunities to level passive aggressive criticism of it all while proposing even more sanctions on Iran , a position even former Iranian political prisoner Shane Bauer called totally irresponsible . In 2008 Clinton ? mocked Obama for saying he would talk directly to Iran , a decision that allowed the nuclear inspections to ultimately , seven years later , to be put in place . Again , her judgement was wrong on a key foreign policy issue which , because she now supports the deal , means this is the case even by her own standards .
