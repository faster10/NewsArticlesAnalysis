But in some instances , the hearing has less dramatic aims . Late last season , the HBO comedy Veep set an entire episode inside a hearing room . In the episode , titled Testimony , Congress was looking into whether Selina Meyer s assistant , Gary , was responsible for tampering with the legislative process . Shot in a v rit style , it had various backstabbers and Keystone Cops called upon to explain themselves ( or point fingers ) . It was Ericsson , many of them fall back on , as Diedrich Bader s sharpie character squirmily takes the fall . It was really funny , if not as funny as what was happening at the House Select Committee on Thursday . Sometimes entertainment can get you only so close to the real thing .
