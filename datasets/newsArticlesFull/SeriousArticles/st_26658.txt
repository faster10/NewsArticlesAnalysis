American reconstruction of Afghanistan is the most expensive reconstruction of a single country in U . S . history , costing more than 90 billion to date . The United States has given more to Afghanistan than any other single country during the Marshall Plan after World War II . Last year , Afghanistan received almost twice as much as the next four largest foreign assistance country beneficiaries combined . With about 2 , 300 U . S . service members killed in this effort , the loss to American families has also been incalculable .
