In this sense , Cruz is imitating a strategy used by Richard Nixon in 1968 . Then , there was a third party candidate , George Wallace , who was as prone to bombastic , racist rhetoric as Trump , particularly on the issues of race and crime . Both he and Nixon were on a similar wavelength , with the key exception being that Wallace was more extreme and politically radioactive , which had the effect of making Nixon seem less extreme , less dogmatic , and a better , more mature option than Wallace . To be sure , the situation today is not identical . Trump is running for the GOP nomination and Wallace was a third party candidate and in 1968 Wallace s late fade didn t translate into higher support for Nixon ? but his campaign did raise the profile of issues that benefited Nixon , and his harsh rhetoric helped Nixon establish himself as a less divisive figure . Trump is doing the same for Cruz this cycle .
