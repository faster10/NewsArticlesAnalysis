But notice the tea party and conservative buckets : There , Cruz is at or near the lead . And that ' s a big group that comes out to vote . Rubio ' s support is pretty much the same in each category . Cruz has clear areas of strength . That ' s the value proposition of each : Rubio does better with moderates , now passing Bush , and does okay with everyone else . Cruz is the right ' s candidate . ( Rubio clearly suffers from the amount of moderate support for Trump and Carson . We ' ll see what happens there over time . )
