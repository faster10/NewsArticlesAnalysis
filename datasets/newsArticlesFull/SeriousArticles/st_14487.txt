Compounding the growing problem of radicalism in Belgium is the availability of illegal weapons ? arms dealers in Brussels are believed to have provided the AK 47s used in the Charlie Hebdo attack , the Kosher supermarket hostage killing the next day , and the August train attack . Belgium is a major legal producer of firearms , but the weapons used in these attacks are probably surplus from the Balkan wars of the 1990s and likely made their way from Eastern Europe . Kalashnikovs can reportedly be purchased for a little more than 1 , 000 in Belgium .
