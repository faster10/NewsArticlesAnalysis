Teicher : It was long ago , Tania . It was so long ago that NRG Stadium still had a grass playing field . The Chiefs have changed a lot since then as well . The biggest changes have come on offense , where Jamaal Charles is no longer the featured back and Jeremy Maclin has become Alex Smith ' s go to receiver . The Chiefs have a versatile 1 2 combination in Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware that has been effective in replacing Charles , while Maclin has rebounded from a slow start to lead the Chiefs in catches , receiving yards and touchdowns .
