The political class seems to think a race between Trump or Cruz on one side and Sanders on the other would be uniquely hospitable to an indepenent like Bloomberg . And indeed some establishment Democrats would likely support Bloomberg over Sanders , if it came to that . ? Ed Rendell , the former governor of Pennsylvania and DNC chairman ( also a longtime Clinton ally ) , summed up what I imagine is a common sentiment among party insiders : Mike Bloomberg for president rests on the not impossible but somewhat unlikely circumstance of either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz versus Bernie Sanders . If Hillary wins the nomination , Hillary is mainstream enough that Mike would have no chance , and Mike s not going to go on a suicide mission . ? Revealingly , Rendell added that he would be open to backing Bloomberg in such a circumstance : As a lifelong Democrat , as a former party chairman , it would be very hard for me to do that . But I would certainly take a look at it ? absolutely .
