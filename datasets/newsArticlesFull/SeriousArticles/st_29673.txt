As Paris reeled from the worst terror attacks since World War II , French officials said Saturday that at least one of the seven assailants ? now all dead ? had a Syrian passport in his possession , and that the men who stormed the packed Bataclan concert hall , where 89 of the 129 people who have so far died were killed , had driven there in a VW Polo car rented in Belgium with a Belgian license plate . All this suggested that the coordinated assault on Friday night involved a network stretching way beyond France .
