' ' At the heart of the conflict of the past few days is a divergent view on how the New Republic and journalism more broadly will survive , ' Hughes wrote in an op ed for The Washington Post . ' In one view , it is a " public trust " and not a business . It is something greater than a commercial enterprise , ineffable , an ideal that cannot be touched . Financially , it would be a charity . . . At the New Republic , I believe we owe it to ourselves and to this institution to aim to become a sustainable business and not position ourselves to rely on the largesse of an unpredictable few . Our success is not guaranteed , but I think it ' s critical to try . '
