Before you know it , the police officer you watched firing 16 gunshots into the teenager ' s body becomes the victim , a hero even . You don ' t believe in conspiracies and cover ups , so what the officers originally said happened that night must be true . McDonald lunged at them with a knife . The officer feared for his life . He feared for the lives of the seven other officers on the scene . He feared for the lives of passers by standing around looking . The cop did everyone a service by getting this thug off the streets . You ' ll see , once we hear his side in court .
