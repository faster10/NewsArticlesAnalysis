I was working with Dr Mark Jago and Dr Pete Morkel in Namibia . Some countries are de horning small populations of rhino to deter poachers from shooting them . It is a short term solution and surely no substitute for professional and well trained rangers protecting these highly sought after animals . De horning has to be done every two years for it to be effective and can only realistically be done with small populations in open bush . My initial task each time was to monitor the heart rate and oxygen levels and help stabilise them as quickly as possible . My responsibilities then grew to taking blood and tissue samples and the de horning itself .
