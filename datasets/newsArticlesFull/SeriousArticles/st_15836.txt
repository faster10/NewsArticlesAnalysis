" That ' s really the basis of trying to come up with a game plan and how you want to play a team like that , " Belichick said . " You don ' t want to put yourself in bad situations , but at the same time , you don ' t want to make it too much of a game where there are a lot of multiples if they do this , we do that if they do that , we do this . That can go on forever . At some point , you have to line up and play what you ' re going to play . Just because they know you ' re in something isn ' t always the worst thing in the world . All good teams have tendencies , all good players have tendencies . That ' s not a bad thing that ' s a good thing . It means you ' re doing something well . At some point , it ' s going to come down to ' you have to play well and do what you do well better than what they try to do against it ' .
