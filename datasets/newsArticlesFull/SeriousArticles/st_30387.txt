As " Ron 1966 , " a reader of the ABC website , put it : " This is just ludicrous ! A prominent figure misuses a word and gets embarrassingly caught out for doing so by anyone who understands the English language or who can read a dictionary and so the Australian Dictionary decides to redefine the word to match the prominent person ' s intended meaning . . . . Is the Macquarie Dictionary also going to redefine ' misandry ' , or is it only accusatory and inflammatory words used by women against men that need to have their definition broadened to save embarrassment ?
