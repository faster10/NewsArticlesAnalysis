Bays : It ' s an intended thing . And partly , it ' s a fun way to do it . It will be fun to see people ' s reactions . There ' s something about as far as how as our experience as the audience is reflected in Ted ' s experience as a single guy , I like the idea of you never know when it ' s going to happen , and when it does happen , it just happens and there she is . I think it ' s a way to put the audience in Ted ' s shoes a little bit even though he doesn ' t actually meet her in this episode .
