Clinton spoke emotionally about a recent meeting with the mothers of African Americans who died at the hands of law enforcement . I still can t get over that Eric Garner , on Staten Island . . . died from a chokehold , she said , referring to the New Yorker who died last year after a police officer placed him in an illegal chokehold . He was selling loose cigarettes , that s all he was doing . Was it against the law ? Yeah , it was against the law , but . . . he had kids , he had a family . OK , maybe he shouldn t have been selling cigarettes , but did he deserve to die because of that ? Absolutely not .
