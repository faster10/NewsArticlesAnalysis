" Baywatch " babe Pamela Anderson Book : " Star and Starstruck " Summary : A poorly feigned attempt to pass Pamela Anderson ' s real life off as fiction . Star Wood Leigh is flung into fame via a show called " Lifeguards , " later dealing with the gossip and drama that follows her marriage to rock star Jimi Deeds . Overall , an easy way for Anderson to reveal everything about her life but pretend it never happened . Review : " Anderson ' s range is predictably limited , and she abandons quite a few unrealized plot threads along the way . This thinly veiled novelization of her own life doesn ' t pretend to be anything but trashy and cheesy , which gives it an amiable charm . " Publishers Weekly
