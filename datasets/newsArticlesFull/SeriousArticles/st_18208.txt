Before the Phoenix Suns game on Thursday , Lue talked about how efficient the Cavs have become from deep because of their passing ( a no pass shot resulted in 27 percent accuracy , one pass was 32 percent , two passes were 40 percent and then three passes or more , a whopping 52 percent from 3 ) . Irving bristled when asked about the stat after the Phoenix game , perhaps feeling the question was slighting his one on one ability . He said his teammates were talented enough to score , no matter how many passes preceded their attempt . It turns out that Lue gave special dispensation to Irving . Yes , if there s an open man , find him . But right now , Lue isn t counting Irving s passes or assist totals . The fact that Irving dropped only two dimes in Detroit was OK because his coach s priority for him right now is simply to push the pace and find the rhythm that will allow him to become dominant again .
