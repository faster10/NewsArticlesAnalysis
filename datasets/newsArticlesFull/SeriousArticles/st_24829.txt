Somehow , the White House and Congressional partisans just crafted a budget deal that actually looks pretty damn good . A deal that provides significant relief from the boneheaded sequestration caps to the tune of 80 billion over the next two years , with parity on the defense and non defense sides of the budget . A deal that staves off governing by crisis with fiscal cliffs and debt ceilings and shutdowns for a couple of years that ' s " years , " not " weeks " ( e . g . , the debt limit is raised until early 2017 ) and that does so without dinging Medicare or Social Security beneficiaries .
