Engadget : Forget anti drone drones , one of nature s most majestic hunters may soon play a valuable role in taking down dangerous UAVs . As part of a new trial , the Dutch National Police force has begun training eagles to intercept troublesome drones during an emergency , when another capture device might put people below at risk . In collaboration with raptor training company Guard From Above , Dutch police taught an eagle to recognize a DJI drone . Once in sight , the bird flies toward its mechanical prey , snatches it with its enormous talons and then takes it to safe place What makes eagles effective drone hunters ? Their feet have four powerful toes that are strong enough to grip and carry heavy objects , whether it s a wild animal or a heavy UAV .
