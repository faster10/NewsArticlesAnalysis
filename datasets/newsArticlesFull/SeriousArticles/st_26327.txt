The second seeded Patriots lost at Denver in overtime in Week 12 and dropped their final two regular season games to give the Broncos home field advantage , but they rebounded to end Kansas City s 11 game winning streak with a 27 20 victory last week . It s pretty hard to get to this point , Brady said . There s only four teams standing . Two of these teams have to go home . Hope we re not one of them . Denver capitalized on a late turnover to score 11 points in the final three plus minutes for a 23 16 victory over sixth seeded Pittsburgh last week . Manning , who did not play in the earlier meeting with New England , made his first start since Nov . 15 in last week s victory .
