Sanders obsesses about the concentration of wealth among the upper 2 percent , the increasingly unequal distribution of income , the diminished middle class , and the acceleration of poverty . He talks about " democratic socialism " as if the electorate has the moral right and constitutional right to vote in tyranny . An ideologue , Sanders cannot comprehend that our economic disrepair is largely the result not of the unfettered free market but of the fascist style mixed economy that he favors moreover , even a watered down version of Bernie ' s socialism would worsen a situation already made worse by President Obama .
