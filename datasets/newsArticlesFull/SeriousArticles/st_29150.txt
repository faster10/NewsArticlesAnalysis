Absolutely not , no . I can ' t do what I used to do . My body just wouldn ' t tolerate what I used to do . ( Fonda has had hip and knee replacement surgeries . ) The mistake that so many people make is that if they can ' t do what they once did , then they don ' t do anything . Big mistake . It ' s important just to do something . If you can ' t run , walk . . . . If you can ' t lift heavy weights , so lift light weights . But just keep yourself physically active . It makes all the difference not just for your body , but for your brain as well .
