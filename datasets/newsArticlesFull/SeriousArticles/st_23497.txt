Putting women front and center in film is the exception , not the rule . Using " Ghostbusters " as an example of how far females have come is like celebrating Kathryn Bigelow ' s best director Academy Award and forgetting that she ' s the only woman ever to take home that honor . You can applaud Katniss , Elsa , and Anna , too . But , they ' re following the legions of guys who have protected and ruled the planet , palaces and corporate empires near and far . It ' s fair and important to celebrate these high profile moments of progress . Doing so , however , may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in Hollywood movies .
