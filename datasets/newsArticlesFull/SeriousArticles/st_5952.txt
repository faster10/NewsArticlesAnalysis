Mr Penn s account is likely to deepen the concern among the Mexican authorities already embarrassed by Guzman s multiple escapes , the months required to find him again and his status for some as something of a folk hero .

Mr Penn said he was also told , during a leg of the journey taken in a small plane equipped with a scrambling device for ground radar only , that the cartel was informed by an insider when the military deployed a high altitude surveillance plane that might have spotted their movements .
