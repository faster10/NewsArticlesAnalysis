The Vienna meetings have unveiled the changes , which have affected the political and military situations in Syria . Given that no Syrian party attended the Vienna meetings , whether from the regime or the opposition , it is clear that the solution is no longer in the hands of the Syrians . Instead , Syria s political settlement has become a regional and international matter . The failure to find a solution would thus be the result of a failure to reach an agreement between the big players in the Vienna process ( i . e . the US , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Turkey and Iran ) . It is worth noticing that during the course of the Vienna meetings , America s role has been transformed from being a party to the conflict into assuming the role of a mediator between the two camps ( Saudi Arabia and Turkey vs Russia and Iran ) .
