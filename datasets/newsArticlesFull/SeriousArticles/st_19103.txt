Hard question . Avery has proclaimed his innocence since he was first accused . Evidence he has marshaled in his defense includes the fact that the county police took part in the Halbach investigation despite the fact that he was suing them at the time . This is where the double meaning of Making a Murderer comes in ? did prison make Avery into a murderer , or did the police , by framing him ? Neighboring Calumet County was supposed to take over the investigation to avoid this conflict of interest , but it didn t exactly work out that way . Several of the officers who worked on the Halbach case were personally involved in Avery s first case . Avery blames the police for his earlier wrongful conviction as well : As he says in the series , he believed law enforcement in Manitowoc County had it out for him and his family . One of his cousins , Sandra Morris , had previously accused Avery of running her off the road and threatening her at gunpoint , as well as exposing himself , and Morris had personal ties to the sheriff .
