A new legal template that eviscerates ? the UNFCCC is what the developed world wants , with no differentiation between the developed and developing worlds . Those countries want to focus on current emissions , ignoring historic emissions . They neglect the challenge of adaptation even while developing countries are already paying a heavy price , by having to deal with the adverse consequences of climate change already taking place . They do not wish to deliver on their UNFCCC commitments on financial resources or technology transfer . The modest target of 100 billion in climate finance promised by 2020 is projected as being close to realisation by lumping together overseas development assistance as well as commercial financial flows . If this attempt succeeds , then this will become the new template for future climate related actions . The UNFCCC will be thrown into the dustbin .
