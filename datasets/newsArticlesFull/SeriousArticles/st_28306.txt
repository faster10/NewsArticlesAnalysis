Those inclined to refute the IARC conclusion because we are constitutionally omnivorous as a species ( we are ) are ignoring two very important considerations . First , our Stone Age ancestors had a lifespan about half our own , so didn ' t have time to develop cancer for the most part . What natural selection never sees , natural selection cannot address . Further , the meat of our native diets is rather far removed from the meats that prevail today , and in particular , the processed meats that have earned the skull and crossbones warning label from IARC . I have addressed this topic before , for those inclined to chew it more thoroughly .
