Prospects seemed bleak . The family s savings had dwindled after his unemployment insurance gave out . But in 1993 Robbins saw a newspaper advertisement for something called the Burlington Community Land Trust . He visited its offices and learned about its generous grants for low income home ownership . The innovative offer would significantly lower the price by allowing the couple to purchase only the house , while the trust paid for the land it sat on . Within two years , his family owned a home in a small town just to the east of the city . The Robbins family bought its home through a conventional realtor and a commercial bank while also entering a covenant with the land trust to lease the land upon their home sits upon . This reduced the costs of their mortgage and down payment substantially . ? ? ?
