And here was where I felt the faint stirring of what can only be described as admiration ? Trump had been offstage and off camera for a good 10 ? or 15 ? minutes . Though his spirit hovered over the whole scene , he had shared the space for long stretches with the less fortunate ? wounded veterans , and also Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum . He had been a gracious host . And assuming the 6 million raised for charity last night actually gets to organizations that will use it to help people ( always dicey in the world of veteran s charities ) , he had done something good for people not named Donald Trump .
