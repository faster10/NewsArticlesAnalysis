In the 15 or so years I ve been paying attention to the Oscars , this is the most offensively stale and safe crop of nominees I ve ever seen ? one that bends over backward to avoid nominating people of color and queer filmmakers . I remember the quaint ol days when a small group of Oscar watchers would get upset when The Reader got nominated over more deserving movies like The Dark Knight and Wall E . But this year , nearly every category is an utter travesty , a sign that the Oscars have learned nothing and will continue to learn absolutely nothing . A few months ago , I forecasted that the acting nominees would be all white yet again , but I couldn t have predicted this level of embarrassment .
