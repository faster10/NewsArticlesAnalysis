But I wonder how many of those who invoke the name of Marx in order to stifle political debate actually believe their own propaganda . Or are they conjuring up a convenient bogeyman at a time of great uncertainty . Do they raise Marx ' s image in order to deflect attention from slightly warmer bodies ( Marx has been dead for 128 years ) in positions of political or economic power who are actually more pernicious ? I also wonder whether those who use Marx ' s name , and those who tremble at the thought of him , actually know much about the man . Are they reacting to Karl Marx or those things done in his name ? I believe it is the latter . I also believe it is time to understand Marx so that we are no longer made to fear him .
