It ' s usually not smart to argue with strangers at the gym , but I tried to respond , saying that even if you don ' t like Obama , at least he ' s done a lot , including the 2009 stimulus package , the Affordable Care Act and Dodd Frank . Before I could add to the list , he cut me off : " That ' s small stuff , and anyway , he hasn ' t done anything on the environment . " I pointed to air pollution regulations , including controls on greenhouse gases . He looked at me as if I had missed the point and said , icily , " Just wait until Bernie gets in there . "
