GS : What we had as far as the last play with Buffalo s reception was that the receiver gave himself up voluntarily in the field of play . When that occurs and we deem that the runner , which he would have been after he maintained possession after his reception , he was now a runner , had given himself up in the field of play . Then the fact that he scoots out of bounds is not as important . We wound the clock . It was a judgment call by that head linesman that he felt like he gave himself up in the field of play . It s not a reviewable play . So winding the clock or stopping the clock is not something we review . So , in his judgment , he deemed that the runner gave himself up in the field of play voluntarily , which does put him down by contact in the field , so he wound the clock .
