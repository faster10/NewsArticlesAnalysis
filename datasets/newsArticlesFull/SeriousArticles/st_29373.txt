Marty Hurney : The former general manager who was fired during the 2012 season also deserves credit here . He selected outside linebacker Thomas Davis in the first round of the 2005 draft and middle linebacker Kuechly in the first round of the 2012 draft . They are the heart and soul of this defense . Hurney may have overpaid Johnson ( six years , 72 million in 2011 ) , but he also made a good move drafting Johnson , who ranks second on Carolina ' s all time sack list , in the third round . Hurney selected cornerback Josh Norman in the fifth round of the 2012 draft . Norman has developed into one of the league ' s best at his position . For all the grief Hurney took for putting Carolina in salary cap hell , he played a significant role in building the core of this defense .
