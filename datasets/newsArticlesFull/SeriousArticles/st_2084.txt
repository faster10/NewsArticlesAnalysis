Huckabee claims that China does not tax capital . The definition of " capital tax " varies widely , and can refer specifically to corporate income tax or other types of capital , or both . If " capital " is understood as being all of a corporation ' s capital , exclusive of spending , it is correct that China does not have a " capital tax , " according to a 2015 report on taxation in China by the international consulting firm Deloitte . Contrary to Huckabee ' s claim , however , the United States does not have a federal " capital tax " either , according to a 2014 Tax Foundation report . China does have a corporate income tax rate of 25 , whereas the U . S . rate is 35 .
