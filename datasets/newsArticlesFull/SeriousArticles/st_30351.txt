The U . S . Supreme Court has not been asked nor could it possibly answer the question of what God or the Bible thinks about same sex marriage . Religious groups are divided on that question , some supporting and others opposing same sex marriage . And even if the religious viewpoint were clear , it should play no direct role in deciding whether the Constitution requires the states or the federal government to recognize same sex marriage . Our government should not act to further one or another religious view of contested moral issues .
