Things came to a head in 1992 , when the Supreme Court issued another historic ruling in Planned Parenthood v . Casey , a case argued and won by the lawyers who founded the Center for Reproductive Rights . At a time when the Bush administration was calling for the repeal of Roe , the Casey decision instead affirmed that decision s essential holdings . It also established a standard rejecting as unconstitutional any law with the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion , and declared that unnecessary health regulations would not stand .
