The Pentagon made clear just how little is changing in its first announcement on a change in U . S . strategy wrought by Paris . In the wake of the recent attack on France , we stand strong and firm with our oldest ally , which is why the U . S . and France have decided to bolster our intelligence sharing , Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement on Monday . New instructions from Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Jim Clapper , the director of national intelligence , will enable U . S . military personnel to more easily share operational planning information and intelligence with our French counterparts on a range of shared challenges to the fullest extent allowed by existing law and policy .
