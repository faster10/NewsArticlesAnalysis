Romney also favored indexing the minimum wage , figuring , like Carson , that it would remove the topic permanently from the partisan arena . ( Because the minimum wage is popular , politicizing it mostly hurts Republicans . ) It was a position Romney had as governor and a position he kept , Stevens said , and he ended up with a higher percentage of the GOP vote than Bush in 2000 . ( Actually , Romney muddied his support in 2012 by proposing the minimum be indexed not only to inflation but also to the jobs level throughout the country , unemployment rate and competitive rates in other states , or , in this case , other nations . )
