Election day itself is but one step in a political process that will take nearly six months before resulting in a new government . The Myanmar Union Election Commission ( UEC ) will announce the official election results on November 22 , and the new government will form sometime in March 2016 , leaving roughly five months of politicking and jockeying before we know the shape and scope of the new administration and how the military and USDP view it . This period will be an important indicator of how serious efforts to continue the reforms are , particularly if the November 8 election is widely accepted as credible and the results acknowledged . The day itself should proceed relatively smoothly , though there is a high probability that the results of some seats may remain in question , allegations of fraud will be levied , and small scale incidents of violence could occur . While many would concede that Myanmar politics would remain problematic regardless of the conduct of election day due to the continued role of the military and a controversial constitution , the current government , particularly UEC , has worked to make the election as credible as possible . The UEC has received technical assistance from international organizations and governments and has Western election observers , the first time in at least 65 years that it has done so . The 2010 election did not include foreign election monitors .
