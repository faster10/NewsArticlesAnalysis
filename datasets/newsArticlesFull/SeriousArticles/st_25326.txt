" Just to stay focused on what you ' re doing , " Bryant said when asked what he said . " Which is playing the game of basketball . It ' s tough in this day and age where everybody has a camera on their phones . You pick up on mistakes a lot more than you would in the past . Not to say that some of the heroes who played here in the past didn ' t make the same kind of mistakes . The important thing for him is to just learn from those mistakes . And stay focused on the game . Stay focused on tactical things where you feel like your weaknesses are and how to get better at it . If he does that , he ' ll be just fine . "
