' I ' m working harder than ever but now I ' ve learned to pace myself , ' he says . ' My stroke was a warning shot and I ' m careful now . I don ' t do things that are too demanding . And I ' ve learned to relax more I ' ve got better at taking time off and turning the phone off and not looking at the email . I do yoga every day which helps with the relaxation and I ' ve also learned to just not care about certain things . I ' ve realised there are more important things in life than being on TV . '
