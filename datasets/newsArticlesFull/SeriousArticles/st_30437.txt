Sanders said the business model of Wall Street is fraud . This is the sort of comment that convinces me that Bernie Sanders doesn t understand the financial system all that well . After all , this is no different than saying that all Muslims are evil because jihadists attacked Paris over the weekend . That s just silly , and it s based on a dangerous and ignorant generalization . What is he saying exactly ? Is he saying every accountant , banker , financial analyst , financial planner , manager and sales person on Wall Street is part of a fraudulent cartel ? This is nothing more than populist rhetoric that some people get charged up about only because they don t understand the thing they hate . Yes , there is some fraud on Wall Street , but that does not mean the business model of Wall Street is fraud .
