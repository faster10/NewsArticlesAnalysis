I think there are a lot of municipalities looking at water infrastructure very carefully on both ends of it . In terms of how to deal with stormwater , we have a gigantic problem of changing weather patterns overwhelming sewage infrastructure , and that has implications for what happens with water sources where we draw our drinking water from . Where you have sewage overflows , you then have massive amounts of water in people ' s basements and it s flowing out untreated into rivers and lakes . We have that problem in Chicago with basements being flooded that didn t use to be , but we have a significant system of replacement and rebuilding of sewage pipes . Philadelphia is doing this remarkably creatively .
