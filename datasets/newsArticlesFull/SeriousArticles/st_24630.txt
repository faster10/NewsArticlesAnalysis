Panthers and Jared , I truly am sorry that this has become a forum for ridiculous Bear and Packer fans to air out their frustrations . The Bears , on one hand , are obviously upset that they can t get ANYTHING going NO MATTER what they do , the Packers , well , you know , losing every home game to their division rivals this year TRULY had to STING ( especially that LAST ONE for the NORTH ) but this is about Jared hopefully being well enough to play throughout the remainder of your season . I LOVE the guy and WISH him only the very best ! PLEASE get to the SUPER BOWL guys ! ! ! I will be rooting for you ! ! !
