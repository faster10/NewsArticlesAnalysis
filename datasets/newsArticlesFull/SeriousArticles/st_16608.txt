For good measure , there is another Australian in action too in the form of Bernard Tomic who meets Simone Bolelli of Italy . It s worked out so many times that way before and that s how things played out tonight . It s unlikely such flourishes will make up for a lack of meat and veg power shots against his next opponent , the Spanish World Number 8 David Ferrer . The only exception came in 2005 , when he finished runner up to Marat Safin . With the 34 year old Australian set to retire after the Australian open and take over as Davis Cup captain , accolades for the gritty fighter are rolling in .
