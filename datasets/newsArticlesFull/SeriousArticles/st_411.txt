I never , never expected that Senator Bernie Sanders would get this far , but I don t see how he is any particular political challenge to Senator Clinton , said Rangel , a Clinton backer who served with Vermont s Sanders in the House . Being from New York , New Hampshire , and Vermont are parts of our great country , but just not really truly representative of our great country . We have set up these little testing grounds , and I think they re important . But if Bernie won everything in the places that are less diverse . I don t see that as being representative of the American people across the country . "
