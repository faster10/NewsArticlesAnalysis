Then came college , adulthood and the World Wide Web . It was there that I found people who were just like me game show fans who loved talking about game shows past , present and future . We reviewed shows , compared hosts and rooted each other on as we went out on auditions . One friend sent me a cassette of game show themes that included a cover of " Route 66 " by Depeche Mode that featured a commercial for the Tom Kennedy version of " Name That Tune , " voiced by the legendary Ernie Anderson . Another sent me a " Price is Right " coffee mug .
