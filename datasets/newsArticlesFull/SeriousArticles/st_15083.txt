I grew up in Flint , but the city I was raised in is nothing like the Flint of today . I am always telling my nieces and nephew that I wish they could know the city of those days . Thriving employment , bustling neighborhoods , and yes , clean water . Today Flint s population is half of what it was in the 1960s and 70s , when it was at its highest . In the past fifty years , Flint lost almost 80 , 000 General Motors jobs , and today more than four in ten Flint residents live below the poverty line .
