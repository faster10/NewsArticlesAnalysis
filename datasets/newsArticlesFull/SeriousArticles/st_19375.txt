Commenting on the reasons behind the slash in funding , Mohanty says , States often do not complete their activities on time because they do not receive the required money on time . Every year , by the time the states receive the required money , it is already the end of the first or second quarter and as a result they often scramble to finish the activities they had listed out in the last quarter . As a result they are not able to utilise their budgets completely and therefore cannot show the sort of expenditure that would justify an increase or at least discourage a slashing in the next year s budget . . . it is like a chain reaction . ?
