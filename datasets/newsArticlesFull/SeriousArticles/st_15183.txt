Five police officers said McDonald was threatening or turned toward cops when he was killed Laquan McDonald police reports differ dramatically from video , by Chicago Tribune staff : Hundreds of pages of newly released Chicago police reports from the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald are most striking for one simple reason : They are dramatically at odds with the dash cam video . . . The reports , released by the city late Friday , show that Officer Jason Van Dyke and at least five other officers claim that the 17 year old McDonald moved or turned threateningly toward officers , even though the video of the October 2014 shooting shows McDonald walking away , and the scenario sketched out by Cook County State ' s Attorney Anita Alvarez in charging Van Dyke with murder contends he was walking away as well . http : trib . in 1HPH3JP
