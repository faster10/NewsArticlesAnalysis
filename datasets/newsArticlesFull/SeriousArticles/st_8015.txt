Wall Street and their protectors in Washington Democrat and Republican say nothing is wrong with making a profit . That is absolutely true . But what is shameful and outlandish is to watch the American taxpayer save the jobs ( and big bonuses ) of these financial miscreants , only to see them jack up fees left and right . Without the American people they would have had to pack up their belongings and hit the pavement . Instead , they refuse to work with homeowners struggling to meet the big mortgage payments that Wall Street helped underwrite then sell in exotic transactions that wrecked this nation ' s financial infrastructure .
