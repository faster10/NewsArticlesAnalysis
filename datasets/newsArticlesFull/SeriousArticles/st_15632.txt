Rand Paul Remember that debates are about expectations and Paul s could hardly have been any lower going into the night . And lo and behold , the candidate who had been expected all along suddenly appeared . He managed to be feisty without being such a pill . Will this get him back into the race ? No . Will this , combined with his fellow libertarian s win this month for Kentucky governor give him more time before he has to go home and tend to his Senate seat ? Yes . And with his hewing closer to his family s libertarian line there may be some of those old stirrings out in the countryside .
