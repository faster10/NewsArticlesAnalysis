We ' re doing these things even though security worked . The security checkpoints , even at their pre 9 11 levels , forced whoever made the bomb to construct a much worse bomb than he would have otherwise . Instead of using a timer or a plunger or another reliable detonation mechanism , as would any commercial user of PETN , he had to resort to an ad hoc homebrew and a much more inefficient one , involving a syringe , and 20 minutes in the lavatory , and we don ' t know exactly what else that didn ' t explode .
