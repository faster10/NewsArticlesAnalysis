I find your lack of faith disturbing , snarls Darth Vader when an imperial officer accuses him of sorcery . What disturbs me is our excess of faith , a credulity that venerates Star Wars as a gospel , a testament , a map of the heavens . In Attack of the Clones , Anakin and Padm pause while smooching to discuss the self sufficiency of the realm they inhabit . Anything is possible , says Anakin : he is paraphrasing Lucas , who once remarked that It wasn t until we created digital cinema that I could allow my imagination to run wild . We live in a real world , Padm replies , come back to it . She has evidently forgotten that her body consists of pixels not molecules , and that the exotic landscape behind her was sketched by computers and overlaid on a green screen . That s the paradox and the predicament of Star Wars : those who live inside the fantasy , whether they re actors or fans , prefer their shared hallucination to the unelastic , downtrodden world of fact .
