A . I felt bad about it . I don ' t know if I would say guilty . I know Kobe ' s a competitor and he ' s going to play as many minutes as you want him to play . I ' m also a competitor , so I want to win and I know having him on the court gives me the best opportunity to win . But I also know that I ' ve got to think about him more than anything . And I thought there were points in time last year where I thought he could play a certain amount of minutes . He told me Day One the minutes that he thought he could play in and like I told him at the end of the day , You were absolutely right and I was wrong . ' I won ' t make that mistake again .
