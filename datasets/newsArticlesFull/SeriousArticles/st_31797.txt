This is what I ' ve been waiting for . I can ' t tell you how excited I was . It came at a very dark time and I just completely made it my life . The whole thing seemed so improbable . I had been waiting tables for four years . I was the waiter who was going to make records and I ' d tell anyone and everyone . And they were like , yeah , yeah , that ' s nice . An old Poison the Well fan came in to the restaurant and recognized me . He had a Poison the Well tattoo and I showed my manager I was like , look , this is my old band ! See ? And he ' d be like , that ' s very nice Mr Miller , but can you please bus table 22 ?
