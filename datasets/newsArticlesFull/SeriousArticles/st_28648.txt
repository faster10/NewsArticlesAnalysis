It seems as though NASA or other space agencies " rediscover " water on Mars every few years , so maybe this latest announcement will be regarded as just more of the same . But this time it ' s different really ! The stakes have just been raised a notch : Not only is there another planet right next door in our own solar system that had habitable environments on its surface long ago , but there appear to have been common and recognizable perhaps even Earthlike environments on Mars . That ' s the big news coming out of this latest discovery from NASA ' s Mars rovers .
