Willimon : There ' s certainly a lot of overlap , right ? To a degree , money is a form of power . But I think the differentiation he ' s drawing is what the end goal is .

Money is finite , it ' s limited by a number and what you can buy with it . Power has no limits if you ' re willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can .
