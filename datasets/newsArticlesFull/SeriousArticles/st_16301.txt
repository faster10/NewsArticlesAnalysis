This doesn t sound like the caricature of the Silicon Valley benefactor . In fact , somewhat paradoxically , there are notes of humility creeping into their giving at precisely the moment when it is glorying in its massive scale . In this and in other ways , Zuckerberg and Chan play somewhat against type . Tech giving , for instance , is often lambasted for demanding immediate results , but the couple make clear that they are in this for the long haul . The greatest challenges require very long time horizons and cannot be solved by short term thinking , they insist , stating that they plan on making investments that might take a century to come to fruition . And they are quick to point out how much they have to learn about the realm of philanthropy from existing experts in the field , without assuming that their own expertise in the tech sector automatically transfers over ( and without the blithe celebration of philanthropic risk taking and mistake making that defined Sean Parker s recent ode to hacker philanthropy ) . One of the reasons why Zuckerberg wanted to begin giving now , he explained in a comment on his Facebook page , is so that he can start learning . If we want to be good at philanthropy in 10 15 years , we should start now , he wrote .
