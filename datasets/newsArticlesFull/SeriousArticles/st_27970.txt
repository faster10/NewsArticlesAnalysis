Vernon Davis is indeed an ASSet . He tanked on the field in the 2014 season after he couldn t get his contract re negotiated . He gave up running in the middle of some routes which resulted in interceptions . As a result , Kap wasn t throwing the ball to him . Davis found that he cannot just turn it back on this season . At his best he is both a pass catching TE and a good blocker . When he was tanking it his blocker also suffered , as some web sites rated him one of the worst blockers in his position .
