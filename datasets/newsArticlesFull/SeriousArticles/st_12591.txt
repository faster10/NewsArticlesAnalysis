Head 30 minutes north of Manhattan and you ' ll come across this historic property that was once the residence of noted newspaperman and playwright General Howard Carroll . Carrollclifffe , as it was called upon completion in 1910 , featured 45 rooms and was modeled after medieval fortifications in Wales , Scotland and Ireland . Though totally refurbished in early 2013 , the integrity and Old World ambiance remain , visible in details like the intricately carved wooden stairways , hand hewn oak beams and leaded glass windows . For the full on castle experience , reserve one of the tower suites , complete with wood burning fireplace and turret alcove .
