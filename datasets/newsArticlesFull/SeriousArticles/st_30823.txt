JUDD : In a way , what happens to the women of Congo is also happening to me , and I also lose my humanity . I compromise my integrity when I do not engage in their struggle . And it ' s not easy . One of the things that has really helped me cope over the years is keeping an extensive diary . I started in Cambodia on the first day I went to a genocide museum there . And then the next thing I knew , I was at Svay Pak . I didn ' t even know what Svay Pak was . It took me a while to figure out that the first brothel I ever went to was one of the most infamous notorious brothels in the entire world . And that night , I thought I was going to die . I thought I was going to die from grief . The grief comes up even when I just remember it .
