There ' s that big swing from Klitschko but Fury ducks underneath it . The bookies still have Klitschko as favourite but I think all observers agree that Fury has a narrow lead here . A left right and Fury lands another jab with the second , cutting Klitschko for a third time . Fury opens up with a couple of massive , wild swings and the champion is on the run . This is frankly pathetic from the Ukranian and Fury lands a left hook , but Tony Weeks removes a point as it catches the back of the head ! That gives Klitsch the round I reckon .
