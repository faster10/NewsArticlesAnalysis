For example , establishment pundits are limited in their understanding , because they re accustomed to think in terms of the establishment they re part of , and within that establishment , being a presidential contender means being an elected politician . That s a big part of what defines the issue landscape ? as well as campaigning style . But in this election cycle , Trump was always only the loudest and most dominant of a group of three candidates who d never held office before ( although in Fiorina s , not for lack of trying ) . So there are two obvious choices : we can try to understand things in terms of the establishment candidates , or we can try to understand them in terms of the outsiders . Or we can try a bit of both ? which is what I d like to suggest .
