In our recent study , my Trinity College colleague , Ariela Keysar , and I found that 54 of Jewish students reported experiencing or witnessing ant Semitism on campus during the six months of September 2013 March 2014 . Our survey covered 1 , 157 Jewish students on 55 campuses . The patterns and high rates of anti Semitism that were reported were surprising . Another finding was that female students were more likely than males ( 58 versus 51 ) to report anti Semitism . Jewish women seem more vulnerable on campus today .
