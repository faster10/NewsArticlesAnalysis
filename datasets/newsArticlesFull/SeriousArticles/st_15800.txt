Step right up ! Get your tickets ! Bring the whole family ! Bring your anger , bring your spleen , don ' t let logic intervene !

Even though it was , in fact , obvious in 2008 that Palin was out of her league , as I pointed out in a column , her fans wouldn ' t hear of it . About 20 , 000 of them took time out of their busy schedules to send me emails expressing their displeasure ( I ' ve kept them all for nursing home share time ) . The whole episode was instructive in multiple ways , but most important , it foretold a dumbing down of the GOP that eight years later may prove irreversible .
