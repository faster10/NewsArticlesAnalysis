From the spring through the preseason , I thought that if Kelly was proved wrong about Bradford , it would be because his gamble on Bradford ' s health failed . Instead , Bradford might be the healthiest Eagle on the 53 man roster . If he just isn ' t a very good quarterback , after the Eagles studied film and assessed their options and decided he was their best option , that brings nearly everything about Kelly ' s judgment into question . Does he know a good QB when he sees one ? Should he be choosing personnel ?
