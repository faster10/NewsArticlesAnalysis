However , Biden followed those smiles ( and laughs which I don ' t like and always recommend against ) with indignation about what Paul Ryan was saying . He followed those smiles with arguments that Ryan was wrong on his facts , wrong on his history and wrong about President Barack Obama . Had it not been clear that Biden was smiling because he thought Ryan was saying something ridiculous , it would have bothered me more . But for me , the smiles didn ' t get in the way too much once I put my Ray Bans on .
