A recent Super Bowl quarterback equivalent to what Manning has done this year is none other than Rex Grossman , the football punchline who quarterbacked the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI , where Manning got his lone Super Bowl win with the Colts . Grossman had a better passing rating and touchdown to interception ratio in 2006 while Manning trumps him in QBR and completion percentage . We ll call it a draw . Peyton Manning has lasted long enough in the NFL that he s become as good as Rex Grossman .
