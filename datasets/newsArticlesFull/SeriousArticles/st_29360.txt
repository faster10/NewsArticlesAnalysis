Chris Wesseling , NFL . com : " While Brady remains a legitimate MVP candidate playing at a higher level than he was five years ago , Manning has been a liability at the helm of Gary Kubiak ' s offense . Manning has managed just one touchdown versus eight interceptions in five home games this season . After throwing a touchdown pass in 56 consecutive games stretching from November of 2010 through November of 2014 , he has been kept out of the end zone in eight of his last 16 games . Quarterbacks can only absorb so many hits , undergo so many surgeries and come out on the losing end of so many thrillers before their bodies break down . In Manning ' s case , that point was driven home Sunday when he willingly surrendered in the pocket for an untouched sack , only to be bailed out by a missed call when he popped up for a flutter ball to Emmanuel Sanders . Brady , on the other hand , just finished carving up Kansas City ' s defense like a surgeon with Julian Edelman , Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski back in the lineup . "
