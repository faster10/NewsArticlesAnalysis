A day earlier , police had identified another body found in the charred hulk of the apartment as that of Abdelhamid Abaaoud , a Belgian extremist of Moroccan origin who has been called the ringleader of the Paris plot . A woman described as Abaaoud ' s cousin , Hasna Aitboulahcen , was killed as authorities descended on the flat though reports that emerged Friday indicated she did not activate a suicide vest , as police initially said , and may have died when another accomplice blew himself up .
