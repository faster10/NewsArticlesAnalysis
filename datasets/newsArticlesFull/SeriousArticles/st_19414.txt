Griff : I ' m sure Delton is working very hard , but I ' d agree he hasn ' t had the sort of year myself or many others had thought he might , . He has 24 carries for 50 yards . I believe that five months away from the program , and out of the strength and conditioning program , too , really took a lot out of him . Williams is still contributing out of the backfield , and it wouldn ' t surprise me to see him make a key play at some point . Dantonio said the running back competition isn ' t settled yet , but Holmes has been playing the best of the group for a few games .
