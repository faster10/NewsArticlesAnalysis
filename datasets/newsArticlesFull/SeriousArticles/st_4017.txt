Since many INA survivors hoped against hope that Netaji would resurface and take the reins of the country , some extremely powerful people in the central government , too , believed in that theory , Bose said . " Naturally , this led to the surveillance on my father and some others of the family . My father was trying to locate letters that Netaji wrote to INA members or statesmen across the world and letters that they wrote to him . This was because he wanted to build an archive . This perhaps made the central government doubt his intentions . They probably thought that he was trying to create a political challenge for the existing government , " explained Bose .
