So let ' s call out the obvious : HRC ' s endorsement of Hillary Clinton is an endorsement of the candidate they think is most likely to win . That ' s Politics 101 , right ? Given the two candidates , this endorsement can ' t possibly be wholly about LGBTQ rights , but instead is an off shoot of politically savvy HRC throwing their support behind the stronger establishment candidate . If you endorse the candidate most likely to win , then you get in good with the candidate who is ( wait for it ) most likely to win .
