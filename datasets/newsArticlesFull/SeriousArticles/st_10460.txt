Cruz believes he will appeal to the millions of evangelicals in American ? and he says more than half of them didn t vote in 2012 . That number only makes sense if you include not only the president s memoranda on deferred action , but the memos from early in his term setting certain priorities for deportation to begin with . Rescinding those would send a clear message that all unauthorized immigrants are equally vulnerable to deportation . And it doesn t explicitly say that he would deport all 11 million of them .
