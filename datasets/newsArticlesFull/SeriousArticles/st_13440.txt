At his next election rally , the PM spoke about a quota conspiracy . Lalu and Nitish , he declared , were conspiring to snatch away a proportion of reservations from the Dalits , Mahadalits , OBCs and EBCs to give these to another community . He must have had reasons not to name the community . But Shah removed all ambiguity on this subject . He proclaimed that if the BJP lost the election in Bihar for any reason , Pakistan would explode crackers . He explained that in order to placate his vote bank , Nitish never arrested terrorists , which endeared him to Pakistan .
