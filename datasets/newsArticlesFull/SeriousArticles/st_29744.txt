When I wasn ' t writing academic papers , I was caring for my baby daughter , working hard to be her primary attachment figure . When she cried out in the night , I wanted her to call for Mommy , not Daddy . I recognized my desire was based on my gender , and I appreciated the irony of this . Nevertheless , I had internalized the values of my culture , and my own scholarship could not help me override this . I comforted myself that attitudes would change over time . After all , the women ' s movement was still relatively young , and I was mothering during the height of the Mommy Wars .
