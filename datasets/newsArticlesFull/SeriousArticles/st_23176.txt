( PT ) : I beg to differ : there was a grand vision . We had five year development plans since 1970 , but people learn from their experience and , of course , whatever mistakes were done in the 70s and 80s we are overcoming them . We also have a much better educated population now then we did then . We are less dependent , if you like , on inexperience then we were in those times . There are people now in charge of doing things , whether in the private sector or in government , that not only have better education , but they ' ve also had 30 years experience in development projects .
