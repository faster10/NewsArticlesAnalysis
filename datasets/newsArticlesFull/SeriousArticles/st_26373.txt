The three bridesmaids end up tearing Becky ' s humongous wedding dress asunder , and so they go out on the town , dragging the increasingly sorry garment around with them , trying to find a way to repair it even as it ' s assaulted by various bodily fluids . " Bachelorette " is expertly shot and paced , with a script that ' s as cutting as a serrated knife . It was written by its director , Leslye Headland ( who based it on her Off Broadway play ) , and her dialogue has a nasty misanthropic zing that ups the ante on " Mean Girls " and " Heathers . " Each of the trio has a guy she ' s passively pursuing ( they ' re played by James Marsden , Kyle Bornheimer , and the always droll Adam Scott ) , and the encounters with them are funny in a merciless , this is a woman ' s brain on drugs sort of way . There ' s a rush in seeing actresses this charming take on characters who are this disagreeable . Yet if " Bachelorette " takes the form of a romantic ensemble comedy , it ' s purged of any true romantic feeling . You ' ll laugh , maybe a lot , but you won ' t feel great about it in the morning .
