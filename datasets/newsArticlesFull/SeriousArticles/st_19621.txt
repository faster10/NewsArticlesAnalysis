I was just as surprised and caught off guard like everybody , James said . It s unfortunate what happened yesterday , and as a team we just have to focus on what s now , what s now in front of us with the coach that we have now and we ve got to continue to get better . He ( Griffin ) was right on everything that he said . Obviously , he sees it from the outside and the inside looking in . He s around us every day and he felt like as good as we can be we weren t reaching the potential to this point .
