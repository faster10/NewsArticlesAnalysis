We hear from women such as Ariel of Ridgewood , New Jersey , a 23 year old who wrote to us to say that she just married " the love of my life " and plans to have children one day when she and her new husband are ready . They both have " piles of student loans " to pay first , and she can barely afford birth control if it weren ' t covered . Ariel and others like her will suffer if this narrow group of GOP members of Congress succeed in their crusade to keep women from having access to birth control and other preventive care .
