When we reached out to the administration , the frontline press folks there were extremely aggressive and served up a bunch of garbage we later confirmed to be garbage . But when we approached administration officials higher up the chain , ? they told us what was actually happening . They told us that reporters for The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal were withholding details of the talks as well , though neither knew of Foster , whose identity we never revealed to the government . They did not put hard pressure on us to hold our story , but instead calmly laid out their analysis of the possible consequences of publishing , and offered confidence that the talks were moving forward and headed toward a resolution . Several times over the course of the past few weeks , it looked like a deal could be struck any moment , but it wouldn ' t come together and timing would be pushed forward .
