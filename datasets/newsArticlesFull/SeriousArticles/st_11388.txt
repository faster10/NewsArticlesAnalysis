According to Wired , the main issue raised by the report relates to a concept known as accretion of risk , which can cause a situation to become significantly more dangerous due to a breakdown in communication or inadequate concern over multiple small risk factors . The example given by Wired involves a short road trip , where the driver notices that the tires are worn , but assumes that won t be a problem , as the vehicle is equipped with a spare . At the same time , one of the passengers notices the spare tire is flat while packing , but doesn t say anything as they assume the other tires to be in good condition .
