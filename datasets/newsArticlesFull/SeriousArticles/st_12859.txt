The secondary also did its part , intercepting Brady once in the first half and again on the game deciding two point conversion ( though that doesn ' t count as an official interception linebacker Von Miller also intercepted Brady in the first half ) . And while Rob Gronkowski finished with eight catches for 144 yards , Julian Edelman ( seven catches , 53 yards ) and Danny Amendola ( five catches , 39 yards ) were contained , and Brandon LaFell s didn ' t register a target , much less a reception .
