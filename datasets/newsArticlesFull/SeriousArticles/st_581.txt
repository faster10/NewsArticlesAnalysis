But I also think there ' s something to be said for having those tough conversations with people . If someone at work says something problematic , that might not be the right arena to shout from the rooftops , but a more successful approach might be more important to take them to coffee or send them an email in order to create a safe space for them to learn , especially if your goal is to make sure that they ' re educated because it ' s someone you like or respect . If it doesn ' t work , you have to decide if this is more important to put time into . Unfortunately , I think it gets easier to deal with as you have a little more practice .
