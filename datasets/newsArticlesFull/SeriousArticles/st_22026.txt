Before we get to the big choice , let us deal with some of the lesser dilemmas facing world leaders . For Europe , one is whether to persist with the idealism of a continent sans frontiers . I don t think it can survive the challenge of dealing with this kind of menace at this level of intensity . France has declared that it will maintain border controls until the terrorist threat is over , a day that is a long way into the future . The pressure to take that stance increased when it emerged that the Belgian jihadi suspected of being the ring leader of the Paris attacks had travelled into and through the EU from Syria at least twice this year . The Schengen agreement , already under incredible strain from the refugee and migration crisis , is surely history . It is moot how much safer Europeans will be for the reintroduction of internal border controls , but when asked to choose between open frontiers and being offered some potential additional protection from the form of urban guerrilla warfare inflicted on Paris , Europe s voters are going to choose security . That will not , as some have had it , be the end of Europe . It will be the demise , and a sad one , of a dream , a dream born in a more peaceful period that subsequent events have made look naive .
