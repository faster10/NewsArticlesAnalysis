This is an appealing story for conservatives with long memories , for multiple reasons . It ' s not because their concern for women is so profound , and it ' s not because they ' ve made a careful strategic assessment that this issue is likely to significantly wound Hillary Clinton ' s presidential bid ( it probably won ' t ) . What raising this issue does is allow them to fight that old battle again , to say that when they were mocked for their Clinton Derangement Syndrome , they were right all along and Bill Clinton was worse than everyone thought . And unlike things like Hillary ' s emails or Benghazi , it allows them to wage a frontal assault on both Clintons at the same time .
