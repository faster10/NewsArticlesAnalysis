The Berkshires . The name conjures up flannel clad weekends spent antiquing and cross country skiing . And there ' s no better place to serve as your home base than this 380 acre resort that was once the Wyndhurst Mansion , built in 1894 for John W . Sloane , a relative of the Vanderbilts and owner of the furnishings house W . J . Sloane . Sloane commissioned premier architecture firm Peabody Sterns to design the " cottage " itself ( cottages at that time were defined as secondary residences with a minimum of 30 rooms and 20 acres ) , and put Frederick Olmstead , the landscape architect behind Central Park , in charge of the gardens .
