Idleman says that there s nothing really obviously different about Kabany s case and the Berwick case , and that even if a labor commissioner rules in their favor , they are prepared for Uber to appeal ? and Kabany is prepared not to see the 15 , 000 he is seeking for quite some time , if ever . The reality is that Uber has treated all their drivers the same , he says , though Uber has disputed that assertion in a class action suit that is still pending and could determine the status of more than 100 , 000 drivers in California .
