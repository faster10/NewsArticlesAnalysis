Yes , Miami again . The Hurricanes were poised for another perfect season . They were a unanimous No . 1 choice riding a 34 game winning streak . Ohio State also was unbeaten , ranked No . 2 , but appeared to be no match for the speedy Canes . The Buckeyes were 11 1 2 point underdogs . Led by freshman running back Maurice Clarett , though , Ohio State outplayed Miami for much of the game . But it was a still debated pass interference call in overtime that allowed the Buckeyes another chance , and they won 31 24 in double OT . With his team down 24 17 and facing fourth down in OT , Craig Krenzel ' s pass into the end zone was called incomplete by one official , but another ruled interference against Miami . Ohio State then tied it , and won it in the second OT for its first national crown in 34 years .
