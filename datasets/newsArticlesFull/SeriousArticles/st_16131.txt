It ' s been a long time since " Idol " discovered a true star . Not since Season 7 ' s David Cook has an " Idol " artist sold a million albums ( though Season 8 runner up Adam Lambert has done reasonably well ) , and Season 10 winner Scotty McCreery seems unlikely to buck the trend . And while " The Voice ' s " Javier Colon has received plenty of critical kudos , " The Voice " finale was actually one of the lower rated episodes of the season . It could be argued that the public appetite for music competition pop stars has already been sated .
