The album s most surprising step is Same Ol Mistakes , a pretty much note for note cover of the Australian psych rock band Tame Impala s New Person , Same Old Mistakes . It typifies what s at once intriguing and yet slightly dissatisfying about ANTI . It s a kick to learn that Rihanna is clued in and enough of a music nerd to be into an indie band like Tame Impala . But her 6 and a half minute version of the song drags on , and feels oddly impersonal . It doesn t tell us anything new about the song , or Rihanna . ? ? ? ?
