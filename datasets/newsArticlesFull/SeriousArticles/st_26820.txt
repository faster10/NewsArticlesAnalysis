That was a hell of a game . The terrible officiating was on full display though . Ticky tack calls on both sides , game changing calls . The refs should never have that much impact on a game , it s getting absurd . They threw one flag for illegal contact or something almost a full minute after the play was over for a penalty that supposedly occurred prior to the pass , that s unacceptable . No surprise they didn t call out a player , just a general penalty that the announcers had trouble figuring out who it was called on . Piss poor .
