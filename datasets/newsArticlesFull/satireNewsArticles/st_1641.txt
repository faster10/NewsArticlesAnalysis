" It was really weird , " said Jessica Lurman , 14 , of Savannah , GA . " The ants were , like , really careful to put all the dead ants in this one big grave until there were , like , only four left . Then , the next morning , three of the four were lying with the others in the big pile , and the last one was dead over by the plastic farmhouse thingy . It must ' ve died right after it buried the second to last ant . "
