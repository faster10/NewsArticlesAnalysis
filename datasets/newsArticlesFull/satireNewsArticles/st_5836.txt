W tness is not the first Christian rock act to be accused of ass kicking . In the ' 80s , the soaring power ballads and monster riffs of Stryper were condemned as kick ass by many parents ' groups , eventually leading to the band ' s decision to drop Christianity from its image in 1990 . The Rez Band ' s " When The Love Comes Down " was also widely criticized within Christian circles for its blues based power chords , though the charges were eventually dropped .
