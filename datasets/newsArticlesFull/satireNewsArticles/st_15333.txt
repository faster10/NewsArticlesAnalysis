" It ' s good to have a man sometimes around someone who can reach a box of taco shells on the top shelf , " Wyatt said . " Even though he pretty much never gets up to reach anything except for that goddamn remote , it ' s still nice knowing that he could reach up high if he wanted to . I feel like , with Trey here , we finally got a real family like everybody else . And if he does run off every now and again , well , that ' s what dads do . "
