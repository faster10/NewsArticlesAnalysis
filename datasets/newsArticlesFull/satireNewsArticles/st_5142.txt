ESPN basketball analyst Bruce Bowen , discussing Anthony ' s remarks on Wednesday night ' s SportsCenter , was sympathetic to player frustrations , but said the answer was to make the call more often , not less . While Bowen acknowledged that referees seem to let the call slide more often than not , he was quick to point out that Anthony clearly took an extra step into the glowing energy portal just minutes after he stepped out of it to speak to himself . In addition , Bowen said these actions were messing with the integrity of both the game and the fourth dimension , and will ultimately have unpredictable far reaching implications on more than just player morale .
