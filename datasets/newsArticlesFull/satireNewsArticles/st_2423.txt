" I used to read a lot more magazines , " Kaiser said , " but once you ' ve read a good book , magazines don ' t quite cut it . I like Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone as much as the next guy , but they just don ' t have the depth of , say , Entertainment Weekly ' s 1999 Year In Movies or The Rolling Stone Record Guide .
