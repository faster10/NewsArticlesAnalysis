" The Marshall Field ' s at University Park doesn ' t always carry the Hugo Boss shirts I like , " Rafalski said . " So , every so often , I like to take a little trip down to Fort Wayne . I know that sounds crazy , but , believe me , when a potential home buyer is on the fence , the right shirt can turn an ' I ' ll pass ' into an ' I ' ll take it . ' "
