If elections indeed occurred , no offices appear to have changed hands . According to the FEAC report , the U . S . president , state governors , and congressional representatives are still in office , and many of the local incumbents who were supposedly running for re election still occupy their seats . The FEAC speculates that some may have lost to members of their own party , but will remain in office for the duration of their terms .
