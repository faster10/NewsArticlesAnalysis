Glick was one of the least distinguished members of Monroe High ' s Class of 1998 . Too timid to rebel and not confident enough to be well liked , Glick was at least noticed long enough to occasionally be mocked . Once known by such names as " Glicklicker " and " Suck My Glick , " he said he is now more likely to be referred to as " the guy in payroll . No , the shorter one . "
