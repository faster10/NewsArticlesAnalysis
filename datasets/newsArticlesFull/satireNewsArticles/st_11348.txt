Among the other Tiger players fired by Steinbrenner are Carlos Guillen , the Tigers shortstop who batted a " disappointing . 571 " during the series outfielder Curtis Granderson , who hit two home runs and had five RBI in what Steinbrenner called " an abysmal performance " and pitchers Kenny Rogers and Jeremy Bonderman , who " cost the Yankees the series " with back to back outings in which they recorded a combined 12 strikeouts and gave up just two runs .
