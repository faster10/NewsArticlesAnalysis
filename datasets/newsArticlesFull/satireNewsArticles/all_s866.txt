BBC lose Operation Yewtree franchise to Sky
\n In a day of frantic bidding, Sky has won exclusive rights to Operation Yewtree raids, wresting control from the BBC. The move has won especial approval from the South Yorkshire Police Commissioner, who stated that his officers ‘were looking forward to working closely with Sky.’ In a separate statement officers from Operation Yewtree praised the BBC for its ‘unstinting professionalism’ and insisted that most Yewtree officers would ‘probably continue to purchase a TV Licence.’ Sir Cliff Richard praised the move. ‘Although I’ve had nothing but respect for the BBC regarding their Wimbledon coverage, they’ve been hopelessly out of their depth on this project. I can’t wait for Sky to cover the return of South Yorkshire police to my various homes, and hopefully we can issue my films, concerts and home raids as a box set for Sky customers.’\n
