Romney’s Binder Calls Lohan a ‘Fugly Slut’
A leaked copy of U.S. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's "binder of women" reveals that he thinks actress and celebrity train wreck Lindsay Lohan is a 'fugly slut". The revelation is surprising because Lohan is a well-known Romney supporter, telling E! News just three days ago that she will vote for the Republican due to his unemployment plan. The binder came to light during the second presidential debate, in which Romney argued he was a staunch feminist because he used "binders full of women" to hire his cabinet as governor of Massachusetts. Following the debate a female staffer leaked a copy of one such binder to a local newspaper, and it was revealed to be nothing more than a celebrity burn book. Boo You Whore... In addition to Lohan, the binder goes after Rachel McAdams, calling her "an overrated, overweight Canadian princess with the acting skill of a blind chimpanzee." The binder also calls conservative Clueless actress Stacy Dash "so buggin'' and ultra-liberal Alicia Silverstone a "fat vegan whore." Aditionally, it says Superbad's Emma Stone and Twilight's Kristen Stewart both made out with Seth Rogan in the projection room above the auditorium. Asked about the controversy on CNN Romney simply replied: "I don't think my father - the CEO of American Motors - would be happy that people are talking about this."
