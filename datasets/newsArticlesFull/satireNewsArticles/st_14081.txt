" You look at how a lot of teams these days are built around a high powered passing game , and you look at Jaguars quarterback Blaine Gabbert , and you realize how important it is for us to have a great punter in our arsenal , " Mularkey said . " After all , we punted third most of any team in the league last year , so it ' s about time we started getting good at it . In fact , at this point , we may as well just resign ourselves to building our entire team concept around the idea of pinning other teams deep with a really good punt . "
