" Although money is often tight right before a large aid check is due , countries must resist the urge to splurge , " Roush added . " If you live off money that doesn ' t exist yet , you have to pay the piper at some point . Resist the temptation . The key is to create a budget for yourself and stick to it . Save money by eating your own crops , instead of imports , and make sure your coal plants are running as efficiently as possible . "
