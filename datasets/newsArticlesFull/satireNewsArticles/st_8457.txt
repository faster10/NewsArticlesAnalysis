" This cannot last , " said Bruce Arena , coach of the U . S . World Cup team and by extension effectively the second most powerful man in America , in an address televised simultaneously on every national channel Wednesday night . " We cannot have crops unharvested in the fields , the doors of our churches sealed shut , the Stars and Stripes fixed at half mast , all because of our dishonorable standard of play . We cannot ask you to forgive our loss to the Czechs , as that must be left to the wisdom of the God of our fathers . We have always been a nation blessed with strength , not only in our love for our soccer teams , but in our love for one another , and we must call on both now if we are to endure these dark days . "
