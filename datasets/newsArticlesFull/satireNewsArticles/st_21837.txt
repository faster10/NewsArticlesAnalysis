Oprah ' s Contraceptive Club is being promoted not only on episodes of her show , but also on a series of 30 second tie in ads featuring various housewives dancing around their living rooms to uptempo Motown music and giving the " thumbs up " sign while repeating the catchphrases " I ' m Not Pregnant For The First Time , And It Feels Great ! " and " Contraception Is A Oprah K ! "
