" I already belong to a health club , a church , and the Kiwanis Club , " Tammy Golden of Los Angeles wrote . " I ' m a member of the Von ' s Grocery Super Savers , which gets me a discount on certain groceries . These are all well managed organizations with real benefits . None of them send me a confusing bill once a year and make me work it out myself , then throw me in jail if I get it wrong . "
