In July 1996 , Panovich and his wife Claire were visiting the zoo with their then preschool age children when several zoo employees believed they had spotted a loose giraffe wandering near the baboon exhibit . Quickly cordoning off the area , they lassoed Panovich , tranquilized him , and placed him in the giraffe pen . Although it was discovered a few days later that the zoo had one more giraffe than usual , no owner stepped forward to claim Panovich , and a decision was made to keep him .
