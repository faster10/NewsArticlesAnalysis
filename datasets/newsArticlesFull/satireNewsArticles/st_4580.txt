Continued Bush : " We pretty much have a 3 4 record in terms of important wars , and that ' s being generous , because I ' m counting the Civil War as a victory . We got absolutely killed in Vietnam , which was another war where the leadership at home did a fine job , only to be let down by the troops . Not quite sure what happened in Korea . And I thought we won the first Gulf War , but apparently we didn ' t , because we ' re still there . "
