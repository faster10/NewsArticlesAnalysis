" My family ' s been suffering ever since I lost my job at the screen door factory , and I haven ' t seen a doctor for well on four years now , " said father of four Buddy Kaldrin of Eerie , CO . " Shit , I don ' t even remember what a dentist ' s chair looks like . . . Basically , I ' d give up if it weren ' t for God ' s grace . So it ' s good to know we have a president who cares about religion , too . "
