" McGrew cuffed me to a desk , clubbed me in the face with a broom handle , and screamed that my ' spic ' buddies on the street couldn ' t help me now , " Hernandez said . " He let me sit there for an hour . Then West came in and removed the handcuffs . He got me a Pepsi and some Twinkies , and while I ate them , he explained , in a caring and sensitive way , why I really ought to cooperate . He said he ' d do everything he could do to help me , but that I had to face the fact that I was a no good taco bender from the barrio with five chicken babies , two priors , and only one real option : to talk .
