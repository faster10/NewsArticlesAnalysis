" There are a lot of ecosystems that are long gone , but it should be noted that there are also a few that have somehow managed to make it this far , so it ' s important for everyone to do their part to help ensure those remaining parts of nature continue to survive , " McCarthy said . " For example , if you come across any plants in your community or maybe some squirrels or a bird of some kind , we ask that you not kill or destroy them . And both individuals and industries should try to avoid putting garbage and chemical runoff into lakes and ponds . You see , a few fish could still be living in those waters , so doing that might kill them , which is actually the opposite of what we ' re trying to do . So if everyone could just try to rein in that kind of behavior if you can , it would really help us out . "
