" One big problem was the empty stomach , " said Van Duyne , holding his head and taking deep breaths . " I really should know by now to make sure to eat a piece of pizza or some french fries or something before doing any drinking . That kind of greasy , high carb stuff works best , I find , because it really soaks up the alcohol . Another thing I neglected to do was drink a lot of water . That ' s key . Also , I forgot to take my usual two aspirins before going to bed , which helps a lot . "
