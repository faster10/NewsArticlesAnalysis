" There have just been so many times he ' s lost hope over the years , " Wasserbaum said . " There was the night of his senior prom , when his date and then best friend drunkenly made out in front of dozens of classmates before openly mocking him in a group sing along along with the rest of the senior class . This is just one of a lifetime of incidents . There was the time his recently discovered biological mother , for whom he had searched for years , told him , ' I have no son ' at her own wedding , the first time they met . And one can safely assume that his rejection as ' unsuitable for conversion ' by a pair of Mormon missionaries he attempted to befriend after they randomly knocked on his door must have cost him a significant amount of what precious little hope he had left . But this latest loss is one not even he could have anticipated , as he was unaware that he had any hope remaining at all . "
