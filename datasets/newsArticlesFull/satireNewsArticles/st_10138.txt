" Brandon is a great kid , and he gets good grades , but when I see him fritter away his allowance on Big Macs and rap CDs , I get a little upset , " Raschi said . " When I was his age , every dollar I earned went toward food for my brothers and sisters , or paying the electric bill . I didn ' t get to spend it on a Game Cube . I mean , those games look pretty fun , but damn if I ever get to play them . "
