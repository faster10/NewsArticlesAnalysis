" The Catholics go through everything at a wedding , " God said . " There ' s a sermon and readings and even Communion . With the songs and the procession and the ' I do ' stuff thrown in there , it takes so long . And the whole time , it ' s stand , sit , kneel , stand , sing , recite , sit , stand , sing , kneel , sit . "
