" The Good Lord has , in His benevolence , led us to an important breakthrough for scientific inquiry , " Creationist Museum of Natural History curator Dr Elijah Gill said . " Our museum has many valuable and exciting exhibits that testify to Creation and shine light on the Lord ' s divine plan . But none have been as exciting or anywhere near as old as this new T . Rex specimen named ' Methuselah . ' This skeleton , which dates back to roughly 3 , 000 B . C . , offers the most compelling proof yet that the Earth was made by God roughly 10 , 000 years ago . "
