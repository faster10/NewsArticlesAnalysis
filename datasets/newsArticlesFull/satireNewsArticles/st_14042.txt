" The big problem is , I don ' t have enough tools to do what I want , " Lennek said . " I should really get myself a good circular saw , a hot glue gun , and a cordless drill . That ' ll make it way easier to follow through on all these projects . It would help if I had more time , too , but I ' m pretty busy trying to hustle for work and looking for more cool stuff . "
