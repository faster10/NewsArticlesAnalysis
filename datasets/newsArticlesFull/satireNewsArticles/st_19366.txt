" True , I have some pictures , " Mirrin said . " But they were taken a year ago , and from what Maggie tells me , David ' s hair is shorter now , and the little tyke ' s been growing like a weed . Sadly , I can neither confirm nor deny these statements because I have no photographic evidence . Maggie says she ' ll send the boys ' new school pictures , but would it be so hard for her to take some photos this summer ? "
