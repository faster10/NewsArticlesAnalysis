" This one guy tried to beat me by asking Hammerhead ' s real name . Can you believe it ? As if I ' d never read Tales From The Mos Eisley Cantina , even if I wasn ' t into the role playing game . I knew he was a rube when he asked that , so I went in for the kill by asking him the name of the Rodian in the Star Wars Holiday Special . "
