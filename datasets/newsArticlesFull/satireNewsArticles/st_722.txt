" This is so amazing , " said Amanda Lakewood , a tax code accountant who traveled all the way from Merced , CA , to be part of the Times Square festivities . " When we ' re all here together , it doesn ' t matter if you work in budget analysis , auditing , or management accounting . It doesn ' t matter if you work for the government , a privately held corporation , or a public accounting firm . When we ' re together here like this , we ' re all just accountants , every one of us . Happy Fiscal New Year ! "
