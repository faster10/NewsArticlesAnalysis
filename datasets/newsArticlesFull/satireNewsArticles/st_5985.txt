" Given the unconscionably bad environmental state of the area in and around the site of the 2008 Summer Games , we cannot in good conscience allow Chinese athletes to compete in China , " said Olympic committee spokesman Sun Weide . " We deeply apologize to China for the bitter disappointment they will feel at not being represented in these Games . However , we place the blame squarely on China for their failure to prepare a suitable venue for international competition . "
