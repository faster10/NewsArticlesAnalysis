" It ' s the little things you never think about that I missed most , " Leffler said . " Having a beer for lunch . Taking in a ball game whenever I wanted . Getting into a car with a couple of buddies and driving off for a few days with nowhere special to go . Hanging out all afternoon in a bar . You don ' t realize how much these things mean until the Marines don ' t let you do them . "
