According to psychologists , frequent and serious sexual harassment is crucial to the proper development of a teenage boy ' s self esteem . " A young boy needs to feel sexually desirable , especially on the job , " noted therapist Dr Eli Wasserbaum said . " It can be very damaging to his still forming social psyche if he senses he is unwanted by female employees . A grope from a female co worker can do wonders during this extremely important stage of sexual development . "
