" Hoagizine is a powerfully delicious sandwich , " said Dr Erin O ' Malley , chief nutritionist at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles . " And there ' s the problem : It ' s overkill . Commercially available , high quality sandwiches are delicious enough for 95 percent of the patients I see . Additionally , those patients who do actually require the extra zest and deliciousness of this medical grade melt run the risk of becoming addicted to its scrumptious flavor . I consider the sandwich to be an emergency lunch option , for use only when everything on the menu looks so blah that it threatens to ruin your entire day . "
