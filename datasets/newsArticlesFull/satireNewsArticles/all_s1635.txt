Siberian virus not at all like 'The Thing' say weirdly glassy-eyed scientists
AN ANCIENT virus found beneath the Siberian permafrost cannot infect and control humans, according to scientists with odd monotone voices. Researchers at a remote research base said the virus, which had been dormant in the ice for thousands of years, is not a threat and definitely nothing like the shape-shifting evil in John Carpenter’s horror film The Thing. Ice station scientist Stephen Malley said: “Do not be concerned. All is well here and will remain well. “The virus will not harm you or make you a helpless, puppet host organism. “We are having fun here and doing normal human things. “We look forward to seeing our families and learning more about their technology.”
