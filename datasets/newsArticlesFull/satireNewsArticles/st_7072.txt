" You can never predict how they ' re going to go , " said Sen . John Kerry ( D MA ) , noting that even the Duck Protection Act of 1984 resulted in 4 , 100 ducks exploding over Chesapeake Bay . " We passed an FAA bill in 1998 that led to 80 , 234 ducks flying into jet engines , which kind of makes sense , I suppose . But then in 2000 , we voted to approve a day of recognition for Hank Aaron , and 3 , 823 ducks had strokes . Whatever the case , it was nice to leave work this time without getting hit by a plunging duck . "
