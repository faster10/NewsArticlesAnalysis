" The average motorist traveling a clogged American highway produces hundreds of kilowatt hours of negative energy per infuriating drive . The Instigator motor converts this emotional energy into kinetic energy by a process most drivers people too goddamn stupid to use their goddamn blinkers when they change goddamn lanes will never be able to understand . Just trust me , dumbasses , it works . "
