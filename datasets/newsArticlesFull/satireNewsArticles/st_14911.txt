" You have to understand in the high pressure world of competitive cycling , it ' s all about getting any advantage you can , " Armstrong said . " And if we were being realistic , we ' d have to admit that everyone in cycling was trying to get an advantage . So , in a way , if we were all trying to get the same advantage , then the playing field was still completely equal . So I was still the best . It makes sense when you look at it that way . And nothing I am about to tell you changes that . So , when I ' m finished saying what I have to say , you all have to promise to still adore me . "
