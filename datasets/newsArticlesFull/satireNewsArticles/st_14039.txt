" I was on my way home when I cut down an alley , " Lennek said . " I found this bizarre door with all these pages from a Reader ' s Digest condensed book pasted on it , and each page had a picture drawn on it . I took it , planning to make it a living room table . I thought we could use that instead of the Dukes Of Hazzard TV trays I found last October , but then I changed my mind . "
