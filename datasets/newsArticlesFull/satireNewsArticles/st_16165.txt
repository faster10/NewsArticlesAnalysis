Most striking is Assmas , Tashen ' s annual spring festival celebrating Holdger ' s ass . As Tashen resident Vic Henshaw described it , " Assmas is exactly like Christmas , except instead of trimming a tree , we trim Holdger ' s ass . Instead of reveling in the glory of Jesus and the spirit of Christianity , we revel in the glory of Holdger ' s ass and the spirit of Holdger ' s ass . It ' s almost identical . "
