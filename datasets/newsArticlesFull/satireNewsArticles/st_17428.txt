Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki , noting that the returning super soldiers will have no trouble whatsoever relating to people who haven ' t seen what they ' ve seen . " Now , we can use these bionic troops on the battlefield to whatever extent we require , send them back to their hometowns , and never have to worry about providing them with costly medical treatment and counseling .
