" We ' ve seen a lot of interceptions tonight , " Marino said in conclusion as another painstakingly edited Favre interception montage , the ninth and last in the program , played behind him . " Were all of them were his fault ? Maybe not it ' s not for us to say . Am I jealous of his record ? Maybe . I never considered myself to be all that concerned with statistics , and with my plus 168 TD to interception record , I ' ll never know what it ' s like to be " Mr 278 , " the all time interception king . Because the man who holds that record , perhaps forever , is Brett Favre . "
