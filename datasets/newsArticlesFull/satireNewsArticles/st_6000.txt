" Politicians are completely out of touch with those Americans who are completely out of touch with politics , " Fisher said . " Why is Congress always debating foreign policy and tariffs and social security and stuff ? How can they claim to represent the views of the people when the people don ' t know anything about all that legislative nonsense ? The CUA represents the views and beliefs of those Americans who care the least . "
