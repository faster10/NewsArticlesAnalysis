Police are taking a wait and see attitude . " I ' m just saying , he ' d better do something different this time if he wants to get our attention , " officer Russell Davison said . " I don ' t care how many people he kills , it ' s got to be original . All the great killers have a hook . They don ' t just stand up on some roof and shoot , even if it ' s hundreds of innocent civilians . God , that ' s boring . "
