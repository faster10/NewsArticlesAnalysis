Potter said the Zipcarp rental process consists of three simple steps : First , customers visit Zipcarp . com and apply for membership . Second , they receive their CarpCard in the mail , with which they can book their fish online or by phone , choosing their preferred carp habitat and species . And lastly , Zipcarp clients show up at their nearest Zipcarp rental station and pick up their fish , which they will return to the exact same spot at the end of their reservation .
