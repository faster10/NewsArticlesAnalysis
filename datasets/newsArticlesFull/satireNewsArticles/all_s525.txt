Gov. Palin Calls for Obama’s “Inpeachment” in Series of Unfortunate Gaffes
Tea Party darling Sarah Palin made headlines today for an unfortunate series of what can only be described as gaffes as Ms. Palin on multiple occasions called for the “inpeachment” of President Barack Obama.  The dazed and confused former half-term Governor, failed Vice Presidential candidate and Fox News Contributor, used her time at the podium to launch beautifully crafted and entirely clichéd talking points during a whirlwind media tour condemning the President. Ms. Palin (who looked stunning as always) unloaded on Obama during the 45 minute speech citing everything from Benghazi, to the IRS scandal, to the Arab Spring, to the Anthony Weiner tweets, to Edward Snowden, High Unemployment rates, a stagnant recovery, the sequester, the downgrade in credit rating for the US, the Boston Bomber, Trayvon Martin, Drones, Obamaphones, Obamacare, the Royal Baby, fake birth certificates, control of the media, collapse of Detroit, the deficit, Fast and Furious, Sandy Hook, the NSA, being black, the Sihk bombing, RupertMurdochGate, Todd’s impotence, sale of NSA data to the Chinese, Sharia Law, the Gays, lying regarding college transcripts,  gun control, Donald Trump’s toupee, Ted Nugent’s multiple baby momma’s, Barney Franks gayness and Obama’s direct involvement in pulling of Dinesh D’Souza’s book from Costco. No word yet as to whether this unfortunate series of gaffes will have any effect on Gov. Palin’s future ambitions for failed runs at political office, or a spot as a host on “The View”.
