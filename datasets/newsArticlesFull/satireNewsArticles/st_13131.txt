Construction of the Hubble Space Kaleidoscope involved incredible technical challenges . According to NASA head engineer Nathan Howard , assembling components for the object chamber was particularly exacting , since it was necessary to create baubles that would still remain pretty despite the harsh environment of space . The project also faced controversy over fears that the device would be unable to record the continuously changing symmetrical forms of solar masses , after early calculations predicted that the 898 million in trinkets would not tumble properly in a zero gravity environment .
