" A tugboat is a natural choice for this type of pretend play , " said Brent Scowcroft , former National Security Advisor under President Reagan . " A boat is shaped somewhat like a piece of soap . And , like soap , a boat possesses the ability to float . And , finally , in a bathtub type environment , there is naturally going to be water . So , to maximize both realism and imaginary possibilities , it ' s best to turn the soap into something that would be in water . "
