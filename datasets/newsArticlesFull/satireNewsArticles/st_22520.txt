Manning claimed to have mentioned several previous clipboard mishandling incidents to Sorgi prior to the on field confrontation , including times when Sorgi held only the bottom left corner of the clipboard " as if he didn ' t care if he dropped it " when he caught Sorgi gripping the clipboard with two hands , but loosely and " as if he was just going through the motions " and when he saw Sorgi standing on the sidelines trying to spin the clipboard on his index finger , an action Manning called disrespectful to both the team and the game of football .
