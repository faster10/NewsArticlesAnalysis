" Karen was so excited about her business , " Gerber said . " I couldn ' t help but get caught up in it . I asked her if I could do anything for her , and she told me that she needed help designing a web site . I was happy to help . Most businesses go under within a year , so she needs a professional web site to give her business an edge . "
