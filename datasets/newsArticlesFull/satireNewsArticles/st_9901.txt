Fossilization , the report said , represents America ' s best method for converting organic plant and animal remnants into exploitable chemical energy sources via the pressure of miles of layers of rock over millions of years . Describing the fossilization process as " virtually free , except for digging , pumping , processing , storage , by product disposal and shipping costs , " the report stressed the importance of maintaining a high overall fossil yield to the long term reliability and availability of chemical energy sources .
