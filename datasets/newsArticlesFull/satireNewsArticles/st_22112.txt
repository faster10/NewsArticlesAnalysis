" As they recited the Apostles ' Creed , I remember thinking of all the things I want to do , but don ' t because of my devotion to the Church , " said Antonio Valez , a Catholic from Mexico City . " As soon as I heard the pope was laid to rest , I said a prayer for the Holy Father ' s departed soul and went straight out and bought a box of condoms . Actually , I ' m wearing one right now . It ' s been on all day and I ' m loving it . "
