" I ' m sitting down to dinner , and I get a phone call asking if ' Congress knows they ' ve got weapons of mass destruction , ' " Cheney said . " I told him yes , and to settle down . Later that night it must have been midnight the secured line rings . I leap out of bed , thinking something awful has happened . It ' s George , saying that he can ' t sleep thinking about how right at this very minute , Saddam is manufacturing more weapons of mass destruction , and we ' re sitting here doing nothing . "
