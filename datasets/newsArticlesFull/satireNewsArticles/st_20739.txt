" I was a mess before Jesus took my hand , " Banks said . " At South Carolina , I ' d show up late to practice , stay out late running around with the wrong crowd , all kinds of bad things . I was about to squander the precious gift of football God blessed me with . But through His grace , I was drafted in the fourth round and sent to the NFL to meet Rev . Fryar , who showed me that Jesus wanted me to glorify Him and play on His team . "
