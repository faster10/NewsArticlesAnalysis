" I won ' t throw in the towel until the last Burger King is gone , " Tarsley said . " I will fight this fight wherever it is being fought , whether it ' s on the airwaves , the national news , or in the parking lots of the restaurants themselves . I will not let Burger King go the way of Sambo ' s and Kenny Rogers Roasters . "
