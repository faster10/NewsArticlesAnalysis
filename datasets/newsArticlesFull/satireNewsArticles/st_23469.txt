Another recent abduction involved Martin Eisner of Valdosta , GA , who was accosted in June by several men whom eyewitnesses described only as " shrill . " Thirty six hours after his disappearance , Eisner was found with his sleeves pushed slightly up and his shirt half tucked . Reclining in a brand new , knockoff Eames chair , Eisner was largely unresponsive , saying only , " Why does my wall have two colors now ? "
