According to the U . S . Drug Enforcement Administration , the violence was sparked by a botched drug deal involving an estimated 20 kilograms of marijuana , a dispute that led low level members of the Sinaloa cartel to open fire on local dealers in Culiac n . Within seconds , the gunfire had spread to Chihuahua , Michoac n , Yucat n , and , minutes later , the other 27 Mexican states , leaving every person in Mexico dead .
