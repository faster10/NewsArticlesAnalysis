COLORADO SPRINGS , CO After a long training season during which team members ' performance was carefully monitored and fine tuned with the Olympics in mind , U . S . Olympic snowboarding coach Peter Foley said his athletes ' urine should be more than competitive with that of any other nation in the world . " It ' s taken months of hard work , and in some ways we were forced to play against our strengths and deviate from the techniques that got us here , but I ' d say our team ' s urine is as clear and pure as possible , " said Foley , who attributed the team ' s urine ' s success to " nothing more than the athletic virtues of discipline , hard work , and self denial . " " We ' re ready to face up to any test the Europeans can throw at us in Turin . " Although team members declined to speak to the press on urine related matters , several were overheard saying their urine could not be expected to maintain its present level of conditioning for more than 15 minutes after the closing ceremonies .
