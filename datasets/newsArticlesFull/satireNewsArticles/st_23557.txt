" Clay , as everyone knows , punishes the over precise player and brings a player ' s instinct into play , " said Nadal , sprawling into a clay formed chaise lounge and dipping a handful of clay from a nearby earthen bowl . " This instinct for how the serve will move , how the volley will progress , even how the break point must be played this instinct cannot be taught , only shaped as by the potter ' s hand . And one shapes his instinct by constant communion with that most plastic and moldable of earths . "
