" The first three questions are pretty easy , " said high school senior Brent Gerson , referring to the portion of the test in which students are asked to give the first letter of the quarterback ' s first name , then the second , and finally the third . " The last 14 questions about the last name are pretty hard . There is no letter bank or anything , and it ' s graded on full completion . But if you remember what you worked on for the last six years , and the student sitting in front of you remembers to wear his Roethlisberger jersey , you should be fine . "
