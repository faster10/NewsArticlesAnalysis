" I can ' t deny that cancer got a piece of me last time , " Armstrong said . " A big piece of me . I think about it every day . But once I got done with cancer , it was nowhere to be found . It disappeared . Well , cancer , you know where to find me . I can beat you again in six no , in three months . "
