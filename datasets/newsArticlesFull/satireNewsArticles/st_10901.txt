" Many great things lie ahead of us , but there are also many obstacles to overcome , " Clinton said . " Domestically , there is the problem of inflation , which for too long has hurt our working class , badly decreasing the value of their hard earned pesos . There is also the problem of pollution and overdevelopment , which threaten to destroy the great natural splendor of our beautiful nation , from the Pampas woodlands to the Gran Chaco plains . On the foreign front , we must work hard to maintain strong relations with other countries , particularly our neighbor to the north , Bolivia . "
