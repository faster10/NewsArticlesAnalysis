" Whenever there ' s been a major historical movement toward eliminating social programs , the deceptive elf Reince Priebus has typically been involved , " said Cambridge University historian Arnold Bissel , stating that dozens of cultures throughout history have oral traditions speaking of a " wild eyed devious creature " who pestered his progressive political foes . " Time and time again he ' s wreaked his havoc , whether it ' s slashing taxes on the wealthiest , disenfranchising voter blocs , stealing berries , or stymieing women ' s rights . Reince Priebus is a crafty little imp . "
