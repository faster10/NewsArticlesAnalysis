" KFC ' s claim that its fried offerings have ' that taste you ' ll just love to eat ' is in direct violation of federal regulations , " acting FCC chairman Michael Copps said . " The word ' eat ' is legally permissible only in reference to substances appropriate for human consumption . Any implication that a consumer could or should ' enjoy ' a KFC Crispy Strip fails to meet these standards , and presents an unlawful deception to consumers . "
