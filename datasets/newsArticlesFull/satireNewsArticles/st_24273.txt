" How am I supposed to teach kids about the language of film without a video projector capable of alternately flashing the words ' government ' and ' lacerate ' on the side of an abandoned foundry ? " said Eugene Hough , 62 , a high school teacher in Des Moines , IA . " It ' s disgraceful . My students want to subvert viewer expectations , but they just don ' t have the 8 millimeter black and white reel of a naked elderly woman crawling through the woods they would need to do it . We are , quite frankly , selling our children short . "
