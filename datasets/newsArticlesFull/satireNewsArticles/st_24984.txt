I ' ve tried for decades to work for the Gannett Gods , but never made the cut . I ' m not bitter . Their high standards is exactly why I yearn to work for them in the first place . I ' m happy with my career , but just once I ' d love a shot at being a Contender at being the USA Today Cartoonist .
