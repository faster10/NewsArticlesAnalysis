" UW Whitewater is the most amazing place , " said Knopecke , who has decided to attend the school in the fall . " Right in the middle of campus , there ' s this big lawn where tons of people were just hanging out together . And there was this guy on the sidewalk selling sunglasses and those Mexican poncho things . I cannot wait to get out of stupid Menomonee Falls . "
