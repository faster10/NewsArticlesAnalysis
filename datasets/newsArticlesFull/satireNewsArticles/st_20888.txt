" " The wispy whine of the female ' s voice sounded a bit like Britney Spears doing a comeback attempt the tune certainly seemed up her alley but she sounded black , so then I considered that ' Milkshake ' girl . But really , I can ' t tell . I ' d bet the guy ' s not R . Kelly , but then again , I ' ve worked in this business for 15 years and I ' m still not sure what he sounds like . "
