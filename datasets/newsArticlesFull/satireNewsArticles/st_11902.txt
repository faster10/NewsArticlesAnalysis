" After seeing yet another deranged gorilla just burst into a public place and start killing people , I decided I need to make sure something like that never happens to me , " said 34 year old Atlanta resident Nick Keller , shortly after purchasing a 350 pound mountain gorilla from his local gorilla store . " It just gives me peace of mind knowing that if I ' m ever in that situation , I won ' t have to just watch helplessly as my torso is ripped in half and my face is chewed off . I ' ll be able to use my gorilla to defend myself . "
