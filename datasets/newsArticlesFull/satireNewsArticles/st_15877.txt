Probably , " said Minnesota Vikings head coach Brad Childress , who says he has " enormous respect " for Smith ' s coaching ability and work ethic . " There will be those who look at the Super Bowl and say the same old crap they ' ve been saying forever ' See ? Black coaches can ' t coach in the rain . Black coached teams turn the ball over too much . Black coaches ' quarterbacks are overrated panicky idiots who throw the ball downfield without even looking and get picked off . ' Bunch of crap , of course . But after Sunday ' s game , it ' s going to be that much harder for him to shake that off . "
