" The people have spoken , " Bush said . " They said they want change . They said it ' s time to clean up Washington . They ' re tired of politics as usual . They ' re tired of the pursuit of self interest that has gripped Washington . They want to see an end to partisan bickering and closed door decision making . If I ' m elected , I ' ll make sure that the American people can once again place their trust in the White House . "
