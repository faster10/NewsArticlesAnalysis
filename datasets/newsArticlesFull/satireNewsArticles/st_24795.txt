" I would imagine some might think that because it ' s the 10th anniversary , we would latch on to the whole ' 10th ' aspect and blow it completely out of proportion , " MSNBC national news director Derrick Lipton said . " But we ' re smarter than that . Our viewers are smarter than that . If anything , we ' ll maybe cut back to Ground Zero when Presidents Obama and Bush leave the memorial service . And then maybe we ' ll have Tom Brokaw on to talk about what it was like covering the event 10 years ago . If we do that , we ' ll probably do commercial bumpers where we show images of the two beams of blue light shining up into the night sky , footage of Bush with his bullhorn saying , " Well , I can hear you , " and maybe something that represents the human side of the tragedy , like people tacking up pictures of their loved ones . That ' s it . But then I suppose we could also have former mayor Rudy Giuliani on because , well , I don ' t know why . He won ' t say anything he hasn ' t said before , but it just feels like we should have him on , especially if Fox has him on . We could probably fill a bunch of time with the whole anthrax thing that came afterward , maybe do an entire terrorism retrospective that would look big and flashy but add no new information whatsoever , and just rerun that over and over and over again . Maybe throw in some of that mosque stuff . And then , oh , this would be perfect , we do profiles on the families who lost their loved ones on the Pennsylvania plane . We ' ll act as if we ' re shining a light on something that ' s been ignored , but really it hasn ' t been ignored , because over the past 10 years there have been 4 , 000 similar segments done about the circumstances surrounding that flight .
