" We must have run at least 200 3D computer simulations , and there is simply no scenario in which the periscope doesn ' t at some point break off and rip an enormous hole in the command module , " said Paulo Lozano , director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ' s Space Propulsion Lab . " And unless Bradley has discovered a new form of liquid propellant I ' m unaware of , it ' s fairly obvious that with so many flames shooting from the engine , the fuel supply would be depleted within a matter of hours , leaving the craft immobilized and left to float off forever in the void of space .
