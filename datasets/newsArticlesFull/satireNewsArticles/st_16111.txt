" My friends at work have been telling me to be myself and not act so desperate , ' " Pinter said . " I don ' t need to hear that . It ' s the same old shit I heard back in high school , like when I had a huge crush on Desiree from French class , and my friend Kristin used to give me that sort of advice during her weekly pep talks . I wonder what Desiree ' s up to these days . "
