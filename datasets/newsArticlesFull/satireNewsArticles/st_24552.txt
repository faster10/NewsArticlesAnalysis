Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared to side with the conclusions of the DCS report . A regular coupon clipper with a Sam ' s Club membership , Greenspan has warned against rash disregard of coupon use for years . In a statement reacting to the report ' s findings , he said that unless Americans start becoming " smart shoppers , " families and possibly the country at large will experience a sharp economic downturn . He also called for retailers to offer more double coupon days , and for coupon issuing businesses to improve perforation standards , so coupons can be more easily separated from their promotional materials without tearing .
