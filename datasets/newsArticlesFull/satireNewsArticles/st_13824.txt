Phillippe said the first few hours can be especially critical in uncovering clues that could pinpoint a missing child ' s whereabouts , such as the footprints of a tiny gnome the child followed as it scampered into the woods , a ribbon that fell from their hair as they ventured down into a glowing well , or small patches of snow remaining in their bedroom after a blustery passageway to a wintery kingdom opened beneath their bed . The investigator added that it was vitally important that members of search parties remain alert at all times as they scoured the homes or grounds where children went missing , listening closely for the faint sound of the children ' s disembodied voices echoing softer and softer as they descended deeper into a fantastical world .
