Feingold described what he called the eateries ' three bedrock principles . " First , we will never mislead customers with pictures on our menus that make a sandwich look bigger , juicier , or more out of this world delicious than it actually is , " Feingold said .

Third , we will offer full , voluntary disclosure on the ingredients of all our dishes , including our world famous secret pancake recipe , as our customers have the right to know exactly what makes them so darn fluffy .
