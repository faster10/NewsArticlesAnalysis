" " I once made the mistake of trying to talk to him about the game , just because I was sitting next to him when Monday Night Football was on . So he says to me , ' You watch TV ? What did you think of this week ' s JSM ? The part where Elliott and Finch were razzing Maya about the overpriced imported coffee she bought online ? That was pulled straight from real life . That ' s based on my actual sister , I swear . "
