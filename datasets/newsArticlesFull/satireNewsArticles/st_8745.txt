" Thanks to Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase , the wasteland just got a little bigger , " said American Medical Association executive director Dr Gordon Puhl . " We ' re all very excited about the new drug and its potential to imprison patients even if only for a few more desperate , agonizing years in lives they can make no sense of , see no point in , and find no worthwhile purpose for . As we slowly learn to accept that our pretensions to relevance and meaning are but so many fragile , illusory constructs which crumble like sandcastles in the face of the universe ' s utter indifference to our plight , one thing is certain : Noexitoxythalynucleothylinase and other such medical advances will ensure that , for each of us , young and old alike , terminally or mildly ill , our suffering is far from over .
