" If those two last more than a year , I ' ll sell my dentures , " said Maria Van Kamp , 58 , the harpist at the reception . " I ' ve played a lot of weddings , and I can usually tell who ' s going to make it . Usually , if the groom is drunk and hitting on a bridesmaid , and the bride threatens to call off the wedding twice during the rehearsal dinner , it ' s a pretty good sign that they ' re not going the distance .
