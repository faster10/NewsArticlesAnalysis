" I was buying a hot dog from a street vendor in Hove Beach yesterday when I saw someone run a red light , barrel down the sidewalk , careen into a garbage truck , exit his vehicle , steal a nearby convertible , and drive away , " one Broker resident reported . " A nearby police car didn ' t even react . But when the car behind him nicked his fender , the officer shot the driver through the windshield and walked away . "
