" I ' ve always enjoyed sex , but our new routine of emotionlessly lumbering through intercourse , aiming for as quick a climax as possible , and then having me roll to the other side of the mattress so that Sarah can prop up her hips with a pillow in hopes that my ejaculate will stay inside her long enough to yield a fertilized ovum has opened up a whole new world of sexual ecstasy to both of us , " said Jon , 38 , noting that he never realized how uninhibited sex could be until he set his alarm clock to wake him and his wife up early in the morning so they could engage in drowsy intercourse before going into work , always making sure to forgo lubricant in order to avoid killing any sperm cells . " Just coaxing out one more paltry orgasm , knowing that if I fail to impregnate her this time we ' ll have to wait another three weeks before making another attempt , makes me feel like a caged animal in heat . It ' s really spiced things up , to say the least . "
