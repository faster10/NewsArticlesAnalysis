" My fellow citizens , I stand here today to tell you that , if given a second term , I have very big plans for our nation ' s future , " Obama said during a rally at Chicago ' s Navy Pier . " Ambitious , forward thinking plans I will have to drastically scale down based on opinion polls , budget considerations , and political roadblocks , but , you know , I ' ll see what I can do . No promises , though . "
