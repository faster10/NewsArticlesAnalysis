" It ' s that time of year again when we roll up our sleeves and begin the painstaking task of resplendoring our parks , " Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said . " After a long off season , the foliage has grown lackluster , our mountain streams have lost their crystal clarity , and even the sparrows ' songs are flat and desultory . So please excuse the noise and dust as we prepare our country ' s scenic wonders for their grand reopening on Memorial Day . "
