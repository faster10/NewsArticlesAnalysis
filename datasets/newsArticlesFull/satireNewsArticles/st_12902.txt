What made Moocher different , however , was the presence of his best friend Hammy the Pig , the trained pet sow he raised from a piglet . Delighting children with her uncanny tricks , Hammy would dance , stand on her hind legs and even juggle multi colored rubber balls with her snout . The sound of Moocher ' s accordion , accompanied by Hammy ' s happy squeals and oinks , was always guaranteed to alert children up and down the Sioux City Line that fun was on the way .
