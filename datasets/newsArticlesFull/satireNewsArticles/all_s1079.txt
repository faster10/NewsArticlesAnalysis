Long lost paternity papers reveal Dallas actress Victoria Principal's meteoric rise to stardom
Decades of suspected hush-hush Hollywood string-pulling have been exposed in a new book exploring Victoria Principal's awesome acting talents. Including studio machinations that secured her the plum role of Pammy. Biographer Arlene Ass-Boner's two year trawl of a mothballed Wanna Bruvvers cuttings dumpster has been published in The Gipper, His Big Dipper & Hollywood's Shooting Stars. ** The memoir reveals how crappy ham actor Ronald Reagan 'groomed' a young Norma Jean Mortensen at Palm Springs Racket Club during his presidency of the US Scream Actors Guild. Nine months later out pops a healthy, brown-eyed eight pound baby girl from Marilyn's fecund loins - and the rest is Tinsel Town hystery. \"To be fair to the old bastard Reagan actually explored acknowledging paternity,\" Ass-Boner concedes, \"even toying with going pubic about the screaming brat in the face of Mortensen lawyers' alimony negotiations.\" Then along came a 'totally freaked out' B-movie actress Nancy Davis, subsequently Reagan's next wife, paranoid about having been placed on a Hollywood Communist blacklist. \"No way was she going to play Step Mom to Ron's latest little bastard,\" Ass-Boner explains, \"can's say I hlame her but whaddahell?\" ** Price $25, RadonHouse Press
