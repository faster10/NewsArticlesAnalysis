" I can ' t wait to find out more about this Keith guy who just moved in , " said Upper West Side doorman Patrice Hall , 53 , who told reporters that while he doesn ' t know much about McGregor yet , the young man ' s name seems to keep popping up in just about every interaction he has with coworkers , friends , and neighbors . " I wonder how he ' s adjusting to the city so far . People have been saying he moved here from a small town and doesn ' t really know anyone , so if I run into him I ' ll be sure to introduce myself . "
