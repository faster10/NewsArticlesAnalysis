Despite the efforts of crews working around the clock , the festival ' s resources were severely stretched by Day Three . Event organizers installed 100 portable toilets on the grounds , but the number proved woefully inadequate . The makeshift toilets were not emptied as scheduled and leaky , overflowing units spilled human waste into ditches . Foot pump handwashing units were emptied mere minutes after they were refilled , as campers carried the water in buckets back to their living quarters , where no fresh water was available .
