" It used to be that only certain particularly noteworthy or rare items , like Fantastic Four 1 or a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card , were considered valuable collector ' s items . That ' s no longer the case , " NACA president Bob Gunther said . " If you have any objects of any kind in your home , in your garage , or on the floor of your car , don ' t throw them away . They could be worth big money someday . In fact , they ' re probably worth a lot of money right now . "
