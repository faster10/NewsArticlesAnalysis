" I ' m fine with most details , but for some reason hands completely and utterly elude me , " said Milligan , who recently described a character ' s hands as " dangling around like big , meaty spiders . " " I ' ll often create an entirely fleshed out character , and write easily at length about their face , their personality , their voice , their hopes , dreams , and desires , but then I try to describe their damn hands and it ruins the whole story . "
