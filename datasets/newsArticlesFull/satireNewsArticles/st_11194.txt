" Sure , I love Kristin , but I ' ve got a lot going on in my life , " Miyatake said . " I ' m working really hard to keep the store up and running . I ' d rather not go through all the hassle of a marriage right now , just because the courts decided I could . I just don ' t see any reason why we need to go through some big , annoying ceremony to prove that we ' re in a committed relationship . "
