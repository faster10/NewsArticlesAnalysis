" I was going to go to bed early Sunday so I could get up early Monday and start on all my projects , " Olson said . " But then I realized I could go to Rocky ' s Bar Grill , where they have this really cool thing called Rocky ' s Sunday Night Record Jam , where this guy spins all these really cool old vinyl records , everything from Curtis Mayfield to The Damned . I normally never get to go because I have to get up at 6 a . m . Mondays , so I figured it was my big chance . But then I got a little more drunk than I ' d planned . "
