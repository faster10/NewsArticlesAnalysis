This is not the first time a McDonald ' s character has stirred controversy for its violent nature . In 1982 , the company introduced " Shakes McJunkie , " an emaciated addict who robbed characters of their possessions , which he then sold to buy McDonald ' s shakes . He was later reworked as " The Machead , " a homeless , wild eyed Big Mac addict who turned to panhandling and gay prostitution as a means of supporting his severe burger habit .
