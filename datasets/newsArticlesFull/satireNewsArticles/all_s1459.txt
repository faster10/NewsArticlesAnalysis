Dappy the Dinosaur to be moved from Natural History Museum
After 36 years, the Natural History Museum has decided to mothball Dappy the Dinosaur and make way for a new huge guest to greet visitors to the premises. From next year, a huge whale called Adele - often referred to as the fat computer in the Thomas the Tank Engine books - will replace Dappy to greet visitors. The Director of Visitor Looming Attractions (DVLA) at the Museum, Gal Georgaway said: "People were getting rather fed up with seeing Dappy. There is only so much people can take of a skeleton wearing its baseball hat on backwards and its trouser crotch down at its ankles." The museum will be adding a host of new attractions during the year including: 1. The Miley Virus - this disease from the prehistoric Akeybrakey period caused animal tongues to mysteriously hang out2. Justinian Blubber - he was a minstrel back in the Tudor period who instead of improving with age, became less intelligent the older he got3. Littlus Mixus - preserved cadavers from Rome of a group of young girls who were put to death having fooled Julius Caesar for over 4 years that they could sing
