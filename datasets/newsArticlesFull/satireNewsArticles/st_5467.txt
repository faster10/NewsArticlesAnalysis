" QuikShot is so easy that I ' m actually shooting a handgun way more often than I normally would , " said local resident Danny Taylor , who participated in a pilot trial of the program , as he deposited an empty . 357 Magnum with the QuikShot logo imprinted on its grip at a Rogers Park reholstering station . " Whether I ' m going to a house party or just to the liquor store , it ' s nice to know that I can grab a piece , use it for as long as I want , and then drop it off without a lot of fuss . "
