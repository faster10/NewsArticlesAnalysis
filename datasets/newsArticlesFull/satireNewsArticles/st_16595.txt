So , a Sikh practices Sikhism , which is a monotheistic religion that is based on the teachings of Guru Nanek Dev Ji and was founded in 15th century Punjab . That probably raises more questions than it answers . Anyway , before we get into all that , we should say right now that Sikhism has nothing to do with Islam . They ' re completely different faiths . Got it ?
