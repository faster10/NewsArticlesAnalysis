" I love Papalpuss , and even after all these years , I still think there ' s so much more I can do with it , " said the pontiff , seated in his Apostolic Palace drawing studio surrounded by framed Papalpuss prints , posters , and stuffed Papalpuss plush toys . " Even though I ' m stepping down from the Church , I want to assure fans that Papalpuss will continue to bungle and fret over all of life ' s little twists and turns each and every day just like always , whether it ' s worrying if he ' s penitent enough , mishearing a confession , or spilling holy water all over his vestments .
