Police continued to search the area through the night , but no additional bodies or Indian artifacts were found . Though authorities are hesitant to make any statements about the killer , they say that the typical profile is generally a male between the ages of 17 and 40 , which was most likely the age of the hunter who lost his arrowhead in the first place .
