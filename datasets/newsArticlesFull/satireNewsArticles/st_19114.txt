AJA President Nancy Staudenmeyer said that the problem now affects more than just recreational joggers . " Kenyan marathoner Evans Rutto would most likely have won last year ' s Boston Marathon had he not come across an execution style murder during Mile 19 , and been detained and questioned for over an hour , " Staudenmeyer said . " And because the victim ' s hysterical mother barged in on his interrogation , Evans wasn ' t even able to finish the race . "
