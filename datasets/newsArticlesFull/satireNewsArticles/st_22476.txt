" Teamwork , " Thompson said , holding up a copy of Kurt Vonnegut ' s Breakfast Of Champions . " I asked Jesus , ' Jesus , do you want trash like this at the library ? ' Jesus didn ' t even have to take any time to think ! He said , ' Hugh , no book filled with drawings of women ' s privates and people ' s behinds belongs in a library ! ' I move we do what Jesus would . "
