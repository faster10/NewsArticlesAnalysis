Continued Forst : " I think the upshot of what we ' re saying is , if you love sandwiches of all kinds , then here is something moderately different that you might like to try . If , however , you are sick and tired of ' the same old sandwich , ' then by all means steer clear of the Beef ' N ' Bacon . Instead , maybe try the Arby ' s Big Montana sandwich , if you ' ve never had one of those . Or just go to a different restaurant . "
