" We can ' t deny there are a lot of rock bands within the secular arena that do kick ass . Europe , Winger and Night Ranger have all kicked serious ass throughout their careers , with such killer anthems as ' The Final Countdown , ' ' Seventeen ' and ' You Can Still Rock In America ' just the first few songs that come to mind . And yes , I do admit to jamming out to music of this variety when I was very young , before my parents took to drink and were divorced , and I was born again in the light of the Lord and Savior Christ Jesus the Lamb . But that ' s all part of my past . Honest . I haven ' t listened to those records since my youth group and I burned them all in 1988 . "
