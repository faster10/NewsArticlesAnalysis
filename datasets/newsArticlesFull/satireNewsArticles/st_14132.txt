If found even partially liable for the creation of the enormous , rubbery beasts that have injured thousands and inflicted massive property damage across the Pacific Rim over the past 40 years , Japan could face stiff international penalties . Insurance officials estimate that from 1992 to 1994 alone , over 20 billion in damage was caused by the bomb force shockwaves created by the flapping motions of Mokira , an awkward , birdlike , beaked monster with an estimated wingspan of 300 feet . Known for her frequent , violent conflicts with other monsters , Mokira wiped out the entire city of Osaka in May 1993 during a fierce battle with Gigantron , a three headed , 200 foot tall metallic lobster also known as " Creature Zero .
