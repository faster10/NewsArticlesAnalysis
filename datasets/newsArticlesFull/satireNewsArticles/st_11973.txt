Well , Maya , it ' s never easy , but try to deal with it on their level . For instance , our youngest , Natalie , is 11 , so I went up to her room and we just sat in a comfy pile of pillows from the Graceful Moments , Snuggly Kids Collection . The pillows are whimsical and bright , but also made of a sturdy poly cotton blend so that you can have a fun pillow fight after you talk to him about what a deadbeat her father is .
