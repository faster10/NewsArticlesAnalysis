" We recognize how distressing it can be when viewers go into a film and suddenly find themselves confronted with jarring scenes containing a protagonist they ' ve never encountered before , which is precisely why we created this rating , " said Joan Graves , head of the MPAA ' s ratings board , who said the new category was added in part due to the thousands of complaints the organization has received from moviegoers who were upset they weren ' t given advance notice that they ' d have to make sense of the scenarios unfolding onscreen . " It ' s important that today ' s movie fans are aware upon entering the theater that none of what they will see has been adapted from a well known comic book , television series , novel , video game , historical event , previous movie , or theme park ride .
