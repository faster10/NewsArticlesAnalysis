" There was this squirrel over by Splash Mountain who said he was one of the Scurry Brothers and asked if we ' d been on his ride called the Admiral Acorn Adventure , " said father of two Troy Milizia from Auburn , NY . " When we said we hadn ' t , he brought out a mountain bike with a little wagon chained behind it and asked us to hop in . He told us it was just like the scene from his movie where he travels down the mountain pass in search of acorns . "
