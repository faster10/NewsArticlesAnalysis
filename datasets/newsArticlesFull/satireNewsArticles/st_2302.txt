Turnbee said there have been two Wendy ' s restaurants on his drive thus far . He didn ' t patronize the first , he said , because he hadn ' t gotten far enough along in his trip to justify making a pit stop . He mistakenly passed the second because he was " fiddling with the dang radio , " and by the time he realized what had happened it was too late .
