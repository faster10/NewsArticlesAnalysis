" The Nevada Gaming Commission is only happy when it ' s investing funds in the expansion and promotion of the gambling industry , " said Friesz , now president of the Carson City Chamber of Commerce . " It used to be perfectly content just regulating the gaming industry issuing permits , regulating casinos , mediating labor disputes but before long , it wasn ' t a big enough thrill for them . They had to start putting their own money on the line . "
