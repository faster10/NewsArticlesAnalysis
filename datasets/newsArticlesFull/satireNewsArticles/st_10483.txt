Unfortunately for the NFL , Brady ' s loss seems to have affected more than just the Patriots and women . Many Boston area fans of both genders , claiming that the team isn ' t worth watching without Brady , have concentrated their attention on the waning and somewhat disheveled Red Sox season or the attractive upcoming Celtics ' NBA title defense . The sports media has likewise gone into shock , with columnist Bill Simmons saying he will no longer watch football this season , Sports Illustrated canceling large Brady themed sections of this years ' upcoming swimsuit issue , and NBC Football Night In America analyst Cris Collinsworth bursting into tears and collapsing into Peter King ' s arms upon receiving the news .
