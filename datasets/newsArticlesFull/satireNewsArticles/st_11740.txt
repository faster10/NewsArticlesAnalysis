" Everybody has heard all about Jim ' s direct line to the Lord , " said Officer Nathan Randell of the Minot Police Department . " We try to leave him alone whenever we can . Most people in town feel sorry for him . All that tragedy shouldn ' t happen to one man . But when Jim gets really riled up , we have to go talk him down , or sometimes even lock him up for a night . He ' ll tell us that blaring religious hymns from his car stereo on Main Street at 3 a . m . is part of God ' s plan , but I guess we have to go against His wishes every once and a while . "
