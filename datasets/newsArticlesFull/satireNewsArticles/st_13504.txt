" I hadn ' t seen my ailing grandmother , who just turned 91 and lives all alone out in Arizona , in over three years , " said Boston investment banker Carl Thompson on Dec . 27 . " But then , the wife and I , along with several other members of our church , went caroling at the homes of various elderly shut ins as part of our holiday outreach program . As I looked into the eyes of those poor souls , so happy to have visitors on this blustery winter evening , I learned a valuable lesson about life , about family , and about myself . It was hard to book a flight out to Phoenix at the last minute , but just when it looked like there were no seats left , a reservation was canceled , and I made it out there to visit Grandma in time for Christmas Eve . It was a Christmas miracle . I know that God wanted me to be on that plane . "
