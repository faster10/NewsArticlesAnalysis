" Whenever people are forced to serve others , resentment and derision are inevitable , " said Dr Henry Janssen , a University of Georgia anthropologist . " This tradition dates back to Ancient Greece , where servants at grand Athenian feasts would sneak into the kitchen to put on short plays lampooning the foibles of their wealthy , gluttonous guests . As long as there are people who stuff their faces with mini meatballs while wearing bad ties , there will be servers there to make fun of them . "
