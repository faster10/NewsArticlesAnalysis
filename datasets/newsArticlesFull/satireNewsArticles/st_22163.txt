" Our line of scratch and sniff textbooks won ' t be available until next school year , " Scholastic Scents president Randy Bauer said , " but we do have a variety of educational packets such as the Oregon Trail fragrance set and our ' Speak Smell ' language workshops . I ' d also recommend you browse our non text book selections , such as the all odor version of The Yearling . "
