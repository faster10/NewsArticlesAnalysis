Ralph Nader , speaking before a special meeting of the What About The Children ? Foundation in San Francisco , said that the entertainment industry must take greater responsibility for the messages it sends out . " We have come to the point where violence and death have become acceptable forms of entertainment , " Nader said . " Impressionable young kids can go to a theater and see a car actually crashing into another car . We shouldn ' t be surprised when the result is tragedy . "
