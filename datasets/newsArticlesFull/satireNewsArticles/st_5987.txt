" China ' s Olympic athletic community should be deeply ashamed of itself , " said Zhang Tianbai , deputy director of the PRC ' s Athletic Sciences and Education Department and director of China ' s Olympic Committee . " When factories have to be shut down for a month beforehand just to clear the air , when automobile traffic is artificially thinned to reduce smog , when thousands of uniformed men have to dredge the river mere days before the regatta , in a city that is supposed to be the pride of a nation and the athletic center of the world for two weeks disgusting is not too strong a word .
