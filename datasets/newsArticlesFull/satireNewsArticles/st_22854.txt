" Just last week on Time magazine online , there was a U . S . map with each state colored differently , " she said . " Some of them were red , some were blue , but some were orange and some were purple . It said " voting alert " across the top . I stared at it for 10 minutes and never figured it out . I ' m still thinking about it . "
