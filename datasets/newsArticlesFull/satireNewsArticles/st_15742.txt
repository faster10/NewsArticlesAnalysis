The lawn mower , a rusty two stroke 1943 Lawn Boy , holds a value that is largely symbolic and , due to its poor condition , has not actually been used by Israeli Self Groundskeeping Forces since 1989 . It reportedly starts only after repeated yanking on its pull cord , requires liberal sprays of starter fluid , belches thick acrid smoke , must be laboriously pushed due to a faulty drive roller , and has no accompanying grass clipping collection bag . But geopolitical experts agree that it is the principle of the lawn mower , more than the machine itself , that has led to 60 years of airstrikes , rocket launcher attacks , and suicide bombings , with countless dead and tragically poor yard maintenance on both sides .
