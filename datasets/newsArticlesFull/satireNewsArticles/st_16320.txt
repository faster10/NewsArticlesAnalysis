" Last year , Joyce and I took a trip to Florida , and we found this great little novelty tie shop by the beach called Krazy Kravats , " Poniewicz said . " They had all these hilarious beach themed ties , stuff like pictures of penguins wearing sunglasses and surfing . I swear , I must have spent at least 40 there . "
