" You said there would be no baseball , " said Ortiz , refusing to leave the car . " I hate baseball . I can ' t hit the baseball . You know that . If you care so much about me and baseball , why you leave me ? Why you leave me by myself in Boston , Manny ? Why you do that ? Why you act so bad ? Boston ' s a good place . "
