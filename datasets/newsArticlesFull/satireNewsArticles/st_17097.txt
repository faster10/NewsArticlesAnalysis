" The world cannot afford to lose this valuable and versatile word , " Brooks told reporters during a charity auction in Manhattan ' s Upper West Side Tuesday , where attendees bid for the chance to have a private lunch with Brooks and repeatedly call him a schmuck . " You can be a poor schmuck , a lazy schmuck , a dumb schmuck , or just a plain old schmuck . A group of people can be collectively referred to as schmucks . You can call someone a schmuck , and you can be called a schmuck . You can even call yourself a schmuck . "
