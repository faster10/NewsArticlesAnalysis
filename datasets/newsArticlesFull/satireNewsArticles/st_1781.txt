" The evidence of an evolutionary link between humans and skeletons is sparse at best , " said Dr Terrance Schneider of the University of Chicago . " Furthermore , it is downright unscientific to theorize that skeleton life originated in Egypt merely because mummies , another species of monster , are indigenous to the area . Spooky creatures are found all over the world , from the vampires of Transylvania to the headless horsemen of Sleepy Hollow . "
