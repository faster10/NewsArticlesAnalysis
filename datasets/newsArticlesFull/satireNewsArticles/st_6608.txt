Esther Goettner of Missoula , MT experienced this confusion last week , when she was inadvertently sent a bottle of phenobarbital . " I take Tenormin for my blood pressure , and I get my Celebrex for my arthritis , " said Goettner , 67 , who said phenobarbital , an anti convulsant medication , was not part of her usual drug regimen . " Maybe I can pass it off to friend Ginny McFee for her birthday . "
