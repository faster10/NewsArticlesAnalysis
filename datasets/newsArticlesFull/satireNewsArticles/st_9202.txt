In addition to a lovely service at Everson Brothers Funeral Home in Chicopee , the 17 , 260 affair included a visitation in an elegantly appointed chamber , a parade led by a gleaming white car , and a 30 minute ceremony at Shady Grove Memorial Cemetery . But throughout the proceedings , a pall was cast by the ever present human carcass .
