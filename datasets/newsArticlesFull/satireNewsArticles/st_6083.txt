The 79 year old Gran Torino star claimed that he has failed time and again to make Lorrimer appreciate his work . Eastwood stopped appearing in Spaghetti Westerns when Lorrimer passed on a chance to see the " Dollars " trilogy at Wheeling ' s Evergreen Drive In in 1969 , and in the 1970s Eastwood made the move to the director ' s chair only to show the unimpressed husband and father of four that he has talent behind the camera . In 2006 , a desperate Eastwood released two separate films about the Battle of Iwo Jima on the off chance that Lorrimer , who once enjoyed a TV documentary on the subject , might find them interesting .
