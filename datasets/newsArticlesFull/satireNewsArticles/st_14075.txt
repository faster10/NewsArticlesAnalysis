" America is a place that guarantees the pursuit of happiness , whether it ' s for an anonymous factory worker or openly gay men and women like Rob Reiner , Carl Reiner , Mary Kate Olsen , Samuel L . Jackson , Moby , Vivica A . Fox , Gov . Gary Herbert of the great state of Utah , or Matt Lauer , " Obama said in a speech yesterday afternoon . " We are long past the days of being shocked at homosexuals in our neighborhoods , our places of work , or even in the White House . Yes , I am gay . And so is my wife , Michelle . And my daughters are lesbians . And we proudly stand alongside David Ortiz , Wes Anderson , Hal Linden , Dr Joyce Brothers , John Rhys Davies , Forest Whitaker , Matisyahu , James Garner , Jeff Goldblum , and Lisa Marie Presley .
