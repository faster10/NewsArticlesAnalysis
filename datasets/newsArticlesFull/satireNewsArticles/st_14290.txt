The first rewrite was satisfactory for both sides , with Eszterhas adding sections that would provide tax breaks for Asian hookers , Colombian drug smugglers , and voyeurs with ties to the S M underworld . With his next rewrite , Eszterhas continued to " add more heat to the bill , " shifting its focus from tax credits for working parents earning less than 20 , 000 annually to increased penalties for stalkers of cat fighting exotic dancers . It was also during this rewrite that the bill ' s name was changed to S . 1792 : Maximum Liability .
