" Rather than punishing our teachers or kicking them out , we give them a gold star every time they do something right , " Zicree continued . " If they write the correct answer to a math problem on the board , they get a gold star . If they volunteer to read aloud during English class , they get a gold star . You ' d be amazed what a little positive reinforcement can do . Some of our teachers have even stopped drinking in their cars during lunch . "
