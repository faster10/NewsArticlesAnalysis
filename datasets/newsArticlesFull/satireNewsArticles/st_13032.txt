" They say Ingmar Bergman , then they say Pippi Longstockings , and then the Volvo car , " Perssen said . " We talk about the bands they sometimes know my favorite now , The Hives , or acopters or Sahara Hotnights , but they usually say ABBA . I do not like ABBA very much , but I am willing to sing along with them to the ABBA if it maybe will get me into the sack later . "
