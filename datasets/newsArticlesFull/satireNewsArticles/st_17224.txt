Bowman says one stunt called the " Flying Medal " will begin with Phelps ' 14 gold medals being suspended above the water . Phelps will then enter the stadium butterfly stroking at full speed , coursing along the surface , and with every breach of the water , placing his head through the hoop of one medal after another . If Phelps is wearing all 14 medals at the end of the stunt , Bowman said , the swimmer will be rewarded with a whole pizza and a pound of cooked enriched pasta .
