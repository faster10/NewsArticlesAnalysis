" I ' ve always been miserable , but I guess I haven ' t been quite miserable enough to do anything about it , " said Gallardo , 44 , who added that while his daily life is consistently unpleasant , he has never felt the need to abuse alcohol or drugs to numb his emotional anguish . " I still go to my awful job , still pay my rent , still eat a whole frozen pizza pretty much every night . I hate every minute of it , but it ' s not making me panic or reassess my life or anything . I kind of wish it did , though . "
