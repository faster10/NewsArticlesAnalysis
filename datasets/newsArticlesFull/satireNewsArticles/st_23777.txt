" I see a day when we will no longer view ourselves as ' reformists ' or ' traditionalists , ' but simply as Klansmen , united in our mutual hatred of others , " Walker said . " I do not know if I will live to see this glorious day , but I do know this : The candle of truth will never be snuffed out by fear , hatred and ignorance . We shall overcome . "
