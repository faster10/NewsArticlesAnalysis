Not content with the status quo , Pelosi told her fellow Democrats that " there ' s going to be a lot of changes in the way we communicate " after the Congressional recess . According to Pelosi , deliberations on the House floor will be based on " total candor " about " what Congress is really feeling about individual pieces of legislation , the motives behind the voting , and the tone of the discussion . " If she feels the talks have failed , Pelosi plans to alert the 434 other representatives of her displeasure by doing nothing for several weeks and then bursting into tears in the middle of House debates on agricultural subsidies .
