Scientists cited numerous key similarities between the newly discovered planet and our own , including the celestial body ' s landmasses , oceans , wind patterns , cloud formations , apparent vegetation , and set of polar ice caps that strikingly resemble those found on Earth . Sources added that NASA ' s preliminary surveys indicate that the recently detected body even completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours and that , even more remarkably , its axial tilt is believed to also be exactly 23 . 5 degrees .
