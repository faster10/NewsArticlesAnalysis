Said Roanoke , VA , clergyman Rev . James Forrest : " I live a shadow life , each day going through the motions of maintaining a church , preparing sermons I no longer believe in , and counseling parishioner after identical parishioner . Perhaps this new cracker can give me a reason to go on , a source of strength , if you will . "
