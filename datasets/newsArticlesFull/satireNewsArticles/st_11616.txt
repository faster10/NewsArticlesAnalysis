God ' s response came at approximately 10 a . m . Monday , following a particularly fervent Sunday prayer session by little Timmy . Witnesses said God issued His miraculous answer in the form of a towering column of clouds , from which poured forth great beams of Divine light and the music of the Heavenly Hosts . The miraculous event took place in the Children ' s Special Care Ward of St . Luke ' s Hospital , where Timmy goes three times a week for an excruciating two hour procedure to drain excess fluid from his damaged spinal column .
