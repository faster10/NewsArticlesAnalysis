And it is very beautiful in the Happy Valley , according to Good Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo , and there is a nice little white house for everyone , and a little green lawn in front of every little house , and every house has a magical picture box which tells the most lovely stories . And everyone will stay in their own little white neighborhoods , and mow their green lawns , and watch their magical picture boxes , and they will be very happy .
