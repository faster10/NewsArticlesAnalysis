Growing increasingly wrathful , God continued : " Can ' t you people see ? What are you , morons ? There are a ton of different religious traditions out there , and different cultures worship Me in different ways . But the basic message is always the same : Christianity , Islam , Judaism , Buddhism , Shintoism . . . every religious belief system under the sun , they all say you ' re supposed to love your neighbors , folks ! It ' s not that hard a concept to grasp . "
