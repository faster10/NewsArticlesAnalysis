HOUSTON Evacuees from the overheated , filth encrusted wreckage of the New Orleans Superdome were bussed to the humid , 110 degree August heat and polluted air of Houston last week , in a move that many are resisting . " Please , God , not Houston . Anyplace but Houston , " said one woman , taking shelter under an overpass . " The food there is awful , and the weather is miserable . And the traffic it ' s like some engineer was making a sick joke . " Authorities apologized for transporting survivors to a city " barely better in any respect , " but said the blistering hot , oil soaked Texas city was in fact slightly better , and that casualties due to gunfire would be no worse .
