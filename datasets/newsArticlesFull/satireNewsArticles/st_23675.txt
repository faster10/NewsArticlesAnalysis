" There ' s this couple I ' m good friends with , Stephanie and Matt , who , on the surface , really seem to have a solid relationship , " Dittman said . " They ' re totally inseparable , which may seem like a good thing , but they rely way too much on each other for their happiness . Wanting to spend the vast majority of your time with one person is not healthy . They ' re co dependent instead of inter dependent . "
