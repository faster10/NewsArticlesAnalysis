" One time , Gerald told me that women hate it when guys play air guitar , especially to AC DC , " friend Peter Giaza said . " Then , a few days later , I was at this bar with this cute girl , and ' You Shook Me All Night Long ' came on the jukebox and I unconsciously started air guitaring . I thought the night went well , but she never returned any of my phone calls after that . I remember thinking maybe he was right . "
