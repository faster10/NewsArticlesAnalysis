" I ' m in the lab day and night , " Kim said . " The other researchers will say ' Come have dinner with us , ' but I ' m so busy that I have to just grab some yogurt from the vending machine . I ' m just too busy running over to the research facility on the west side of campus or carrying samples to the lab up on the fourth floor . I ' ve lost 20 pounds since starting this project in January . "
