Narcissists finally get to have sex with themselves
A SEX app for Google Glass is being hailed as a revolution in narcissism. Pathologically self-absorbed people will be able to see themselves looking awesome during sex as their image is relayed from their partner’s Google Glass to their own headset. 34-year-old Nathan Hayes said: “Previously I only knew whether I looked awesome during intercourse by asking my girlfriend immediately afterwards. “This is what I always wanted, my partner reduced to the status of a camera. “After sex I lie on my back while looking at myself through my girlfriend’s eyes and say ‘You are an incredible creature’. “Then I reply ‘I know’. This new app will take my relationship with myself to another level.” However mirrored ceiling maker Roy Hobbs says Google Glass is an inferior way to gaze at yourself during intercourse. “For hundreds of years, we’ve been mirroring people’s ceilings so they can watch themselves doing it. “You can’t beat the actual reflection of your naked writhing body. Digital just doesn’t compare.” He added: “Kindles are shit too.”
