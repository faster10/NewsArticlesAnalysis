" Last Friday , when I found out about Dale and neighbor Rhonda Geilstead , I was gonna kick him out of the house for good , " Sheila said . " But I knew he ' d take off in the car if I did , and I had to go to the dentist in Mobile on Saturday . I wasn ' t about to wait two months for a new appointment , so I didn ' t even bring the Rhonda thing up . "
