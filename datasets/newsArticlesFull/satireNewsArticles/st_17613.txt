Furthermore , the report continued , a third of the home runs hit by players who participated in the television series Home Run Derby , a show on which Aaron appeared several times , should have been counted . In addition , during the second half of the 1962 season , balls that bounced over the outfield fence should have been counted as home runs , and foul balls that were hit behind the batter but cleared the netting intended to protect fans seated behind home plate were also home runs . That being the case , league scorekeepers now say Aaron had his best year in 1962 , hitting 65 home runs 20 more than originally thought .
