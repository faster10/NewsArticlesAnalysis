" Of course , minorities should be hunted and persecuted nobody ' s saying they shouldn ' t , " KKK member Bob Parrish of Bessemer , AL , said . " But to ignore the truth is to choose to live in ignorance , and White people deserve better than that . These are the ' 90s . Will we turn against each other in superstition and prejudice ? Or will we embrace the future and oppose all non Whites together as brothers ? It ' s time for a more enlightened hatred . "
