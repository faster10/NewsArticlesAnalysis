" Between Game Of Thrones , a new season of Mad Men , and the final season of House , not to mention dozens of sitcoms and reality shows , this year ' s been a real grind , " 38 year old Omaha , NE resident William Bell said Sunday , adding that if he ' s going to do a good job watching television this fall , he needs to just zone out this summer . " I ' ll worry about how I ' m going to watch the newest episode of Castle while simultaneously playing catch up with Hawaii Five 0 later . But right now , I ' m going to kick back , relax , and think about nothing for a while . "
