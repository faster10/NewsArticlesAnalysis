" Each and every person can make a difference when it comes to helping the environment , " said Shelley Manning , a sanitation operations coordinator . " Especially if that person has one of those Dustbuster machines they ' re going to throw away you know , the kind that picks up bread crumbs and then you can empty the canister when it gets full ? Oh , and some sturdy sconces . If somebody has those , they would also be helping out the environment a ton . "
