" We ' ve had a pretty solid run of strong , independent heroines , so I think we ' ve racked up enough cred to get back to what we do best and make a regular old damsel in distress picture with some real heavy themes about purity , " said Iger , surmising that after the studio ' s recent streak of well rounded female protagonists , audiences would surely let a " real dumb one " slide . " At this point , I think we ' ll be fine if we slip in a movie with some blond girl who always combs her hair , sings sad songs about the man she ' s longing for , and otherwise doesn ' t say much . Or maybe she ' s a foolish , overly emotional robin who is constantly patted on the head and kept in line by her knowing father . "
