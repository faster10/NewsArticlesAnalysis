" This is a great addition , " said Jonathan Connolly , a Boston area banker who tried out the new Starbucks Tuesday . " I was enjoying my usual triple mocha latt in the main Starbucks , and I had to go to the bathroom , where three people were in line to use the stalls . The wait might have been a problem , but , to my great pleasure , there was another Starbucks right there , ready to serve me more delicious coffee . And the baristas were helpful and courteous . "
