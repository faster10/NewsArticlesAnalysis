" I feel worse than I ever have in my entire life , " Freiburg said . " When I ' m not working , I ' m packing . When I ' m not packing , I ' m talking to my lawyer . When I ' m not talking to my lawyer , I ' m crying . It feels like everything is falling apart around me . I just want to be alone . "
