" There have always been plenty of options at Busch Gardens for the casual thrill seeker , but never any for those who want an extreme , adrenaline fueled experience that , over the course of half a month , taxes every fiber of the human spirit while also showing all that this beautiful country has to offer , " said park director William Bohl , revealing that the Staminator shatters all previous park records with speeds of 90 mph sustained for 17 hours at a time . " For those people , I present a daring new ride that rockets passengers across vast prairies , through dense forests , over rugged mountain ranges , and down into deep river valleys , as well as blasting them through picturesque historic districts of major metropolitan areas at breakneck speeds .
