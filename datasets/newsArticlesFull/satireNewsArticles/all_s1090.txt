Rolf Harris Stripped in Jail
Disgraced Australian celebrity Rolf Harris had his various awards stripped from him while he is in jail. The extensive collection of plaudits conferred on Harris by the Oz government were all rescinded yesterday. Speaking to one of our reporters via Skype Mr Harris was virtually incoherent with rage - saying only \"huh a-huh huh huh a-huh huh.\" Harris was last seen during the Skype call (check our YouTube channel) being dragged away screaming -\"50 shades of Grey - thieving Pommy bastards - I was tying kangaroos and everything down in the 70's, fucking sport! I want half that movies takings - Ya Pommy Bastards!\" The Australian consulate was not available for comment on the issue yesterday when we contacted them.
