MIDDLEBURY , VT " Life begins at 90 . " So goes the motto of spunky area senior Archibald Munson , 91 years young and still as active as ever . While others may imagine retired life to be dull , this resident of the Middlebury Home For The Aged stays active and vital with his favorite hobby filling his trousers with his own bowel movements up to 40 hours a week !
