" Your petty machinations are useless , " read the message scrawled in human blood . " Soon our numbers will grow so vast that mankind will be too terrified to step into a movie theater , sit on a friend ' s sofa , or check out books from the library . Forget not , we can survive without food for up to 18 months ! Surrender now and return to the tropical , woody areas that birthed you . The future of the cities is now , my friends . We are the future . "
