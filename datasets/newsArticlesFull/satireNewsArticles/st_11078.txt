According to White House sources , Obama " snapped " late Tuesday afternoon when a staffer reminded him he was scheduled to take a call from incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner . At that point , a visibly disgusted Obama was observed slowly repeating the words " House Speaker Boehner " before ordering everyone to leave the Oval Office , where he sat typing and , according to some , banging angrily on his keyboard for the next five hours .
