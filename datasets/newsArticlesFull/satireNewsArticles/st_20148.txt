" One must strive to eat dangerously as one comes into the Will to Power Oneself Thin , " Nietzsche wrote . " What do you fear ? By this are you truly Fattened . You must embrace your Fears , as well as your Fat , and learn to Laugh as you consume them , along with Generous Portions of Simple Salad . Remember , as you stare into the lettuce , the lettuce stares also into you . "
