" It ' s just nice to finally live in a place where I don ' t feel like an outcast or an outsider , " said Vanessa Aldridge , 38 , stressing that she has faced absolutely no discrimination since she , like all homosexuals and gay sympathizers , was sentenced to an eternity in Lucifer ' s Den immediately upon her death . " There ' s no stigma attached to openly being who I am here . Everyone is respected and free to live the way they want to live . "
