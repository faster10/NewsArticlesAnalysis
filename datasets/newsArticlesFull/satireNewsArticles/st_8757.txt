According to Wachter , physicians upgraded Reagan ' s condition from " amusing " to " very funny " last January , when he began referring to all friendly females as " pill lady " and threatening females as " Nancy . " The move to " hilarious " was made late last week , Wachter said , when Reagan began brandishing his wrinkled , shrunken penis at visitors who attempted to smoke in his presence , shouting , " Fire engine ! Fire engine ! " and voiding a brief dribble of urine in their direction .
