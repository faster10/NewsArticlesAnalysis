" Only take as many rocks as you absolutely need , " said Dr Merrill , author of the book No Stone Unturned : Methods For Modern Rock Conservation . " And once you are finished with your rocks , do not simply huck them into the woods . Place the rock down gently where you found it so that others may look at the rock and enjoy it for years to come . "
