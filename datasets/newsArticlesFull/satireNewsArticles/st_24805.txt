According to Norfolk police officials , the Big Boy theft may be linked to a string of similar crimes to hit the Norfolk region this year . In March , an apron wearing , molded fiberglass chicken was stolen from the roof of a local Cluck ' N ' Shake restaurant . During Homecoming Week in May , a giant , anthropomorphic frozen confection named King Kone disappeared from the Portage Road Tastee Freeze and was found five days later at the bottom of a nearby quarry . The perpetrators were never found in either case .
