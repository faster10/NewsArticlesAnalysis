" I ' m at a loss , " said U . S . Commerce Undersecretary Stephen Borstein . " How can one make sense of something so inherently absurd ? A man comes on television out of nowhere , right in the middle of a program , advocating the purchase of millions of bottles of a particular mouthwash . Then , before you ' ve had time to absorb it all , the plea ends and Everybody Loves Raymond comes on again . There can be no rational explanation for such a thing . It ' s as if the whole world ' s gone crazy . "
