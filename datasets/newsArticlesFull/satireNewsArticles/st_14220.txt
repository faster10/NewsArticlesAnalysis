" During the Passover seder , which commemorates our people ' s deliverance from slavery in Egypt , we will remember the day God brought us unto the Land of Milk and Honey by drinking a tall glass of milk with a thick slice of honey glazed ham , " Feinberg said . " And joining the charoses and maror on the seder plate will be a ham roll , symbolizing the juicy , mouth watering taste of freedom . "
