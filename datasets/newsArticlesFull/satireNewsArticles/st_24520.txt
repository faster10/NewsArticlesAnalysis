Another reason for the hippie explosion , environmentalists say , lies in the differences between the current crop and the more mature , " old growth " hippies of the 1960s . While old growth hippies were a gentle species that was considered a mild annoyance at worst , the new breed , they say , is a hardier , more insidious creature which seems to thrive in virtually any environment . " We ' re seeing these young hippies in the malls , in fraternities , on Madison Avenue all kinds of places where hippies were once considered non indigenous , " said Alfred Meijer of the Nature Conservancy . " Years of cross breeding and exposure to television have produced a hybridized , consumer culture bred hippie that can adapt to literally any environment , countercultural or mainstream . And unlike the old growth hippies , which at least were anti materialistic , the new ones are voracious consumers , swiftly depleting their habitat of all resources and purchasable goods . "
