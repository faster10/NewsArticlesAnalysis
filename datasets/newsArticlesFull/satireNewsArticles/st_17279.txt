" When they approached me I was frightened because I am not used to seeing arms so well defined , " refugee Delipia Selvaraj said . " And when I learned that the arms were 45 years of age , I did not believe this . But as I got more comfortable being around them , I saw that they are not only strong , but loving arms . That is why I let them hold my 2 year old daughter Lakshmi . "
