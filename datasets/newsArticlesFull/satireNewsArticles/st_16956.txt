" I doubt this ' ll work any better than anything else he ' s tried , " former roommate Chris Komarek said . " Kevin was never good when it came to meeting women . He had a girlfriend for a few months in college and was really hurt when they broke up . If this Maxim stuff is building up his confidence , more power to him . It couldn ' t be any worse than when he used to run stuff in the ' Missed Connections ' section of the personals , hoping to hook up with some girl he ' d stared at in some coffee shop for hours . That was just sad . "
