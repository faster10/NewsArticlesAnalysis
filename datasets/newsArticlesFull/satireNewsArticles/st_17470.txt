" Barbaro was a great horse , but an even better person , " said Cheryl McElroy , still visibly shaken after filing past Barbaro ' s coffin and placing a single red rose upon it .

He showed us that anyone could win the Kentucky Derby if they just believed in themselves even you or I . And he proved that people can lead perfectly normal , productive lives after breaking their long pastern bone and being diagnosed with laminitis of the left hoof . "
