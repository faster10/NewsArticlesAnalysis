" Ron has a history of telling Me that the filmmakers ' totally understand ' the Word Of God , and that the project is going to be ' fabulous , ' " Christ said . " But when it comes out , it ' s all wrong , and Ron claims everything fell apart in post production . At that point , there ' s nothing left for Me to do but say , ' Okay , fine . I forgive you all . ' Well , next time , I ' ll be shepherding the project through from casting to final edit to marketing . "
