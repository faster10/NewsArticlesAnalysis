A publicity campaign for the tear inducing shampoo has already begun , with Johnson Johnson debuting a series of television ads to push the baby care product . In one of the minute long spots , scheduled to air later this week , a mother cradles her crying newborn in her arms . As time passes , the weeping infant grows increasingly older , until the now elderly woman struggles to hold up her 48 year old , 230 pound son . A voiceover announcer asks viewers , " Worried your child will never toughen up ? At Johnson Johnson , we can help . "
