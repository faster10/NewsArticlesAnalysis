" It ' s true , " Mayor Roberts confirms . " Our highways are jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive . This is terrible , and not just because of the risk of a tragic wreck on the highway . We can ' t have kids thinking that they can skip some school , shoot some pool , act real cool , stay out all night , and it will be all right . "
