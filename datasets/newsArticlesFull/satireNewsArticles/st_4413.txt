" How many applications have you filled out today ? " Bush said . " You should spend eight hours a day looking through the want ads , mailing r sum s , and pounding the pavement . You won ' t find a job moping around the house and feeling sorry for yourself . If you ' re down and out , you have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps . Life ' s hard , my friends . Get used to it . "
