" This staff has been working directly under me for a long time , so it ' s only natural that they ' d want to show their appreciation by throwing a little shindig on my last day , " said Roberts , who recently accepted a job as regional director of Quad State Shipping in Rockford , IL . " And it ' s only natural that the employees would want to blow off a little steam at the end of the week . Even so , I really wasn ' t expecting much more than cake , punch , a couple of warm wishes , and maybe a card . Frankly , I was surprised when I found out they ' d hired a band . "
