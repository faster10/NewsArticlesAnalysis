" It ' s rather a shame that the Tour ' s ' clean ' riders , or ' lanternes naturelles ' as the fans call them , receive so little attention , for their monumental achievement , " said cycling commentator Phil Liggett , reporting on the non doping riders ' finish for Versus 2 , the little sister network to Versus , who carried the main Tour de France coverage . " It ' s nearly impossible to compete in the full Tour while shot full of human growth hormone , erythropoietin , testosterone , glucocorticosteroids , synthetic testosterone , anabolic steroids , horse testosterone , amphetamines , and one ' s own pre packed oxygen rich red blood cells . To do it on water and bananas is almost heroic , no matter what one ' s time is . "
