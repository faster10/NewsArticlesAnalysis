Breaking News: R.F.I.D. Chips Discovered on WI “I Voted” Stickers
As Americans are headed to the polls for the most important election in their lives, startling news arrives from the dairy state. An Electromagnetic Radio-Frequency Identification (R.F.I.D.) device has been discovered on one of the “I Voted” stickers which are given out freely to citizens after they vote. A flight attendant, after having voted, was unable to pass the security checkpoint during her return to work at the Dane County Regional Airport just outside of Madison. It was not until she removed the windbreaker she was wearing that sensors employed to detect metallic objects cleared her to advance. A more localized scanning wand detected the problem on her “I Voted” sticker that she was given at her local polling station. It was then that airport authorities and security personnel discovered the miniature chip embedded at the top of the flagpole in the upper left hand corner of the sticker. Calls to the polling place have not been heeded by election officials. The standard “No Comment” rebuff of this reporter’s inquiries generates doubt that this was an accident. A visit to the polling place resulted in a standoff where security guards would not allow for an onsite interview to take place. Maddy Peters, of Madison, remains rattled and disturbed by the discovery. She’s left wondering the same thing we all are at this time, “How many more chips were passed to voters and what is the overall scope of this operation?” The National Report is your source for breaking news in these bustling times.
