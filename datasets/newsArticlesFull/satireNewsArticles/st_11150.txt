" Wow , that is nuts , " said student Jeremy Golliver , who claimed he knew gay rights was a struggle " like , a hundred years ago " but didn ' t realize it lasted so long . " It ' s really embarrassing , when you think about it . Just the fact that people in this century were actually saying things like , ' No , gays should not be allowed to marry , ' and were getting all up in arms about it , as if homosexuals weren ' t full citizens or something . It ' s insane . "
