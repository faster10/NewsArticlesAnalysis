Sloman said the commercials will have elements of continuity tying them together in a loose narrative , including a character named Randall who , irrespective of anything else being said in the commercial or whether anyone is even listening to him , only looks at the floor and says , " Erica Erica where did it all go wrong ? " Additionally , one or more characters will end each ad by offhandedly muttering Old Milwaukee ' s new slogan , " Honestly , what ' s the point ? "
