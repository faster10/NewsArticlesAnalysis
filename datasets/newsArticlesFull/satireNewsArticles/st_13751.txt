" The Internet has really revolutionized my ability to keep on top of my medical problems , " said Hartley , speaking from her bed . " For instance , I used to think my headaches were just really bad migraines . But then last week , while searching Mt . Sinai Hospital ' s online medical database , I learned about something much more serious called cranial AVM , or arteriovascular malformation , which , along with headache pain , may also result in dizziness , loss of concentration , and impaired vision . I immediately thought to myself , ' Hey , that ' s exactly what happens to me . ' "
