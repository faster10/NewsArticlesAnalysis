" I figured there would be a real big cube that would sit in the middle of town that powered all the streetlights and things like that , and then a smaller cube in your house for your refrigerator and your heaters and everything else , " said Youngstown , OH resident Kendra Morgan . " And then you ' d have some littler cubes that you could carry around with you in your pocket for whatever else you needed them for , like a blow dryer or a coffee machine , and the cubes would make all of them run .
