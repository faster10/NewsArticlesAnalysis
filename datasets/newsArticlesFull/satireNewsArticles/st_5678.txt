A toy abuse monitoring group , the Association for the Advancement of Plastic People ( AAPP ) , said it has gathered evidence suggesting that the Chinese government has also detained an additional 20 million toys for questioning . According to the group , even toys that contained only trace levels of lead paint were loaded onto trains bound for detention centers in remote provinces of Western China , where they were allegedly deprived of sleep , burned with cigarettes , and subjected to traditional Chinese water torture .
