" I read Get The Gimmies as soon as Melody told me about it , and I really liked it , " Bishop said . " I went to the library and got lots of other ones , too . I ' ve been reading them all week . My favorites are The Berenstain Bears Forget Their Manners and The Berenstain Bears Visit The Dentist . Others are super good , too . "
