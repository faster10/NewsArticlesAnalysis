" The emphasis in long distance running is , naturally , most often on results , " said Tergat , a native of Kenya who grew up running hundreds of hot , dusty miles a week in his home country for nothing more than the sheer pleasure of it . " Yes , this is a great way to wrap up the year , and yes , it was a dramatic , painful experience every marathon is . But I would be lying if I didn ' t say I had an absolute blast every single step of that 26 . 2 miles . "
