" Brandon is very fortunate he gets to go to college next year , " Raschi said . " He ' ll be able to just go to college and dink around for a while , sow some wild oats and ' find himself . ' I never got to do that . Instead , I spent 10 months waist deep in rice paddies , waiting for the Viet Cong to strike at any second . After seeing the horrors I saw in ' Nam , you don ' t waste your time when you get back . But , thank God , Brandon doesn ' t have to look at life that way . Must be nice . "
