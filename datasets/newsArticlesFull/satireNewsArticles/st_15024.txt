" Allah willing , embarrassment and tearful rejection shall rule this day , " bin Laden said . " Paper hearts shall be rent and trod upon , and dreams of love delivered stillborn . Body language shall be misinterpreted , crushes unrequited , and sincere expressions of affection mocked . Invitations to dinner will be rejected , just as Americans have rejected Allah , the one true God . "
