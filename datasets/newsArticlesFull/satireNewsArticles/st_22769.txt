For example , it ' s told in this totally messed up order . It starts after the crime is over and then goes backwards . That ' s nuts ! Like they ' re constantly jumping back and forth between flashback and present . The way they introduce each character is by flashing back and showing how they got involved in the crime . I can ' t even remember what happened first and what happened last , who knows what and who ' s the baddest killer , and I ' ve seen the movie over 100 times . Trying to follow the story is really hard sometimes . It ' s very complex .
