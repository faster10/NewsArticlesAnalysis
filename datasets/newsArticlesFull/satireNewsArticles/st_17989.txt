According to MPAA officials , the new " O , " or " Original , " designation will inform viewers that a particular film contains characters with whom they are unfamiliar , previously unseen settings , and novel plots . The rating will also reportedly serve as a warning of the potentially disorienting effects associated with having to remember characters ' names for as many as two hours and the discomfort that can occur when one is forced to keep track of narrative arcs for an entire film .
