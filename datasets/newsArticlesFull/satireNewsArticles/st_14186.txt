" My movie about My life will be the greatest movie ever shown , " Christ said . " It should be the last Word on Me . No more animated versions , no more musicals , and no more movies where the scourging scene is so violent , you could put it in Fangoria . I mean , yes , being crucified is very painful . But I can ' t see devoting more than , say , three minutes of film to it . "
