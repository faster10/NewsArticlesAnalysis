" What these raccoons conveniently neglect to mention is that their foraging creates an enormous mess , " Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R TX ) said . " They recklessly overturn trash cans and rip apart garbage bags with their sharp teeth , then they don ' t even bother to clean up afterwards . In the morning , residents wake up to find garbage strewn about their lawns , creating an ugly , unsanitary situation . What ' s worse , they don ' t even have the decency to be quiet about it , knocking over metal cans in the middle of the night while decent , non nocturnal folk are trying to sleep . They ' re animals , I tell you . "
