The most celebrated event took place at New York City ' s Madison Square Garden , where defending World Wrestling Federation champion " Stone Cold " Steve Austin was defeated in a stunning upset by the Undertaker before thousands of fans . Having subdued Austin with a tombstone piledriver , the Undertaker looked up to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who was seated in his mayoral box high atop the arena , to determine Austin ' s fate . Giuliani pointed his thumb downward , and the Undertaker ran Austin through with a broadsword to fans ' raucous cheers . He then presented Austin ' s lifeless body to the mayor .
