" By ordering NORAD to deactivate the nation ' s air defenses on 9 11 we succeeded in clearing a path to Manhattan for our plane , but this apparently created a window of opportunity for five al Qaeda operatives who , ostensibly , departed on another aircraft just a few minutes after our plane did , " said NSA officer Will Mason , adding that FAA leaders were instructed to delay reporting the radio controlled airliner ' s deviations from its flight path that morning , but immediately began panicking once they noticed the similar behavior of a second aircraft . " No one had any idea who was controlling that other plane . We were celebrating quite a bit after our successful strike , but when the second one hit it pretty much silenced the entire Pentagon Command Center . "
