" When we set out on this quest , we assumed it would take two , three years tops , " Di Bona said . " We thought someone out there in America had the funniest home video at the ready , and we ' d just give it a national audience . Fifteen years later . . . Well , we know the video is out there , but sometimes , late at night , I do worry that it ' s locked in a trunk somewhere , and we ' ll never get our hands on it . "
