" I ' m not asking for people to faint or go into hysterics or anything , but would it be too much for just one person to respond intensely and personally to who I am and what I stand for ? " continued Romney , adding that he would even be thrilled to have a voter shout at him in anger , because then he would at least be able to say he had actually moved someone . " Frankly , I don ' t even care who it is an elderly woman , a child , a mentally ill person who just happens to be wandering through the rally . I am wide open here . "
