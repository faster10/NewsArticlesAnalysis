" I can ' t even look at the back of my Volvo anymore , " said one Syracuse , NY liberal who wished to remain anonymous . " My ' Lick Bush ' and ' Four More Wars ' bumper stickers just remind me of the angry feelings I can ' t sustain . I still have a MoveOn . org sign hanging up in my cubicle at work , but if someone starts to talk about Cheney , I can ' t take it . I ' m like , ' Yes , we all hate Cheney . He ' s an evil puppet master . Yes , Bush is dumb . This is obvious . How many times can we say it ? Now , excuse me , will you let me through so I can microwave my burrito ? ' "
