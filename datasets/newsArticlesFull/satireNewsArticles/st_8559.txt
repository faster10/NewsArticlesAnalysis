" We never had to rush onto the football field or basketball court to protect our son , " Andrew Davis said . " Jeremy would have hated that . Instead , he wanted to be the one to point out his handicap when someone stole the ball while he was dribbling . During his sophomore year , the football coach put him in at running back on the last play of the game , and he rushed for a 65 yard touchdown . Even though the opposing team just stepped back and let him score , Jeremy celebrated as if they had actually tried to tackle him . He didn ' t care . That takes guts . "
