" At no point should these commercials depict persons willfully placing KFC items anywhere within the designated ' eating zone , ' " said Copps , referring to the federally defined area extending in an 8 inch radius around the mouth . " Nor should individuals be seen manipulating the chicken in a manner that may bring it into contact with their lower facial region , or the lower facial region of a child or companion animal . In fact , children under the age of 8 are not allowed to appear in the ads in any form . "
