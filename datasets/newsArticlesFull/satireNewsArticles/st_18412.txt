A Zogby International poll conducted last week reflected the country ' s distaste for political debate . When asked if they preferred the Republican emphasis on national security or the more Democratic commitment to domestic issues , 73 percent of respondents agreed to disagree on the matter and just leave it at that 16 percent called the topic of Obama versus Clinton " touchy " and not worth talking about if it could offend someone and 11 percent said that for the sake of everyone having a good , hassle free year , it is probably best to just let it go and not worry about who the 44th president will be .
