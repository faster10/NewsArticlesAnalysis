One of the 15 permanent exhibits , titled " Working For ' The Weekend , ' " examines the routines of middle class wage earners , who labored for roughly eight hours a day , five days a week . In return , they were afforded leisure time on Saturdays and Sundays . According to many anthropologists , these " weekends " were often spent taking " day trips , " eating at chain family restaurants , or watching " baseball " with the nuclear family .
