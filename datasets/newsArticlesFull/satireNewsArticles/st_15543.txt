" I couldn ' t believe it , " said another Herchwick fan , Wauwatonka elementary school teacher Gwendolyn Briars . " I got up right next to him , and when he was signing my autograph , I told him that I ' d actually met him once before , about eight years ago , during a Christmas party at the home of our pastor . And you know what ? He remembered me ! Sure , he ' s a big star now , but he hasn ' t let that change him . " " What can I say ? " Herchwick told reporters . " I ' ve been in the public eye so long now , sometimes I forget just how lucky I am . All this acclaim and attention really makes me realize how much I ' ve been blessed , and I thank the fans for that . I ' m nothing without them . And it ' s important to remember that and to take time out to give back to the community , as I ' ve done here today . "
