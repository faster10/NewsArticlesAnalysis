" I ' ve been to Jessica ' s house for dinner before , and her family always seemed really sweet and nice , but I ' m starting to see a different side out here , " said Phelps , remarking that midway through the weeklong vacation the Matthiesons appeared to have become less adept at keeping up their usual appearances . " I used to think her dad was pretty funny , but now I ' m starting to wonder if maybe his jokes are just mean . He teases Jessica ' s mom a lot , and she almost never laughs along with him . When she does , I ' m pretty sure she ' s faking it . "
