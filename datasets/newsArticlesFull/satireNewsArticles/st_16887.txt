The 44 year old actor , who is set to star in the upcoming Ridley Scott directed film The Martian , said he had planned for the headshots to replace the most recent ones he had taken in 2010 . In addition to his complaints about the overall appearance and composition of the shots , Damon stated that the photographer , who " basically stole 500 right out of his pocket , " had ultimately given him a set of substandard photos that casting directors would toss out immediately .
