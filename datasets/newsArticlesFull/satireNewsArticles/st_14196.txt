" I remember when I turned 1 , 000 , I was really excited , " said Christ . " A bunch of the apostles threw a big surprise party for me at the Sea of Galilee , and it was such a great time I don ' t even want to tell you how much water we turned into wine that night . But once I turned 1 , 000 , each birthday sort of became less and less of a big deal . It ' s like , once you ' re a thousandsomething , you don ' t even get so excited about birthdays anymore . The past few hundred birthdays , I ' ve generally celebrated by just going out to dinner with a good friend or something mellow like that . "
