Fans began lining up in mid afternoon for Favre ' s 8 p . m . fitting , a late addition to the Packer preseason calendar made only after Favre purchased the Brooks Brothers suit to wear at upcoming formal occasions and announced his intention to have it altered to fit him more precisely . The 65 tickets sold out within six hours of the fitting ' s announcement on July 26 , despite the fact that no football would be played , Favre would not be miked for the event , and the tailors in question would be traveling into town from Chicago , home of the hated arch rival Bears . The stands filled with cheering green and gold clad fans , none of whom wore their own suits to the event , an hour before Favre took the field .
