" Of course I still think about socializing from time to time , but whenever I get tempted to make a phone call to Andy or Dave even just one little text I put my phone away and go for a walk alone to settle my mind , " Bradford said . " I remind myself that just one night with them is all it would take to bring me back to that old social life I don ' t want . And if I hang out with one bud , I just know I ' d end up hanging out with a bunch , and I know exactly where that would lead me . "
