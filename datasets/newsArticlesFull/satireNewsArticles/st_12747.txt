" Is he gone ? Good , " Parker said . " Okay , I love this part : ' Then , Hamlet is arguing with his mother , and thinks there is a rat , or maybe Claudius behind the drapes , so he stabs through them , and sleys sic Paulonius sic , who is really his girlfriend Ophelia ' s dad . ' You know , I think most Shakespearean scholars would agree with Erin ' s assessment that the dramatic high point of the play is when Hamlet sleys Paulonius , his girlfriend ' s dad . "
