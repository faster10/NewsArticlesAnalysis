" If a priest goes even one child over the limit , there will be hell to pay , " said Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops Giovanni Battista Re , explaining the Vatican ' s new " Three Strikes , You ' re Out " rule . " After the third offense , the offending priest will immediately be moved to another parish . This will give officials time to investigate the case , and will act as an effective deterrent since it usually takes months for priests to gain the trust of the new children . "
