According to Bolden , barring any weather related delays or the driver not showing up for some reason , the bus will depart from a station in Orlando on a north northwesterly path following the curvature of Interstate 75 though the inhospitable central regions of Georgia , Tennessee , and Kentucky . Once it reaches Cincinnati , the bus will alter its attitude due east and slingshot around the city , merging onto I 71 for the final 130 mile stretch to Cleveland .
