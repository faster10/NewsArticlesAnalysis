" I asked George how much it costs to be in those social clubs , but he said he didn ' t remember , " Reinard said . " I think he just didn ' t want to say the amount . He ' d change the subject on me a lot , say he did a lot of partying back then , but that was all behind him now , since he found the Lord , or whatever . "
