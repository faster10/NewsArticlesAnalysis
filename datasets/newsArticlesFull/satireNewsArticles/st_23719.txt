" God has granted no interviews , made no public appearances , and kept entirely to Himself for what seems like ages , and yet it ' s fair to say that no other author has been quite so influential , " said noted critic and conference attendee James Wood , observing that while the fiercely private immortal being has only one book to His credit , He remains among the world ' s most respected and quoted writers . " For many readers , God ' s writing had a transformative impact on their lives , and countless people list His book among their favorite titles . But for reasons that we can only speculate about , God has chosen to stay out of the limelight and let His words speak for themselves . Perhaps it is God ' s retreat into His own world that allowed Him to render His vision so vividly on the page . "
