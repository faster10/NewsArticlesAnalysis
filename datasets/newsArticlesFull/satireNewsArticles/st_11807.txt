Google ' s robot army is rumored to include some 4 million cybernetic search and destroy units , each capable of capturing and scanning up to 100 humans per day . Said co founder Sergey Brin : " The scanning will be relatively painless . Hey , it ' s Google . It ' ll be fun to be scanned by a Googlebot . But in the event people resist , the robots are programmed to liquify the brain . "
