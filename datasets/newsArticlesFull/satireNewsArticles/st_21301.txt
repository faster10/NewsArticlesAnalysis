N . inspections , the president abruptly stopped speaking mid sentence , dropped his fork to the floor , and closed his eyes as he entered a deep trance . " The president was just sitting there , completely silent , until he snapped out of it several minutes later and whispered that we had just taken out a top level Taliban commander and six of his subordinates , and inflicted limited collateral damage on a nearby school .
