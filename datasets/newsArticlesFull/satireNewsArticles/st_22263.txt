" It was probably my worst game as a pro , " said linebacker Junior Seau , who was almost invisible for the whole game , only able to intercept a total of two Derek Anderson passes all game and none in the second half . " Not that I was alone out there . Randall Gay only recovered one fumble for a touchdown . And I hate to call out the other unit , but there were a couple of times when the offensive line almost gave up their fourth sack of the season . "
