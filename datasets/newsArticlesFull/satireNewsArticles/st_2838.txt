" ' Outraged ' is too mild a word to describe my reaction when I heard this , " Fowles said . " ' Sickened ' is more like it . How can anyone admire that evil man ? It deeply disturbs me that with all the millions of unsung heroes out there , like teachers and paramedics and neighborhood watch people , young people would worship a monster like Charles Manson . And Leeza ' s not much better herself for giving these wackos a forum to air their twisted views . Shame on her . "
