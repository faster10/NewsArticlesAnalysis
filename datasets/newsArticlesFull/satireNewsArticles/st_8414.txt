Though the hated billboard is said to typically reappear as James ' haunting likeness , some have seen other disturbing images . Last Thursday when the mural was attached to four 1 , 000 pound weights and forcibly sunk in the Cuyahoga River , commuters driving into the city reported seeing in its place a 10 story tall photograph of John Elway leading Denver to victory over the Browns in the 1987 AFC Championship game . Others saw a still image of Michael Jordan jumping into the air and pumping his fist after his game winning shot over Craig Ehlo . Many pedestrians , meanwhile , reported seeing a 100 foot banner of Earnest Byner ' s 1988 fumble on the three yard line .
