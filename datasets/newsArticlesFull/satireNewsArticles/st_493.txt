" I don ' t know why I can ' t play up there , " Rieder said Monday . " I ' m not gonna fall off . It ' s way less steep than the slide at the playground . And I never fall off that when I climb up . Plus , I wouldn ' t ruin anything there ' s not even anything to ruin . It ' s just the roof and the chimney and the TV antenna and the wires that go to the telephone pole , but I know not to touch the wires . "
