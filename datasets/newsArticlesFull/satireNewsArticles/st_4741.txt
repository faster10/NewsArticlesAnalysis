" This ridiculous show of force is patently not the way to fight the West Nile virus , " said Dr Arnold Bloch of the Centers For Disease Control . " Foreign military action will do nothing to halt the spread of this disease and does not help those currently infected with West Nile . Besides , Bush should have deployed those anti mosquito jet fighters along the eastern seaboard and garrisoned the Mississippi River area last year , when there was still a chance to contain the disease ' s domestic spread .
