The enormous number of unsold copies created major headaches for both Time ' s distribution department and subcontractor Interstate Periodical Distributors . Some 1 , 300 semi trucks , many less than a third full due to isolated pick up points , were needed to transport the 450 , 000 magazines from newsstands and bookstores across the U . S . to Time ' s main warehouse in Elizabeth , NJ . From there , the magazines were loaded onto 85 idling dumptrucks by gasoline powered forklifts . Upon arriving at Fresh Kills , the world ' s largest landfill , the unsold issues were transformed into a 75 ton mountain of waste paper by a fleet of diesel bulldozers .
