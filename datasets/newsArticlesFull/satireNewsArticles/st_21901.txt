It ' s true : the conditions here are terrible . I currently live in a 7 x 10 windowless tank with poured concrete furniture . The weight rooms are overcrowded , the food is terrible , cable t . v . is only available if you ' re ' affiliated , ' and for some reason there seems to be a horrific act of violence committed on or around 4 p . m . every day .
