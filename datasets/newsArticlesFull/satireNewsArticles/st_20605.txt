" Sometimes the carps are real clunkers , " said former Zipcarp customer Eric Lowell , adding that his carp broke down in the middle of the highway last week . " The fins don ' t work at all , the eyes are all busted , and there ' s no air in the gills . It ' s just a really terrible feeling when you ' re in the middle of nowhere and your carp dies on you .
