Turnbee , who is currently on route to pick up his wife , Shelly , from her sister ' s house , said he would be on the lookout for a dining service sign with a miniature Wendy ' s logo . While Turnbee said he depends on these icons to inform him as to what dining options are ahead , he was confused by one near the Mercer exit , which had an image of just a fork and knife , and no other specific details .
