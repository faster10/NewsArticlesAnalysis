According to sources , Ramirez pulled up to Ortiz ' s Weston , MA home last Sunday , a selection of Tom Petty hits blaring from the stereo of his faded red 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 convertible . After embracing each other , a visibly somber Ortiz told Ramirez , " I don ' t know what ' s going on with me , man . I ' m not hitting the baseball . " Ortiz then threw his battered duffel bag in the car ' s backseat and asked Ramirez where they were headed .
