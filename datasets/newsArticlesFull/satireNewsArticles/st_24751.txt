" According to this ancient text , when God first broached the idea of a child , Erica broke down and told Him she just wasn ' t ready for the Incarnation of the Messiah , " theology professor Michael T . Freyland said of the parchment found in a cave near the Church of the Annunciation , the site at which the archangel Gabriel is believed to have appeared and spoken to Erica in an effort to change her mind . " They ' d been together a few years at that point , and God was devastated . She was smart , caring , and beautiful not that Mary wasn ' t , but with Erica things were apparently just different . She was the whole package . "
