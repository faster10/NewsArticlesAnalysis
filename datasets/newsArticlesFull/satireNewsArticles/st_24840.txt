" I am proud of my service to Public Enemy , " said retired S1W Roger Chillous , 41 . " I was right there in the front of the stage for the First London Invasion tour of duty right before I retired . But I can no longer effortlessly execute the complex choreographed maneuvers that were once required of me . I wasn ' t called up for the East Coast West Coast conflict , so I don ' t understand why I was for this . "
