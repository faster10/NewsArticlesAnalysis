" The main job of the BCS is to place the best football players in the nation in a single game in order to decide the national champion , " said BCS chairman Mike Coleman . " This year , our computer took hours to process the polls ' relevant data by which I mean the opinions of the nation ' s finest sportscasters , sports radio hosts , coaches , color commentators , and ESPN The Magazine contributors and determined that no championship game is necessary . No team in America deserves to even step on the same field as Ohio State , let alone actually play in a game against them . "
