" We were all in the housewares aisle yesterday when Evelyn slipped away from us toward the end of her morning shift , " said Flagstaff , AZ Kmart inventory clerk Elliott Davis , 54 . " It was really touching to be with her as she said her final goodbyes especially because I missed being by Iris ' side last week when she passed on over by sporting goods . It ' s always tragic , but at least when they pass away , they get to be with the people they worked with nearly every day . That is , until manager Alec Peters comes over and reminds us we have to get back to unloading the trucks . "
