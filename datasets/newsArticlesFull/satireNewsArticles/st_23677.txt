" For my birthday , my husband Barry got me this wonderful , incredibly expensive present : a first edition copy of A . A . Milne ' s Winnie The Pooh , my favorite book as a kid , " said Jackie Peters , Dittman ' s sister . " I thought it was a beautiful gesture , but when I told Roger , he said Barry must be feeling guilty about something , like maybe an extramarital affair . I told him that was ridiculous , but he just said I was probably in denial . "
