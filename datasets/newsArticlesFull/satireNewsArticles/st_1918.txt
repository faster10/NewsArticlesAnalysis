" I try as hard as I can , " said Buster , lying on his blanket in the entryway of the Hopkins family home . " I welcome Buster ' s owner Gerald Hopkins home every night with lots and lots of barks and leaps . And when he sits down in his chair to read , I lie quietly at his feet . Still , when I see that dog on the Dog Chow bag , I feel like I ' m nothing . "
