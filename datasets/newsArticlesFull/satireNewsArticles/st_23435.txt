" Believe me , we ' ve tried to get them into little helmets , " said Marjorie Kaplan , president of Animal Planet Media . " But they don ' t like them . They seem to think they don ' t need them , and they wiggle and squirm until you just give up . Even if you do get a helmet on them , they just get it over their eyes and walk backwards until it gets all cockeyed on their little faces , and then they look up at you like , ' Please can I take it off now ? Please ? ' and oh , jeez , it ' s just too cute . "
