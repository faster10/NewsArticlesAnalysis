" I ' ve tried to find a way to get around this whole illness thing , " said Loftus , resting on his living room couch after a morning of radiation therapy . " Unfortunately , I don ' t have the kind of job where I can work from home , even if I had the energy and lucidity to do so . And even when I can make it into the shop , it ' s tough to work the machines , because these club fingers I ' ve developed are just as ridden with subdural hemophilia as the rest of me . I feel terrible about being such a drain on AT D . "
