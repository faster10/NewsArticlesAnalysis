" I haven ' t seen anything like this since Pope Paul VI died in 1978 , " said Fr . Robert Mendiga , a Jesuit priest at St . Andrew ' s School of Divinity in North Carolina . " This was the ' 70s , the era of pre AIDS sexual experimentation and widespread recreational drug use . Catholics , especially Americans , were quite willing to be led into temptation . It stopped when John Paul I was chosen , but when he died one month later , Catholics went right back to sinning . "
