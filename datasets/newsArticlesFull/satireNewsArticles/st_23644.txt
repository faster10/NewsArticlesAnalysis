The 10 began its long journey into Kellener ' s wallet in 1983 , when a beefed up national defense budget of 210 billion enabled the military to purchase advanced warhead delivery systems from aerospace manufacturer Lockheed . Buoyed by a multimillion dollar bonus , then CEO Martin Lawler bought a house on a 5 , 000 acre plot in Montana . When a forest fire destroyed his home in 1986 , Lawler took the federal relief check and invested it in a savings and loan run by a Virginia man named Michael Webber . After Webber ' s firm collapsed in 1989 , and he was indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges , he retained the services of high powered law firm Rabin Levy for his defense . After six years and 7 million in legal fees , Webber received only a 250 , 000 fine , and the defense team went out to celebrate at a Washington , D . C . area restaurant called Di Forenza . During dinner , lawyer Peter Smith overheard several investment bankers at an adjoining table discussing a hot Internet start up that was about to go public . Smith took a portion of his earnings from the Webber case and bought several hundred shares in Gadgets . com , quadrupling his investment before selling them four months later . Gadgets . com ' s two founders used the sudden influx of investment capital to outfit their office with modern Danish furniture , in a sale brokered by the New York gallery Modern Now ! in 1998 . After the ensuing dot com bust , Modern Now ! was forced out of business , and Sotheby ' s auction house was put in charge of liquidating its inventory . The commission from that auction enabled auctioneer Mary Schafer to retire to the Ozark region of Missouri in 2006 . Last month , while passing through Hazelwood , she took her Audi to Marlin Car Wash , where Kellener was one of the employees who tended to her car . She was so satisfied with the job that she left a 50 tip , which the manager divided among the people working that day .
