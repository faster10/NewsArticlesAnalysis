" I like talking to him he ' s a very good listener , " Phelan said . " I told him all about how I was trying harder to be more comfortable and talkative around my co workers at the computer lab , and how I was hoping to break through and do stuff with some of them outside of work someday . He just listened quietly for a long time , and then when I was done talking , he said , ' Goodbye . ' "
