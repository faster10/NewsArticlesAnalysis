" Unfortunately , the inadequacy Buster is feeling is common among normal , everyday dogs , " Thannum said . " No matter how much their families love them , regular dogs can ' t help but be affected by the unrealistic images shoved down their throats by dog food companies like Purina , Cycle , and Iams . Dogs like Buster need to understand that if they were to meet the supposedly perfect animals they see on the food bag , they ' d see and smell dogs with a lot of the same problems they have . "
