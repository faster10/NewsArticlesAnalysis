In preparation for the new addition to the royal family , Queen Elizabeth has instructed her staff to convert the State Room of Buckingham Palace into a nursery , retrieved her old breast pump from the basement of Windsor Castle , and assembled a baby throne . The queen also located an old journal containing a list of her favorite baby names , which she wrote down just six weeks before Britain entered World War II .
