" Vigilantes have an undeserved reputation for recklessness , " Republican pollster Jennifer Mendenhall said . " As we phase vigilantism in , be prepared to hear a lot of talk about ' mob ocracies ' and ' tyrannies of the bat wielding , roving majorities . ' That rhetoric is meant to scare peaceful citizens into thinking they need magisterial authority to protect their interests . But vigilantism is not about crazed drunkards clustering in town squares , waving pitchforks and crying out for blood . It ' s about an opportunity to let the citizens of America serve as their neighbors ' meter maids , correctional officers , chiefs of police , or , if necessary , SWAT teams . "
