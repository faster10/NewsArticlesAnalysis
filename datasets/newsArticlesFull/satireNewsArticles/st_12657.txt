In the Heard It On the Grapevine category , I heard that , before he died , Bill Bixby completed a TV movie with him as all three of his characters : David ( The Hulk ) Banner , Eddie ' s father , and that other guy he played . Oh , I would kill my mom to get a copy of that on video ! ( Sorry mom ! )
