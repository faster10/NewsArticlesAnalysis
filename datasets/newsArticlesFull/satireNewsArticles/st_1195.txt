" If that dog wants to run around all night long , let him , " adds Janet , totally unaware of the transparent nature of her oft repeated complaint . " He ' s just going to be scratching at the door all night anyway if you don ' t let him out . If that ' s what he wants , why keep him cooped up in a place he obviously hasn ' t wanted to be for a long time ? Who cares what he does all night , so long as he ' s not doing it here ? Let him howl at the moon all night for all I care . "
