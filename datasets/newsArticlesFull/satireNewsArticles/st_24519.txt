" For some time , it was believed that the extinction of Jerry Garcia and the dispersal of The Grateful Dead would have a suppressive effect on the size of the hippie population , " Kennedy said . " Surprisingly , though , exactly the opposite has happened : The herds have grown , diversifying and spreading out . In the past , if the Dead were playing in Chicago , the entire hippie species would be singularly concentrated there . But today , you could have a herd of hippies at Red Rocks to see Phish while , at the very same moment , an equally large herd is massing in Ann Arbor for a Widespread Panic show . "
