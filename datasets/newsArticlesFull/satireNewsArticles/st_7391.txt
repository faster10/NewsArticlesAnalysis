James Haltigan , CEO of Wis Tek Electronics , is one of many Wisconsin corporate welfare recipients affected by the new law . Before CW 2 , on a typical weekday afternoon , Haltigan usually found himself at his large oak desk , barking orders at secretaries . Today , he is standing on the side of a public highway in a blaze orange reflective vest , picking up litter for the Transportation Department as part of a special CW 2 work detail .
