" It ' s not just about Americans eating too many fries or cracking their skulls open when they fall off their bicycles , " said Los Angeles resident Rebecca Burnie , 26 . " It ' s a financial issue , too . I spend all my money on trendy clothes and a nightlife that I can ' t afford . I ' m 23 , 000 in debt , but the credit card companies keep letting me spend . It ' s obscene that the government allows those companies to allow me to do this to myself . Why do I pay my taxes ? "
