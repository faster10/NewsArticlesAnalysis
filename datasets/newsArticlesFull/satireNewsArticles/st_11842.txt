" Bill ' s a great guy , and I love him to pieces , but he is just so unbelievably disorganized , " Gore said . " I called him the night before the move , and he said he ' d be ready if I showed up at his place at around noon , but when I got there , he still hadn ' t even gotten everything packed yet . Right then and there , I knew I was in for a long day . "
