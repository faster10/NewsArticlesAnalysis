" It just seems so wasteful , " Sandy said . " My chicken parmesan was 12 . 95 , and I could have easily made it for the entire family for under 10 . I could have picked up two nice chicken breasts at the Jewel for 5 and cut each one in half , making four servings . A good jar of tomato sauce would be 3 , tops , and a 16 ounce box of pasta you can get for next to nothing . And I think I have everything I ' d need for breading the chicken just sitting in the cupboard . "
