Members of Bush ' s re election team have urged the president to exercise caution with his blog , perhaps because of posts like the one dated July 8 , 2004 : " Another long day of speeches and fundraisers . Met with all these phony media company execs . Had to promise them some bill next term and shake a lot of stupid hands , but they did bring in two or three million or so . Whatever . Karl keeps a list . I got big laughs during my speech , so I ' m happy . "
