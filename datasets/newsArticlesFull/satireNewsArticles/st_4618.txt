" America has always been the land of promise and possibility , " Bush or Gore said . " And never has that been more true than today . The opportunities that stand before us are great . The challenges are many . But I am energized by what lies ahead . Make no mistake , there is much work to be done . But we are more than up to the task . Remember that I am here to work for you , the people . Because you are the people who put me here . This is a fresh start . Our children are the future . America is ready for change . And new ideas . And a fresh start . "
