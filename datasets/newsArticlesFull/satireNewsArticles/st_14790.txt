Bryant was scheduled to begin training with personal coaches Michael Jordan , Kareem Abdul Jabbar , and Karl Malone this week , but , in the true spirit of his new role as Olympic team captain , head coach , and lone member , he has opted to prepare for the tournament on his own time without anyone ' s assistance . Starting at the end of the 2005 2006 NBA season , Bryant will practice tip offs , work on fundamental self inbound passes , learn how to play defense , and draw up several play formations , each of which he will be responsible for calling during the games .
