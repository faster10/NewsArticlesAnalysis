Edwards , 18 , died in the early hours of Saturday morning after his 2002 Chrysler Pacifica plummeted nearly 30 feet into a ravine five miles north of Albany . The Annual staff , which threw a post game party Edwards attended that same night , blamed the accident on a combination of acute intoxication , malicious drugging , and vehicle pushing .
