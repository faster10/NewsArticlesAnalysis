Peters was known for remarkable physical attributes . Sources from Chesapeake Ohio report that the accountant had a neck so skinny , his necktie had to be slung a dozen times around it . Those who worked closely with Peters say he had the strength of one tenth of a man , could tabulate two tables of figures at once , and had thumbs and middle fingertips so calloused that he could sharpen a pencil with his bare hands .
