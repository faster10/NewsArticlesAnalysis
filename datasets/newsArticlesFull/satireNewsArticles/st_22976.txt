Born Karol Joseph Wojtyla in Wadowice , a town 35 miles southwest of Krakow , the pope did not have an easy childhood . In what may have contributed to his desire to inspire laughter , he faced many early hardships . His mother died just a month before his 9th birthday , and only three years later , his brother died of scarlet fever . The pope began his religious career shortly thereafter , studying in an underground seminary in Krakow . He established himself in the Krakow scene and was awarded an archbishopric in 1963 . He made cardinal in 1967 .
