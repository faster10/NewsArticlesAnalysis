" Whatever ' s in there , it ' s got to be pretty heavy , because otherwise why would the men need to take turns holding it ? " police chief Edgar Rudolph said . " And we know it ' s not liquor , because everyone in town is well aware of Bridgeport City Ordinance Title 9 , Chapter 4 , Article 4 , which clearly states that it is unlawful for any person within city limits to possess any alcoholic beverage in any public place , or to transport any alcoholic beverage upon any public street , sidewalk , pedestrian mall , alleyway or thoroughfare where such alcoholic beverage is in a receptacle which has been opened , or the seal of which has been broken , or the contents of which have been partially removed .
