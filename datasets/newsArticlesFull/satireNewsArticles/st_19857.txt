" For decades , we ' ve speculated as to what caused our ancestors to evolve beyond their arboreal kin , and now we know for certain that it was all due to these proto humans dropping snacks from their grease covered fingers and then having to climb down out of the trees to get them back , " said anthropologist Gerald Dupuis , who noted that the fossilized specimen ' s advanced tooth wear suggests repeated snacking on various salty and sweet treats , while its bone structure showed it to be significantly overweight . " We can say with confidence that nearly every subsequent adaptation in our species ' history was a product of our earliest relatives holding something appetizing to eat , accidentally letting go of it , and then having to will themselves to go pick it up .
