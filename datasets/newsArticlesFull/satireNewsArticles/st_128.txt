" I spent 200 on a rare movie poster for the Italian version of The Adventures Of Pluto Nash , " Vartan said . " I emptied out my bank account to get the money , and then I had to call the electric company and make up some excuse why I couldn ' t pay them this month . That kinda sucked , but it ' s gonna be worth it in a few years when Pluto Nash is recognized as a classic on par with Battlefield Earth and Showgirls . "
