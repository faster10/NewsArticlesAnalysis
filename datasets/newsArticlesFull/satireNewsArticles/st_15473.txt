" I wanted to finally kill Tempest without wrecking all those buildings , " said Broskowski , his fingers numb from prolonged exposure to DualShock controller vibrations . " I had , like , 9 in late fees on the game , but I wasn ' t taking it back until I got an A rating on all the missions , rescued all the colonists , and got to the versus mode . It takes about eight hours , but it ' s the best part of the game . It sucks that I had to fight about 200 other Orbital Frame Robots to get there , though . I ' ll be paying for that tomorrow , that ' s for sure . "
