" God , Eric writes me these huge , long , rambling e mails all the time , " ex girlfriend Julie Goldstein said . " I always feel like I should write him a decent message back , but I know I ' ll just get another one in a few days , so I usually just respond with something like ' Ha ha , ' or ' Too bad , ' or ' Funny one . ' I guess he ' s satisfied with that . He ' s never complained that it ' s so one sided . I guess he just feels like he ' s the one with all the important things to say . He always was a self absorbed ass . "
