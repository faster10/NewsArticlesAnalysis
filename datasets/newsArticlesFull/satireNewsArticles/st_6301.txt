" Issue three ended just as Fett and Vader were about to start fighting , " Clinton said . " They both want this alien head in a box that can tell the future , and the moment Fett finally gets it , Vader appears . Obviously , it ' s not going to be a fight to the death , because the whole story takes place prior to the trilogy , but it ' s still sure to be a great fight . "
