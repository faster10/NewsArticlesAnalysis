" Our 9 year old was making a big fuss when we sold his old Pok mon toys to the Sarrackis , " neighbor Debbie Ancona said . " Even though he never plays with them anymore , I felt guilty , so I gave him the 50 cents we got for them to find something that might cheer him up . He ran back from the Ashby table with an old Power Rangers doll . "
