" Every once in a while , I ' ll see a new face ducking behind a bench when she ' s around , " Kowalcyk said . " Most can ' t hack it for more than a few months and drop off , never to be seen again . A lot of them switch to stalking Katie Couric or Kelly Ripa . To be honest , I ' ve thought about forgetting Martha and following somebody else for a while . But once Martha gets under your skin , she sticks to you like wheat paste . I guess I ' ll keep going until one of us drops . Probably me . "
