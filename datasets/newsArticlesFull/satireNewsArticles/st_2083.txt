" I know he ' s a big masking tape in the garage believer , but I guess I only believe in what I can see and touch , not something so abstract , " said Van Ness . " I mean , I know my hot glue gun ' s right there on the kitchen shelf , and I can pick it up right in my hands any time I need to join two clean , dry surfaces together . "
