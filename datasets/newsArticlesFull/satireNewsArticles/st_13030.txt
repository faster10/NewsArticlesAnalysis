" On last Friday , I stay at the New York University on the campus in the room of Kristine , " Perssen said . " On Sunday , I stay in apartment in the Eastern Village which is where the bands like the Ramones and The Talking Heads played . The girl , Brynn , was very beautiful . She had a tattoo . Ha , I will not say where , though . That is for me to know ! "
