The Hole contains several symbolic features : A massive reinforced concrete foundation known before 9 11 as the " Bathtub " now serves as the renamed " Remembrance Facing . " According to official memorial literature , a gently declining plane into the heart of the memorial stands for the gradual but steady passage of time , and permits construction vehicles to enter and exit the site . Chain link fences symbolize the present but nonetheless scalable barriers between different cultures . Lastly , the " Eternal Puddle , " perhaps the Hole ' s most notable and arresting , as well as bottommost , feature , allows visitors to reflect on the tragedy , while the rainwater and seepage fed Puddle itself reflects muddy swirls and oil slicks .
