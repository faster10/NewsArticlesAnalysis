" What I really love about my writing and believe me there ' s a lot I love about it is that my love for my writing comes across in what I ' ve written , " Simmons said while signing books for party attendees , some of whom had reportedly requested the honor . " I have in any case been told it does , sometimes at its oddest moments , and that , for me , is a source of great pride . But I confess what I ' m most proud of are the comparisons to the greats : Damon Runyon , Ring Lardner , David Halberstam , John McPhee , Aaron Spelling . I ' m really glad I was able to make those .
