Addressing reporters , the 47 year old Fife said , " At approximately 9 : 30 a . m . on the day in question , shortly after I finish lunging at dogs , I will proceed to the front steps of the Simmons Building and yell loudly for nine hours . The screaming will be broken by a 15 minute fit of rigid catatonia , most likely in the late afternoon . "
