The plate frame , purchased at a Marshfield area Champion Auto Supply , is just one of the many upgrades Hoechst has made to his car to help him stand out among a crowded field of local males .

Hoechst also recently filed an application with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation for vanity plates reading , " 2FAST4U . "
