According to Star Hustler ' s producer , the show will remain on hiatus until Horkheimer ' s health is restored . When Horkheimer does return , the program will no longer feature the usual effects of him " jumping " from planet to planet , " beaming in " at each episode ' s opening , or " zooming " from star map to star map at light speed .
