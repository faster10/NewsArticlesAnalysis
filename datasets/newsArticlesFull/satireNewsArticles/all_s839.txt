The LBT INTERVIEW:  BEN SHERWOOD
[Editor's Note: Since the below interview was published in late-September, 2012, it has been revealed that Mr. Sherwood's sister -- Dr. Elizabeth-Sherwood Randall -- serves as Special Assistant to President Obama.  Mr. Sherwood has not responded to our request yesterday for comment on the appearance of a conflict of interest. We see that he is true to his word at the end of the interview on ABC's Benghazi coverage strategy after the scandal has expanded.] A brilliant, retentive intellect, a gift for sharp analysis, and a habit for telling the truth do not always lead one to the top of a media empire.  The truth is, they did not lead Ben Sherwood to the top of ABC News.  Sheer grit and determination did.  Sherwood  is an accomplished author, journalist and entrepreneur.  He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University and is a Rhodes scholar.   Sherwood sat down with Peter Hartwig to discuss ABC News’ treatment of the Benghazi incident.  ABC and other “mainstream” media outlets have come under fire for not reporting the details surrounding Benghazi.  Sherwood explains why along with his perspective on the role of the old line broadcasters.   What ideals are these? The propogation of our democracy. As one of the original three networks, we serve as a filter for what news reaches American living rooms.  It is our job to select this news appropriately.
