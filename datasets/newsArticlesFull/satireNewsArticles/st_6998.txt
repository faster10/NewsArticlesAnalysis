" There is nothing more satisfying than knowing you ' ve just put in a full day of bringing our nation ' s legislative branch to a complete standstill , " said House Speaker John Boehner , who like the vast majority of his colleagues worked without break throughout the day and night fostering political disharmony and rejecting the passage of crucial legislation . " We got a lot of good , quality gridlocking done today . We gridlocked efficiently , we gridlocked passionately , and we gridlocked as best we could for the American people . Now we go home , rest up , and get ready for another full day of gridlocking tomorrow . "
