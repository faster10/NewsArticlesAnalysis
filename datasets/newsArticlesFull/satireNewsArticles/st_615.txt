" My daughter Ella is a year old now , and I ' m happy to say that she is shaping up to be a complete nonentity in my life , " Rodriguez said . " But I ' m certain her children will love ol ' Grandpa A Rod coming around to wherever they happen to live , and showing them the baseball he hit off of Joe Nathan . Maybe I ' ll throw in a dragon or wizard to make the story a little more interesting , because the kids might not want to pay attention to someone who is basically just an old stranger who makes their mother cry .
