John Travolta to receive special award for Oscars portrayal of a ‘straight man’
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has revealed that John Travolta will receive a Special Recognition Award for his electric performance as a heterosexual version of himself at the 2015 Oscars. The celebrated star of hits such as Grease, Pulp Fiction, and Battlefield Earth delivered an almost entirely convincing turn as a lecherous, straight, caricature of John Travolta. The performance included lingering, and unwarranted embraces of female stars Idina Menzel and Scarlett Johansson. An Oscars spokesperson explained, “John Travolta has long been held in the highest regard for his commitment to method acting, but his decision to take up what must have been his most challenging and personal role to date elevates him to a new level.” “Watching viewers could easily be forgiven for thinking they were watching a straight man on the stage.” “It’s high time John was recognised for his dedication to keeping it up for all these years, and his delivery last night was indistinguishable from the real thing.” Rumours around Travolta’s preparation for the role have included spending a week living with Vince Vaughn to monitor his mannerisms and hetero styling, as well as a series of lunches and choreography sessions with legendary inappropriate touching mogul, Bill Cosby.
