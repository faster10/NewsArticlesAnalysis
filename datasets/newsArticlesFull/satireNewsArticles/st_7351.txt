" On the surface , this double homicide seems identical to that of Yvette and Hector Reynoso in Crotona Park July 3 , " said Sgt . Bob Bloch of the New York Police Department . " The bodies were arranged in a back to back seated position , tied tightly together . Each victim ' s clothing was removed and put backwards on the other person . And their throats and wrists were ritualistically slashed , and the eyeballs carved out and placed in their mouths . But look closer , and you ' ll see that this crime is a pale , uninspired imitation of its predecessor . "
