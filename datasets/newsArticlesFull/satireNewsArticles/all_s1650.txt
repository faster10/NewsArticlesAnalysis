Ghosts ‘bollocks’
GHOSTS are a load of bollocks, it has been confirmed. Paranormal investigator Emma Bradford said: “I tried looking at all the compelling evidence for the existence of ghosts but there isn’t any. “Why would a lost soul, trapped between the worlds of the living and the dead, move a pint glass two inches to the left or open a cupboard door several times? Surely they would do something a bit more intense. “The only people who believe in ghosts are little kids, insomniacs and grannies – who obviously have a vested interest in there being life after death.” She added: “However I am still scared of them, especially headless horsemen.”
