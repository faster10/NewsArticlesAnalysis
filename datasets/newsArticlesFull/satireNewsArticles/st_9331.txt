" I ' ve been hauling my tired old ass into this hellishly sterile office for 22 goddamn long and miserable years , planting myself here at this same windowless cubicle and cranking out the same meaningless TXR 50 forms ' til I ' m blue in the face , " said associate client services director William Richelieu , 51 . " The last thing I need as I ' m trying to hold on to what little of my sanity remains is some young son of a bitch running around trying to increase productivity and get me to foster ' team spirit . ' If he doesn ' t quit running to the fax machine every time it goes off , I ' m going to go to his house in the middle of the night and slash his tires . "
