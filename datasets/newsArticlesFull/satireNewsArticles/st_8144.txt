" Even after subjects were robbed of their ability to recognize loved ones and the basic skills necessary to feed and clean themselves , the worst of their memories persisted , " said Dr Emily Braun , a neurobiologist at Columbia University who contributed to the study . " Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that areas of the brain that retain , for example , the memory of walking in on one ' s oldest and most trusted friend engaged in passionate intercourse with one ' s wife or of suddenly being stricken with uncontrollable diarrhea while giving a presentation at a sales conference continue to light up well after the other cortical regions have gone silent .
