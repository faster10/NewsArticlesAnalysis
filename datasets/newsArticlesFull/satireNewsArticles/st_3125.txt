" Roger suggested that Valerie and I try yakoman sake , " Gibson said . " He says it ' s not really sake , but has the qualities of sake . Real sake is just water , rice , and a mold called koji . He said that once we got used to drinking yakoman , we could work our way up to trying ' the good stuff , ' this dai ginjo he special ordered . I think that might have been the problem the last four times not having the right kind of sake . "
