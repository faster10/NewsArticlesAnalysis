According to reports , players and coaches jubilantly waved Broncos towels and danced to music playing through speakers affixed to parade floats , though the songs became difficult to hear through 60 mile per hour winds , and occasional bursts of blue and orange confetti were virtually impossible to see due to poor visibility created by ground level fog . Sources also confirmed that a large marching band and two dozen Broncos cheerleaders accompanied the motorcade on foot , delaying the progress of the parade significantly as they slowly trudged through roughly five feet of snow .
