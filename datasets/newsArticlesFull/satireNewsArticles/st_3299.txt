" Mr Moreland was a fun teacher , but he could be moody , " Dolan said . " If we were talking during class , he would yell , ' People ! ' and bang his conducting wand . If he got really mad , he ' d stomp into his office and slam the door , leaving us all sitting there , holding our instruments . Basically , he ' d throw a hissy fit . "
