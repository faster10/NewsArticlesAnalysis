" Last year , I spent most of Thanksgiving dinner talking with the good cousins about how awesome Thor : The Dark World was , but this time it ' s just going to be lame , " said Patrick , 12 , explaining that his quiet cousin John still gets upset when you swear in front of him , even though he ' s in sixth grade now . " I really wish Kelsey was coming . She has her driver ' s license , and last year she drove us to the mall a couple times . There ' s no way Samantha will do that . If we ask her , she ' ll probably just roll her eyes and say something about how we should all be volunteering at a soup kitchen instead . This is going to be awful . "
