" I ' ve really rediscovered the simpler things in life , " Wallace continued . " Who knew the pleasures to be found in just taking a walk around the city ? Or walking around the mall for a few hours ? Or driving down to the gas station for a sandwich ? That ' s what I did earlier today , and it was great , absolutely great . There ' s lots of tremendous stuff to see at the gas station , if you just take the time to notice . "
