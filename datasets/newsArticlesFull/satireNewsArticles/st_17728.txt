Continued Toothpick : " These credit card companies are monsters . They care nothing about the damage they ' re doing to the American landscape by driving us out . Loan sharking was about more than giving people money and roughing them up when they didn ' t come through . It was about ruffling a kid ' s hair on the street , helping out a local fella who needed a break , and occasionally letting somebody off easy with just a couple of punches to the gut instead of a glass filled sock to the face . It ' s a unique part of our shared national experience that , once extinct , will never come back . "
