" Now that my son is out of the house , desperately searching for a job and having no luck , I ' m really glad we put aside all that money , " said Karen Franklin , a 41 year old mother from San Diego . " My husband and I took great pains to make sure our kids would have an easier time than we did when we were young and unemployed . Things are more expensive now , but hopefully we ' ll be able to cover him for the first year or two . "
