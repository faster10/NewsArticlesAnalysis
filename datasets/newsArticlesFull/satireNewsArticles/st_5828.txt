" This is America , " said Duane Collins , a Gatlinburg , TN , distillery operator and father of five . " And in this country , we have the God given right to change laws we don ' t think are Christian . We are united in our demands that the second law of thermodynamics be repealed , and our voice will be heard no matter what . That ' s just a plain fact , and nothing anybody says can ever change it . "
