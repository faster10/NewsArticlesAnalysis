Lovingly replenishing Sheldon ' s lettuce supply and refilling his special personalized food pellet distribution device , Frye removed the squat , near immobile animal from his tank for his daily bathtub swim in several inches of lukewarm water . Frye then cleaned the droppings from Sheldon ' s aquarium habitat , rinsing out the bed of multi colored pebbles and placing fresh pebbles where necessary , pausing periodically to " check in on " the turtle with queries like , " How ya doin ' there , lil ' buddy ? " " You doin ' okay in there ? " and " Havin ' fun just swimmin ' around ? "
