" At present , the IKEA epidemic is mostly limited to the coasts , but if the populace isn ' t educated about the very real aesthetic dangers of IKEA , more lifestyles will be lost all across the nation , " Greeves said . " Just last week , we received a report about a young man who ' d moved to Wyoming to go to college . His very first week in the dorms , he went to the IKEA web site . A week later , he broke out a bright red Klippan sofa . He ' s just 18 years old , the poor guy . No matter where he ends up going in the coming years , he ' ll be carrying the IKEA sofa . "
