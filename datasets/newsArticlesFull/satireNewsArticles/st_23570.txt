" I know it ' s traditional to tell a guy exactly how great the team is , and what a great city it is , and stuff like that , " said Oswalt , who returned to his home in Houston Thursday night after what he called a " stressful whirlwind tour " of the Rangers facilities and the city of Dallas proper . " And they did that , showed me around , but kept saying how Dallas had all kinds of people , and how they were pretty accepting , and no one was going to judge me , especially because I ' d be a star there . I wasn ' t really sure what the big idea was at first . "
