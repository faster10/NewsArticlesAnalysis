Item ! It ' s the battle of brainy cars ! At a recent car and truck show , attendees were delighted to find both KITT ( from Knight Rider ) and Viper ( from Viper ) . I have it on good authority , though , that KITT wasn ' t as pleased as the fans , though . Apparently , the prima donna automobile was fit to be tied at the prospect of having to share the road with this young buck of a car . Hey KITT ! Cool your engine block !
