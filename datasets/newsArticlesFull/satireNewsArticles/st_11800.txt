" By the time we had to catch the bouquet , we were all pretty much fed up , " bridesmaid Helen Perry said . " The fight really freaked everyone out Elaine ' s family is pretty strict , and that ' s putting it nice . No one was mingling , and everyone was just sort of sitting quietly at their tables and waiting until they could slip out unnoticed . But when the DJ announced that all the single women should line up , that guy Gary ran over , jumping and clapping and pretending to be really excited to catch the bouquet . Elaine ' s dad gave him a look , but Gary didn ' t seem to care . "
