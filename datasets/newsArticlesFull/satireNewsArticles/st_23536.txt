" This guy I know named Pat was going to lend us 40 to print 200 copies , but then he wound up spending the money on Widespread Panic tickets , " Thornberg said . " So after that , we decided to print just 50 copies , but the guy at Kinko ' s said if we printed that few , the price per copy would be twice as much . So we were like , ' Forget it , man , we can ' t swing it . ' "
