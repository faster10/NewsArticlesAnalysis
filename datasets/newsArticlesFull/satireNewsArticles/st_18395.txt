" Please don ' t hate me for what I ' m about to say , " said an unidentified 44 year old male from Syracuse , NY . " I ' m not against a disabled child having a creative outlet . And I don ' t expect Shakespeare here . But ' flower petals ' ? ' Warming a kitten ' s nose ' ? It ' s terrible . And notice how , toward the end , he always has to shoehorn in a reference to God . Almost every single poem is like that . "
