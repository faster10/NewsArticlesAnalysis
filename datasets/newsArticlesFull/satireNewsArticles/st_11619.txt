" The Lord has answered a little boy ' s plea to know if he would ever walk again , and that answer was no , " Rev . H . Newman Gunther of the San Francisco School Of Divinity said . " For years , this boy had been plagued by the question of whether or not he would ever walk , and now Our Lord , in his wisdom and mercy , has forever laid to rest any lingering doubt . Young Timmy can rest assured in the immutable truth that the Lord has bestowed upon him . Now and for all time , he finally knows that he will never escape the cruel prison of his chair of iron , for God hath willed it so . Praise be to God ! "
