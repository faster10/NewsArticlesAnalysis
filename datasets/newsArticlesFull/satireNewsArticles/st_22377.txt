" Sure , we ' ve been through some hard times , especially those dark days in 2012 and 2013 when we pretty much stopped bombing Iraq entirely , " former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in his closing remarks to the group , raising a glass of champagne as the room followed suit . " But we started right up again , like we always do , and we ' ve seen thousands of new airstrikes since . Our enemy may change , but from Saddam to the Islamic State and through all the I don ' t know how many insurgencies in between our mission has remained the same . We ' ve stayed true to our roots and kept the tradition of bombing Iraq alive . "
