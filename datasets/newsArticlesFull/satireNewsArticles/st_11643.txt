" Many people hear my name in connection with the Christian Right and start to assume we are aligned in some capacity , and I ' m here to say , for the record , that we are not , " God continued . " So let me just be clear : I don ' t want women to get raped not ever . I don ' t think their resulting pregnancies are my divine will . And if a woman is raped , then she has the right to get an abortion , period . I do not agree with Mourdock . I do not agree with the Christian Right . End of story . "
