" When you ' re a bishop , you church hop constantly , performing the Eucharist throughout the diocese , " said Boland , whose diocese covers 20 counties in northern California . " Like , I love to worship God in the joyous celebration of the Mass and sacraments , but the whole thing never really changes . At some point , I went from ' I can ' t believe I get to do this ' to ' I ' m going to be doing this for the rest of my life . ' "
