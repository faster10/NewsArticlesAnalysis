The well worn copy of Oui a Playboy spin off published by Hugh Hefner in the ' 70s and ' 80s has been held by 22 Shawano boys since its February 1974 purchase . With the exception of its original 18 year old buyer , who hid it in a woodshed where it was discovered by a group of boys in January 1976 , the magazine has never been in the hands of anyone over the age of 16 .
