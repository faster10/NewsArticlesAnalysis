" This is a great addition , " said Steve Connolly , a Charlottesville banker and frequent McDonald ' s customer who tried out the new McDonald ' s Tuesday . " I was enjoying my Arch Deluxe Value Meal , had to go to the bathroom , and saw that there were already three people in line for the stalls . The wait might have been a problem , but to my great pleasure , there was another McDonald ' s restaurant right there , ready to serve me more hot , tasty food . And the service was quick and friendly . "
