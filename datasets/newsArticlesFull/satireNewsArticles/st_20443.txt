When the keg was tapped , Greaves and his team went looking for a place to gather more data . " We heard there was this awesome study on Church Street , but we didn ' t have the address , so we just went wandering around , " Greaves said . " We eventually wound up walking into this complete other study where we didn ' t know anyone . Unfortunately , it turned out to be totally lame most of the people there were in the non drinking control group . We had fun for a little while busting on them , but pretty soon we split . "
