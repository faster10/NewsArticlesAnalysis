" I don ' t know what it is about me , but I ' ve never been afraid to try new things , " Hodge said . " Remember when they put the crisped rice in the middle of M Ms last year ? I wasn ' t scared . Or when they added that cookie layer to Reese ' s Peanut Butter Cups ? Even though I had no idea what it would be like , I dove right in without thinking twice . I just try to keep an open mind about new experiences . "
