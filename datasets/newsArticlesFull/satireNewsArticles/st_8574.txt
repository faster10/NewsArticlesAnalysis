" Tenchumaru ' s first arrow severed Haller ' s vocal cords , silencing him without hitting any of the major arteries or veins in the neck and without penetrating deeply enough to touch the spinal column , " Skokie Police Department ballistics expert Ken Draper said . " An arrow was then fired into each of the seven henzoitoichi , or major nerve clusters , of Haller ' s body . Though the hits themselves were not fatal , the excruciating pain killed Haller within 10 seconds . "
