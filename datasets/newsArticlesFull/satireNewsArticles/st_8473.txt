" People were being mean to me , and I was very , very sad , " Rigby said . " So I ranned sic away . I took the bus all by myself for the first time . I saw a Waffle House , and they fed me for free when I said I was a senator . Then they called the police to pick me up . I got to ride in a police car ! I ' ve ridden in a police car and a limo and a fire truck since becoming a senator ! "
