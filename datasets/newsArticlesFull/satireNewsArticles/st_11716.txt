" Yahweh , or Allah , depending on what name you choose to call Him , has finally brought to bear upon this place a direct route to peace , " said former president Jimmy Carter , who in 1978 brokered the Camp David Accords , one of the region ' s many short lived peace agreements . " Lord knows that I and many others before and since Camp David have done our best to find a way for these two peoples to stop the killing and hatred , to no avail . But God , in His infinite wisdom , realized that it just isn ' t worth it anymore , and that the best thing to do is cut His losses , drown the whole lot of them , and start fresh once the raging waters subside .
