" Let ' s take a look at the evidence , " said ECFR senior fellow Gregory Lunsden . " In Matthew 15 : 14 , Jesus says , ' And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch . ' He says nothing about some gravity making them fall just that they will fall . Then , in Job 5 : 7 , we read , ' But mankind is born to trouble , as surely as sparks fly upwards . ' If gravity is pulling everything down , why do the sparks fly upwards with great surety ? This clearly indicates that a conscious intelligence governs all falling . "
