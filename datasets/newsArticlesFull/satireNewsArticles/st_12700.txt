" Every Wednesday , they have an open mic night down in the U . C . basement , just like on MTV Unplugged , " Knopecke said . " The basement ' s the coolest : It ' s like a bar , with pool tables and dartboards , only you don ' t have to be 21 to get in . That ' s definitely gonna be one of my main hangouts come September .
