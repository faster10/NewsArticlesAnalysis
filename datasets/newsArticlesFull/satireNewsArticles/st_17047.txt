" Jason Giambi is just so naturally funny , " Mussina said . " I keep telling him he should submit . But he ' s more of a performer . He ' ll come up with the funniest things off the top of his head . Me , I prefer sitting in front of a computer for two , three hours , and really sort of crafting the jokes . Jason could do it if he wanted , though . He ' s really , really funny . "
