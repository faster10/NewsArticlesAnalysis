New law to link hackers with stock photos of hackers
POLICE are to get new powers to link computer hacking suspects with the shadowy, menacing figures seen in stock images. The law will help cybercrime units struggling to find hackers who work in near-darkness, lit only by the eerie glow of their outdated 1980s greenscreen monitors. Detective Inspector Emma Bradford said: “We see these sinister figures, their faces always hidden, mocking us in every newspaper story about computer security. “But when we raid their homes we find only ordinary people using MacBooks with the lights on who don’t resemble these terrifying images even slightly. “Using these new laws we can arrest people then take pictures of them in silhouette, wearing a balaclava, against a background of ASCII text. “There isn’t a jury in the land that wouldn’t convict.” A hacker, wearing a hood pulled low over his eyes so nobody can identify him at his keyboard, replied: “Got to type fast to steer this military-grade Chinese icebreaker through the firewall and break into that raw data. “Not really. Actually I just guessed your password was your stupid dog’s name.”
