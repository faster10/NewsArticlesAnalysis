Twitter Fury After Man Calls Leonard Nimoy One Trick Pony. Which He Was. There, I Said It.
Fans of Star Wars actor Leonard Nimoy who was buried in Los Angeles in a small, private funeral on Sunday are said to be enraged after one man dared to call the actor \"a one trick pony\".  Nimoy, 83, who died on Friday of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is often caused by smoking, was famous for playing the role of Dr Spock on the hit 1980's TV show set on a spaceship in a universe, far, far away.  The tweet, sent by plagiarizing, joke stealing and self styled \"award winning and bestselling author\" Duncan Whitehead, has been re-tweeted twice and has led to threats from geeky men who masturbate into socks. The offending tweet which read \"Let's be honest here. He wasn't a great actor. He was mediocre. He probably got the role because of his pointy ears in the first place. He wasn't exactly Daniel Day Lewis was he?\" has since been deleted.  According to angry fans Nimoy's career also took in other roles, directing, writing and photography. Fans claim his two books, I Am Not Spock and I Am Spock made no reference to his role as Dr Spock.  \"He directed Star Trek III: The Search for Spock in 1984,\" screamed one fan in block letters on twitter \"that shows diversity right there.\" His photography collection, according to fan and self published pamphlet author David Hughes, included \"lots of photos of him dressed up in character.....as Spock. Who is this Whitehead fucker anyway?. What has he ever achieved? Tool.\"  Whitehead though is unrepentant. \"Oh for fucks sake....he played a emotionless, straight faced character with big ears. I think I may have seen him in an episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E with his ears taped down once. Yeah, I am sorry he is dead, but he was 83, this isn't the end of the world. Everyone is mourning Spock not Nimoy. There. I said it - again. He wasn't fucking Anthony Hopkins!\" \"
