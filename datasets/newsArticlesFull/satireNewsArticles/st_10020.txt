" The world is full of strange , isolated cultures , but the American suburbs are unique among these in that virtually no culture exists there , " Green said . " Even the Eskimos living in the most barren , remote Arctic regions have whale bone art and beautiful storytelling traditions . The odd part about these suburbanites is how , unlike the Eskimos and other isolated groups , they live in close proximity to places brimming with art , life , and vitality . Yet somehow , they shut all of it out . We don ' t know the reason for this , but I don ' t think anyone wants to spend enough time in the suburbs to find out . "
