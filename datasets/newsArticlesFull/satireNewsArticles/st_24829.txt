Last Thursday , four months after hanging up his red RE MAX blazer , Parker was drawn back in for one last big score . " I was out on the porch , taking a little nap , when I hear a guy walk up , " Parker said . " I tell him go away , I don ' t want any of whatever he ' s selling , thank you , when a voice I never wanna hear again says he might have a job for me . And I think , oh , Christ . It ' s Sneaky Pete . "
