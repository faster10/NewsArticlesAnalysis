Miss Sorenstam , hitting from the ladies ' tee throughout the tournament , finished with a 6 under 282 for a two stroke ladies ' victory , just barely holding off little ladies Soo Yun Kang , Michele Redman , and Lisolette Neumann . " I thought I had a chance to catch up to her , but there was no stopping that lady today , " Neumann said . " All you can do is lower your eyes demurely , curtsy , and say ' Congratulations , ma ' am , ' in a meek tone of voice befitting a lady . "
