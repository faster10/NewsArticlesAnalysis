" It is positively preposterous that we are considering spending taxpayers ' hard earned money on this presidential hop frog , " said Sen . Jesse Helms ( R NC ) . " My hop toad Beauregard is the three time jumping frog champion of Currituck County , North Carolina , and it rose to such heights without the benefit of any public funding whatsoever . " Helms then challenged Clinton to put The Colonel up against Beauregard in a best of three hopping contest on the banks of the Potomac River .
