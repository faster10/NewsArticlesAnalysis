George Zimmerman and Darren Wilson Scheduled To Box Live On Pay-Per-View
Some are calling it the most anticipated battle royal of the 21st century. Trigger happy neighborhood watchman, George Zimmerman, will go toe to toe with this month’s most reviled boy in blue, the one and only, Darren Wilson. The match is set to air  Christmas Day 2014 on HBO as a pay-per-view feature and is expected to draw viewers in the millions. Famed boxing instructor, Howard Kronk, decided to organize the match after watching the fiasco following the shooting of Michael Brown. “It’s obvious the world harbors a great deal of animosity for these two men. This is a way for them to redeem themselves and also provide entertainment for those who may be on the fence in regards to their opinions on current situations these two are mired in.” Others weren’t so thrilled about the event, and found it both tasteless and exploitative. Several Ferguson residents voiced their displeasure over the Zimmerman VS Wilson match. “Mr. Kronk is essentially making a mockery out of some very serious civil-rights issues and profiting from it.” Said Linda Turner, who has been protesting the Wilson decision since last week. “We need him to know that this is not a game. What he is doing is extremely disrespectful. We hope he makes the right choice and decides to put a stop to this unfortunate match.” Multiple Ferguson and Florida residents were oddly supportive of Kronk’s efforts to bring the fight to the public. Ferguson resident Shaniquiliqua Washington was ecstatic over the possibility that she might be able to watch former officer Darren Wilson get what she described as his “just desserts”. “I can’t wait. I can’t mother——- wait! I hope that mother—— gets beat to a mother——- pulp! It’s kind of confusing because, you know, I’m not exactly cheering for Zimmerman for what he did to Trayvon, you know what I’m saying? My first pick is Wilson because he did that —- in my own hood you know? He deserve it more.”
