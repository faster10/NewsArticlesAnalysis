" Mary Ellen was the first woman in our family to attend college , and she ' s extremely well read and well traveled , " Kelleher said . " She ' s raised two terrific children , Patrick and Stacey , and she ' s a public librarian , so if Ralph ever needed research material on a given topic , she could get it for him in no time flat . Maybe I ' m getting ahead of myself here , but I would be happy to provide the necessary introductions , should Ralph be passing through Bowling Green during his campaign . "
