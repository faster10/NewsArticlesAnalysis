LAUSANNE , SWITZERLAND The International Olympic Committee announced Monday that final selections had been made for the panels that will judge ice hockey teams in seven different categories , including technical achievement , overall impression , and artistic interpretation , during competition at the 2006 Turin Olympics . " It is an honor to be chosen to help usher in this exciting new era of international hockey , which finally takes its place alongside all other skating based sports in using a more enlightened scoring system , " said former Russian national team goalie Vladislav Tretiak , who will grade teams in the men ' s hockey events on their offensive and defensive performance in the crease and behind the net . " I look forward to working with the other 11 men and women on the panel , and urge viewers at home to enjoy judging the games themselves and comparing their results to ours . " The new system is intended to be more fan friendly , more intuitive , and less absolute than the old system , in which winners of hockey games were chosen based on points scored .
