" You listen to me now , people , " said the 6 ' 7 " , 320 pound two time AWF champion , speaking directly into a nearby camera . " I want to say something to all my former partners in the Coalition Of Wrong , to all my former tag team partners , from the War Pigs to the Stink Squad , and to my now ex girlfriend Lustula . I have seen the light . I will no longer be a bad example to children everywhere . I thought you were my friends , but I was wrong . You thought you could control me , but you were wrong . And at Battle Among The Cattle , next month in the Calgary Saddledome , you ' ll all see just how wrong . "
