Beginning Nov . 12 , all participating fast food restaurants will begin serving a maximum of two ketchup packets with any hamburger based meal . If a patron desires additional ketchup , he or she will have to fill out a special three page Ketchup Request Form , which must then be presented to a manager on duty for evaluation .
