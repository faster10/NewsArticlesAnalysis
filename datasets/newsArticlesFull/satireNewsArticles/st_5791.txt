On Mondays , Christ works His chest and biceps and completes three sets of 10 transfigurations . On Tuesdays , He switches to triceps and abdominals , and passes as many sets of Last Judgments as He can in a minute . Wednesdays are devoted to the back and legs , and Thursdays and Fridays are for core and flexibility .
