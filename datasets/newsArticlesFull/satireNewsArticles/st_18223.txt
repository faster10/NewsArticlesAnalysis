NASA is continuing to perform extensive endurance tests on portions of the 700 million , including acclimating it to extreme atmospheric pressure by deploying a sample stack of 200 million to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean strengthening its resilience in high temperature conditions by sealing it in airtight containers and lowering them into the lava flow of Hawaii ' s Mauna Loa and replicating the high acceleration environment of space travel by shooting bundles of dimes out of magnetic rail accelerators at thousands of feet per second into giant axial fans .
