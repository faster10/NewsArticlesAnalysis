" When high school graduates enter the world , they meet people with whom they share common interests , " said Dr Sharon Kesselbein , a Kansas City based psychologist and former public school guidance counselor . " While being cast into a wider world can be disorienting , it can also be liberating and enriching . The young person discovers that he isn ' t so strange or misbegotten , as he ' s opened up to friendships with people who are making similar discoveries and experiencing a similar openness . So none of this happened to Glick , huh ? Really ? "
