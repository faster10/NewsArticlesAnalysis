Red Cross rescue worker Lauren Elson said the camp has some semblance of an organizational structure , with certain decisions made by individuals at the Shoney ' s sponsored Countryfest Info Tent . A crude communications system also exists , with edicts periodically broadcast live on 94 . 7 KTTS , Springfield ' s Hot Country Mix . Though a set of camp rules was posted near the Fat Jack ' s BBQ Ribs stand , lawlessness was still the norm .
