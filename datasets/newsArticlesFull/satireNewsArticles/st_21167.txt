" Let this circle of flowers brief , beautiful , and too soon gone symbolize the respect we have shown for the memories of those innocents who lost their lives on that sorrowful morning by creating this great hole , " said the Reverend Charles Bourne of Lower Manhattan ' s Trinity Chapel as the flowers sank into the brown , debris strewn runoff at the bottom of the cavity . " I firmly believe , as does every person here , that this deep , empty hole has come to stand not only for the New York City of today , but also for the transformation of the entire United States since Sept . 11 , 2001 .
