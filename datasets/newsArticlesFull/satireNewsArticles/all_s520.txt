Ted Cruz Briefly Detained at Texas Border by Immigration Officials
CNN is reporting that Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was briefly detained by immigration officials this afternoon following an event held in McAllen, Texas.  Cruz was apparently heading back to Houston when US Border Patrol detained him at a checkpoint at approx. 4:15pm. Speaking before the press, Agent Percival “Biff” McCauly believes he made the right decision. “I grew up in Arizona and had the honor of serving under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, so my Mex-dar is pretty well honed. I asked him for his green card, which he refused to hand over. When that happens, the bracelets come out. That’s just policy.  These immigrants are tricky.  Several of these light-skinned Mexicans dress him up in khakis and loafers and try to pass themselves off as Americans.  To complicate matters, Mr. Cruz was only able to provide a Canadian birth certificate and a shady story about Mexican parents and US citizenship.”  Cruz was released following an interview with supervisors at the scene. The Senator was in town with Glenn Beck as part of a publicity stunt, “Soccer Balls and Teddy Bears”, with the intention to feed, clothe and provide toys, bibles and copies of Beck’s latest book to illegal immigrant children who have gathered at the border.  Cruz, himself an immigrant, has been critical of the response from the White House on the issue of immigration and was hoping to further enhance his image with the Latino community. Cruz came under attack earlier this year for his ambiguous national status, and was forced by liberals to surrendered his Canadian citizenship.  As the son of former Castro supporter, Rafael Cruz, Ted’s credibility with establishment Republicans is often questioned. Famed liberal Jose Antonio Vargas, the outspoken gay/illegal, was also detained at the border this week while boarding a fight.  Vargas was also released shortly after his capture.
