" I got chills when he quietly looked at every player there , and everyone in the locker room could see how profoundly moved he was , " said Wolverines tailback Mike Hart . " Then he told us , ' You know , men , it isn ' t your fault , but this whole thing is really a bunch of bullshit . I ' m proud of you and all , but there ' s nothing at stake here , so have a fun little football game and don ' t get hurt . Now I think I need to go lie down , because the thought of my beloved Michigan going along with this pointless crap is making me sick . ' "
