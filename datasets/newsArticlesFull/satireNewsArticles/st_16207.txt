" In Chicago , I ' m constantly surrounded by talented musicians , " Ruskin said . " The last thing I need right now is a bunch of competent songwriters putting in their two cents and truthfully telling me that what I ' m doing is just awful . How can I reach my self indulgent musical nadir if I ' m getting a bunch of sober , reasonable advice from people who know what they ' re talking about ? "
