" At the end of every session , after the other senators have gone home , Freddy will follow me around , asking if he can mop , " Capitol custodian Larry Gibson said . " I say , ' Now , come on , Freddy , you ' re a senator now . You ' re a lot more important than old Larry here . Why don ' t you go draft a bill or serve on a committee or something ? ' He ' ll usually go away for a while , but then he always comes back carrying a full wastebasket , saying , ' I like to help you , Larry ! ' He won ' t leave his limo driver alone , either . "
