" We ' ve always been interested in expanding our brand to involve fans of every possible stripe , " said ESPN president George Bodenheimer at the gala WESMC premiere party at the ESPN Zone restaurant in Times Square Monday .

This new show was designed from the ground up to give them the kind of deep , meaningful competitive experience they don ' t get from normal sports entertainment shows . "
