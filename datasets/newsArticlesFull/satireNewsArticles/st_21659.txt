" When it comes down to it , school isn ' t for everyone , " said Education Secretary John King Jr . , who applauded the nation for its efforts but conceded it was time to try something different . " The American people have put their heads down and given it their best shot , but something ' s just not clicking . While we ' ve offered lots of encouragement and plenty of hands on learning experiences , we ' ve seen very little in the way of scholastic achievement . We need to accept that maybe the United States just isn ' t cut out for this . "
