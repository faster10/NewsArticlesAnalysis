" When I heard we were getting involved in Syria , right away I thought , ' Well , here we go , it ' s 1456 Belgrade all over again , ' " said Seattle resident Matt Haggerty , 42 , who , like millions of Americans , says he " in no way supports the idea " of getting entangled in any military campaign even remotely similar to the Ottoman invasion of the Catholic Balkans . " Look , we all know what happened in Belgrade : Mehmed II thought he had everything under control , but Hungarian nobleman John Hunyadi organized a peasant army of roughly 50 , 000 soldiers and relied on the strength of the city ' s castle to breach the Ottoman ' s formidable naval blockade , which prevented any further imperial advances into Europe for roughly 70 years . And frankly , like most of my friends and neighbors , I see very little separating what we ' re about to do in Syria and what the Anatolian corps did during their all out assault on the Belgrade fortress from the Danube River .
