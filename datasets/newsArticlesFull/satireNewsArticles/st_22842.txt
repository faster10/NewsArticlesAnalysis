HOUSTON A rooftop sniper armed with an automatic rifle opened fire on a crowded downtown intersection yesterday , killing four and leaving area police officers greatly unimpressed . The seven minute shooting spree , which also critically wounded at least 20 others in a busy lunchtime crowd , was described by the officers as " uninspired and " lame . "
