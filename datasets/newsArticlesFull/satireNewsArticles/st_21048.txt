The violence continued that evening , when the severed heads of 20 Chechens were paraded through the streets of Jericho by Azerbaijani extremists . The killings are thought to be in retaliation for rocket attacks by a band of pro Armenian Chechen rebels , who have thus far evaded Azerbaijani attempts to flush them out of their encampments in the hills with prolonged shelling .
