" The runes of prophecy are clear , " Biehlke said . " They indicate that in the darkest of times , when all seems lost to the non believers and the 4 . 99 patty melt special has done poorly , the Foretold One will seize the handle of the Spatula and , holding it aloft , lead us into a Golden Age , a glorious time when competing restaurant chains such as Denny ' s and Perkins will fall like swatted flies , and countless hungry travelers and friendly locals will pass under the neon sign of Grandma ' s and fill their bellies happily . The One will rise to become the greatest leader in the history of the food service industry . . . Cook of Cooks , Manager of Managers , Lord of Hosts and Hostesses . "
