" I ' m now at the point where something Tom Vanderbilt calls ' The Big Momentum ' is about to kick in , and I start building on my past successes , " Horton said . " My next pathetic goal is to force myself , no matter how depressed or listless I may feel , to tackle the pathetically huge pile of laundry that ' s been accumulating in my room for months now . I ' m giving myself one month to get it done . After that , my next goal will be to get some sort of shelf or something to put the clean clothes on instead of just piling them next to my mattress like I ' ve always done . "
