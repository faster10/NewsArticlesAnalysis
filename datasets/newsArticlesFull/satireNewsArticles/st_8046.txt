" I thank God that no souls perished today in this infernal blaze , " said local pastor Cyrus T . Jebediah , speaking to a coughing Soledad O ' Brien as authorities assessed the damage to the building . " Everyone in Hempstead helped quell the flames .

Made me proud to be a Hempsteadian , I ' ll swear to that . "
