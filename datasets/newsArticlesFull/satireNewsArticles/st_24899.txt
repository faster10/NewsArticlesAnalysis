" The principles of Terranometry state that the Earth resonates on a very precise frequency , which it imparts to the surfaces it touches , " said Dr Wayne Frankel , the California State University biotrician who discovered Terranometry . " If the frequency of one ' s foot is out of alignment with the Earth , the entire body will suffer . Special resonator nodules implanted at key spots in MagnaSoles convert the wearer ' s own energy to match the Earth ' s natural vibrational rate of 32 . 805 kilofrankels . The resultant harmonic energy field rearranges the foot ' s naturally occurring atoms , converting the pain nuclei into pleasing comfortrons . "
