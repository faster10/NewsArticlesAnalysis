Manny Arora , Jones ' attorney , said that Jones was " genuinely sorry in advance " about the incident , but was not at liberty to answer questions regarding his relationship with the one to three men who will be seen fleeing the vicinity covered in blood . Jones refused to confirm that the weapon to be used in the stabbing , a seven inch pearl handled hunting knife , will in fact be given to one of the men by Jones himself this coming Friday morning .
