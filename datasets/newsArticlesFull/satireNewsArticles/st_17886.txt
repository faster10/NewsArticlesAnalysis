According to Mormon officials , The Word Of Wisdom , the prophetic Latter Day Saints health code given by revelation in 1833 , prohibits the use of tobacco , strong drink , tea , and coffee . While the use of Benadryl is not specifically discussed in the gospel , church elders believe that the drug is prohibited due to its dangerous mood altering side effects , including nervousness , excitability , and drowsiness .
