" Peabody ' s impact on the Senate had been negligible , " CNN political analyst Mark Shields said . " When he would try to go to the floor to offer his opinion on the Financial Regulatory Relief Economic Efficiency Act of 1999 , he found that the big , mean senators would block his way , and he ' d have to return to his little seat . And the only legislation he ' s authored , S1156 , the Letting Small People Have Their Say Act , was laughed right out of committee . Needless to say , this made the Littlest Senator very , very sad . "
