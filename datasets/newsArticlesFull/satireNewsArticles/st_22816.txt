Tuesday ' s incident is the latest in a series of car alarm crises to plague New York in recent weeks . On Oct . 26 , a 1993 Saturn ' s car alarm went off for over three minutes in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn before police , hampered in traffic by an overturned truck , could arrive on the scene . On Nov . 5 , a 1996 Mazda Miata ' s alarm went off in midtown Manhattan , causing panic for several minutes until order could be restored . And last Thursday , a car alarm went off in Kew Gardens , Queens , when a man who had left his keys inside his 1994 Geo Metro attempted to open the door with a bent coathanger .
