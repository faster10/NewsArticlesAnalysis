" It ' s about time you folks woke up and smelled the coffee , " Spring Green , WI , packaging plant manager Bert Seiffert said . " ' Sorry ' has never cut the mustard with me . That ' s what I said to that slacker Oppley when he came in five minutes late for the third time this week . I said , ' Sorry is a pretty sorry excuse , if you ask me , ' and I docked him for an hour ' s pay . He said , ' Hey , Bert , that ' s not fair . ' ' Hey is for horses , ' I said . "
