" I ' ve use the copier for my own stuff once in a while , like , maybe to copy an order form from a Fingerhut catalog or some quilt patterns , but that ' s it , " said senior sales associate Donna Wilke . " Besides , I don ' t think it ' s our department that ' s causing the problem . I always see people from payroll using our copier on their way to lunch . "
