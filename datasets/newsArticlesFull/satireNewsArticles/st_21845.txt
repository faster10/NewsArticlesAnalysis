" The sirens are really loud , " said San Francisco resident Linda Pearcy , shouting over a horn posted in her backyard . " My dog won ' t stop barking , and the windows rattle all day long . And I didn ' t know about the helicopters dropping all the orange slips of paper . I guess I can ' t complain , though . These are scary times , and the government is doing what it can to make us feel more secure . "
