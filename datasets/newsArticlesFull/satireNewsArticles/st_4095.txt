" The problem is we ' re complacent , " Campos said . " This stock index is satisfied with 12 , 000 points when it should be shooting for 14 , 15 , or 16 , 000 . You can ' t be afraid of success . You have to lay it on the line , trust one another , and leave it all on the floor every single day . "
