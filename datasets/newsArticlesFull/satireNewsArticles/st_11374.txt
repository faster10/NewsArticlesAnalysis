" I remember when I used to come home and watch Blinkers chew through old cardboard , squeaky toys , file folders , wood chips , plastic tubing , Kleenex boxes , Styrofoam cups anything he could get into his mouth , really , " Kerlin said . " He just loved to chew . He still does , but it ' s just different now , you know ? "
