" For the last 30 years I ' ve made my living acting in movies , and now , going forward , I have to say I ' m leaning toward continuing to do so , " Willis said on Monday , explaining that if he had to think about what line of work he is most suited for at this stage in his life and career , he would most likely say acting in Hollywood films . " When I finished making my last feature film , I was faced with the decision of what to do next . I mulled it over for a few days , and then I called my agent and said , ' I think I would like to appear in another feature film . ' And he said , ' Okay . ' "
