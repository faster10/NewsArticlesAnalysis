" Every night at dinnertime , " Clint , 33 , said , " I gather the whole brood around the table , mute the TV , and thank the Lord for the many gifts He has given us , and apologize to Him for the fact that the kids ' fat sow of a mother burned the damn meatloaf again , and ask Him to give us the strength to put up with this pig sty of a house for many more years . Then we say Amen . It helps a lot . "
