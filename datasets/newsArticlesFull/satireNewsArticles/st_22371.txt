Also present were Iraq War architects Condoleezza Rice , Paul Wolfowitz , Doug Feith , and Richard Perle , who admitted to reporters they felt overwhelmed by nostalgia throughout the event as they reconnected with old faces and shared laughs over the discredited intelligence that served as the basis for military action .
