Norville Tucker , who moved his family to the woods outside Shelby , AL in 1998 to " escape the damaging cultural influences of urban Mobile , " is widely credited with pioneering the home churching movement . Tucker said he was inspired to home church when his 10 year old son Macon returned from Sunday school singing a lighthearted song about Zacchaeus , a tax collector befriended by Christ , and then later recited the parable of the Good Samaritan .
