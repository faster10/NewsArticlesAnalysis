" I actually would ' ve gotten a lot of stuff done Friday if the whole universe hadn ' t been against me , " Olson said . " I took my car in to get my tires rotated , but the guy said he couldn ' t get to it until the following Tuesday , so I was like , ' Screw that . ' I also went to Staples to pick up the computer desk I ' d had on layaway for the last month , but I forgot to bring my receipt . They wouldn ' t give the stupid thing to me , even after arguing with the guy for almost an hour . The whole day was a colossal waste . Except I got a new belt I needed for work . "
