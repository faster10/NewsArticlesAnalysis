Murdoch journos in crisis as ‘making things up’ added to ‘not-allowed’ list
After the trial against Tulisa Contostavlos collapsed due to lies told in court by a Sun on Sunday reporter, those at the Murdoch-owned paper have been left panicking over what they can put in this weekend’s edition. Judge Alistair McCreath told Southwark Crown Court he thought Sun reports and prosecution witness Mazher Mahmood had lied in giving evidence, prompting the response of “Yeah, and?” An insider at The Sun told reporters, “I’m not sure where this leaves us to be honest. We can’t hack phones, we can’t make things up – what else are we supposed to put on our many brightly-coloured pages?” “I suppose we could try reporting some actual news, but do you know how much work that actually involves?” “Right now I can sit here and crack out 500 words on any given celebrity with nothing more than a cup of coffee and my imagination. Easy as you like.” “If what we’re being told is that newspapers must only report so-called ‘facts’ and ‘the truth’, then frankly we’re screwed.” “We might as well turn the Sun on Sunday into an A4 flyer that just lists the people who work here.”
