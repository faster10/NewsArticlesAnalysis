Created by a design team who chose to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from the Bilderberg Group , the memorial has as its centerpiece the " Truth Towers , " a 60 foot tall replica of the World Trade Center that houses a museum devoted to unanswered questions surrounding the attacks . Below it lies a pentagonal reflecting pool from which emerge 18 steps leading to the base of the monument , with each stair intended to symbolize one of the 18 Great Lies of the 9 11 conspiracy .
