" On a first meeting , I always bring something neutral like Heineken in cans , " Iwanski said . " It ' s an import , so it says ' I care about beer , ' but since it ' s in cans , it says ' I ' m no snob . ' If you bring anything too fancy or too cheap , it tips the study too far in one direction . "
