" He stood there and told us that no matter how well or how poorly we played on Saturday , how many yards we gained , how many tackles we delivered , that it didn ' t matter . Because we were the Michigan Wolverines , and win or lose , the Wolverines were almost certainly going to play in the championship game . "
