So disturbed was Erasmus van Ghent , burgomaster of Ootgroot , that he called upon a local garrison of Spanish mercenaries to put down the chaos . Witnesses report that the Spaniards took to their work with relish , impaling many with pikes , severing codpieces and setting huts ablaze . Within minutes of the Spaniards ' arrival , the peasants scattered to parts unknown , and a relieved van Ghent rewarded the garrison with guilders and sacks of saltpeter .
