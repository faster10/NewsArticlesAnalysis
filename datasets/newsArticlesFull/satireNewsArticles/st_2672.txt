" How I loved to stroll down the promenade arm in arm with my best gal , Dorothy , " Fletcher says , shifting in his chair as he pages wistfully through a faded old scrapbook . " We ' d talk and laugh , unconstrained by bulky plastic sacks tied to our waists , and go into all the shops never to buy anything , of course , just to look and to dream . We ' d wander along the boardwalk all evening , she with her blue Gainsborough hat and I with my clean underpants , all the while holding hands and not ejecting fecal matter from our anuses . "
