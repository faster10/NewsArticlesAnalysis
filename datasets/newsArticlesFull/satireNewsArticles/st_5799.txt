Added Christ : " What if the Virgin Mary had decided to abort me ? Certainly she must have been tempted to do so . After all , it wasn ' t even her decision to conceive me in the first place . But in the end , she made the right decision , bringing her pregnancy to term and giving the world a Savior . Blessed is she among women . " According to legal experts , if convicted , Christ could face the death penalty .
