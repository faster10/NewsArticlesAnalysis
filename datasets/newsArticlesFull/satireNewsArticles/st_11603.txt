" I don ' t care how holy somebody claims to be , " God said . " If a person tells you it ' s My will that they kill someone , they ' re wrong . Got it ? I don ' t care what religion you are , or who you think your enemy is , here it is one more time : No killing , in My name or anyone else ' s , ever again . "
