" Public schools , from what my servants tell me , now offer Hispanic and African American students special counselors who are sensitive to their unique needs as minorities , " said Manhattan socialite Virginia Des Jardins , founder of One Percent Nation , a newsletter dedicated to increasing awareness of minority elite issues and raising identity consciousness among one percenters . " Where are the counselors who can relate to our special needs ? Unless you were raised in an environment with 17 maids , you cannot possibly understand what it ' s like . And day after day , as the economic gap between us and the masses widens , the situation only worsens , and we become ever more marginalized . "
