" We believe the past is larger now than it ' s ever been before , " said College of William and Mary professor Timothy Gibbon , lead author of the report , observing that whole generations of people have already become a part of history , and that if nothing changes , an untold number more can expect the same fate . " Many things that are in the past today were , during our parents ' and grandparents ' time , still in the present or even the future . Based on precise measurements of its size , we believe the past has subsumed every single person and event that has ever existed . "
