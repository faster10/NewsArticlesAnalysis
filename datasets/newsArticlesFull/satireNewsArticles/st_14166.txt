" Last March , Jesse Jackson stood smiling in front of the East St . Louis housing projects in near freezing weather during the ' Positive Image ' campaign , " Morton said . " In June , he stood with his arm around former President Jimmy Carter at the site of a proposed community center in Atlanta . Last month , he slaved under the hot flash bulbs at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center , standing at the bedsides of victims of gang related shootings . And every week , he bravely faces CNN cameras to host his Both Sides With Jesse Jackson program . "
