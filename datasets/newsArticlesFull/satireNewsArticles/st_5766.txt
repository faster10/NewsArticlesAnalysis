" Jesus , or Isa Shabazz , or whatever He ' s calling Himself these days , is the way , the truth and the light . It says so in the Bible , " said devout Catholic Kathleen Langan of Cork , Ireland , kneeling toward Mecca for the first time . " My loyalty to Him is absolute . If He told me to be a Buddhist , I ' d do it . All praise and thanks to Allah . "
