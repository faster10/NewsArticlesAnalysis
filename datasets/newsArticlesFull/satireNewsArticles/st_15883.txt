" Often when I ' m at home I ' ll hear them on the radio , " Smith said . " On the TV , too , if I pay attention . And now and then , if I listen closely , I hear them on my phone , especially when I ' m talking to Chicago Bears GM Jerry Angelo . They ' re also there when I eat in restaurants or go grocery shopping even when I ' m at church and it seems that no one ' s talking but the pastor . They ' re sort of taking over my life . "
