" A ceramic , reusable mug is the most environmentally sound choice for coffee drinkers , " Toomer said . " But a mug only makes you feel good once at that moment when you first buy it . On the other hand , using a new disposable cup made from recycled materials every single day will make you feel like you ' re doing your part to help the environment every single day . "
