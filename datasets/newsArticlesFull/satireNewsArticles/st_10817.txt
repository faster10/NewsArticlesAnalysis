Said Tampa , FL , resident Helen Neimaier , who lost more than 20 , 000 hours to sitcoms from 1951 to 1998 : " Every night , it was something different , yet completely the same : Mrs Roper would mistakenly think Jack was giving Chrissie love lessons when he was actually giving her cooking lessons . Or Webster would learn an important lesson about playing with fire . But we were given nothing of substance to watch . And we would go to bed , only to begin again the next night at 8 p . m . , 7 Central and Mountain . "
