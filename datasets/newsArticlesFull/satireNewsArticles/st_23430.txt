" In order to reduce swelling , we lowered Alvin ' s body temperature by pumping an ice cold saline solution into his little veins , " said head veterinarian Dr Richard Cooper , adding that an emergency tracheotomy was performed when Alvin was admitted and that the puppy is currently breathing with the aid of life support machines . " But with the severity of his injury , he ' s going to have a long road ahead of him . There ' s a chance he could live , but it would be a difficult life . He would never be a normal dog . "
