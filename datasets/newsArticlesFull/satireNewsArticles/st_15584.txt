" This is one of my personal favorites , " said Garcia , sliding open the door to unit 235 . " Look at the sparseness of the arrangement here 252 cubic feet available , and the customer has stored only two boxes , stacked one on top of the other . There ' s a Zen like quality to the arrangement . One box holds women ' s clothing , the other photographs and letters , both of which seem to have once belonged to an ex girlfriend . They ' ve been here for six years , and the guy keeps paying the rent . Makes your head swim with possible scenarios of failure . "
