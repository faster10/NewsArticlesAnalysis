" Our friends have been very supportive of our relationship , especially our friend Trent Matthews , " Miyatake said . " But he ' s a DJ , so now , after the Boston ruling , he keeps talking about how fun he would make our wedding reception . He called the other day to say he ' d just been trying on new tuxes , in case we gave him a reason to need one soon . Who does that ? "
