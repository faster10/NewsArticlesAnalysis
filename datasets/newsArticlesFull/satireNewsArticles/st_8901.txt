Peters said the Department of Transportation plans to construct some 1 , 400 of the new lanes over the next four years , all of which will feature a special bowl design to keep cars in the lane while drivers are sleeping , drunk , applying makeup in the rearview mirror , receiving or performing oral sex , or drumming along on the steering wheel while singing " The Immigrant Song " at the top of their lungs . Padded concrete embankments and steel rail barriers will line the lanes in urban areas , and rumble strips will be cut into the pavement every 100 feet in an attempt to help keep drivers alert .
