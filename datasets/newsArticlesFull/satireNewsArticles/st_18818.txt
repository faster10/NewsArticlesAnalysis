Throughout the address , the nation emphasized the humility , grace , and joy with which Griffey embraced the national pastime . They talked about buying his batting gloves and signature baseball cleats as children , imitating his stance and perfect home run swing in batting cages , and how they would ask their father ' s to hit long fly balls so they could make " Griffey esque " catches in centerfield . They talked about his 1989 Upper Deck rookie card , and how , instead of going down in value with every hamstring injury , it should have skyrocketed in price with his 800th , maybe 900th home run . They talked about the guy who made wearing baseball caps backwards cool . And they talked about the elation they felt when Griffey became the first one to ever hit the Camden Yards Warehouse during a monstrous shot in 1993 ' s Home Run Derby .
