" Basically , we feel that there are a lot more important things in this life than selling shoes , " Knight said . " When a Nike commercial ends , and the ' Just Do It ' logo fills the screen , it means a lot more than ' Just Buy The Shoes . ' It means ' Live Your Dreams . ' It means ' Make It Happen , Children Of the Earth Find The Courage To Go Out And Make The Most Out Of Life . ' I don ' t want that beautiful message of hope and inspiration tarnished by crass commercialism . "
