" With Alan , you never see it coming , " Ulster said . " You ' ll be discussing something you really enjoy like , say , surfing or whatever and you think he ' s engaged and agreeing with you , and then bam ! He pulls the rug right out from under you with a spot on remark about how it ' s a pretty feeble attempt to recapture one ' s long past youth . He ' ll get you every time with that one . "
