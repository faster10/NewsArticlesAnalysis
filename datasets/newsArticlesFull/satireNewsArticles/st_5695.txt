Despite the new , broadened time allotment , expectant employees are encouraged to speed the birthing process by breaking the amniotic sac membranes themselves . The expectant mother will be responsible for thoroughly sanitizing every affected area , and will also be discouraged from using factory instruments such as tongs to facilitate the birthing process , unless it is the only means through which she can remove the baby before the allotted 15 minutes elapse . The new mother would then be docked three days ' pay to replace the implement .
