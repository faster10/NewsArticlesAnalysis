" If you look at the data , our students were correctly spelling Roethlisberger only 43 percent of the time during the quarterback ' s rookie season , " said Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl , who called the 2004 statistic an embarrassment . " In just five years , we have increased that number to 92 percent . That ' s 54 percent better than students in California , 35 percent better than those in Oklahoma , and 96 percent better than those in the Cleveland area , who tend to spell Roethlisberger by adding the letters ' u , ' ' c , ' and ' k ' after the letter ' s .
