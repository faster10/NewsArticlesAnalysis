" It ' s impossible to pull off the typical dog food delivery schedule and meet federal safety standards at the same time , " Sanders said . " Every day , in kitchens across the U . S . , drivers run their teams at full gallop through routes that traffic control knows damn well are dog occupied . But the traffic controllers look the other way , because , if they didn ' t , delivery quotas would never be met . Drivers whip their teams up to full speed and chance it , hoping either to outrun or out maneuver the dog , figuring they can always pivot at the last minute and send the animal sliding across the linoleum if it gets too close . That way , management is happy , and they get to keep their jobs . "
