Rarity , once a prerequisite for an item to have collector ' s value , is no longer relevant . An early sign of this shift occurred in the early ' 90s , when Marvel Comics encouraged fans to pre order multiple copies of the much hyped " Todd McFarlane ' s Spider Man 1 " because of the book ' s anticipated collector ' s value . The issue sold more copies than any comic book in history , but fans still hoarded multiple copies in special dust proof Mylar bags , in part because of its unique status as the least rare comic book ever .
