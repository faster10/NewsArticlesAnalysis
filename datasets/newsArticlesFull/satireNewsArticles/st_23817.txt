" Christmas Day is something our whole family greatly looks forward to , drinking egg nog , opening presents , sitting around the family room in our pajamas and robes , and sipping hot cocoa throughout the day , " said Marv Langan , 51 . " Well , you can forget about that this year , with Barb hovering over us with her Bible . "
