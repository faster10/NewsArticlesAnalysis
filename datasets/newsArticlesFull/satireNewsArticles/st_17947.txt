" I am truly not radical , " Ruderman continued . " I am nothing now , only an empty shell . I shall leave for the Land of the Lame , to live amongst the lepers , half castes and dweebs . My name will vanish from the world , insects will crawl on my sores all the days of my life , and crows will alight atop my unburied corpse , and feast there on my flesh . "
