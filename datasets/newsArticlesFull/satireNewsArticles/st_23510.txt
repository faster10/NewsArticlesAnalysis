" We were very concerned that the high school had no black students , and that none of the students at the school had ever known any blacks , and that there were no blacks living anywhere within the neighborhoods zoned for the school , " Blochner continued . " We said to ourselves , ' This is unfair ! ' and were determined to change reality for the better . So we decided that in our fictional version of the school , we would put in a black kid , and we ' d make it seem like he ' s smart , too . "
