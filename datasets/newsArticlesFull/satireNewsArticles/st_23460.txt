" I believe if I have a girl , I shall give her a pretty name such as Amberjill , Erline , or Cleva , " Queen Elizabeth said . " However , if it is a boy , he will be both child of and father to all Britons and therefore will need a dignified name such as Blaxton , Dalbert , Arkwright , or Egerton . "
