" I twisted my ankle something awful a few months ago , and the pain was so bad , I could barely walk a single step , " said Helene Kuhn of Edison , NJ . " But after wearing MagnaSoles for seven weeks , I ' ve noticed a significant decrease in pain and can now walk comfortably . Just try to prove that MagnaSoles didn ' t heal me ! "
