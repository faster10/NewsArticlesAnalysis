" I feel like I ' m at an age where ' s I ' m too old to just like rock and rap and R B , " Bergkamp said . " I still really prefer it , but to have a few Charles Mingus CDs in your CD collection is a nice way to make you feel like more of an adult . Plus , if I ever feel like listening to something without lyrics , it ' s there . "
