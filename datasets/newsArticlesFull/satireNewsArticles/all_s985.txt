Cliff tells pals ‘We’re all going on a summer holiday’
Cliff Richard aka Harry Webb has surprised close friends by announcing a spontaneous open-ended return trip to Portugal. Bachelor boy Cliff, 87, insists the break is the perfect opportunity to spread the gospel to fishermen who have lost faith in stringent EU quotas. And Mr Richard reckons the next two weeks are the best time to go what with the schools being off and the UK subject to thorough house searches. Cliff’s pals, meanwhile, have suggested the famous line ‘No more worries for a week or two’ may be a bit wide of the fucking mark. Pal, Simon Williams, said: “Although temperatures are set to hit forty degrees in the Algarve this week, Cliff is used to spending plenty of time in The Shadows.” Cliff has chosen the beautiful coastal resort of Punta Umbria, which is traditionally a magnet for those with an interest in watersports and small buoys. Police have been eager to speak to the clean-living octogenarian after allegations he starred in a saucy sixties film called The Young Ones. Although Richard denies allegations of impropriety, experts claim he has always possessed an undimmed enthusiasm for ‘performing’. Last night far more important shit was happening elsewhere with lots of people being killed.
