" When we here in the Arby ' s family got to brainstorming new sandwiches , we figured a combination of Arby ' s delicious , hot roast beef , crispy bacon , and fresh lettuce and tomatoes , topped with a zesty pepper jack sauce on a fluffy Kaiser bun , would be a winner , " Shepherd said . " But somehow , the end result was , well , edible , obviously , or we wouldn ' t sell it , and possibly even savory or delectable to someone who is very hungry . But great ? Certainly not . In the final analysis , our Beef ' N ' Bacon sandwich is merely ' good . ' But , hey , meat is meat . "
