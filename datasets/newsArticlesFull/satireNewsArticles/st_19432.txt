" Luckily , only one of the Dodge Daytona ' s crew members , the pilot , was a member of the McManus family , " McManus said . " Had there been multiple family members on board , the loss would have been more difficult to sustain . But as such , only one of six , or 17 percent of total McManus family members , were lost . "
