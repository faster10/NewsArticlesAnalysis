" Los Angeles is a perfect football city , " said Gene Washington , the NFL ' s director of football operations . " It ' s a mystery to me why no team has been able to make a go of it here during the modern era , when places like Pittsburgh and Green Bay enjoy rabid fan bases . Obviously , the solution that has always eluded us is to move the most popular teams here . I ' m sure the die hard followers of the Glendale Steelers and the Orange County Packers won ' t abandon their teams over a little thing like geography . "
