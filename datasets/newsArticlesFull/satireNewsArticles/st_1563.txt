" I truly appreciate the support I ' ve received from Eagles team officials , but this is really something I have to handle on my own , " Reid said . " I believe the old saying that a football team is like a family , and in any family , you solve your problems yourself through hard work and honesty . Right now , I can ' t ignore the real problem : The Eagles family is 3 5 , we ' re going through a crisis where it ' s becoming hard to trust each other , and while I might not want to admit it , people are unhappy and communications have begun to break down .
