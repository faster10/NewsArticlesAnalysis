" I ' ve never seen anyone with such an acute olfactory sense , " Lasser said . " Last week , a delivery came in .

Without even opening the box , Celine told the FedEx man that someone had made a mistake , and that the box contained Douglas fir needles . When we opened the box , we found out that she was right .
