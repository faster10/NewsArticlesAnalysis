Microsoft buys Minecraft to find out what it is
MICROSOFT has paid $2.5 billion for computer game Minecraft to see what it does. The 90s computer giant said the name sounded interesting and could possibly form part of its strategy to do something involving young people. In a statement to the New York Stock Exchange, Microsoft said: “Apparently you build things. That’s as far as we got.” Minecraft player Kyle Stephenson, aged 11, said: “You can spot the Microsoft people a mile off because they’re wandering around aimlessly looking for something to buy, or copy. “I told them they have to build things, but they said they’re only good at building one thing 20 years ago and living off the proceeds forever.” Microsoft also plans to buy the new Taylor Swift album, the Hunger Games books and one trillion loom bands.
