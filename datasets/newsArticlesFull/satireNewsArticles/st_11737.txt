" The Lord may want to enact retribution for all the people who died in cars , like my daddy did when I was 7 , " Gurshner said . " But unless the Lord directly tells me to torture Ford , or beat him , I won ' t . One thing I will not do is make love to the Ford CEO ' s asshole , no matter what the Lord says . That activity is a sin against nature . An order to do it would be God ' s way of testing me . "
