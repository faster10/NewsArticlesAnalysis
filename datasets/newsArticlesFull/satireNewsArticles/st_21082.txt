Reports of the highest order , released by officials of the highest order , confirmed a number of other events that absolutely did not happen . At 6 : 42 p . m . , two fully manned paramilitary transports failed to arrive at the scene , and , as a result , did not send the already frightened crowd into a mass panic . After not being loaded into the nonexistent vehicles , the protesters were then not driven , deep into the night , to a remote rice field .
