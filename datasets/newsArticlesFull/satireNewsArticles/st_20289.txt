" At ElfquestCon in ' 84 , we were told that there was marijuana present , " Kenneth Osoms , 25 , said . " My older brother said he had seen a marijuana smoking pipe with some charred marijuana leavings , but this I never witnessed . That is all I have ever seen at any con . This year at GenCon , I felt kind of sick after eating a corn dog . "
