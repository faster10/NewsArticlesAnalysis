" To determine whether our new Revlon SureHold hair spray is safe for human use , we will take a rhododendron , remove it from its natural soil based environment , and strap it into a leather restraining harness , " Revlon researcher Warren Gilbride said . " The plant ' s leaves will then be scraped raw and soaked in SureHold , and the spray will be injected into its stem and poured into its flowers . The effect of this treatment on the overall health and well being of the plant will be meticulously recorded , and the product ' s likely effect on humans will be extrapolated from the results . "
