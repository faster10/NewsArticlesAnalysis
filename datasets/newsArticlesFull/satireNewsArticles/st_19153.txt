" I stuck it out , I really did , " a saddened Janus said . " I tried to make it work . But Star Wars just didn ' t hold up its end . A relationship is a two way street . If George had told me he didn ' t want to do any more Star Wars movies after the original trilogy , yes , that would have hurt . But it would have been better than dragging me along like this . What he ended up doing was just passive aggressive bullshit . "
