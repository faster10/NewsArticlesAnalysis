" We ' re so happy that we were able to get Tyler a gift he really wanted this year , " Hannah Greenberg said . " You wouldn ' t believe how hard he is to shop for . He ' s so picky about his movies . For his birthday , we gave him The Wedding Singer . I thought all the kids liked that Adam Sandler Cory said he sings a song about Hanukkah . Well , boy , was getting Tyler that movie a mistake ! "
