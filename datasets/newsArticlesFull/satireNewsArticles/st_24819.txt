" I took them to a great Szechuan place , and they were upset about it not having sweet and sour chicken or chow mein , " Brulley said . " I told them that ' s Cantonese style , and that this was authentic Szechuan . They looked at me like I was from China . I don ' t think they realize different parts of a country have different styles of dishes . They certainly don ' t realize that countries that speak the same language don ' t always have the same food . "
