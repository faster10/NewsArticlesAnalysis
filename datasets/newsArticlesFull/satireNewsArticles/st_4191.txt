Not everyone who took in the sight of Favre ' s pants being taken in thought it would be a good fit in the Green Bay system . " Favre should do himself a favor and hang it up right now , " said Milwaukee Journal Sentinel sportswriter Cliff Christl , who watched from the packed Lambeau Field press box along with reporters from 48 different news organizations . " You can talk inseam , sleeve length , taper and cuffs all day , but this is a game of inches , and I just wasn ' t impressed with what I saw out there . There ' s a certain standard that Green Bay fans expect , and that suit just doesn ' t measure up , not to the suits Favre wore in his Super Bowl seasons , not even to Bart Starr ' s old suits . "
