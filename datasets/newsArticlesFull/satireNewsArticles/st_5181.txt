" We ' ve got a system , " Brant said . " Our strategy is to bet against all the customers who come in here . Then we spread our bets around to each and every table and machine in the casino and keep at it for the long haul . We were down about 200 at one of the roulette tables , but were up on everything else , so we came out pretty much ahead . Actually , more than half a million ahead . "
