" The idea is to treat the leader of the free world like any other major league pitcher , " said W . Ralph Basham , the director of the president ' s Secret Service detail , who has supplanted the head of security at the ballpark for the event . " Of course , we ' ve had to get the NSA to brief the catchers for both teams , sweep the place for bugs , and outfit the entire facility with advanced electronics to prevent the stealing of signals . There will also be complete personal searches performed on all spectators , so we ' re asking fans to show up at least six hours before game time and carry three forms of identification . And all popcorn , peanut , and beer sales will be performed by fully trained special agents . "
