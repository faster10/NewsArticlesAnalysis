Sources nationwide confirmed that the Chicago area billboard is just one of many advertisements for the Seinfeld inspired situational comedy . A second version of the advertisement , seen in many cities throughout the country , reportedly features Seinfeld pictured with a bespectacled , balding man , a dark haired woman , and a second taller and more frazzled looking man , all of whom are hugging one another , leading many to conclude that these individuals are also characters in the show and may be part of Jerry Seinfeld ' s fictional family , the Seinfelds .
