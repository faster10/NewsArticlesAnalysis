Police are currently looking for leads at a Lester Avenue laundromat just four blocks away from the corner where the bra was found , as well as in a nearby residential area where pranksters may have stolen it from a clothesline before discarding it . A sketch artist has also produced a composite rendering of the bra owner ' s torso , which is believed to be at least 55 inches in diameter . Police have provided local media with the sketch and are urging citizenry with any information about the enormous bra to come forward .
