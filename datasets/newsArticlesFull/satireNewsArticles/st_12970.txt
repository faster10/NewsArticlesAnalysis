Horkheimer is currently receiving oxygen treatment at Dade County Hospital . Though he is listed in stable condition , doctors stress that he is not out of danger at this time . To minimize the risk of relapse , he is being kept in a locked room under strict orders not to be allowed to observe the night sky between 9 : 30 p . m . and 2 : 30 a . m . through April 21 , when viewing conditions are considered most favorable .
