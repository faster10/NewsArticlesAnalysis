" I had a hard time concentrating on work today , " said Aberdeen , MD , insurance claims adjuster Jim Freund . " Seeing those UPS guys in their short pants made me want to run home , grab my baseball glove , and head over to the park . As thanks , I think I ' ll stop off at my local UPS office and send a five pound parcel to Hagerstown at the two day shipping rate . "
