" This is great for the league , but I ' m not sure it ' s the best thing in the world for the players , " McNabb said . " The anxiety made me throw to wide receiver Todd Pinkston a half second before he turned and looked back for the ball I mean , looked for the can of Campbell ' s new Chunky Chili . If I hadn ' t felt so much pressure to please the advertisers , I wouldn ' t have hit him in the forehead with that pass . I also believe that , if he ' d been wearing a traditional helmet instead of a KFC bucket , he wouldn ' t be in the hospital right now . "
