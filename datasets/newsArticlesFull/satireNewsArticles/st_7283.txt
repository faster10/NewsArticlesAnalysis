Scientists are calling the current decrease in biodiversity one of the worst episodes of mass extinction in the Earth ' s history . The rate at which species are currently vanishing approaches that of the " K T Event " that ended the Age of Dinosaurs 65 million years ago and resulted in a loss of 76 percent of the world ' s species . The current era of biodiversity depletion , however , is unique in that it is the first mass extinction to occur in conjunction with an expanding industrial society , and thus , the first in which consumer product availability can function as a " balancing factor " to help keep global diversity thriving .
