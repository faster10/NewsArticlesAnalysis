" Standing there with my hand on an ice cold doorknob , I heard strange , unnatural sounds leathery wings flapping , a sorrowful wail , and loud hissing . A wave of dread passed through me as I opened the door , but all I found was Michael and some kids in pajamas eating ice cream and watching 101 Dalmatians . "
