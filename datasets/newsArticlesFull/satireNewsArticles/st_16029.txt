" If we were jumping Tony ' s car a year ago , Jay would have been right up front , cheering the loudest , " Orr said . " But when the car got stuck , and we had to dig it out with a tire iron , Jay just stood there shaking his head . You could tell he was thinking we ' re idiots . Acting stupid isn ' t much fun when there ' s someone around who knows better . "
