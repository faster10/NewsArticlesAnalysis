" Last Saturday , on a gorgeous spring afternoon , I was jogging in Central Park with my daughter . We were marveling at the beauty and majesty of nature , and I remember thinking what a wonderful world we live in . Then , out of nowhere , I heard the gunfire , " said Kanner , speaking from her hospital bed at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center . " All they took was a measly 17 , and for that , the doctors say my daughter will never walk again . If only Our Holy Father didn ' t have those mental problems , my precious Katie might not be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life . "
