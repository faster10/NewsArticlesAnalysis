Kopecke , a Spencer native who had traveled nine miles to neighboring Marshfield in order to " find something to do " Saturday , was accompanied by fellow Spencer High School graduates Amanda Rutt and Christine Combs . The group had been circling the mile long stretch of Central Avenue between the Rainbow Foods near the water tower and Lutz Funeral Home for nearly two hours before Kopecke spotted the neon light .
