" Kyle , I love you , true blue , so I say I do , " she says , reciting a poem she wrote for an English class in which she received a C minus . Speaking in an arithmetic , monosyllabic , uneducated drone , she maintains her pie in the sky fantasies of future family bliss with Leske in total disregard of her own vast lack of competence or skills in essentially any area . Desperate to procreate , not only from misplaced attempts at achieving adulthood , but also in a pathetic bid to preempt potential loneliness , she seems unmindful that her lack of maturity will result in the rearing of freakish , simian children whom she will viciously abuse , both emotionally and physically , in a vain attempt to stave off the agony of her daily life .
