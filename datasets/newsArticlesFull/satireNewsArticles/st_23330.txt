" Our zoo is dedicated to providing every one of our animals with surroundings that mimic their natural homes as closely as possible , which is why we ' ve built dozens of modern habitats that contain the precise types of discarded plastic and styrofoam packaging , acidified water sources , and industrial byproducts they typically encounter in the wild , " zoo director Michael LaForge said of the facility ' s trailblazing enclosures , which occupy more than 100 acres of largely drought ravaged and eroded land abutting a chemical processing plant . " In the past year alone , we ' ve spent over 20 million to systematically contaminate dozens of exhibits for our animals , from our freshwater pond tainted with hydraulic fracturing runoff to our temperate woodlands that we reduce in size every month through systematic deforestation .
