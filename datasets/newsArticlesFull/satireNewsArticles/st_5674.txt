In the past six weeks , Mattel Inc . has recalled more than 20 million toys from China that are believed to contain lead paint and other safety defects , a situation that prompted the Chinese government to send People ' s Liberation Army forces into major industrial sectors to mercilessly slaughter any remaining items that have not been exported for sale overseas . So far , an estimated 9 to 10 million toys , from anonymous dolls and miniature cars to trademarked characters such as Thomas the Tank Engine , Curious George , and Big Bird have been reportedly kicked , smashed with rifles , shocked with electric batons , hanged , and pounded with nails , before having their ears severed and eyes gouged out , and then being shot .
