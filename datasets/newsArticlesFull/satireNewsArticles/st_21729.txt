" You get friendly with some cocky chump who thinks he can pack it away , and you ham it up , " Rierden says . " You nibble at a few wings and say you had a big dinner , or complain about how spicy they are and maybe pop a few Tums for effect . After a couple of friendly challenges , you suggest making it interesting . Then you waste the dupe by pounding 40 or 50 wings in eight minutes and you ' re on your way to the next dump . "
