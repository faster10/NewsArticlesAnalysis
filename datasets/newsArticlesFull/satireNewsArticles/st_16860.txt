According to Gedman , Monday ' s spill has had an added benefit , providing the waters of the Bering Strait with an attractive rainbow sheen . " Before the spill , the water here was pretty much greenish blue all the time , " Gedman said . " Now we ' ve got a million different colors . It ' s quite beautiful : The oil ' s iridescent , rainbow colored shine is far more attractive than the algae and drab green colors of the plant life it replaced . "
