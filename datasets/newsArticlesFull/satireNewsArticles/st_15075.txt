As noted in the Retro Department report , the popularity of lava lamps at any one moment is difficult to gauge due to their varying status within different subcultures . As a result , the lamps often simultaneously occupy many different points along the retro cycle curve , causing confusion among retro cognoscenti . For example , in 1998 , computer dweebs considered the lamps " CyberKewl , " while swing dancing hipsters dismissed them as " lame a roony toony . "
