President Clinton , responding to the attack , made the following statement : " While , like the members of RIF , I support the eradication of illiteracy in the United States , I cannot condone the means by which they go about achieving this goal . Such acts of terrorism as theirs are unconscionable and cowardly , and must not be tolerated , even when done in the name of something as admirable as getting people to read . "
