" I flew Mustang fighters in World War II , " said Elroy Bruss , 78 , a retired United Airlines pilot . " In those days , the fuses were eight inches long , and we used to cut ' em in half before we took off so they didn ' t get blown out by the wind . Now some of the 747s have fuses 20 times that long . Men aren ' t allowed to be men anymore . "
