" You don ' t call a state with 991 votes between the candidates , " Rove wrote . " You don ' t do that . You never do that . And if you do , I ' m not the one who ' s crazy . You ' re the one who ' s crazy . You are the one who must be stopped . You are part of the liberal conspiracy trying to take hold of this nation . And I will be the one to murder you and the children you wanted to abort . I will be the one who stops the madness . I will rain bullets and hellfire on your heads . Say goodbye . "
