It fires the largest widely available cartridge in the world a machine gun bullet , really . It can empty a 10 round magazine as fast as you can pull the trigger . And thanks to its ingenious dual chamber muzzle brake , gases are vented away , and the user feels no more recoil than you get with a 12 gauge shotgun . Not that anyone should know what the recoil feels like on any gun . "
