" Oh , man , Malibu . That takes me back , " said Streeter , browsing the shelves of a liquor store while picking up a bottle of wine for a dinner party . " At Mardi Gras one year , me and my buddy Mo got totally smashed on that stuff at Pat O ' Brien ' s . I woke up on the floor of the hotel room the next day with a ' No Parking ' sign on my chest . I must ' ve ripped it down when I was drunk , but , I swear , I had zero recollection of doing it . And Mo had this girl ' s number written all over his arm , like , 100 times . Stay away from that stuff , man . "
