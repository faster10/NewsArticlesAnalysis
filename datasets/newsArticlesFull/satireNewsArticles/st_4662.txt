Asked by a Boston Globe reporter to explain the bite marks on three of the victims that perfectly matched Bush ' s dental records , the candidate said : " Look , you guys , I ' m just not going to get in the gutter with you and play that game . If you ' re interested in slinging mud , that ' s fine , but you can count me out .
