" If I know Hitch , by the end of the week , he and Noreen ' ll be back together , cuddlin ' and kissin ' , just as happy as two crawdads in a pond , " Sparta Police Chief Buck Perkins said . " We don ' t get a lot of ultra progressive agitators ' round these parts , but Hitch is okay . Plus , he earned a lot of points with the townsfolk for his vocal criticism of the anti war movement . Even though he was attacking the war opponents from the left , folks around here don ' t necessarily understand the implications of that , so he ' s an all right Joe in their book . "
