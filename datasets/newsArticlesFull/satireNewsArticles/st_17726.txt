" Call me old fashioned , but I prefer the loan sharks to the credit card companies , " said Gene Hobson of Detroit . " When I borrow money from Three Knuckles Benny , I know there ' s going to be a personal touch , whether it ' s a dead animal on my doorstep or one of my kids coming home with a missing toe . The credit cards just don ' t give you that sort of individualized attention . And , if you ' re late with them , it ' s a form letter and maybe maybe an irate call from the accounts receivable department . "
