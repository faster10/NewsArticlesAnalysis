According to Sgt . Bruce Stebbins of the Waycross Police Department , the brutal slaying will not be easy to solve . " Because the victim ' s beak is missing , dental records will be useless , " he said . " And , thus far , we have found no signs of struggle , such as scattered feathers or claw marks . Whoever perpetrated this brutal crime clearly knew what he was doing . "
