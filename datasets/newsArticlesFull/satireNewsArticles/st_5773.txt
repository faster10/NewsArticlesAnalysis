" For it is written , in Surah Al Maa ' idah 5 : 116 , ' And behold , Allah will say O Jesus Son of Mary , did you say to men , worship me and my mother as gods beside Allah ? He will reply Glory to you , I could never say what I had no right to say . ' " Christ said . " You see ? It turns out , worshipping Me isn ' t the key to the Gates of Heaven , after all . Salvation can only be found in the Five Pillars of Shahada , Salat , Saum , Zakat and Hajj . I can ' t believe how obvious it all seems to Me now . "
