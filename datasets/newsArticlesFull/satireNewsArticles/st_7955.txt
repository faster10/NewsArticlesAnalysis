" Winners seem to have an unknown quality that enables them to use drugs and keep on winning , " DEA head researcher and narcotics expert Howard Tobin said . " It goes against everything we know about drugs , but many of the drug taking winners we studied did not , in fact , become losers . They did not lose control of their lives , nor did they lose their loved ones , their jobs , their homes , or their physical or mental well being . There is clearly something at work here that we still do not understand . "
