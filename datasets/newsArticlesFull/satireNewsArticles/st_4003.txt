" It ' s always a special moment to watch our passengers ' eyes light up when they see their first whale struck head on and then get dragged underneath the boat , " McDermott said . " Sometimes we ' ll come upon a mother nursing her calf and we ' ll max the engines to take them both out in one charge , and on other days we ' ll get really lucky and a whale will spout its blood right onto the deck . It ' s a new experience every time . "
