" I can ' t believe they ' re all so closed minded , even Cheryl , " he continued . " Well , I ' ll eat every single one of those bags if I have to , even the sugared stuff I don ' t particularly care for . Or , better yet , I ' ll just pour the stuff into old boxes . Who ' ll know the difference ? Oh , man , I just remembered : I took out the trash , so we don ' t have the old boxes anymore . Maybe I ' ll buy a couple boxes of the expensive cereal , dump it out , and replace it with the bargain stuff . Wait , that wouldn ' t make any sense . Look , I ' m not changing my mind about this , okay ? "
