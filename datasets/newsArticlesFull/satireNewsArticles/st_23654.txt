ENCANTO , CA Real estate agent Jake Trammel shakes his head as he points out unsold house after unsold house in this San Diego suburb , where homes once went for half a million dollars or more . He pulls up to a Victorian mansion whose windows and door create the look of a leering skull . As the sun breaks through a storm cloud overhead , the illusion disappears , and Trammel admits that he hasn ' t had an offer on the haunted residence in 18 months .
