The decision was first handed down in New York ' s lowest circuit court , Shea Stadium , after presiding home plate umpire Ed Montague was unable to rule in the case . San Diego Padres catcher Ramon Hernandez , acting on the advice of now retired pitcher Pedro Astacio , then filed an immediate appeal with first base umpire Bruce Dreckman , who ruled against Wright . However , according to defense attorney David B . Reiss , in order for justice to be served , the decision must be overturned by the Supreme Court and the strike ruled a ball .
