" I told Lorraine a few things but , to be honest , I didn ' t want to be too critical , " Pfaff said . " Sure , there were a lot of things about working at ADP that I hadn ' t been too thrilled about , like the lack of inter departmental communication and the frequent overtime , but I didn ' t really know if I should go into it . Especially since I ' m still sort of hoping that maybe the budget cuts will be lifted and I ' ll get rehired . "
