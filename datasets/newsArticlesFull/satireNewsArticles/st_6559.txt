" If I don ' t go to shows , I lose touch with what people like , " Haley said . " You can ' t just exist in an ivory tower , like a lot of DJs do . Plus , I like to tell people on the air which bands I ' m going to be checking out that weekend . I want my listeners to know that I may be a DJ , but I ' m a fan first . "
