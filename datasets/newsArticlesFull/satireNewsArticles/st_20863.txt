According to tournament officials , the desperate call for players is not an uncommon practice for the NIT , which is now in its 50th , 34th , or 22nd year depending on who you talk to . Last year ' s selection committee was only able to get 25 collegiate teams to participate in the postseason playoff . In 2004 , only 10 NCAA teams were willing to play in the consolation tournament , making it possible for " The Montana Bar Bears , " a squad consisting of five lawyers from Missoula , MT , to win the entire tournament . The Bar Bears defeated Rutgers University in front of a record NIT crowd of 278 people .
