" Secondly , I ' m not the head of Warner Bros . , but if I were , and I were spending 250 million on a film , damn straight I ' d spend an extra 5 or 10 million or whatever it costs to put a living , breathing Heath Ledger up on that movie screen . Thirdly , everyone likes it when the bad guy from an older movie shows up in the sequel and talks about stuff that happened in the last one , so this seems like a no brainer to me . "
