" I don ' t want someone trying to sell me something with a ton of memory or RAM or anything like that , " said Moyers , adding that getting a computer with " all that graphics and sound stuff " would be a waste of money because he ' d never use it anyway . " What I need is something that starts right up when you turn it on and goes right to Google when you click on Internet Explorer . Nothing crazy . As long as it ' s compatible with Comcast , so I can get on the Internet , I ' m fine . "
