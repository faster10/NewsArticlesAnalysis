" I ' ve seen people stuffed into boxes with days ' worth of snacks , pillows , and portable radios , " said Knoxville , TN branch manager Carlo Estes . " One time I heard some soft whimpering coming from a box that was supposed to be sent to Honolulu that was just sitting in our sorting facility . And when I opened it , I saw a grown man wearing nothing but swim trunks and a pair of sunglasses lying inside , totally dehydrated and malnourished . "
