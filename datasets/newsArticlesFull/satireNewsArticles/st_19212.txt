" We have come together today to observe a Christian holiday that has been all but stamped out on the surface , " said a man who wished to be identified only as " Greg , " after hanging a figurine of Mickey Mouse dressed as Santa Claus from one of the shrub ' s boughs . " I can ' t say this humble bush is much of a Christmas tree , but it was the largest we could manage to get here , given the circumstances . Let us remember , though , that to merely celebrate Christmas to exchange gifts and eat our candy canes in peace without the government or the powerful secular elite coming in and destroying it is a blessing in itself .
