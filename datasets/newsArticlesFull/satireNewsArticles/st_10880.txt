" Fans shouldn ' t get too carried away , though , and look for elements of The Godfather in other movies I ' ve worked on , " continued Coppola , confirming that the Godfather storyline is only limited to the three films with Godfather in their name . " For example , Apocalypse Now is a film I made that ' s not part of the Godfather universe , which I tried to emphasize by not having Robert Duvall ' s character Bill Kilgore mention the Mafia just like Tom Hagen never mentions Vietnam . I was very careful about that kind of stuff . "
