" Unlike my Democratic or Republican counterpart , my staff and I insisted that this election be about the issues , " Bush or Gore said . " We refused to take the low road and stoop to dirty tricks in order to get elected . While Mr Gore or Mr Bush was busy with cheap innuendo and unfounded accusations , we were out there taking our message to the American people . And , judging from what happened today at the ballot box , you heard that message loud and clear . And I thank you . "
