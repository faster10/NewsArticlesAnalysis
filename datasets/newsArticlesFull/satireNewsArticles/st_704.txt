" I was watching their show last night , and they were doing a spot on the breakout new shows of the fall season almost all of them were Paramount shows , of course . Shameless corporate tie in . Okay , we do it sometimes , too , but not that bad . Anyway , at the start of this thing , they had a ' produced by ' line , and there were three names . How can it take three people to produce this one segment unless you ' re really overstaffed and stifling people ' s creativity ? "
