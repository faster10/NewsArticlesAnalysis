As of press time , a torrential rain continues to fall on Israel and the West Bank , with the downpour expected to continue for another 39 days and 39 nights . Thus far , flood waters have risen more than 200 feet , drowning most of the humans and animals in the vicinity . The few remaining survivors , most of whom cling to pieces of driftwood , have made desperate pleas for mercy , but their cries have fallen on deaf ears in Heaven , with the Lord refusing to stem the raging waters .
