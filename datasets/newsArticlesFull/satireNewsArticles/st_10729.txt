Fellow survivor Elaine Drenholt says her involvement with a cult drained her more than just spiritually . " I used to give all my money , resources , and time to the Cosmic Yoho Radiance , " she said . Drenholt proudly notes that these days , she spends most of her time volunteering at the Fellowship House , where she strives to earn salvation through charity , stewardship and volunteer work .
