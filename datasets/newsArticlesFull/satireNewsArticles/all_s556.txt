Selena Gomez Says Bieber Has ‘Tiny, Weird Penis’
 Actress Selena Gomez said today that ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber has a "ridiculously small" penis. In an interview with E! Entertainment News outside a charity event in New York, Gomez explained how the tween sex idol is under-equipped for the job. "We're here with Selena Gomez," started the reporter. "Wow Selena, you look amazing tonight! I bet that's the kind of outfit that would just drive Justin Bieber wild when you were together huh?" "I dunno ... It's hard to tell when Justin's excited because his dick is so small," Gomez answered. "Sometimes I would try to initiate sex by doing a strip-tease for him. And I couldn't tell if he was horny or not. It changes like 2 millimeters from flaccid to fully erect." The E! reporter, realizing she had an opportunity to make headlines, decided to goad Gomez into further disparaging Bieber. "How small are we talking?" she asked. "Smaller than an average-sized cucumber?" "Honestly, I've seen pieces of penne pasta bigger than Justin Bieber's cock," Gomez replied, "and the pasta's usually stiffer too. "I find it hilarious that there are all these millions of girls who dream about dating Justin Bieber and think that he's like some sort of sex god. "Ladies, unless you're an Asian midget with a correspondingly miniature vagina - he won't be able to satisfy you. Sorry. "And don't even get me started on the weird shape. His dick bends so much, it looks like someone attached the letter L to his crotch. "You know those breakfast cereals with pieces shaped like letters of the alphabet? That's exactly what Justin Bieber's penis looks like. A minature L from an Alpha-Bits cereal box." Selena Gomez is an actress best known for her work on the Disney series Wizards of Waverly Place and the recent Harmony Korine film Spring Breakers. This week she released a single from her forthcoming debut record album.
