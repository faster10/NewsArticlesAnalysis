" Len ' s been a real joy to be around lately , " wife Mary said . " He used to just mope around the house , watching football in his underwear and stuff , but these days , he ' s a dynamo of activity . He ' s even started playing racquetball at the gym every Thursday night . I ' m not sure what the change is , but whatever he ' s doing , he should keep it up . "
