" Obviously , you want to give your armed forces everything and tell them there ' s no limit to what they can achieve in this world , but sometimes that just isn ' t possible . " Wittman said . " Sometimes you have to ask yourself , ' Do I want them to have a new generation of Ohio class nuclear submarines this month , or do I want them to be able to fly their F 35 Joint Strike Fighters ? ' It ' s a shame to have to choose one or the other , but that ' s the sad reality our Joint Chiefs of Staff now face in this country . "
