" Sometimes a decidedly unsnuggly cat is redeemed by its air of grandiosity and haughtiness , " board member Joyce Reamish said . " Such is the case with our Cat Pic of the Month , a Siamese named Sheba from Grand Forks , ND . Sheba was photographed while poised on a mahogany table bathed in natural sunlight , the garden just beyond the window . The look on her face is 100 percent sassy . Mr Paws , on the other hand , is sassless . "
