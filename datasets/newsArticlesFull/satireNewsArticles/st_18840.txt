" Since the start of my candidacy , I have focused on the issues that genuinely affect the American people , " Nader said . " This recent interest in my personal life is not surprising , given the media ' s love of shallow , tabloid style celebrity journalism . Today ' s mainstream political reportage is more personality driven than issue oriented , to the great detriment of the democratic process . I thank the Coalition To Find Ralph Nader A Special Someone for its concern , and I ' m sure all these women are terrific , but these efforts are misguided . People would be better off spending their time focusing not on me , but on the things I have to say . "
