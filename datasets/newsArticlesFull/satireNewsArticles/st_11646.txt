" What these people are saying betrays a worldview that is , frankly , completely different from my own , and it embarrasses me to even hear my name mentioned alongside theirs , " God told reporters , emphatically . " For example , I ' m not into capital punishment at all , or really killing in general , so I ' m not sure where that whole talking point came from . On the same token , I don ' t like guns very much , and I certainly wouldn ' t say that everyone has a right to own guns that ' s absurd . Unlike Mr Mourdock and many Christian Republicans , I agree with the overwhelming majority of climate scientists that global warming poses a major threat to the planet and must be addressed . I also believe stem cell research is very useful , and I think that if you ' re gay , that ' s fine by me . "
