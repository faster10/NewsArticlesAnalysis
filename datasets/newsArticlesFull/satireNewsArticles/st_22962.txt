" By forgiving these children , primarily churchgoing boys between the ages of 5 and 15 , the pope has shown true Christian kindness , " said Father Thomas O ' Malley , a member of the New York archdiocese and one of the many priests implicated in charges of sexual activity with minors . " The pope is saying that , in their own way , these sinful youths are victims , too . Through their absolution , he sends the important message that empathy , contrary to what naysayers and critics in the secular media would have us believe , does have a place in modern Catholicism .
