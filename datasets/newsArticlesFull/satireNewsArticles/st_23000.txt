Although God is universally known for His compassion and mercy , members of the Roman Curia confirmed He can be demanding as a supervisor , with some speculating that because He is infinitely perfect Himself , He tends to have very high standards for others . They also said it is particularly difficult for popes during their annual employee assessments , as their direct supervisor wields so much power and , on top of everything else , is all knowing . Fortunately , they noted , He is " pretty forgiving . "
