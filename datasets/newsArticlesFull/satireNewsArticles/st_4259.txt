According to lead engineer Dr Gregory Spriggs , production on the towel alarm clock was not without its setbacks . In 2003 , the scientists experienced problems knitting a 470 microfarad electrolytic capacitor into the fabric , and in 2005 , work came to a standstill for weeks as they heatedly debated whether the alarm should be a " buzz " or " beep " noise . Last year , the scientists unveiled their first prototype , but the design had to be rethought following a series of injuries , numerous third degree burns , and one fatality during the product ' s initial testing phase .
