" I ' ve seen Gary on and off for maybe 12 years , and it has pretty much all been a wasted effort , " Dr Joan Aldrete said . " He ' s desperate for someone to listen to him , but , nine times out of ten , he won ' t even show up for his scheduled appointments because of some new crisis . He gets fired from work , or maybe some girl rejects him , and then he becomes so engulfed in self loathing that I don ' t hear from him for months . He ' s so wrapped up in his depression and misery that he ' s incapable of working toward a true healing . In my professional opinion , in all my years of counseling , I don ' t believe I ' ve ever met anyone I liked less . "
