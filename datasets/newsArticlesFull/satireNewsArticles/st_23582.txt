" When a forest drapes itself in flora of every color and scent imaginable , it ' s obviously asking for it , " Schickle said . " I ' m sure the plaintiff will argue that these radiant flowers were meant to lure pollen hungry bees , not pulp hungry loggers . But how was my client supposed to know this ? When was it made clear that this colorful display was meant to attract one particular species of fauna but no other ? When was it made clear that this forest was looking to satisfy the needs of bees and bees only ? "
