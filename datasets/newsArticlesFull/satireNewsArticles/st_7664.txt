" I came to stand in the presence of this wondrous miracle , " said Mark Cadwell , manager of the 625 million hedge fund Polestar Overseas , humbly placing a sovereign bond prospectus before the weeping bull and calling upon it to raise the credit rating from BBB to A . " My faith in free enterprise had been shaken deeply by the slowing growth in emerging markets , and I felt hopeless and lost . But as I submitted myself before this sacred figure , my mind opened to the vast possibilities of investing in distressed debt and inverse ETFs , and my belief in our economic system was fully restored . In its eternal wisdom , I have been reborn . "
