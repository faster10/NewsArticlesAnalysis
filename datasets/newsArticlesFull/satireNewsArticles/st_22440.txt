According to forecasters , this could be the best soup weather since the NWS started keeping records in 1909 , a year in which giant pots of spicy crawdad gumbo were seen as far north as Pennsylvania . In response , health professionals have set out important wellness guidelines . Dr Linda Naik , a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services , said that people in affected regions should ready themselves for snuggling into the warm , woolen collars of their cable knit sweaters and throw on an old black and white movie before digging into steaming bowls of soup at least as thick and rich as a tomato broth .
