Harvey Keitel is the baddest dude I ' ve ever seen act . And unlike my esteemed colleague , I ' ve seen a ton of movies . Three of my favorites are Blade Runner , A Clockwork Orange and Star Wars . Those are some cool movies . But Dogs , as it ' s called by people who really love it , like all my friends on my dorm floor ( Tremain House kicks ass ! ) , beats them all . It ' s like , POW , POW , POW !
