MacAlester said that as an outsider , he was a victim of discrimination from adults and fellow teens alike . " They told me the school didn ' t have enough funding for another gymnast , but I knew they were really kicking me off the team out of prejudice , just because I was different . One student even tried to plant a ' joint ' of ' weed , ' or ' grass , ' on me , to get me in trouble , " he said . " But after proving myself in a death defying bout of tractor chicken , I was able to win the other teenagers ' respect , enabling them finally to see beyond their narrow worldview . "
