Gondry ' s latest project has already garnered a great deal of interest among Hollywood insiders . Although the former music video director has thus far only invited Science Of Sleep actress Charlotte Gainsbourg over to play in the box , a number of A list actors , including Tim Robbins and Sean Penn , have expressed interest in getting involved in any way Gondry sees fit . Comedian Dave Chappelle , whose documentary film Dave Chappelle ' s Block Party was directed by Gondry , has also offered to perform a free concert in the box next month .
