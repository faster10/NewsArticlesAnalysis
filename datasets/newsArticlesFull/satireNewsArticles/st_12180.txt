" My heart goes out to Buster Posey , because I know he ' s in a lot of pain , but when his leg just collapsed underneath him and then he went limp and flopped down on the ground and didn ' t move That was probably the best thing to happen to baseball in 50 years , " said MLB commissioner Bud Selig . " And I wish him a speedy recovery . Hopefully he can get back on the field really soon and next time get both his legs broken . "
