Philae Probe Lands on Comet 67P-Discovers Life!
Darmstadt, Germany-Scientists were astounded today when the Philae Probe spacecraft, which has miraculously landed on Comet 67P, right away sent back pictures of a microscopic civilization located on the surface of the comet! What was probably more astounding was that the civilization spent its time watching 1950s television that was broadcast from Earth sixty years ago. "We could hear the Honeymooners TV show and Leave it To Beaver reruns being played from the special radio connection on the probe. This very well could have been the mystery civilization that broadcast to us a few decades ago that they would destroy Earth if we ever broadcast My Mother the Car again," spoke the head scientist.
