" Andy puts in really long hours at the show , " Tan said . " He ' ll generally leave his house around 9 a . m . and not get back until well after midnight . From what Andy ' s told me , for some reason , they make those guys work , like , 70 hours a week . Apparently , that ' s just common practice on sitcoms . I can ' t understand why : It ' s not like they ' re working to cure cancer . They ' re writing Just Shoot Me , for God ' s sake . "
