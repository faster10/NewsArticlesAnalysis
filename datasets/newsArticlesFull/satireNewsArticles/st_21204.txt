" I ' ve been helping to put on the Haunted House of Representatives since I was first elected in 1987 , and I have to say , I think I have just as much fun as the kids do , " said self proclaimed U . S . Representative Nancy Decompelosi while applying several fake lesions to her face and adding plastic spiders to her hair . " We jump out at the tour groups from both sides of the aisle , show them to a live meeting of the Wails and Moans Committee , and then , when they least expect it , the Shrieker of the House bursts out of his casket and delivers a long , terrifying chillibuster . And for the older kids , we have the gruesome Senate Torture Chamber , where they can watch as the sadistic Majority and Minority Whips viciously gut and kill a helpless bill right there on the floor .
