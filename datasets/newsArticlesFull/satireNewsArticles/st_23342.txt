" I waited for two hours to fill up my Qassam 2 rocket yesterday , and I could only afford half a tank , " said Hezbollah militant Amin Hammoud , who admitted to siphoning fuel from other rockets in his neighborhood . " Do you know how fast a Qassam 2 burns through half a tank of rocket fuel ? Even if I launched it from An Naqurah , it still wouldn ' t make the trip to Nahariyya . "
