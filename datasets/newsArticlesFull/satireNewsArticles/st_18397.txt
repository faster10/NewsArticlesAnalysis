" I don ' t consider myself some bitter , cynical crank who can ' t appreciate sincere sentiment , " Veronica said . " But the unrelenting cheerfulness is a bit much . When I read one of these Hopeweavings poems , I want to open my shirt collar and go out for air . God is always near , children are always special , and the sun is forever shining . I feel like somebody ' s cramming a rainbow down my throat . "
