In a routine papal blessing Sunday at St . Peter ' s Square , Benedict made far fewer mentions of Jesus than usual and only cited scripture twice , opting instead for such uncharacteristic phraseology as " Sorry if this sounds preachy , " " I ' m not here to judge , " and " Hey , this works for me , but by all means , feel free to do your own thing , too . "
