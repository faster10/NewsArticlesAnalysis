" It ' s wrong . It ' s just wrong , " Swarbrick said . " I haven ' t been able to keep food or fluids down since this . . . this March Madness began . Everywhere I go , I hear the cheering , the talk , and I see that goddamned bracket everywhere . Why ? Why are all these people so happy after watching a championship tournament ? How can they be happy without a network of polls and computers run by an arbitrary board of university executives to tell them who the champion really is ? "
