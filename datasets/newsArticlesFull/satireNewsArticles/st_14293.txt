" When John Sayles worked on the bill for increased health benefits for Alaskan fishermen , it was a beautiful , poignant bill , " said Sen . Ernest Hollings ( D SC ) . " It only got 11 votes in the House , but those congressmen who supported it were deeply moved . Not at all like that 220 billion asteroid defense system bill Jerry Bruckheimer put out a few years ago . It was a soulless piece of crap , but everyone showed up for that vote . "
