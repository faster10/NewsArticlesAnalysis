" I don ' t want to sit here and have an argument about who ' s alive or who ' s dead , because , quite frankly , I don ' t care , " Boston resident Sean Barksdale , 32 , said . " This is what I want : I want an original scene with original dialogue that features Christian Bale as Batman and Heath Ledger as Joker . And it has to be the real Heath Ledger , too , not someone doing a Heath Ledger impression or I swear to God I ' m asking for my money back . "
