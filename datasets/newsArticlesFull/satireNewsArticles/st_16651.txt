" I just saw him over at the gas station yesterday , " said Eric Pugh , Yothers ' former coworker . " He was buying a frozen pizza and a sixer of Miller High Life . He seemed just fine , nothing out of the ordinary at all . We talked about going to that bar over in Effingham for 3 pitchers of Old Style . I sure hope we get a chance to do that before it ' s too late . "
