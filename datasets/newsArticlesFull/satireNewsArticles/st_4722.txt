Bush went on to defend his decision to remove troops from Afghanistan and " bring the party " to Iraq . He maintained that while policing the region wasn ' t " a bore or anything " it wasn ' t all that entertaining , either . Furthermore , the president said that had the United States not shifted its focus away from Afghanistan , military forces never would have had the opportunity to kick up their heels in Iraqi cities such as Basra , Baghdad , and Tikrit .
