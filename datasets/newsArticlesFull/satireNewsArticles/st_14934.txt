Although an investigation is still underway , some details of Ethel ' s 17 tortured years have been made public . According to the police report , Ethel ' s cellar dwelling had no heat or ventilation , and only a single grimy , barred basement window provided light . There was no plumbing , so Ethel was forced to scuttle into a corner and defecate in a drain .
