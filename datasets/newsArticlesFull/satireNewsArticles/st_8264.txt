The DOE ' s first major contribution to the conservationist cause was the establishment of the James Monroe National Park over 90 percent of the Philippines in 1899 , followed by the Teddy Roosevelt Panama Canal Waterfowl Preservation Zone in 1910 . The DOE later went on to open preserves in such fragile ecosystems as the Abraham Lincoln Rain Forest in Brazil , the nation of Vietnam , and the Uusikaupunki National Park in Uusikaupunki , Outer New Jersey ( formerly Finland ) .
