" One of the major ' heresies ' of Christian history is the Gnostic belief that the Creator , or ' demiurge , ' of this troubled world is a blind , idiot god who is insane , " Jurgens said . " This idea surfaces in many religious traditions around the globe . As it turns out , they were only half right : God has His problems like anyone else , but He is essentially trying His best . He just has a condition that makes His emotions fly out of control at times . "
