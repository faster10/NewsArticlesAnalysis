Last year , nobody was going to vote for Andrea Dixon for senior class president , but then she and her boyfriend Greg Dolan got in a car accident on the way back from their shift at Applebee ' s . After that , EVERYONE voted for her because Greg was in the hospital for weeks . She didn ' t even have to do anything to win , except go to a couple funerals .
