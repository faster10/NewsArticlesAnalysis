" My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary last night while fighting off nagging colds , so we decided to try Robitussin Reserve , " said Gary Hutchinson of Darien , CT , who picked up a bottle of the top shelf vintage at a nearby Rite Aid . " We cracked it open , said a toast , and then really savored it . It definitely has much more depth and complexity than the cheaper bottles I used to buy . And it really took the edge off my cold .
