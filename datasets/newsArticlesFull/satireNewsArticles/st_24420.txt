" Shockingly , even William Henry Harrison , a president who was in office for a month and spent most of it on his deathbed , seems to have found time to lie during the famously lengthy inaugural address that would speed his demise , " independent counsel investigator James McManus said . " And so called ' father of our country ' George Washington is not exempt , either . A story familiar to any schoolchild tells us that , as a boy , Washington confessed to chopping down a cherry tree , saying , ' I cannot tell a lie . ' Evidence suggests , however , that the entire tale may have been bogus from the start . This is doubly damning to the presidency ' s reputation , for it is not merely a lie , but a lie about not telling lies . "
