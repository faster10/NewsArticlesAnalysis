" Everyone lined up for the cha cha slide , and it was like ' Oh , boy , here we go , ' " said groomsman Jeff Canzanovia . " I had to dance with bridesmaid and Elaine ' s sister Erica Schroeder , who I can ' t stand , but we were all going through the motions to make Kevin and Elaine happy . Then this guy Gary comes onto the dance floor and acts like he can ' t dance , pretending to trip and fall . I usually hate ridiculous behavior like that , but I have to admit his antics were pretty much the only thing that made the night halfway bearable . "
