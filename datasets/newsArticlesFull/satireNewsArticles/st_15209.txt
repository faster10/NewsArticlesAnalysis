Sources close to the Oppels report that Amanda , who had been distant from her father prior to the vacation , " really bonded " with him on the trip . She also reportedly spent a great deal of time with fellow travelers and close family friends Greg and Karen Garner , and even more with their son Brad , 23 , heir to the Garner office supply empire .
