" Her friends sold the baby shower so hard , " DeGrassio said . " They were all like , ' We play games and open presents ' as if I don ' t know what a shower is . I ' ll tell you what it is : four hours of chattering and cooing over stuff from Target . I always give the same gift when I go to one : a pair of overalls . But everyone acts like it ' s the Bicentennial fireworks display . "
