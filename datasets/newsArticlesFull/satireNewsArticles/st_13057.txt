" Dude , I got to put at least 300 into my car to get that shitheap running again , or how else am I supposed to deliver pizza ? " the embattled Doogan said from his living room couch , where he has spent the past two weeks . " There ' s no way I can afford to do that and pay the back rent I owe , plus three months of cable bills and beer money . Plus , I still owe like 100 on the noise complaint ticket we got from that spring break party . How am I supposed to pay any of it back if I can ' t work at Pizza Pete ' s ? "
