Designed for outdoor use , the 14 piece set of internally lit plastic figurines was first purchased by Pope John Paul II in 1981 , and every year since , according to Vatican observers , the reigning pontiff has personally assembled the nativity scene outside the Apostolic Palace in Saint Peter ' s Square . The display , including the colored lights that outline the manger and wrap around a few of the piazza ' s iconic Tuscan colonnades , is reportedly powered by an extension cord running from an outlet in the papal garage .
