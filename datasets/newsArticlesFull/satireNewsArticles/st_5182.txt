" We try not to play stupid , " Brant said . " We never gamble more than we can afford to lose . And we try to never lose our heads . We leave that to the customers . We set aside a certain amount to gamble that ' s our kitty and if we double our money , we only play with our winnings after that . Right now , the kitty stands at around 176 , 500 , 000 . "
