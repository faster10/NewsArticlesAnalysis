FOUND: Michelle Obama’s Excessive Travel & Accommodation Demand List
Diva Jennifer Lopez once asked for – and received – white flowers, white furniture, white curtains, and Cuban food for an AIDS charity event appearance. That used to be a low water mark of pampered celebrity absurdity, but nowadays in Obama’s America, first lady Michelle Obama ‘out-divas’ the divas! A partial list of the first lady’s excessive travel and speaking engagement ‘must haves’ was discovered by housecleaning staff at New York’s opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel, the only hotel Mrs. Obama uses during jaunts to New York, often with her mother Marian Robinson in tow, along with her entourage of – get this – over 40 staff members! Most celebrities’ wish lists, called “riders,” are given to promoters to make sure special hotel, backstage and travel demands are granted while the artist is on tour. Some requests are reasonable, while others are downright self-serving and ridiculous. Besides receiving a six figure speaking fee for appearances, the first lady is awarded on-demand first class flight accommodations on the airline of her choice for herself and her mother (but only if a private Lear jet is unavailable). Fresh organic fruit trays must be at hand and filled at all times because Michelle hates to see an ‘unbalanced plate,’ and the premium fruit must be chilled and maintained at a constant temperature of exactly 40°. These extravagant accommodations and extras must also be provided to all members of her travel entourage – including stylists, wardrobe coordinators, communications specialists, and public relations advisors – all on the taxpayer’s dime! A partial list of the first lady’s orders appears below. This is only the first page – of twelve! What do you think? Outrageous or incredibly outrageous?
