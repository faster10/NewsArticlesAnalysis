According to Selig , a committee of sports journalists and baseball historians was set up during the off season to investigate , with Selig ' s oversight , whether there was any substance to a rumor that began circulating last summer concerning Aaron having hit more homeruns than those credited to him in the record books . Though Selig said he couldn ' t recall the date the committee was established , he believes it was in or around the time he approved the San Francisco Giants ' highly publicized signing of Barry Zito .
