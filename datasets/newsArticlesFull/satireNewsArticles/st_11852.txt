In December 1999 , Bush told a Dallas Morning News reporter that " the nation simply can ' t bear another four years under an unrefined president . We are proper people , and we shall conduct a proper , civilized government without those beastly Democrats . " Gore staffers retaliated the following week by disguising themselves as waiters and infiltrating a Republican fundraiser , at which they pulled off a host of shenanigans . Among them : paging a " Mr Dick Wiede " on the dining room sound system , altering Bush ' s speech notes to include insults aimed at key Bush contributors , and spraying George W . Bush ' s mother , former first lady Barbara Bush , with champagne as she shrieked in open mouthed horror .
