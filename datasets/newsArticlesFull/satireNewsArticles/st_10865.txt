" I ' m confident that , with a little retooling and a possible time slot change , Eat At Taco Bell will find its audience . Before long , millions of Americans will be tuning in each week to watch Lisa , Matt and the rest of the gang get into crazy adventures , talk about love and sex , and eat delicious Taco Bell food .
