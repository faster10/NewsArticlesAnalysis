Engineers say the robot is also equipped with a sophisticated audio command program that recognizes and subsequently ignores such phrases as " Stop " and " I give up " and is programmed to apply pressure to a prostrate suspect ' s neck with a force of up to 500 PSI both before and after he ' s stopped moving . Its operating system is also reportedly loaded with advanced visual recognition software that allows the robot to identify nearly any object in the subject ' s hand as a weapon , prompting it to rapidly empty the clip on its extendable . 40 caliber firearm .
