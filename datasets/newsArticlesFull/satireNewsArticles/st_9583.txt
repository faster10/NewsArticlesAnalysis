" Back in ' 91 , I was working at this True Value over in Hialeah . On my very last day there , just before quitting time , the guys surprised me with this really expensive bottle of Bombay Sapphire , " Streeter said . " We all went in the back of the store and finished off the whole thing . Man , it was like drinking diamonds . We nearly kicked this one guy ' s ass for trying to mix it with orange juice . It was too good for that . I ' d almost say I liked it better than the Oban scotch my girlfriend gave me for my 21st birthday , but I don ' t know . Bombay is a breed apart , that ' s for sure . "
