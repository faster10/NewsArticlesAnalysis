" Racing and literature are both huge parts of American life , and I don ' t think David Foster Wallace would want me to make too much of that , or to pretend that it ' s any sort of equitable balance , " Helton added . " That would be grotesque . But the truth is that whatever cultural deity , entity , energy , or random social flux produced stock car racing also produced the works of David Foster Wallace . And just look them . Look at that . "
