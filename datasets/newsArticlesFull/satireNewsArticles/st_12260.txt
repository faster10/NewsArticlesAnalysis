" I ' ll never forgive him for making me stay up on the rope until I climbed to the top , " said 16 year old aspiring paleontologist Joe Wagner . " I was up there for almost 20 minutes , struggling to get more than a few feet off the ground before he finally said I could get down . The whole class was pointing and laughing at me as I tried to lift myself up . And the whole time , Malanga just stood there all smug and satisfied , like he was teaching me some important life lesson . I can ' t tell you how humiliating it was . Malangaloid is a total bastard . "
