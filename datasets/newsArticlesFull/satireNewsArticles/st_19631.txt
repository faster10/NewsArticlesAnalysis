" We ' ve thought a lot about how contestants should be kicked off the island , " Davies said . " The voting thing has been done to death , and anyway , on our island , voting is a very touchy subject . Right now , we ' re toying with allowing cast members to just escape to the North . But it might be neat to choreograph some sort of mad uprising for the final episode . Whatever we do , you can bet it ' ll be exciting , tension filled , and consistent with an America where slavery and states ' rights survived long after the 1860s . "
