The foundation has already raised more than 20 million , thanks to donations from supporters such as Jackie Mason , Albert Brooks , the Schtupp Institute , Sen . Russ Feingold ( D WI ) , and the Henny Youngman Endowment for the Preservation of Schmekel . The money will go toward projects aimed at reintegrating " schmuck " into the English lexicon , including billboards and flyers plastered with the word " schmuck , " the upcoming 5K Schlep for Schmuck Awareness , and a new Mel Brooks film .
