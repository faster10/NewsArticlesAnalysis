In the end , the Municipal Bus Pageant will be not about the attractiveness of a single bus , but a celebration of all things mass transit . " The people love Arcola Municipal Bus , and Arcola Municipal Bus loves the people , " Ludlow said . " Who among us hasn ' t been lulled to sleep by the steady rocking of our buses as they plow their furrow across the dark night ? Who can forget their childhood excitement when they yanked the bell pull for the rst time ? Or the mustachioed smile of the kindly driver , and the perky sound of his paper punch perforating a transfer ? The Bus Pageant will bring these simple joys to everyone . "
