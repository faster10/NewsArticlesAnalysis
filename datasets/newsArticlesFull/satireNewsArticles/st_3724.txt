" Most bird observations occur during the day , but it ' s possible that birds are having sex in the middle of the night when it ' s very dark and they ' re hard to see , or maybe inside clouds where we can ' t glimpse them at all or maybe it occurs both in clouds and at night , " said animal physiologist James Bosley , a proponent of the theory that currently has the most traction among biologists , which suggests that most birds reproduce by flying directly into each other at high speeds . " My own research team is currently looking into whether ducks are doing it under water each time they dip beneath the surface , out of our view . "
