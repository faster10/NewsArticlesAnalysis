NASCAR Driver Kurt Busch’s Ex-Girlfriend Admits He Was Right, Says ‘I Am A Trained Assassin’
In a deposition last week, NASCAR driver Kurt Busch stated that he believed his ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, was a trained assassin.“Everybody on the outside can tell me I’m crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,” said Busch, who stated that he believed Driscoll traveled the world as a hired killer, and that he once caught her in their home, covered in blood.Initially denying the claims, Driscoll stated that Busch was just taking plot elements from a movie script that she had been writing, and that he had read. This morning, though, Driscoll shockingly admitted that the screenplay she had been writing was autobiographical, and that she was, indeed, a trained assassin.“It’s true that I have travelled the world, and I am a trained assassin,” began Driscoll in a surprising statement. “I am currently writing a screenplay based on my life as a member of The Foot, a secret clan of ninja assassins that have been fighting our enemies for decades.”Driscoll claims that she first joined The Foot clan almost 15 years ago, and quickly became one of their most deadly warriors.“They sent me all over the world, hunting people who they said we our enemies. I have killed many people in the name of The Foot, although our greatest enemies – Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello – have evaded me for years. Sadly, Kurt has blown my cover as a covert, deadly assassin, so I must go into hiding before I am captured or killed.”Busch, who was later asked about Driscoll’s announcement, said that he wasn’t surprised.“I knew that she was deadly. I’m telling you, guys, she killed Bin Landen! She killed Hussein! She probably killed JFK! I don’t know. All I know is, I’m glad this is all out in the open, now. See – I’m not crazy! I’m not! She’s a killer!”Busch is reportedly being taken into hiding by NASCAR officials, out of fear of retaliation from The Foot Clan.
