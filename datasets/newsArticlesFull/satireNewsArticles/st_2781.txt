Hargrove also noted that Sheldon ' s " play " behavior is not really play at all , but rather escape instinct in action . " Sheldon , like any animal forced to live in a small glass tank , is consumed with a desire to get away , " he said . " Of course , since this is a pet turtle we ' re talking about , there is very little Sheldon can do to act on this desire other than basically crawling to the side of his tank and looking out . "
