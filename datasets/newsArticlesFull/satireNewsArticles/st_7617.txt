While police say they remain baffled by the events that unfolded , they have been able to determine that the bodies are those of two young girls , believed to be between the ages of 8 and 10 , both of whom suffered an apparently violent death . Their bodies showed signs of blunt force trauma to the head , as well as several postmortem stab wounds , although no indications of sexual abuse were present . A steel pipe bearing human blood and tissue matter was found at the scene but did not appear to be related to the arrowhead .
