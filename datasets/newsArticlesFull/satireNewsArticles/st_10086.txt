The quarrel is said to have escalated within minutes , as family members could be heard yelling the phrases " I ' m sick of this , " " Cheesecake Factory is off the table , " " I hate pasta , " and " Don ' t put words in my mouth " throughout the suburban residence . According to accounts , the protracted period of fierce squabbling included numerous threats to leave the house , repeated usages of the word " unfair , " several personal accusations entirely unrelated to the argument at hand , and suggestions for alternate dinner plans including Chili ' s and California Pizza Kitchen that were swiftly and angrily rejected .
