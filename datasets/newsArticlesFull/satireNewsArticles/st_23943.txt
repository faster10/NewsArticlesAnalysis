" I ' m getting a black Toyota 4 Runner as soon as I get out of high school , " said Hector Ordonez , 16 , a junior at Kingswood High School in Salinas , CA . " And if I can make my dream car come true sooner by dropping out halfway through senior year and working at Burger King , that ' s what I ' ll do . Whatever it takes , it ' s worth it . "
