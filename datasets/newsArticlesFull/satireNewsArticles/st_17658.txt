Last winter , Gehr converted his family ' s basement rec room into a maze of twisting tracks and miniature houses . He began to stay up until all hours of the night gluing branches onto miniature trees . On more than one occasion , he was late to work because of his habit , sleeping through his ringing alarm clock after staying up until 2 a . m . on a bridge painting binge .
