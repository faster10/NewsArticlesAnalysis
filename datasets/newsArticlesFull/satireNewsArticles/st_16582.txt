" We ' re going to raise so much money for this cure . We ' re going to raise tons of money ! When everyone sees what we ' re on to , they ' ll want to give us thousands no , billions of dollars , " geneticist Keith Dunbar said in a near shout , while holding his quivering balled up fists at chest level . " Of course they will . We ' re moments away from eliminating depression forever ! We ' ll probably even have time to make some headway on that schizophrenia MRI study that ' s been sitting on the back burner . Oh , and plus the literature review I ' ve been meaning to do I can fire that off in an hour . Then there ' s Deborah ' s chimp experiment , and I can write up that bilateral lesion study from September ! "
