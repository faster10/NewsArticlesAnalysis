" Mr Karelin , I have heard you talk long and loud about your strength , your stamina and your many so called pins , " said a visibly angry Lawler , his face still damp with perspiration following a match against Stone Cold Steve Austin . " But when you get in my ring , you are dealing with the King . Get ready to come face to face with real wrestling , Mr Karelin . Real , professional , American wrestling . It ' s going to be lights out for you , pal , in Sydney . " Lawler added that , upon victory , he will shave Karelin bald .
