Mohammed , who arrived with the same beat up glove he had used since high school , is said to have spent the first practice looking on in disgust as his players missed wildly on throws to first base , allowed grounders to roll between their legs , and collided while chasing fly balls in the outfield . He was later seen burying his head in his hands when a player swung at a pitch , missed , and accidentally sent his bat flying into the bleachers .
