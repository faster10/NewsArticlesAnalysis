Kasich ' s fellow legislators were skeptical at first perhaps none more so than House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt ( D MO ) . " When I saw the box on Kasich ' s desk , I got angry at him and said , ' You went and bought that thing , didn ' t you ? ' " Gephardt said . " I figured that was 60 bucks thrown out the window . A week later , I was asking to go with him to auctions ! "
