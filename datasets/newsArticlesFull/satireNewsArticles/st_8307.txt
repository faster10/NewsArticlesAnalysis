" Yes , all must die , " Dread Secretary of Evil Hammond S . Reynolds said during a press conference in Room 1228 of Washington ' s Robert C . Weaver Federal Building . " There shall soon come an accounting in which all will fall before the Grim Reaper as wheat in winter , as lambs under the knife . Soon all necks will feel the steely bite of our soul thirsting axe , wielded by the unforgiving iron hand of the Department of Evil . Thus spake I , Dread Secretary Reynolds . "
