" I think it ' s just plain sneaky giving the place a Mexican name and making it look like a Mexican place . The least they could do is have a few things like chimichangas and burritos on the menu , for all the people who walk in here by accident . You shouldn ' t have to fool people to get them to eat at your restaurant . That ' s just bad business . "
