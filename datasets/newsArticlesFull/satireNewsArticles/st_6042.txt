" I run a pretty tight ship around here , and I think that makes all the difference , " said Ernie Wilhelm , head of the art jail ' s 400 person security team . " For every piece of art that ' s in here , there are four or five people who ' d love to get it out . As a result , everything is secured and totally locked down in its place , with the exception of a couple interactive installations and the Calder mobile hanging in the atrium . "
