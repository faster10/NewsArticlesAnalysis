The study found grade school and junior high readers particularly susceptible to the travel myths . In one case study , 9 year old Justin Fisher began reading a fantasy novel by C . S . Lewis under close observation . After 60 minutes , the only travel to occur was a voluntary visit to the kitchen for a snack and two trips to the bathroom , both made because Fisher " had to go . " In no way , say researchers , did any of the travel involve evil witches , messianic lions or closet portals to other universes .
