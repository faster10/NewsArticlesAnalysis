" We here at Mead understand that as students get older and wiser , they need notebooks with increasingly narrow lines , " Mead CEO John A . Luke told reporters . " In college , people are at a stage in their education where they require 9 32nds of an inch between each line , which is why we make college ruled notebooks . But I think we can all agree that grad school is a completely different world than college a world where 9 32nds of an inch is simply too much room . "
