" Rather than cruelly herding our stock onto dark , narrow loading ramps , we believe in letting them move freely across our facility ' s spacious , blood sluicing grated floor , " said KLJ Packing operations manager Eric Judd , adding that the extra room is intended to make the animals as comfortable as possible for the 24 hours between arriving at the plant and being skinned and dismembered for sale . " Before our animals are led into stun boxes , they ' re allowed to walk without hindrance among the carcasses suspended from the bleeding rail and the floor ' s various viscera piles . "
