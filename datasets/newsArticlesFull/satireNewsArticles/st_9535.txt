Among the so called " priceless " keepsakes that sold for a pittance was a framed wedding photo of Keller and wife Nancy , who died in 1993 , that had been overlooked by the family . Priced at 4 , the photo was bought by Morgantown resident Jackie Pullman , who promptly removed the picture from its silver frame and threw it in the garbage upon returning home .
