I’d take driverless car over lift from my girlfriend, insists man
Car owner Simon Williams said he would rather get a lift to the pub from a vehicle which appears ‘bewitched’ than be driven again by his girlfriend in her Vauxhall Nova. Testing of driverless cars will be given the go-ahead in the spring, allowing the prospect of comparisons to the people who normally drive you. The driverless cars use video cameras, radar sensors and a laser range finder to “see” other traffic, but do not insist on telling you what Sharon said about that new bloke she’s been seeing from down the road. Simon Williams, 27, said he’d be perfectly happy to get a lift from a driverless car, as long as it didn’t insist on giving him a list of reasons why he’s not as good as the car’s friend’s new boyfriend. He told us, “I know it sounds a bit risky, but I’d honestly rather be driven through speeding traffic by something that was probably built on Windows XP, than have to listen to a sales pitch about a weekend at the mother in law’s.” “I also imagine it’s much easier to relax in a car without a driver, than it is to relax alongside one who is so entirely oblivious of everything around them.” As well as being entirely nag-free, the driverless car has already shown itself to be 75% better at parking than its female human counterpart. Williams continued, “Well, that’s not too difficult to be honest.” “You could point the car down my street and then turn it off before letting it come to rest wherever it wanted, and it would still be better parked than my missus’ Nova.” “It might not be able to ‘see’ the lines, but as least it doesn’t appear to be deliberately ignoring them.”
