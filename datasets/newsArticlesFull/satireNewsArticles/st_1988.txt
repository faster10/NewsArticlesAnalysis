" It ' s not like I don ' t like movies , " Jensen said . " I loved Notting Hill , and I ' m totally psyched to see Hanging Up I ' m the biggest Meg Ryan fan . I even used to have a When Harry Met Sally poster in my dorm room . And have you seen My Best Friend ' s Wedding ? Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz are so amazing in it . My all time favorite , though , has got to be Beaches . "
