" When I look back on what I ' ve done since my early days nearly getting myself killed fighting rats in the Morthal swamps , it ' s incredible where I ended up , really , " said Brightbane , who since arriving in Skyrim has accomplished such feats as slaying the fearsome dragon Alduin and being inducted into the Thieves Guild . " Look at me : I ' m standing here in a full suit of Daedric armor , upgraded all the way to ' legendary ' status thanks to my smithing skills . That ' s just not something you think is possible when you ' re delivering letters around Riverwood for some lousy Ring of Sneaking , unable to get your hands on a magicka potion to save your life .
