Corey " Aqualad " Friesen , 18 , of Danville , IL appeared to share Mancuso ' s fears about manual and analog socializing . " I vaguely remember trying to make friends pre MySpace , but in 16 years , I only made three real friends , " Friesen said . " If I have to revert back to face to face friend gathering , I would be middle aged before I built that number into the double digits . I ' d definitely never get back into the hundreds again . "
