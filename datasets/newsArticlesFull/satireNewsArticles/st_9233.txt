Following a special holiday dinner of turkey , artichokes , and spiced yams , Nicole and sullen daughter Gabrielle , an 18 year old freshman at the University of Vermont , were put in charge of selecting the movies to watch . The two shared a wordless 10 minute car trip to their local Blockbuster video store , where Gabrielle ruled out most of her mother ' s choices as " stupid " or " lame . " Tired of saying no and eager to leave the store , Gabrielle finally assented to the holiday classic It ' s A Wonderful Life and the 1994 remake of Miracle On 34th Street .
