" I ' m meeting once a week , not Sundays but on Wednesdays , with anyone who cares to join me . We won ' t be worshipping anybody , just practicing my favorite hobby , horticulture . I ' ll admit , it doesn ' t have the power to grant eternal absolution from earthly pain , but at least flowers are real . We must cultivate our garden . "
