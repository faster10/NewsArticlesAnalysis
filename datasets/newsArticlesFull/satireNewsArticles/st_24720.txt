" Let ' s be honest , " Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie said . " The Bush camp has been criticized for ignoring the minority vote for some time , especially during the last election . This project is our way of correcting that misperception . The Bush camp is extremely concerned about the black vote , especially in places like Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania . This year , on Nov . 3 , we ' ll make a concerted effort to welcome minority voters into our own special camps with open arms . "
