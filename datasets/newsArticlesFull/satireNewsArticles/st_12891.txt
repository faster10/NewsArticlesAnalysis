" Joe Lunchpail would say ' Rock Around The Clock ' by Bill Haley His Comets was the first rock single , but that ' s dead wrong , " said Dave Rinkin , a line cook in Chapel Hill , NC , who occasionally writes for Roctober magazine and has a collection of more than 10 , 000 records . " Haley ' s song just brought the sound to the mainstream . Anyone who knows anything will say the first single was either Roy Brown ' s ' Good Rockin ' Tonight ' or ' Rocket 88 ' by Jackie Brenston And His Delta Cats . "
