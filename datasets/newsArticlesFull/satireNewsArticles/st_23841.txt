" I haven ' t seen Urban Cowboy in a long time , so I bet it ' ll pump me up , " Wiseck said . " I ' ve also been thinking about bringing my own music to play during my ride , maybe AC DC ' s ' You Shook Me All Night Long . ' Last week , George Jones ' ' White Lightning ' was on the jukebox when I lost to the bull . As much as I love that song , it ' s just not good bull riding music . "
