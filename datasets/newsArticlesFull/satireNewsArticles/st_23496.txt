" In all my years in the senate , this is the most adorable thing I have ever seen , " Sen . Frank Lautenberg ( D NJ ) said . " The little raccoonies have come to visit ! Aren ' t they precious ? Look at their little pawsy hands . Hello , little bandit masks ! Look at the racoonie woonies with their widdle bandit masky wasks ! Wee pawsy wawsy hands ! Oooh , I wish I could pick you up and give you such a great big hug ! "
