" Last June , I found a 20 bill on the street , " Vartan said . " I was totally psyched , because I was seriously hurting for cash at the time I think I had , like , 5 . 85 in my checking account . I was going to put it in the bank , but on the way home I saw this shirt in the window of Ragstock that said , ' It ' s Not A Beer Belly , It ' s A Gas Tank For A Sex Machine . ' Of course , I got the shirt and lost seven pounds that month because I ate nothing but rice and beans , so it was even more ironic . "
