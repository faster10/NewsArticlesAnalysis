" This is the Puppy Bowl , " Schechter added . " Everyone , even your pug mixes , are going at a higher gear . Boy that was a tough injury , though . To be honest with you , when that puppy ' s neck snapped , it sounded like a bundle of wet celery being twisted , and his head was just hanging there , limp , like it wasn ' t even connected to his body . I was pretty close to the action , too , so I saw firsthand the look in Alvin ' s eyes . He was so confused . So scared . Then of course he went into shock and passed out . "
