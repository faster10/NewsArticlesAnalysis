" Our asking price for the song ' s ' Domo Arigato ' spoken word intro with synthesizer backing is 25 million , " Styx bassist Chuck Panozzo said . " As far as the lyric , ' My blood is boiling , my heart is human , my brain IBM , ' goes , I can ' t imagine we would be asking any less than 55 million for that . "
