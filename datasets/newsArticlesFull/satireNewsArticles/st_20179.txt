As popular as it is with the aged , Old People is arguably even more well liked by their families . " Every few minutes Grandma would demand we take her to the bathroom , even though she ' s been using adult diapers for eight years , " said Hannah Swoboda , 41 . " Even after we put her in the nursing home , she ' d call all the time ' Want come back , want come back . ' It was so tiresome . But now that she ' s got Old People magazine , that ' s all changed . Now we can barely drag her out of that home . "
