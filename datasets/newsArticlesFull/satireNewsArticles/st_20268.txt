" You know , we just want to let the kids do their thing , " said Kindler , who plans to hold a " Faith and Fun Night " next week to introduce church youth to the new facility . " If they want to go shoot some hoops in the parking lot , they can do that . If they want to stay inside and chat with friends , that ' s cool too . I ' m not here to tell anyone what to do . "
