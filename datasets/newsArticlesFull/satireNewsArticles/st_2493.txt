" Half the places I go offer some low carb or Atkins thing , " Turnbee said . " I ignore all that crazy business . At most of the places I go , I can still get one of the old standbys : a burger , a roast beef sandwich , or a ham and cheese sub . I do have some trouble when we go up to Canada to visit Shelly ' s sister . The restaurants are all different up there . "
