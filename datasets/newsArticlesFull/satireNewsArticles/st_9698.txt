" I ' ll never forget that day , " said Frank Costello , 89 . " It was around 6 , and I was enjoying a delicious steak dinner with my wife Helen , when all of a sudden , my fork fell out from between my toes . I tried to pick it up again , but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn ' t . I had lost all use of my feet , just like that . "
