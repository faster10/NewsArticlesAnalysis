" If you don ' t fly often , there ' s lots of stuff you probably don ' t know , " Meyers said . " Like how much better the Northwest WorldClub lounge is in Dallas than the one at most other airports especially La Guardia . Or how you can do on line check in with Continental , but that ' s only if you have no carry ons . Or how you should use your Delta SkyMiles card on weekends , because you get double miles on all purchases . Those are the kind of things you may not know if you ' re not a seasoned traveler like myself . "
