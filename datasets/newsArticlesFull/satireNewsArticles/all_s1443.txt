Lady Gaga says I.Q. tests matter
Tanzanian - After the disappearance of several albino people, blonde bombshell Lady Gaga comes out to say that theories on human intelligence must be correct. "We need to find a solution to the problem and fast," says Lady Gaga. Armed gangs of witch doctors are snatching up white people by the thousands in the false believe they posses black magic.  Heinrich Einstein, a scientist at the institute of neurological research in Munich Germany points to the fact that intelligence is inside the brain.  "The reason those witch doctors believe that white skin has black magic is because their brains don't posses a large enough frontal lobe and other features," says Einstein. This explains why some people in Tanzania don't believe white people posses black magic. They have higher cognitive factors. Jeffrey Dammer, Ted Bundy, and Charles Manson are genetically related to Tanzanian witch doctors as reported by Rolling Rocks magazine.  "Several neurophysiological factors have been correlated with intelligence in humans, including the ratio of brain weight to body weight and the size, shape and activity level of different parts of the brain," states Lady Gaga.  Specific features that may affect IQ include the size and shape of the frontal lobes, the amount of blood and chemical activity in the frontal lobes, the total amount of gray matter in the brain, the overall thickness of the cortex, and the glucose metabolic rate. "Educating witch doctors wont increase their intelligence, but incarcerating them for many years will prevent them from passing on their low cognitive genes to other more intelligent people in Tanzania," says Einstein. Worse yet, the parliament are allowing Tanzanians to migrate to Britain with a fresh package of DNA.
