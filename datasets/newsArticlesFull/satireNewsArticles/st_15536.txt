" I guess I ' m used to people recognizing me , " said the 44 year old Herchwick , who , in addition to anchoring the 6 p . m . news , co hosts the weekly Wauwatonka Live At Five . " It happens once or twice a week at the grocery store , at Sears , at the garage where I get my tires rotated , you name it . But this event was really something special . Seeing all those people and getting a chance to meet so many of my fans in person , well , it really brought home to me just how much of a celebrity I actually am . "
