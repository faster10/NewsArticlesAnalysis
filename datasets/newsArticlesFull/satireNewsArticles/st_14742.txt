" I was in the hotel this morning , and I ran into Jason Garcia . He ' s a reporter at The Orlando Sentinel who I know a bit from SPJ conferences and whatnot , " O ' Neill said . " He was pretty vague about what he was doing in Spartanburg . Later , at the rally , I couldn ' t help but notice that nice Citizen diving watch he wears sticking out of a Grand Council robe . Damn , that guy always was a go getter . "
