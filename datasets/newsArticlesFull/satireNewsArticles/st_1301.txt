" The new Swiffer , as seen on TV , requires no spray or chemical cleaners , so I ' m sure you can understand how excited I was to finally find something that could give my sad , short existence a sense of worth , " said Manitowoc , WI , homemaker Gwen Hull . " When you finish the clean up job , simply tear off the patented Swiffer Cloth and throw it away as easy as one , two , three . But when I did this , tossing the soiled , disposable Swiffer Cloth into the garbage can like so many hollow , rejected yesterdays , I thought to myself , ' Is that it ? Aren ' t I supposed to feel more fulfilled than this ? ' It all felt so futile . I felt like that Swiffer Cloth in the trash represented me , my hopes and dreams made manifest . I felt like it was my goals and aspirations for a better life that were lying there in the garbage , never to be heard from again . "
