The first step in using the Screw You Packet is to calculate your Economic Mobility Factor ( EMF ) via the easy to use EMF 1138 calculation sheet included in the packet . Those with an Economic Mobility Factor of 90 or above may mail or fax forms SC0089 L and SC0065 dd to their local Screw You EMF Processing Center ( SYEMFPC ) .
