The federal government shut down again on Monday at 5 p . m . when a bat was spotted flying around the inside of the U . S . Capitol building . Legislators , fearing they may be attacked by the bat , have suspended all governmental activity until it flies out a window , is shooed away by someone with a broom , or is ultimately done away with by U . S . pest control experts .
