" I was really excited to use that pristine new mop head for the first time , " Akers said . " So when 4 : 30 rolled around , I raced over to the mop closet and , with great pleasure , unscrewed the filthy old mop head and threw it out . Man , that felt good . Next thing you know , I ' m out there in the main dining area , mopping away like a kid in a candy store . The new mop head worked so much better than the old one , I was literally whistling while I worked . "
