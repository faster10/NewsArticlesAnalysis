" I grew up in an extremely poor , all black section of Lagos and attended schools that were overcrowded and horribly equipped , " Adewale said . " For many blacks of my generation , the experience was the same . I want every member of the current generation of black youths to read from new textbooks and learn in state of the art facilities . We must leave no child behind . "
