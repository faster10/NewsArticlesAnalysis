£1500 Google Glass to finally end myth that people in glasses are ‘clever’
As Google Glass prepares for a public release, the £1500 price tag has ensured the common perception that people wearing glasses are ‘clever’ is finally over. With fans of the wearable tech lining up to batter their credit cards in order to be seen in public talking to their spectacles, many observers have said that glasses might become the new ‘bib’. Tech reporters Simon Williams told us, “In the same way that a grown adult wearing a bib in public would be assumed to have certain ‘challenges’, the same will ultimately be thought of about Google Glass wearers.” “They will become used to sympathetic glances from passers-by, as those around them realise they must be incredibly, shockingly, stupid. And at least £1500 poorer.” “It’s like a massive sign on your face saying ‘I have more money than sense’, or ‘I am too stupid to do sums’.” Another told us, “I feel a bit sorry for the people buying Google Glass to be honest.” “I don’t see how Google charging simpletons £1500 for their latest gadget is any different from payday lenders charging simpletons a 1000% interest rate on their loans – it’s just exploitation of the feeble-minded by another name.” Google fan Shane Matthews took part in the Glass trial earlier this year, and said he’d noticed a definite change in the public’s attitude to him since the price of the device was released. He told us, “Whereas people were previously wary of me recording them, or would ask exactly what I was doing with it, now they just tilt their heads to the side and say things like ‘you poor baby’, and maybe pat me on my head.” “It’s fine though, I still think I look cool, and I quite like beans for dinner every night.”
