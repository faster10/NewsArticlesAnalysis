Rev . Kyle Knopf , pastor of Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church , where the Peters family has worshiped for the last 40 years , said : " Young Greg has a long , hard road ahead of him . He ' s got to provide for his baby until Herman is full grown in other words , until the child is as old as Greg is now . That ' s a big commitment . "
