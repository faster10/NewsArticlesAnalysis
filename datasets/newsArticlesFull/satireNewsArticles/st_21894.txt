According to top scientists , the discovery challenges many fundamental principles of modern biology , raising new questions that are key : If an osprey kills a lion , does the osprey then rule the African savannah ? If ospreys no longer eat northern pike , does the northern pike move to the top of its food chain ? And if lions are wiped out , will zebra herds grow unchecked or will the ospreys eat the zebras , too ?
