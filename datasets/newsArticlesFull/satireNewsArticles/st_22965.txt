" For months , I feared that my boy and the dozens of others who committed sinful acts with Father Halloran before he was moved to the safety of another parish to protect him from further temptation at their pre pubescent hands was going to Hell for what he ' d done , " Leahy said . " It ' s the worst feeling a mother can know . But thanks to the forgiveness of the pope , my long nightmare is finally over . He was just a boy of 8 at the time . He didn ' t know any better . Thank you , your Holiness , for giving my poor little Timothy a second chance at redemption . "
