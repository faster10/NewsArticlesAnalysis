As for the future of the photo , Tillinghast predicted it will go in a photo album with other standouts from the past . " Kerri has an album of college memories into which this would fit perfectly , " he said . " The album contains many great pictures of the three going all the way back to freshman orientation , including one from that time last fall when Jill and Stacy arrived intoxicated at Kerri ' s dormitory room at three in the morning with pizza sauce smeared on their cheeks . That was hilarious . "
