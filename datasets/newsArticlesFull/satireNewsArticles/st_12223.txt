Thatcher , who had had a shitty time at work Sunday night , said he went to bed before anyone came home that evening and was , as a result , unaware of the presence of the guy on the couch until 10 the next morning . " I had just gotten up and was on my way to take a piss , when I saw something on the couch , " Thatcher said . " Upon closer inspection , I was like , ' Holy shit , some dude ' s there sleeping . ' "
