" The Midwestern Aborigines are ruddy , generally heavy set folk , clad in plain , non designer costumery , " Eldred said . " They tend to live in simple , one story dwellings whose interiors are decorated with Hummels and ' Bless This House ' needlepoint wall hangings . And though coarse and unattractive , these simple people were rather friendly , offering us quaint native fare such as ' hotdish ' and ' casserole . ' "
