Though little is known of Gwilym ' s life , artists have traditionally depicted the suave nobleman riding an eye catching white mustang and wearing garishly colored linen garments that fall loosely about the chest to reveal a large medallion bearing his family ' s crest . It is remarkable , historians note , that he was able to spread his seed so far and wide before the age of 29 , when he was savagely beaten to death by a neighboring lord known as Dafydd of Nine Cuckolds .
