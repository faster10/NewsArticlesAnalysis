" Many of these rappers create fictional , internal universes that , for them , become a sort of alternate reality , " Bloch said . " For example , a young rapper named Kurupt told me how the feds have tapped his phones , and how he ' s wanted in more states than John Gotti . A New York area MC by the name of Nas told me that he was recently chased in his Lexus by CIA agents but managed to escape when Pablo Escobar , his business partner and passenger , shot the driver of the pursuing vehicle . These sorts of paranoid , delusional fantasies are classic warning signs of schizophrenia , and an afflicted rapper ' s condition can deteriorate to the point where he is completely insane in the membrane .
