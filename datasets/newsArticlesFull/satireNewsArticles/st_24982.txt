Although this Republican City of Twins has put its best foot forward in welcoming all of us in the Press Corps , I can ' t say much for the prospects of their party if no one shows up at their convention . Maybe they should build a nicer stadium that strategy works like a charm for our great Ball Clubs around the nation . Perhaps if they harness the awesome spirit of Abe Lincoln , they could build the first Log Cabin Stadium . But any hesitation in getting it built before November will surely spell doom at the polls .
