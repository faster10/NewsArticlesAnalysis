" By conquering your Fear , by eating it in Heroic Portions , by laughing at that Fear which you have eaten , one avoids the Eternal Recurrence of cyclic ' Yo Yo ' Weight Loss and Weight Gain , " Nietzsche wrote . " And in so doing , one transcends Thinness . One discovers that he need not dwell forever on the chill , Wind swept Borderland between Thin and Superthin . "
