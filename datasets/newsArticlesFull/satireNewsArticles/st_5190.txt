According to casino sources , each of the new machines features a simple design consisting of a plain gray outer casing with a side mounted handle that , when pulled , immediately informs the player that he or she has lost the game by flashing the word " LOSER " on a screen and sounding a loud buzzer . Noticeably absent from the Lose Your Dollar slot are revolving reels of colorful icons or a payout tray , which Bellagio officials confirmed was due to the fact no winning scenarios exist and no money will ever be disbursed . Once they lose , players are quickly prompted to insert more cash through a lighted slot for bills , which reportedly accepts denominations as high as 100 .
