" Last year , I called upon Congress to require trigger locks on handguns and place metal detectors at the entrance of every womb , " Clinton said at a White House press conference . " Such laws may well have saved the life of that unborn child . I now ask Congress to do the right thing and pass that legislation , as well as a measure extending the waiting period for firearms beyond nine months . We must keep handguns out of the unformed hands of our nation ' s fetuses . "
