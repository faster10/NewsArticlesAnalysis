" I am not going to change just because I now have this deluxe sewing machine that no one else in the country has . I do not want my newfound status as one of Guatemala ' s super rich to keep me from appreciating the good things in life that I have always enjoyed : three square meals a week , soles on the bottom of my feet , and over half my teeth . Even though I am a big sewing machine owner guy now , I am still going to stay the same me my family has always known and loved . "
