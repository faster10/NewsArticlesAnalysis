The trip reportedly culminated with Ramirez taking Ortiz to a batting cage in St . George , UT . Though Ortiz missed the first several balls , Ramirez told Ortiz that he knew he could do it , and that even if they were no longer teammates , they would always be best friends . Ortiz then began hitting ball after ball , the last five of which hit the " home run " net .
