" Overall , this is a great phone , " Sychak said of the Motorola V60 he has carried since last October , in recent weeks in his back pocket . " I really can ' t complain . It may not have some of the bells and whistles I ' ve seen on some of the newer models , like mobile messaging or color display or downloadable interface graphics , but it still suits my basic needs just fine . I shouldn ' t need a new one for a long time , barring the unforeseen . "
