" Look at the cute bunny , " said PETA commando Shirley " No Mercy " Dorn , a Norfolk area petcare volunteer and leader of the PETA strike force . Lovingly cradling the rescued rabbit as she walked past the charred and dismembered bodies of its captors , she added , " Look at his nose ! Look at his nose ! "
