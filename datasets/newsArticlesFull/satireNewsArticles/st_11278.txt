" He wasn ' t flashy , but he was the backbone of that group , " said Marty Nevins of Valdosta , GA . " No one will ever forget that moment when he decided to launch a massive ground assault on Baghdad rather than engage in a prolonged air campaign . That ' s just good old fashioned , meat and potatoes invading . None of this fancy shock and awe shit . They can bring in somebody else , but I don ' t think that group ' s gonna be the same with a new frontman . "
