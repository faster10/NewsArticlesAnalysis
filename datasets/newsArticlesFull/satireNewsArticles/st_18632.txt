The multi front offensive on parks , beaches , and public pools is scheduled to occur in three waves . First , families wanting to secure parking in close proximity to high value picnic checkpoints will move out under cover of darkness . The second rush of citizens will rendezvous at strategically shady regions of public parks by mid morning . Coastal weekend warriors will then begin storming the beaches , which should be filled to capacity by noon Saturday .
