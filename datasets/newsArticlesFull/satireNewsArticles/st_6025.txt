City planning commissioner Errol Criclow , who was dismissed by LaMere at a Planning And Zoning Commission hearing last Thursday as " subhuman , " said that he feared that LaMere ' s power would eventually corrupt him and his city . According to Criclow , during a private consultation with local community leaders , LaMere became infuriated with timid suggestions that his amulet be used to create more green spaces . In a blinding torrent of thunder and light , LaMere violently rezoned Rochester ' s west side with a maze of warehouses and parking garages . The act left LaMere himself dazed and shaken .
