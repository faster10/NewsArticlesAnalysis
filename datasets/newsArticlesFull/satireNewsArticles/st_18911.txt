" And I ' ve got my best guys working around the clock to convert all the ' overs ' in the piece into one syllable ' o ' ers . ' I got Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney and Margaret Atwood stripping all the V ' s and tacking apostrophes in their place . It ' s grunt work , but somebody ' s got to do it if this poem ' s going to get done . "
