" Over in Richland Center , we had some criminal activity occur dangerously close to unguarded reserves of fertilizer , " Richland County police officer Tim Hutter said . " The report came from one Helen Johnson , who expressed fear for the safety of her cows . A cow found lying on its side could either be the victim of a chemical agent or of some immature teenager who thinks it ' s funny to sneak into the pasture and tip over a helpless animal . Either way , we can ' t be too cautious . "
