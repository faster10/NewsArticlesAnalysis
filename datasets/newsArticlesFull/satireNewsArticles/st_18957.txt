" That ' s a load of bunk , " Slocum said . " When handled properly , machetes ain ' t dangerous . If other people are getting hurt by machetes or letting them near children without proper supervision , that ain ' t my fault . I shouldn ' t have my machete taken away from me , just because somebody else is careless with theirs . "
