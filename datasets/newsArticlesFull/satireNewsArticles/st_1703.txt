" It was going great : She was laughing at all my jokes and said I had ' wonderfully deep ' eyes , " Richman said . " At one point , I suggested that we go to a dance bar , but she said she didn ' t really like dancing . Now I see it ' s probably not so much that she doesn ' t like dancing but is against dancing . And when she said most movies and TV shows are awful these days , she didn ' t mean lame or dumb , but sinful . "
