Jarry said he dreams of one day running a store that deals exclusively in E . F . Caldwell sconces , table lamps , and chandeliers , along with those of other celebrated firms like Sterling Bronze Co . , Bradley Hubbard , and Murano . Unfortunately , the antique market in Duluth is not large enough to support such specialization . To ensure his store ' s profitability , Jarry has been forced to offer more in demand collectibles , such as Star Wars action figures , Schlitz beer signs from the ' 70s , and Welcome Back , Kotter TV tray tables .
