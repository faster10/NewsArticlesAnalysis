" Some kids might think it ' s cool to score drugs for their uncle , but it kind of gives me the creeps , " Kevin said . " I don ' t really hang out with the kids who deal that stuff , so it ' s awkward to go up and ask them for it . I ' m going to try , though . It ' s even worse to have Uncle Alex calling here and hanging up when Dad answers . We have caller ID . "
