According to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , the length of the mission depends upon the performance of the troops . " Hopefully , all will go well , and our very special forces will be back home within a week , " Albright said . " But if there are setbacks , such as soldiers losing their keys or having trouble staying on task or forgetting to take their pills , it could take longer . "
