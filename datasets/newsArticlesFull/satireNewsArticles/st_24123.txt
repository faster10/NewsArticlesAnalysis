Alarmed by the product ' s rise in popularity among minors , U . S . Sen . John McCain ( R AZ ) recently drafted legislation aimed at curbing underage Twinkie use . The bill , which allocates 255 million for PSAs and after school specials like ABC ' s recent The Boy Who Liked Twinkies , would also prohibit the snack cake from being advertised in youth oriented publications like Boys ' Life and Archie comics . Additionally , it would also ban the airing of TV ads featuring Twinkie The Kid before 10 p . m . Similar Hostess characters , including Captain Cupcake , Chauncey Chocodile , King Don and Fruit Pie The Magician , were voluntarily pulled from the air in the late ' 70s amid similar controversy .
