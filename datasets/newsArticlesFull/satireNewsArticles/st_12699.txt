" There was someone from Minnesota on my campus tour with me , and there was a black guy , too , " Knopecke said . " Then , at one point , this guy with blue hair walked by , and no one was even giving him a second look . I am so looking forward to being at a school where everyone isn ' t exactly the same . "
