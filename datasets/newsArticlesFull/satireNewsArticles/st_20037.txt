The initiative , known as Right Side of the Track , is opening 12 " Colts Fillies Clubs " in impoverished urban locales across the country , and already has four operational centers in Detroit , Baltimore , Birmingham , and St . Louis . According to organizers , the facilities will provide at risk yearlings and disadvantaged foals with free access to state of the art running tracks , experienced trainers and jockeys , and , depending upon their behavior , sugar cubes .
