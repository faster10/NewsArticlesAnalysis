" Hey Everyone , " read the first line of the president ' s note , which at 27 megabytes proved too large for millions of Americans ' in boxes . " I ' m writing to you because I need to clear up some important issues . First and foremost , I want to say that this has nothing to do with the midterm elections because I was going to send an e mail regardless of the outcome . However , I guess one could argue that , in the end , the midterms are an important measure of a president ' s overall success , though I wouldn ' t go so far as to call the results a referendum . Legislatively , I feel I ' ve had a lot of success that I think history will judge quite favorably . I mean , pretty much every modern president has seen his party lose seats during a midterm , you know ?
