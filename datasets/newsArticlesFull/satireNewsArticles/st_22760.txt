" When I came here in 2001 , they promised me a championship team , " the stadium said . " I was warned by venerable and much beloved Three Rivers Stadium which imploded soon afterwards , as you know that I should look elsewhere , that this team was set in its ways and not focused on rebuilding , that they were simply using me as a means to make money , " the stadium said . " I was young and brash and I didn ' t listen . Now that I am more mature and have settled a bit , I realize I have to do what is best for me and my family . "
