" I need my machete and not just for play , " said Delmore Taggart of Coffeyville , KS . " Sure , I enjoy taking it out to the barn and having a little fun with the animals . But it ' s also vitally useful . How else am I supposed to , say , slash my way through dense jungle vines ? Or harvest a sugar cane crop , if there were any around here ? "
