" Van Burensburg seems like it ' d be easy , but it ' s not , " Sadecki said . " I used to call it Van Turdburglar , ' cause they got a lot of homos there , too , but that kind of felt like a stretch . You could do Van Halensburg , but that ' d be a compliment , like the town really rocks or something . I think there was a president called Van Buren , but I don ' t know anything about him . So it ' s tough . "
