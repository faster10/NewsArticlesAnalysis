Though authorities are still debating the cause of the tragedy , preliminary reports indicate that a mechanical malfunction in the band ' s 45 million on stage ventilation system is to blame . The system , which employs five computer controlled , industrial sized wind machines to blow fumes away from the stage area , has been used by the million selling group since 1992 to combat the " danger layer " of toxic odors which surround the band ' s rabid fan base at all times .
