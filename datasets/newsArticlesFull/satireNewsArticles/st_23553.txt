" To be perfectly honest , I think they sound much more like Oasis , " Yorke told the magazine . " Or maybe some shit pop band , like the Killers . Their only similarity to us is that they ' ve made their music available for free online , and that hardly counts . After listening to every one of their songs and poring over all of their lyrics , I can say without hesitation that Radiohead has never influenced this band in any way , shape , or form . "
