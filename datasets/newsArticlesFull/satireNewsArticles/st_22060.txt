" Amir was more than a boss to me he was a friend , " Al Katif said . " He was a visionary , an important contributor to rubble theory , and a brilliant pragmatist when it came to the urban development of Palestinian lands . We will miss Amir , but we will remember him by continuing the great work he started . "
