" The National Hockey League takes discipline very seriously , " Shanahan said . " However , it is not the job of the penalization system to make violators into better people , a task for which we believe the coach , family , and church are best suited . We are only attempting to protect law abiding players , ensure a fair and competitive atmosphere , and provide an entertaining experience for our fans , and we think the use of the modern , safe , and clean penalty box helps us meet those goals .
