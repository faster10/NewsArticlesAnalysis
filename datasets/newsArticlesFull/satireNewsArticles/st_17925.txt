" Hannah ' s telling me that no one she knows does drugs , but right there on page 112 , it says that someone at summer camp last year was smoking pot , " Dunn said . " Hannah wrote that she didn ' t smoke any , but I still find it disturbing that kids that young even have access to drugs . I used to smoke pot once in a while , but I haven ' t seen so much as a joint passed at a party in years . "
