Guard Matt Slauson , who recently signed with the Chicago Bears , admitted he was looking forward to the day when a player could freely come out of the closet and suffer a career ending injury from a cheap cut block . In addition , Slauson said that he would be perfectly fine with a homosexual teammate , one whom he could potentially learn from and then physically and mentally torture on the practice field as well as in the locker room .
