" One great advantage of using Manpower , " Wunsch said , " is that you don ' t have to build relationships with the workers they supply , because , even if they ' re there for months or years , they ' re not technically company employees . I can ' t begin to tell you how refreshing it is to work with people you can ignore , people you don ' t have to smile at when you see them around the office . "
