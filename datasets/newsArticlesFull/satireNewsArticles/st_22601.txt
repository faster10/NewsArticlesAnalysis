" I used to go to the gym , but I haven ' t seen the inside of Gold ' s since we started on this new distribution structure , " Poole said . " I used to eat fairly healthy , too , but I ' ve grown pretty accustomed to snacking on whatever ' s in the breakroom all day and then grabbing some McDonald ' s on the way home . I always pair it with a 32 ounce Coke . That ' s right sugary , empty calorie laden Coke . I refuse to choke down another Blue Juice as long as I live . "
