" I didn ' t want to drive all the way to the Salvation Army to get rid of our old baby clothes , " Ancona said . " If I didn ' t sell them today , I was going to throw them out . It ' s a good thing the Farrells just had a baby . They bought all my baby clothes , and we bought a bunch of the stuff they had to get rid of to baby proof the house . "
