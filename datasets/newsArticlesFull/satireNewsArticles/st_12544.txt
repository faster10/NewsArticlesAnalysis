Perez is not the first to note that quirky , independently distributed typefaces rarely earn Fonty recognition . In the rare instances when cutting edge fonts are nominated , they are typically relegated to the Best Decorative Font category . Such was the case with the bitstream release Eyeballs , which was nominated for Best Decorative Font but lost out to SnowCap , a long entrenched favorite of the bagged ice industry .
