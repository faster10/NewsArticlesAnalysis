" You can really feel it in your legs it ' s hard work , " Miller said . " There are some days when I ' m so exhausted that the thought of putting on my clothes and standing just sounds like the last thing in the world I ' d want to do , but I try hard to push through . I know the more I stand , the more energy I ' ll have later on for other things , like eating . "
