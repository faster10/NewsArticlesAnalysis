" If we don ' t do something , this technology is going to destroy the record industry , " said Nathan Davis , vice president of Atlantic Records , Kid Rock ' s label . " Just imagine if the oil change industry allowed the public to have direct access to oil and oil filters , enabling them to change their car ' s oil themselves without going through Jiffy Lube or Kwik Lube . People would stop going to oil change shops , and the entire industry would collapse . We can ' t let that happen to us . "
