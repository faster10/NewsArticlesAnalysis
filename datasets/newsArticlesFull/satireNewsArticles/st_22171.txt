According to Jim Lucas , in the weeks leading up to Adrian ' s suicide , the teen grew increasingly despondent and self destructive . " He kept scratching himself back and forth on his wrists , saying , ' This way to the hospital , this way to the morgue , ' " he said . " At least once a day , he ' d mention that slitting your wrists in a warm bathtub is supposed to feel just like going to sleep . Those last few days , I heard it from him so many times , I practically wanted to slit my own wrists . "
