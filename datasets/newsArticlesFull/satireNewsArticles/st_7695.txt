" We only expect our fans ' weight to increase , " Rice said . " If their current rate of gain continues , by 2016 the average Cubs fan will weigh 600 pounds . And unfortunately that means we ' ll have to tear down Wrigley and build a new , state of the art stadium that allows ushers to roll supine game attendees from their bus , car , or subway into the stadium and into their spots , where they can continue to just lie there and watch the game . Basically , we can ' t have Cubs fans physically moving on our premises , as any movement on their part would certainly kill them . "
