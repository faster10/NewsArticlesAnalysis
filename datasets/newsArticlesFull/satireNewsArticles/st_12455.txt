Hudson would not comment on the possibility that the beheading was a " copycat " crime inspired by a much publicized incident in nearby Ashland this past April , when a Ken doll was found in a toolshed immersed in a hardened block of wax . Two boys , ages 12 and 13 , were arrested in connection with the Ken torture and will stand trial in juvenile court next month .
