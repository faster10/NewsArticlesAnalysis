Last Friday at 4 p . m . , Mark Wesley , 46 , a resident of Overland Park ' s exclusive Maple Bluff subdivision , heard the sound of " animal like shrieking " coming from the vicinity of his front lawn . Upon opening his front door , he was greeted by the sight of a pale and shirtless Manson carving a pentagram into his chest with a razor blade .
