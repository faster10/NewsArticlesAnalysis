" Joe brought home these old printing plates , " Worthen said . " He put , like , six of them up on the bathroom wall , and two of them have already fallen down because of the humidity from the shower . And the ones that are still up have these razor sharp edges . Every time I ask him when he ' s going to finish it , he tells me he just needs to borrow some tin snips to fit to the corners . He doesn ' t care that we ' re in danger of slicing ourselves open on the edges of these stupid plates . "
