" Justin was doing great out there . It was a pleasure to watch him , " Acta said of Masterson , who pitched 7 . 2 scoreless innings . " But he was looking pretty tired , so I thought I ' d call time , talk things over , give him a breather . Then I remembered I had this nice little 2008 Seven Hills Winery Viognier that I ' d put on ice at the start of the game , and I thought , why not ? It ' s a lovely night . "
