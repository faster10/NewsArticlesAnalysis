This week , the APBA has begun to send out recall information and cardboard mailing boxes to registered pug owners , who are asked to place their ' 07 pug inside the box , seal it , and , if they wish , punch air holes in the top and sides . Owners must then put the box inside an airtight heavy duty plastic bag , affix a postage paid mailing label , and drop it off at any U . S . post office .
