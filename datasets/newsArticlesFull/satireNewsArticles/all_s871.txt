Bob Geldof to extend Band Aid concept to Boomtown Rats singles
‘It’s feckin’ genius,’ said the singer/songwriter, speaking about the fourth successful release of ‘Don’t They Know it’s Christmas?’ in thirty years. ‘I can’t believe it, surely they’ve cracked on to the date by now?’ he asked before launching into his new project. ‘You know, one of the reasons I stopped doing the Boomtown Rats was because writing songs is so feckin’ tedious, making words rhyme and stories that sorta make some sense,’ he said, adding, ‘but then I thought why don’t I do a Band Aid thing with my old songs, change a lyric here, add a chord there, slip in Bono wherever I can?’ Geldof hinted that ‘Tell Me Why (I Don’t Like Mondays)’ was going to get the Band Aid treatment first. ‘It’s a feckin natural. We’re going to start with Tuesday first, because that’s really a none-day, isn’t it? Week’s under way, nothing special to look forward to, if anyone is going to go postal, surely Tuesday’s the day. And what about Wednesday? Sure it’s close to half-past week, almost twenty-five to Friday and all that shit, but Christ, how depressing a day can you get?’ Geldof went on to explain that ‘She’s So Modern’ is probably ‘a load of crap now. ‘Modern? She’s probably mid fifties, tights rolling down her legs, wearing three baggy cardigans, shopping in feckin’ Aldi and dripping wee unless she’s stocked up on decent Tena’s. And don’t start me on Rat Trap – I mean there’s mouse traps and bear traps,’ he said, noting that he frequently gets requests to ‘shut my feckin’ trap. That could be a single too,’ he said, scraping the barrel for a suitable Boomtown Rats song to adapt.
