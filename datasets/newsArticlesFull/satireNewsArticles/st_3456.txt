" This was clearly the right thing to do it ' s just too soon , " programmer Russell Sperber said . " No one is ready for the realistic wound channel modeling or rifle bullet ballistics right now , but by the time March rolls around , they ' ll go nuts over it . That and the unlockable extra levels , the ' Create A Cryptic Note ' feature , and the ' Play As The Cops ' mode . And , of course , we ' ll be expanding the Create A Sniper feature , in which you can put yourself or your friends in a tree outside a strip mall parking lot and take aim at the customers exiting such stores as Ponderosa , T . J . Maxx , and Jo Ann Fabrics . "
