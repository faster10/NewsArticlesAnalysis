" We could use a simile and say , ' Our schools are like prisons without guards . ' It ' s okay , but not as good as ' ticking time bomb . ' We could use hyperbole and say , ' Our schools are filled with crime all hours of the day . ' Not good either . Nothing has the punch of ' Our schools are a ticking time bomb . ' "
