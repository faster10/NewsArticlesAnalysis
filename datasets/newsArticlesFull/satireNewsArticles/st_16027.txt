" Jay , Teddy Orr , and I used to go ' country cruising ' all the time , " McRoddy said . " When I called up Jay to do it a few weeks ago , he said he ' d go but that we couldn ' t use his truck because he didn ' t want to get another DUI . This is the guy who , a few years ago , liked to say that DUIs are the small price you pay for having a good time . I ' m not sure I even know Jay anymore . "
