Those close to Cheney report that the vice president has long complained about having to see doctors within the HMO network , rather than choosing his own specialist . In 2003 , Cheney wrote a letter of complaint when , instead of being admitted to the Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment of his angina , he was directed to an HMO approved urgent care clinic in Clarendon , VA . According to the vice president , he sat in a crowded lobby between a mother with a colicky baby and a drunken Georgetown student with a broken nose for several hours , and both were examined before him .
