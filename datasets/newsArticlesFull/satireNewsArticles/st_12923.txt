According to witnesses , dozens of angry actors marched off the CW lot in Burbank yesterday and pillaged through the streets carrying the head of TV executive Les Moonves . Bands of the irate C listers are said to have poured down from the Hollywood Hills at nightfall , reportedly smashing the limousines and luxury vehicles they encountered on Melrose Avenue and Rodeo Drive before laying siege to the Los Feliz compound of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt .
