So they went skipping hand in hand , all the American People together ( who will never again quarrel , or say nasty things , or steal another boy ' s lunch basket nor pull another girl ' s pigtails , or walk through the Little Red Schoolhouse wearing trenchcoats and carrying bad , bad muskets to shoot other children ) , and they skipped into the Happy Valley of all tomorrows , where the Sun always shines , and there are always plenty of Nokia cell phones , and gas is never more than 1 . 09 a gallon and they sang as they skipped , and they were not troubled by anything .
