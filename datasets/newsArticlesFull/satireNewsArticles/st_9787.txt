" Those bikes are my pride and joy , but I ' ve taken them for granted , " Randle said . " And that ' s true for far too many other things , as well . From now on , I ' m going to swim in my Olympic sized pool , crack open that bottle of 1982 Chateau Ducru Beaucaillou , hire a pilot , and have him fly me all over the place in that Cessna two seater I have in storage . What was I doing wasting my life away in an office when I had a beautiful 12 , 000 stereo just waiting for me at home ? "
