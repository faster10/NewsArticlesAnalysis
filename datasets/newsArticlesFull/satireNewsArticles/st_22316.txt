The wedding of Margrethe , daughter of Jan the Beekeeper , and Pieter , an apprentice harness maker , happened to fall on the Feast of St . Anthony , patron saint of swineherds and bell ringers . It is believed that this may have intensified the drunken revelry amongst guests . A great sheep ' s bladder of cider was brought up from Antwerp for the occasion , and pipers were engaged to make merry music .
