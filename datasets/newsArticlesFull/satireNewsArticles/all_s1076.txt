Birth of a Nation, my butt!
Birth of a Nation, a 100 year-old black and white (appropriate) historical film turns racists into even bigger racists claim modern day psychologists!  This epic film depicts white people painted black and acting like ignorant morons running away from a bunch of white, ignorant morons called the Ku Klux Klan. This is why it is called 'Birth of a Nation' because the film makers hoped to make sure that white viewers would turn against black people and America would remain a white, master race nation! No, this is not Nazi Germany, this was the USA! Thankfully a clever Dick washed all the faces of the whites playing black people and banned Al Jolson from singing 'Mammy'. England banned the 'Black and White Minstrels', an all white TV show with whites painting themselves black and the world began to realise that black, white, red, yellow, etc, people are all equal and this stupid film was rightly dumped in a very black and dark dungeon! However, sadly there are white sickos out there who rediscovered the film and allow themselves the pleasure of watching the Ku Klux Klan spank black people with impunity turning it into a cult film for racists still left in the dark abyss of slavery!\" Hollywood is contemplating releasing the tales of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn in support of the racist movement that is sweeping the US in view of ISIS barbarism and hope to turn the US back to what it really is, a multi-culti nation run by guess who? Scumbag CIA reporter, Fuzzy Creep-Underyourbogseat, also hoped to interview Bill Cosby, sadly he was otherwise engaged!
