" I hope Becca isn ' t being worked too hard at the bookstore , " Lobsang said from Lhasa , Tibet in a phone interview . " I was amused by her choice of summer beach reading : the kitschy Jacqueline Susann classic The Love Machine . Summer does have a way of slipping by you , I agree . And I also hope that Becca had fun in Curacao , even if her annoying younger brother was there . I had an annoying younger brother once , too . He was imprisoned and later shot by the Chinese secret police . "
