I have even stopped listening to the radio entirely since every time I turn it on I hear yet another song about utilizing the transfer of heat across a thin liquid to separate uranium isotopes ( " Topin ' Freakin ' " by Lil ' Fission , " F k the International Atomic Energy Agency " by Yellowcake , and " 1 SWU 1 kg SW 1 kg UTA " by Kelly Clarkson to name just a few ) .
