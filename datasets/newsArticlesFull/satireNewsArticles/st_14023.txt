At press time , despite what has just been written here , this reporter really hopes Jon Hamm wins tonight because the guy deserves it , and this season of Mad Men was really good , and while sources can argue that it served primarily as setup for the next season , they cannot argue the fact that Megan has truly come into her own and added a new element of depth to the show . And if the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences chooses not to recognize that then they can go straight to hell . That being said , if they do choose to recognize it , this reporter will be really happy because , well , it ' s just nice to have something you like so much be validated live in front of a national audience . Sure , that sounds pathetic . This reporter knows it . But it ' s true . It ' s just true .
