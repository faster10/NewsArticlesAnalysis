Viewers have repeatedly cited one scene in particular , in which the female athlete blows a whistle while students perform drills , as evidence that she is a track star . However , they admitted it is not completely clear whether the sequence is set at a track and field facility , and later acknowledged that both whistles and athletic drills are used in a variety of sports . In addition , because the woman appears to be fairly young , sources have concluded she is more than likely not either of the two Olympic track stars they are peripherally aware of , Jackie Joyner Kersee or Florence Griffith Joyner , though neither gold medalist has been ruled out completely .
