According to Siegel , Blues Brothers 2000 , which stars Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman , will be even funnier than the original . " Aykroyd and Goodman will be pure dynamite together , " he said . " I never thought I ' d say this , but Blues Brothers 2000 will outshine even the first Blues Brothers movie ! "
