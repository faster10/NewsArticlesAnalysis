The press conference came as a surprise to humankind , as God rarely intervenes in earthly affairs . As a matter of longstanding policy , He has traditionally left the task of interpreting His message and divine will to clerics , rabbis , priests , imams , and Biblical scholars . Theologians and laymen alike have been given the task of pondering His ineffable mysteries , deciding for themselves what to do as a matter of faith . His decision to manifest on the material plane was motivated by the deep sense of shock , outrage , and sorrow He felt over the Sept . 11 violence carried out in His name , and over its dire potential ramifications around the globe .
