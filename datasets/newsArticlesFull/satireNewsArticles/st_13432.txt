" My honest assessment ? ' Marian The Librarian ' is at 50 percent right now , and it needs to be at 110 , " said director Paul Stutzman , adding that the while Allen Bielecki and Melissa Hodge are both doing a fine job in the roles of Professor Harold Hill and Marian Paroo , the number just isn ' t coming together as he ' d hoped . " People are going to come here expecting a classic ' Marian The Librarian , ' and if we don ' t give it to them , we have no one to blame but ourselves . It ' s certainly not up to my standards , it ' s not up to Greensburg Playhouse standards , and if they ' re being truthful , I think Allen and Melissa would tell you it ' s not up to their standards .
