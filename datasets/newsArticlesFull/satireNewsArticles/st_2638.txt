Birch said he has little sympathy for his perfectionist mother , who reportedly tries to do too much and invites too many people . He says she is known to spend countless hours weaving thistle wreaths and sun drying her own currants for hot cross buns in preparation for the Equinox . " It ' s hard to feel sorry for her when things don ' t go exactly according to her elaborate , impossible plans , " Birch said . " And she knows better than to invite Aunt Isolde , who always has too much mulled mead and starts moaning about the lack of a good high priest in her life . "
