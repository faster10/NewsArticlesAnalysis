" It was horrible , just horrible , " one witness said . " The gorilla would pick him up , spin him around , and throw him down , then hit him with the luggage . It would set him up against the wall in a half conscious slump , get a running start from the other side of the room , then smash into him with the suitcase and rebound off the wall . It ' d pick him up and spin him around in a pinwheeling motion , then throw him at the floor and bounce him against the wall again . It ' d jump on his head , bounce up and down in a squatting motion on his chest , then pick him up and start the whole process again . "
