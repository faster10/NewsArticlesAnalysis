" We wanted to make these reckless driving lanes as convenient as possible , " said Harold Bovy , chief engineer on the project , who added that his team ' s main priority was containing drivers while allowing emergency vehicles the easy and frequent access they will require . " So we made sure that once reckless drivers are in these lanes , they can only leave them by designated funnel shaped ramps or in the full service hearses that will be stationed 24 hours a day at any number of convenient rest areas .
