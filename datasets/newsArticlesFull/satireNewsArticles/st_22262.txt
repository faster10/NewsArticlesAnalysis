Although Belichick has refused to discuss personnel moves , Patriots insiders say that benching Brady for next week ' s game against undefeated Dallas was a definite possibility . All pro tight end Ben Watson , who only scored twice against the Browns and struggled to produce a 106 yard performance , will almost certainly lose his starting job . Backup running back Samuel Morris managed only 102 yards on 21 carries and is generally acknowledged to be finished in the NFL . And wideout Randy Moss , held to only 49 yards , is almost certain to be traded by next week .
