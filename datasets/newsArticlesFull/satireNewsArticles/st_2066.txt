" God , I remember how Eric would go on and on about how great things were back in Ohio . He was cleaning pools with his friend Mark Tanner , and all they did , according to Eric , was drive around from job to job , listening to the Melvins and talking about girls . Then , they ' d get off from work and drink at this biker bar down the road from 3 in the afternoon until closing . "
