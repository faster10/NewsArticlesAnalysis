" You have to really get to know your truck you have to listen to it , " Maurer said . " If you do , you ' ll pick up on those little clicks and whines that are signs of bigger problems . Even when it ' s running perfectly and it seems like nothing ' s bothering it , your truck is trying to tell you things . You just have to have the patience to hear . "
