Television networks have joined forces with the Breast Cancer Obliviousness Foundation in support of its cause . Throughout March , CBS will air public service announcements featuring Ray Romano delivering the slogan , " Breast Cancer : Fuhgeddaboutit ! " On March 28 , NBC will air a " very routine episode " of Friends in which none of the female characters are diagnosed with , or even mention , breast cancer . The episode will conclude with a phone number viewers may call to hear that evening ' s sports scores .
