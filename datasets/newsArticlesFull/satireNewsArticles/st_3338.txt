Anyway , I was going to write about Barack Obama and the big race issue for this post , and I had it all planned out : I was going to go ask Manuela Fonetcilla , the exchange student from Chile , what is was like to not be white and run for secretary of SADD , so I would know what Barack Obama is going through .
