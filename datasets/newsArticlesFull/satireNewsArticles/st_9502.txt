" Why are the vampires lesbians ? " sales agent Cal Fagan asked . " Were they lesbians before they became vampires , or did getting bitten have something to do with it ? I never understood that . And is it necessary for them to seduce their victims before killing them ? Why do they ' writhe sinuously ' on every other page ? And what did William ' s secret meeting with the dominatrix have to do with anything ? I ' m sorry , it just seemed gratuitous . "
