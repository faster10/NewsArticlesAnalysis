The campaign is intended to de emphasize the inconvenience and social stigma associated with using public transportation , focusing instead on the positives . Among these positives : the health benefits of getting fresh air while waiting at the bus stop , the chance to meet interesting people from a diverse array of low paying service sector jobs , and the opportunity to learn new languages by reading subway ads written in Spanish .
