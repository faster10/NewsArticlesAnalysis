" I think we ' ve come far enough as a nation that we don ' t need to have one anymore , " Wheldon wrote . " It ' s not like we ' re Somalia , where the warlords run everything , or Russia , where it ' s all organized crime . We ' ve had over 200 years of being Americans . I don ' t think we still need the United States of America to show us how to do it . "
