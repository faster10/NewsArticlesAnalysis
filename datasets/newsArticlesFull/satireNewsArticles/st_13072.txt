Perhaps the most damaging testimony has come from Mr Crandall himself , who on Tuesday told police that while the couple was dating in 1977 , Mrs Crandall then known as Helen Steuben demanded that he buy her a ring worth over 1 , 000 before he could have sex with her . The first sexual liaison took place some six months later at Bob ' s Honeymooner Hotel during an all expenses paid trip to Niagara Falls .
