To date , the residents of Summitville have raised 7 , 348 , which town mayor Hal Munsingame proudly hand delivered to CEC MidCorp ' s headquarters Monday . Unable to get past the lobby security guards , Munsingame left the cash with a receptionist along with a note reading , " Summitville believes in you ! " and a jar of Edna Rafferty ' s homemade strawberry preserves .
