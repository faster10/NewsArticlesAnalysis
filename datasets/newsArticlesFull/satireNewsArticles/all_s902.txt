Poll of end of year polls decides the best end of year poll of the year
The results of a poll of the best end of year polls of the year will be announced later today. The NME poll of the year is expected to be named as the best end of year poll. “It’s simply a very good end of year poll,” send end of year poll expert Simon Williams. “It lists its items according to rank over a series of pages culminating in the item that the contributors deem most worthy. I simply can’t get enough of it.” There has been criticism that the poll of end of year polls only takes in the most popular and mainstream end of year polls and that it has become a popularity contest rather than a true indicator of the best end of year poll. “It’s a valid criticism,” said Mr Williams. “There have been some splendid end of year polls; ‘Horse and Hound’ ran two terrific end of year polls, best horse and best hound.” “Also ‘Modern Dentistry’s’ end of year poll of favourite teeth was riveting.” “And Zoo magazine’s Best boobs of 2014 was surprisingly arresting.” “But I think that, if the NME end of year poll does win, it will be a fair result. It is thought that the Rolling Stone end of year poll was deemed ‘too mental’ to be included after naming U2 as best album.
