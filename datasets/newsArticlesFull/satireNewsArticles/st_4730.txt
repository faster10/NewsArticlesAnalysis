" After the unspeakable events of last Sept . 11 , the U . S . was deeply touched by the outpouring of support and condolences from our neighbors and allies the world over , " Bush said . " This kindness played a vital role in our national healing process , but , more importantly , it cemented our long standing self image as the country , with all other nations lumped together into a vague , foreign Other Place . I call upon you now to join us in our vision of America as the only country whose wishes matter . "
