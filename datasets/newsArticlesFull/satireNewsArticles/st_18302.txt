The NASACAR Space Shuttle , which boasts such sponsors as Sunoco and Gold Bond Medicated Powder and is piloted by veteran driver Ernie Irvan , made its debut Sunday at the Slick 50 300 at the Talladega Speedway in Talladega , FL . Despite averaging 2 , 300 mph , the shuttle finished dead last in its inaugural race , largely due to a mid race pit stop that took nearly two days .
