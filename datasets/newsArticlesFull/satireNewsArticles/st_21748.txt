LOS ANGELES U . S . figure skater Rena Inoue announced Monday that , due to a stipulation in her Skating With Celebrities contract with the Fox network , she will be required to drop her traditional partner John Baldwin and compete in the Olympic pairs event with former Full House star Dave Coulier . " Although Dave and I have made a lot of progress on the show , and I am confident in our ability to outskate pairs like Tai Babilonia and Bruce Jenner or Jenni Meno and Todd Bridges , I ' m not sure we ' re quite ready to compete against professionals like Russia ' s Maria Petrova and Aleksi Tikhonov just yet , " Inoue said . " It ' s certainly going to be a challenge . Me and my real life partner John have won two national titles and were the first pair in history to land a throw triple axel . Dave ' s still getting used to wearing ice skates . " Inoue predicted that , despite the fact that Coulier has to hold her hand during the entire performance to stop himself from falling , they stand a fighting chance of outscoring Canada ' s Valerie Marcoux and her partner , the breakout star of Canadian TV ' s version of Skating With Celebrities , Rick Moranis .
