" I rarely see my husband anymore , " Ghayda Hassim said . " I never thought I ' d say this , but I miss the early months of the occupation when Sulieman was out of work like everyone else , sipping mint tea , watching Al Jazeera at full blast , and ordering me around like a slave . I want my old Sulieman back . "
