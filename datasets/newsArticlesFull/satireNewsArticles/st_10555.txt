" Now that the public ' s efforts to curtail questionable Wall Street trading practices have all but ceased , it ' s time for us to bring the world to its knees again , " said AIG CEO Robert Benmosche . " There are still plenty of opaque financial derivatives , high frequency trading operations , and off balance sheet transactions out there , all with virtually no federal regulation . Trust me , we can definitely work with that . And if anything , we can always just lobby for further concessions and deregulation in Washington which , by the way , is so , so easy to do and then we can cause as much damage as we want . "
