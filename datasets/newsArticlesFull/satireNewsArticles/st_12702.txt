" You should see University Avenue , " Knopecke said . " There ' s about three different record stores , including this unbelievable one called CD Wherehouse . It ' s got everything : I looked under R . E . M . , and they had almost every album by them . They even had an entire section of rap music . Just as amazing , though , is this other store , The CD X change , where you can buy used CDs for , like , half the price of new ones . I ' m gonna be there all the time . "
