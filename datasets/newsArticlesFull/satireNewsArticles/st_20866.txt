" Looking at the field , I think we have a pretty good chance , " said 52 year old David Holtz , who will play for the Greensboro County Rotary Club . " Sure , the University of Dayton has guys who are younger and faster than us , but they lost to La Salle in February . Christ , I could beat La Salle by myself . The team to watch is definitely the Freemasons from Danville , CT . They have this one guy who is 6 foot 4 . "
