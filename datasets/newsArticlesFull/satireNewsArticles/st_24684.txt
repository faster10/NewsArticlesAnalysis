Added Klieg : " Rather than trying to attract more voters , let ' s attract better voters . We could reduce the overall cost of the election by 97 percent if we paid a small body of informed , designated voters to keep abreast of candidates ' policy positions . The candidates would save time and money , too , because they could focus their attention on the thousand votes that count . And fewer ballots means faster , more accurate counting . It ' s just good sense . "
