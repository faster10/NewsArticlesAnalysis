Updike added : " John Kitner ' s quest is a part of a larger one : how to write a character who is different from yourself . If he can find the magic key to this age old puzzle , he will usher in a renaissance in human literature . For the first time , crime novelists will be able to write convincingly about murderers , even if they are not murderers themselves . Non spies will be able to write about spies . In this new type of literature , there will actually be characters who are something other than novelists . Imagine the possibilities . "
