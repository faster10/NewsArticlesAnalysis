" Sadly , this sort of mistreatment of iPhones is more widespread than people think , " said Dr Jordan Heimlich , director of Winnetka Community Services , who is currently supervising the iPhone ' s care . " People leave their iPhones precariously perched on the edges of counters , they forget to charge them , they even fail to provide them with basic necessities like a decorative carrying case . I ' ve even heard cases of iPhones being dropped . "
