“Stop Peelin Justin Bieber’s Banana” Rob Ford Yells at Reporters
Mixing Jimmy Buffet and Bob Marley lyrics with fake Jamaican patois, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford bellowed out at media late today over coverage of pop star Justin Bieber’s recent Miami arrest. “Why all you reporters kickin Bieber’s coconuts eh mon?” Ford asked loudly of reporters waiting for the Mayor outside downtown Toronto’s Pork Chop King restaurant and bar.  “Doin ya big man ting on a good kid who got a lil highho on his own personal time?” “Dat’s a good yong mon dere…a real cheeseburger in paradise if you see wot I mean.” Footage of Ford swearing and rambling in a mixture of English street-gang slang and Jamaican patois at Etobicoke’s Steak Queen restaurant got wide media coverage last week but was bumped off the front pages by 19-year-old Bieber’s Miami arrest for DUI, resisting arrest, drag racing, not having a valid driver’s license and being a little zit. “Dis ain’t right yous guys,” Ford continued as he made his way to his black Escalade with reporters shouting questions the Mayor chose to ignore. “Tryya be nice. Let’s get together an feel alright, alright?” As stunned reporters watched and listened, the Mayor did a little dance shuffle and quietly sang “Don’t worry bout a ting, cause every little ting gonna be all right.” Ford admitted last week that he had been “drinking a little bit” despite repeated promises that he had totally quit crack, meth, pot, prescription drugs, model airplane glue and alcohol. “Look, let da Bieber mon alone right,” said Ford as he took a parking ticket from under his windshield wiper and tossed it onto the passenger seat. “We’re all just searchin’ for our lost shaker of salt, naah I mean?”
