Americans remain stubbornly uptight about sexual relations with hot robots
In spite of increasingly casual attitudes about sex, a recent survey shows that most Americans remain prudishly opposed to the idea of intimacy with sexy life-sized robots. The Center for Technological Progress stated in its findings that while 87 percent of respondents found “nothing particularly weird” about movies in which a human makes love to a robot, only 23 percent said they would have intercourse with a robot in real life. 12 percent of respondents said they have already experienced physical love with a robot, but only half of those said it lived up to their expectations. Of those who enjoyed sex with a robot, most said it was because the robots had been programmed to switch themselves off after the encounter, avoiding any post-coital awkwardness about having just had sex with an inanimate machine.
