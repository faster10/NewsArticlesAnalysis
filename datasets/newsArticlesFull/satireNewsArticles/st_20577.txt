Course workers , spectators , and event sponsors have all presented damaging evidence pointing toward Keflezighi ' s use of equine enhancements . Volunteers working refreshment tables during the race said Keflezighi took water only twice at miles nine and 17 consuming roughly 10 gallons each time , and was the only professional runner in the men ' s event to request an oat , carrot , and sugar lump station . In addition , a spokesman for Nike told reporters the company provided Keflezighi with six shoes for the marathon , four of which required special construction before being nailed onto his feet .
