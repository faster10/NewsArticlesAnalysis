Local wildlife officials were excited by the spill . " A thick coat of oil should help these animals tremendously , especially with the cold weather coming , " said Greg Gedman , secretary of Alaska ' s Department of Fish , Wildlife and Parks . " Last winter , over 2 , 500 Aleutian cranes suffered severe thermal breakdown from the cold . When temperatures reach 75 degrees below zero , cranes need a good oil like Castrol to keep their wings , claws and other parts loose . "
