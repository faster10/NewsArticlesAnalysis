Let ' s say your provisions to the Patriot Act are striking out , or you put your foot in your mouth at a press conference . You can expect a little visit . Not the Big Guy himself , but someone will drop by for a little chat . He ' ll hint that maybe you could add a step , get a little quicker , gain a little more power if you had some of Karl Rove ' s candy . Oh , Number One ' s too smart to get caught with it himself , but as sure as I ' m standing here , he knows where it is and who ' s taking it . You better believe it . "
