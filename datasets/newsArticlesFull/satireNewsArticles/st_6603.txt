" I ' m in a lot of pain , so I chose the generic painkillers , " said Art Gallagher , 69 , of Colorado Springs , CO , a recent enrollee who has been on pain relievers since his stomach surgery three months ago . " I ' m not always thrilled with the limited selection they don ' t have Vicodin , and I already have plenty of Percocet . But they do have a pretty good selection , as long as you ' re not too picky about some of the fancy extras , like extended side effects or warning liner notes . "
