Newsweek movie critic David Ansen called The Entitled Scorsese ' s " best shot " at a directing Oscar since his most recent loss to Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby . " Filming in a soundstage in Burbank instead of on the streets of New York was a risk , but it will pay off , " Ansen said . " As long as Spielberg doesn ' t come out with anything , I ' d say this is Scorsese ' s year . "
