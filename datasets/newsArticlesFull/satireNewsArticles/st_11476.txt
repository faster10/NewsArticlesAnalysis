" Many participants wrote ' shot to death ' in the space provided for comments , probably thinking that it fit in with the gangster characters ' stated realities , " Columbia Pictures director of marketing Peter Zitterman said . " Some comments showed a lot of careful thought , such as ' point blank through head from right side , ' ' both at once with single shot from elephant gun , ' and ' several hundred times , with multiple camera angles showing their bodies jerking as they ' re shredded with a heavy hosing of lead , spraying the lens with gobbets of meat and bone and blood , with the sheer number of fist sized exit wounds obviously precluding any sequel . ' And shootings weren ' t the only ideas suggested , believe me . "
