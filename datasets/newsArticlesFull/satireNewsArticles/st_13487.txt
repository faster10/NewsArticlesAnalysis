" I got Mom a coffeemaker , but it sits there on the counter all shiny while she makes her coffee on the stove , " Seely said . " She said she wanted to keep the new coffeemaker nice , so whoever got it next could enjoy it . The box and all the instructions are in the kitchen closet . Plus , she said she didn ' t want to buy coffee filters for it , because they come in packs of 100 . "
