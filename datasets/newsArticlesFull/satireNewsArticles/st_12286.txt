Pascarelli confirmed the fire broke out around 12 : 20 a . m . at a Grove Street property occupied by Mike and Sheila Donlin , three young children , and as many as six perfectly good , untouched Oreo cookies , all of which were present at the time of the blaze . The rapidly spreading conflagration may have been sparked by faulty electrical wiring in the kitchen and likely trapped the tasty cookie and cream treats inside the pantry as the blistering hot flames encircled the snacks and , finally , incinerated them .
