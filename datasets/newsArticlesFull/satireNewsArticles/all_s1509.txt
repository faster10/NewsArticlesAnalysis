INTERVIEW WITH THE SEARCH ENGINE
As random as they are relevant, enigmatic as they are enlightening, search engines have earned a slightly sullied reputation as a necessary evil. But it is a one-sided assessment. The search engines have not been able to explain themselves. Until now. Thanks to its sophisticated program, which answers questions with phrases or sentences, Jeeves of AskJeeves.com granted SatireWire the opportunity to actually interview a search engine. There were many important questions to ask. Unfortunately, he never got to most of them. NOTE: These are real screen captures of actual responses. Advertisements appearing with results have been edited out, and the query boxes have been enlarged to allow readers to view entire questions. This does not in any way alter the responses.
