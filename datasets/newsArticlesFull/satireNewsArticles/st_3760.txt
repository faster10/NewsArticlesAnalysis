" Did you know that sometimes , without any warning , B . J . will suddenly leave the base he ' s standing on and set off for the next one , just for the sake of going a little farther ? " catcher Jose Lobaton said . " He doesn ' t take a map , a compass , no GPS , nothing . It ' s amazing , and risky . And that ' s just one base . To go around all of them like this I don ' t know if anyone else on the team has what it takes to do that . "
