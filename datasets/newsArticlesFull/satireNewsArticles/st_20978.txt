" Thank you very much , " Seaver said upon receiving the gold Nobel medallion from Sweden ' s King Karl Gustaf . " Basically , what I try to do is five sets of 30 to 40 crunches every day , alternating between slow , low reps of incline sit ups to work the slow twitch muscle fibers and quick , high rep crunches to work the fast twitch muscle fibers . In between sets I like to mix it up with cardiovascular work cycling , swimming , even rollerblading . "
