In an effort to prevent such incidents of " excessive iconoclasm " in the future , Apple has developed a manual outlining the company ' s rules and regulations regarding individualism . Permitted will be such unorthodox activities as removing shoes when seated or within four feet of a desk whistling when given prior written permission from a direct supervisor and kicking puddles , provided the kicking is conducted during one ' s lunch hour and the puddle is one of the 35 on the Apple campus specifically designated for such a purpose . Prohibited will be such " gratuitously idiosyncratic " behaviors as singing out loud , flying kites and catching butterflies .
