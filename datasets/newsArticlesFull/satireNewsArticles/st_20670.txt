" The 1930s were one of the most boring eras in American history , " Dandridge said . " People didn ' t have a lot of money or education , so they amused themselves in simple ways . Yes , there were movies , but they were in crude black and white and didn ' t have any swearing , nudity or special effects . Radio also existed , but the programs were hokey and old fashioned . So planting a time capsule was , for these people , a departure from their horribly dull routines . But their poverty , combined with their na vete and limited knowledge of the world , left them no choice but to put cheap , uninteresting stuff in their time capsule . "
