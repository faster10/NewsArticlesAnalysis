The regiment ' s last mention in historical records came in March 1776 , when the soldiers garrisoned a small fort near the Concord River and awaited orders from Gen . William Howe , then commander in chief of British forces . Though regiment scout James Winthrop reportedly estimates that Howe is no more than 80 kilometers from their location , public records indicate the general has been in London since his burial there in 1814 .
