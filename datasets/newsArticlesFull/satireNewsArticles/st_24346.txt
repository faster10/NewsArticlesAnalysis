" I want to make it clear that I have nothing against filler as a content padding tool , " said U . S . Rep . Scott Klug ( R WI ) , chair of the House Content Regulatory Committee . " In fact , this very speech I am reading to you now consists of over 30 percent filler , and I applaud that . The purpose of setting limits is not to eliminate filler in the media altogether . Rather , the purpose is merely to get people within the industry thinking about other forms of content the American people might also enjoy , such as , say , ideas . "
