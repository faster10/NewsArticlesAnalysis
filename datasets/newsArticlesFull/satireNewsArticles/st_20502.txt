Salinger , 90 , explained that he first became a fan of the Terminator franchise in 1991 , when he saw Terminator 2 : Judgment Day and found the character of the young John Connor to be " a striking figure of teenage alienation and disillusionment . " His interest in the series continued with his rental of the first Terminator film , which he described as " almost as awesome as the second one , " and his Amazon purchase of Terminator 3 : Rise Of The Machines on Blu ray .
