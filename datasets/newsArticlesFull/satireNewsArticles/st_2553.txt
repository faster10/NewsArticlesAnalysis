Seward said reading is not a cheap hobby . In addition to the cost of the books themselves , he has invested in custom made bookshelves and numerous attractive bookmarks , each of which ultimately comes to rest somewhere between the front cover and the middle section of a pristine classic of Western literature . According to Seward , the enjoyment he experiences every time he feels himself being drawn 25 to 35 percent into one of the great stories is worth the expense .
