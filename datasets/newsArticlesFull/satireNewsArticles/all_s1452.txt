Scientist Fires Missile and Accidentally Destroys Pluto
An astronomer/scientist at the Space Science Lab, who has so far managed to remain anonymous, has admitted to accidentally destroying Pluto with a nuclear missile. "I meant to hit the zoom so I could get a closer look at this three-headed dog rock formation and accidentally hit the button to launch the missile that we keep nearby in case we see stray meteors heading for Earth" admitted the flabbergasted scientist. "At least he didn't destroy a full planet, just a dwarf one. It would have been a lot worse if it had happened before Pluto got demoted" spoke a World Planetary Council representative.
