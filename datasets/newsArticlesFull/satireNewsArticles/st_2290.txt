" This week ' s question is : What is your favorite song on Turnstiles ? " Hudek said . " Surprisingly , ' Miami 2017 ' is in the lead , with seven votes . I was sure it would be ' James ' or , at the very least , ' I ' ve Loved These Days . ' Not that ' 2017 ' isn ' t a great song it is . But the best on all of Turnstiles ? My suspicion is that there ' s one person out there who really likes it and is casting multiple votes . Right now , there ' s nothing to prevent that . "
