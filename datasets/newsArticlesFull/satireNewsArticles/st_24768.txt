" I ' d never seen one of those things up close until I found Adam Duritz rooting around in my garage a few months ago , " Aidan Hubbard , 53 , told reporters outside his Whitley Heights home , where he said the Counting Crows frontman hissed and bared his teeth at him . " He was just caked in dirt and had grass and leaves in his hair . We discovered he ' d been living in our crawl space , and my wife felt so bad she set food out for him . I know they say that only makes the problem worse , but we just couldn ' t help but pity the furry little guy . Now I see those things everywhere . "
