The party , held in the Gullicksens ' spacious suburban Atlanta home , was attended by nearly 100 friends of the upper class couple . The caterers were hired to set up the buffet , serve appetizers and entrees to guests , and break down the food area at the party ' s conclusion . All surreptitious , catty remarks about the Gullicksens and their friends were added free of charge .
