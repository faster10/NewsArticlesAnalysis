Sarah Jessica Parker’s Former Character Bradshaw Gets Feminized In Prequel With Ravishing Robb
May 15, 2012 Did anyone really think that Carrie Bradshaw would ride the airwaves -- or cable lines -- ever again? Â Well, get ready, because stunner Annasophia (yes, all one word) Robb will be taking up the mantle of a young Carrie Bradshaw in go-go NYC in the 1980s in Sex and the City Prequel -- The Carrie Diaries. For those unfamiliar with Robb, she looks only vaguely like the beloved Sarah Jessica Parker. Â True, the corkscrew curls remain but what of Parkerâ€™s trademark masculine face? Â What of that bulbous nose that could have been stripped from the mug of Henry Kissinger? Â What of that jaw that looked hijacked from the head of Sly Stallone? Fem Robb looks positively female next to Parker's beastly beauty. As viewers will soon find out, Bradshaw will retain a unique look but all of the hard edges will be lost. Â Robb has gentle and even dainty features that are far different from spunky Parker's dramatic Semitic appearance. Â Always lurking beneath Bradshaw's angst was the cunning mind of a New York Jewess. Â Constantly challenging viewers was Bradshaw's ambiguous gender and the vaguely homoerotic passions that erupted between her and her beaus. With any luck, Robb will bring her own approach. Â Still, many observer are wondering how a very feminine and fresh-faced Robb will steer dear Bradshaw from luxury apartment to luxury apartment with the same verve as Parker. Perhaps it will not be so devastating to lose Parker because who has not wished to see Bradshaw groove down to Little Red Corvette while strutting her stuff across the Brooklyn Bridge?
