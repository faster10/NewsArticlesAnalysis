" It ' s true that consistency is part of what makes McDonald ' s the leader in the fast food industry , but so is good value , " said Brian Landers , manager of the McDonald ' s outlet . " When customers see the low , low prices , they ' re more than willing to give our Six Piece Quarter Pounders and Fish McGriddles a try . The food ' s a little different at this McDonald ' s , but it ' s really very close . "
