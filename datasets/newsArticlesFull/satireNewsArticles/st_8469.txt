" I sponsored the Everybody Eats Food Bill of 2001 , which makes it illegal for Americans to go hungry ! " Rigby said . " That way , poor people don ' t have to starve anymore ! Lots of mac ' n ' cheese . . . I like that ! And I was the first senator to propose free weekly field trips to Little Tyrol for the American people . It would be free , ' cause the government would pay for the bus rides ! "
