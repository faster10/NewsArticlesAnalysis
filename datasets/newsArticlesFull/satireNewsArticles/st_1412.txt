No one will ever get sick and die again , and Grandma will come back from Heaven and live with us , and all the daddies will hug the mommies again , and men will only want to marry women , and women will only want to marry men , and everyone will be the exact same perfect color , and no one will have off brand clothes or speak in strange tongues . And everyone who once did any of those things will laugh , see how silly they were , and feel sorry that they made everyone so upset , and behave once and for all .
