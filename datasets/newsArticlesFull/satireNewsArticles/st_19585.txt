House Appropriations Committee chairman C . W . Bill Young ( R FL ) is skeptical about Loquasto ' s trustworthiness . " I like the Nevada Gaming Commission , and , of course , I feel for them at this difficult time , " Young said . " But I wonder if another subsidy is going to help them learn at all . I mean , the last time we allocated funding to them , they turned right around and spent it all on liquor licenses . "
