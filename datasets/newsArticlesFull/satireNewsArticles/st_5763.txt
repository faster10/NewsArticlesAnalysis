" People of all nations , in the past , you have heard Me say that whosoever shall believe in Me shall not die , but have eternal life , " Christ said . " But now , I say unto you , forget I ever said that . There is only one holy revelation of Allah , the Qur ' an , which was dictated to the Prophet Mohammed , Praise Be Unto Him , by the Archangel Jibreel in the seventh century after I died . "
