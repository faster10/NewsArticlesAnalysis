" I ' ve got experience , " Mullins said . " Hell , I ' ve got more experience than half the Senate and House combined . In my life , I ' ve been a truck driver , a warehouse manager , a car salesman , an auto mechanic , an accountant , a ditch digger , a chicken plucker , and a shit shoveler . If that don ' t qualify me to run this country , I don ' t know what does . "
