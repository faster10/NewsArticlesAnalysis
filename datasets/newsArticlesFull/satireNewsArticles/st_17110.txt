" In my youth , I was pretty quick to fly off the handle at the mere mention of Western clothing , music , food , ideas anything , " said Kalmati , explaining that once he entered his 50s , he no longer felt the same intense compulsion to savagely beat any man who dared to shave his beard . " Thirty years ago , seeing a woman who wasn ' t covered head to toe in a burka would drive me mad . I ' d follow her home , find out where she lives , and come back the next day to throw acid in her face . Nowadays , I ' m more likely to just shake my head and go on with my day . I don ' t blow a gasket like I used to . "
