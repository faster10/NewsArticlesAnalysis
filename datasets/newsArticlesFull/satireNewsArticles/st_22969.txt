Pope Francis told reporters that , of the few followers who sat in those dark , dingy houses of worship , most appeared totally disinterested in his homilies , oftentimes sitting in total silence while he attempted to preach the virtues of charity and piety and exhort believers to seek everlasting life in Christ .

Indeed , Francis added that he gets pretty embarrassed now when he thinks back on some of his " terrible early material on the Holy Trinity and the Kingdom of God .
