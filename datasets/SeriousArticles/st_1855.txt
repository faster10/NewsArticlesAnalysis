Black Friday is a time when big retailers open early and offer deep discounts , but a few started opening and offering those discounts on Thanksgiving a couple years ago . And this year , at least a dozen did so , with a few opening earlier in the holiday than they did last year . The National Retail Federation , a retail trade group , predicted that 33 million , or almost a quarter , of the 140 million people who planned to shop during the four day holiday weekend that ends on Sunday , would do so on Thanksgiving . Analysts had questioned whether the holiday openings would steal sales away from Black Friday or result in people spending more overall . ' Retailers were pretty successful in drawing the consumers into the stores on Thursday , ' said ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin , whose company counts how many shoppers go into about 40 , 000 stores in U . S . But ' Thursday ' s sales came at the expense of Black Friday ' s numbers . '
