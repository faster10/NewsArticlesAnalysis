Jones was wrong for his penalty and he finally admitted so . Always plays on the edge and it cost the Bengals on this one . I agree 1hat Munchak should have been ejected . Porter should not have been on the field and was instigating ? at very least offsetting penalties . It also appears that perhaps the hit on Brown was not quite as bad as it appeared and the national media is making it out to be . Reports out of Pitt are that he has already been cleared for the game this weekend . Miraculous recovery from concussion protocol !
