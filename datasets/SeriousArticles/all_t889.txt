Ashton Kutcher Starts a Conversation About Men's Bathrooms and Babies
Ashton Kutcher is starting a conversation about gender equality. Just two days after International Women's Day, Kutcher is bringing up an issue that men face: a lack of diaper changing stations. The actor is calling out menâ€™s restrooms, in particular, as they rarely have diaper.  "There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens public restrooms, " he wrote on his Facebook.  "The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page! #BeTheChange "    NEWS: Emma Watson Doesn't Think Gender Equality Will Happen in her Lifetime  This message has already received over 215,000 likes, has been shared over 8,000 times and many are leaving comments with where they have seen a men's restroom with a changing station. Kutcher's call for change comes after he recently welcomed baby girl Wyatt on Oct. 1 with his possible wife (seriously, are they married or not?!), Mila Kunis.

When you first get them it's, you're all excited and you're like ready to do all these things, " he said.  "And then you realize it's like getting a new cell phone where all the features don't work yet. " The 37-year-old Two and a Half Men star also spoke about how Wyatt  has changed him,  "You think you know how much you can love another person and then you have a child and you realize you didn't know. It's infinitely rewarding. " What do you think about Ashton's new #Bethechange movement for dads? Let us know your thoughts on this topic using the #ETnow. Follow Rosalyn on Twitter: @RosalynOsh
