It's a Once-in-a-Lifetime Pi Day!
This happens once in a lifetime! For all math nerds out there, grab an extra piece of pie, because March 14, 2015 (3.14.15) is a day that adds those two extra digits to Pi Day. As an irrational number, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter goes on infinitely, and although pi is commonly written out as as 3.14159, 3.14 is usually enough. This Saturday is not only a day to appreciate pi: though as it also marks, the birth of late math genius, Albert Einstein. He would have been 136 today! Former astronaut and Dancing with the Stars contestant Buzz Aldrin celebrated Einstein's birthday and Pi Day with theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking at his home. Another former Dancing with the Stars contestant, actor Jonathan Bennett, also went on Twitter to appreciate today's significance.  And these two were not the only ones to celebrate the day as many stars posted photos of pies and made us all a little hungrier for a sweet treat!
