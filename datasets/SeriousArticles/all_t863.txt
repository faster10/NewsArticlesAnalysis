"I am so grateful for the experience — working with Joan Rivers for five years was incredible. I learned so much and I’m excited for my future. I want to try new things. " Kelly didn't address the controversy surrounding off-color comments made by Fashion Police co-host Giuliana Rancic, which many believe is the reason behind Kelly's exit from the show. After the Oscars, Rancic made a comment about singer Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks that some found to be racially insensitive. Kelly, who is friends with Zendaya, threatened to quit over the remarks.
