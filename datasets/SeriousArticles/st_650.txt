Like most of my Syrian colleagues , I wasn ' t an aid worker before the conflict . This is a new field of work for many of us , but in it I feel that I have a responsibility to those Syrians who are trapped inside this never ending conflict . Each time I interview a child or a mother , I have a responsibility to share their story and ensure the world does not forget them . Before I came back , I thought that perhaps people wouldn ' t want to speak to me that they would be scared to share their experiences . But actually , everyone was just relieved that there were people outside Syria who still cared .
