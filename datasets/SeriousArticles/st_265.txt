Chicago Bears : After an early season slump , second year cornerback Kyle Fuller has slightly improved in recent weeks . Fuller is second on the Bears with 10 pass break ups but has forced only one turnover in 11 games . That ' s a far cry from Fuller ' s rookie season of 2014 . Fuller took the ball away seven times ( four interceptions and three forced fumbles ) last year , including two picks in a road game at San Francisco . With the 49ers coming to town Sunday , the Bears are hopeful Fuller can make an impact . San Francisco quarterback Blaine Gabbert has thrown three interceptions in only 95 pass attempts .
