Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio talks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington , Tuesday , Oct . 27 , 2015 . House Republican leaders on Tuesday pushed toward a vote on a two year budget deal despite conservative opposition , relying on the backing of Democrats for the far reaching pact struck with President Barack Obama . In his last days as speaker , John Boehner was intent on getting the measure through Congress and head off a market rattling debt crisis next week and a debilitating government shutdown in December . The deal also would take budget showdowns off the table until after the 2016 presidential and congressional elections , a potential boon to the eventual GOP nominee and incumbents facing tough re election fights .
