This my personal feel , and other voters have a different sense of it , but here goes : If there is not enough evidence for me to write in the paper about a player s use of PEDs then there isn t enough for me to consider that as a factor for my ballot . If I DO NOT vote for a player because of PED use then I should be able to write an article that mentions said PED use . Pretty simple . That means that for my ballot I have to use the same standards of attribution and sourcing that The Post Dispatch would require . No innuendo . No suspicion . Only proof . Only accountability . I know there have been articles that speculate about Piazza , but speculation isn t enough to get in the papers I have worked for in my career and thus it s not enough to be on my ballot .
