I recently attended an iRefuse rally held on Long Island . The poster for the event juxtaposes two silhouettes of a child ' s head : one , under the title " Learning , " is filled with images of Shakespeare , a guitar , a flower , math equations and plants . The other , under the title " Testing , " is filled with a multiple choice exam . That is why parents are refusing they want school to be a place where children ' s talents are cultivated and not harmed by tests whose main use is to fire teachers .
