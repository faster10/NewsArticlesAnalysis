The whole week was amazing : a sitting vice president and two lesser entities fled the Democratic presidential field prostrate House Republicans begged Paul Ryan to lead them . Ryan demanded job security and paid family leave . Republicans hate giving workers stuff like that , but Ryan won t be a worker ? he ll be a boss , so it s okay . Democrats were feeling good . Seeing John Boehner capped by his own party and then Kevin McCarthy cap himself lifted their spirits when Harold Trey Gowdy and his thugs trained the high intensity lamp on Clinton , things finally seemed to be going their way .
