Mars rules the way he takes action , and because it ' s next to his Moon , gives him a passionate nature that at times can come across as a temper . As his Mars is retrograde the energy is often internalized and the powerful Mars in Aries energy can be suppressed , and he would generally dislike open confrontations . Sometimes a retrograde Mars can be construed as weak action , but like most people born with a retrograde Mars , his progressed Mars is now direct and at some point in his life he learned to take a more direct approach .
