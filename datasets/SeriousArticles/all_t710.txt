"We know, and recognize, that we have that in common," she said. "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre."The interview comes ahead of the release of Madonna's latest album, "Rebel Heart," which arrives Tuesday. West collaborated with Madonna for three songs on the album. Now 56, the "Material Girl" says she's still pushing back against critics.  "I always feel like I'm breaking some taboo, or coming up against something. People have always judged me, and given me s--- about one thing or another. Now they're giving me s--- about age," Madonna told the Daily News, adding, "It's b-------. And mostly I hear it from women. I feel I should be hearing support -- like, 'Good for you.'"And, just like West, she's not afraid to boast about what she's accomplished."I earned my stripes," she declares. "B----, I'm Madonna. And that's it."
