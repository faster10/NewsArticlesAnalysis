B ij ng ' s most morbid shrine , the operating Taoist shrine of Dongyue Temple is an unsettling but fascinating place to visit . Stepping through the entrance you find yourself in Taoist Hades , where tormented spirits reflect on their wrongdoings . The ' Life and Death Department ' is a spiritual place to ponder your eventual demise , the ' Department for Wandering Ghosts ' and the ' Department for Implementing 15 Kinds of Violent Death ' have slightly less inviting names , while the ill might seek out the ' Deep Rooted Disease Department ' . Other halls are less morbid , but no less interesting . Visit during the Chinese New Year or the Mid Autumn Festival to see the temple at its most vibrant .
