The biosecurity board does not approve particular experiments but offers policy advice on , among other things , oversight of ' dual use ' studies , meaning research that could be used for biowarfare or bioterrorism as well as for legitimate purposes . In 2012 , for instance , the board recommended that details of experiments on an especially deadly form of avian influenza , H5N1 , not be published . They feared the information could be used to create a strain that , unlike the natural form , is highly transmissible between infected people .
