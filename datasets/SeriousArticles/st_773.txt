Since opening on July 26 , The Wolverine , Jackman ' s fifth outing as the ornery X Man , has grossed 307 million worldwide . It ' s not exactly Avengers money , but it ' s more than enough for Fox to want to keep Jackman in the X Men fold . As The Wolverine ' s post credit sequence teased , Jackman will time travel for a cameo in next year ' s X Men : Days of Future Past . But will that be the end of Jackman ' s run ? The 44 year old has played Wolverine longer and more frequently than any actor has ever been associated with a comic book hero , but his current deal is about to expire . Now the National Enquirer claims that Fox is offering Jackman 100 million for him to keep slicing and dicing for four more X Men movies . Them ' s a lot of chicken breasts !
