A team from Cairo University s Faculty of Engineering , and a Paris based organization called the Heritage Innovation and Preservation Institute used infrared thermography to measure the temperature of each of the walls of the tomb . The technology carefully compares temperature profiles of small sections and indicates if there are any differences . A difference in temperature in a seemingly uniform tapestry , or in this case , a wall , could indicate that the wall isn t a single piece . Infrared thermography experiments revealed one area of the northern wall had a different temperature than other areas . This strongly suggests the possibility of a hidden chamber that was carefully concealed with plaster and then painted over , to make the wall appear as a whole , reported the Daily Mail .
