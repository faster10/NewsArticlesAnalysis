I ' m not aware of other ERA activists who may have quizzed Sanders on this issue , but his actions showed me that he listens to and considers the priorities of the average citizen . I ' m well aware of the fact that Hillary Clinton is also a long time supporter of the amendment and is a champion for women , but Sanders is currently the only candidate who ' s talking about this issue on the campaign trail and the only candidate who has included working to ratify the ERA into the Constitution as part of his campaign platform .
