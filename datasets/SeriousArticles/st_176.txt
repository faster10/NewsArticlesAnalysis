NRC CHIEF : EMPTY SEAT NOT HURTING COMMISSION WORK : The NRC s business hasn t been upended by the year long vacancy on the commission , NRC Chairman Stephen Burns said yesterday at a Platts Energy Podium event with reporters . Burns said we have not pushed off matters because we don t have a fifth commissioner , noting that consensus is a goal . What about that pending nominee , Jessie Hill Roberson ? I have no real understanding as about where it stands in the process , Burns said . Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Jim Inhofe told ME later in the day that we re not slow rolling her nomination but the committee is negotiating a bipartisan pairing for Roberson , a Democrat . I imagine it ll be very very soon , he said . NRC Commissioner William Ostendorff s term expires at the end of June but the White House hasn t yet indicated whether he ' ll be renominated .
