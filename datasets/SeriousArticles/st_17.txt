HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection . Studies show that 50 to 70 of women will develop an HPV infection during their sexually active lives and that infection occurs soon after they become sexually active . Although most infections resolve over six to 24 months , some persist and can lead to cancer . Certain types of HPV are responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancer , other cancers of the anal and genital areas and a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers in men and women . Other HPV types cause genital warts .
