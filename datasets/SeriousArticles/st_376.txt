What is a deposition ? Testifying at a deposition looks a little like testifying at a trial . There are lawyers , a stenographer , questions and answers . But a deposition is not a trial . At trial , you can tell your story and convince a jury of your position . A deposition , on the other hand , is the other side ' s only opportunity to find out what ' s in your mind , lock your story in writing , and have it ready to bash you over the head with if you testify inconsistently at trial . Generally , the more your opponent gets you to talk at a deposition , the more information he or she has to use against you at trial . An argumentative witness like Bieber is a dream come true for his opponent .
