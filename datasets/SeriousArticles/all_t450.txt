Kaine sees W.H. moving soon to authorize force against ISIL
Sen. Tim Kaine said on Sunday the White House will soon send to Congress legislation to authorize the use of military force in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Virginia Democrat, who has very vocal in calling for such authorization, said he believes the administration’s proposal will have “strong support” in the House and Senate. Story Continued Below Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he wants an Authorization for the Use of Military Force that would allow for U.S. combat troops only “in limited circumstances.” The senator criticized both the White House and Congress for failing to prioritize a formal authorization in the months after the administration’s airstrike campaign against ISIL. “If we’re going to ask people to risk their lives, then Congress ought to do our job and put our thumbprints on this mission,” Kaine said. The senator has been particularly tough on the administration on the issue after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address, which the senator said didn’t outline enough of what the White House wanted in an authorization. In the past, Kaine has argued that allowing the president to act militarily without an AUMF means “Capitol Hill is embracing the policy of preemptive war.”
