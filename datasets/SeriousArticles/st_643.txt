It was a good win because both teams , I thought , were playing at a pretty high level throughout the course of the game , C s coach Brad Stevens said . Obviously , each team had its own stretch and its own run , but it looked to me like we were going to be in for a real tough one early . They just looked really connected , really alert , the Bulls did , and seemed to be clicking early . And I thought our bench kind of settled us down , and then everybody was pretty good the last 36 minutes or so , 40 minutes .
