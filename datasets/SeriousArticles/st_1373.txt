I am convinced that military options in Syria will do immeasurably more harm than good . My conviction stems from living in Syria during the U . S . occupation of Iraq and visiting Syria regularly over the last decade . I learned that Syria is a complex nation its ethnic , sectarian , tribal and religious composition is fragile . Thankfully , the White House and State Department have so far steered clear of pursuing military options . But the war drums are being beaten in the U . S . media and on the think tank circuit .
