As Phillips reveals : Anwar Moslem , Mayor of Kobani , said on September 19 , 2014 : Based on the intelligence we got two days before the breakout of the current war , trains full of forces and ammunition , which were passing by north of Kobani , had an hour and ten to twenty minute long stops in these villages : Salib Qaran , Gire Sor , Moshrefat Ezzo . There is evidence , witnesses , and videos about this . Why is ISIS strong only in Kobani ' s east ? Why is it not strong either in its south or west ? Since these trains stopped in villages located in the east of Kobani , we guess they had brought ammunition and additional force for the ISIS . In the second article on September 30 , 2014 , a CHP delegation visited Kobani , where locals claimed that everything from the clothes ISIS militants wear to their guns comes from Turkey .
