With fewer titles accounting for a larger share of what Americans read , the tours serve as reminders that independent writers and small presses are alive and well , providing alternatives to the " blockbuster " titles that get most of the publicity in mainstream media . Initiatives such as The Lit Pub and Vouched Books , which helped publicize the Southern Summer Comfort Book Tour , promote small press literature through a variety of efforts . Efforts like setting up pop up " guerrilla bookstores " at readings and art events remind people that great words are being written on small presses , said Laura Straub with Vouched Books .
