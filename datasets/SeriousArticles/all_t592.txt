At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented wombs, semen chosen from a catalog."John took to Instagram to slam the designers, saying, "How dare you refer to my beautiful children as "synthetic"... Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana"Ryan Murphy responds to Dolce & Gabbanais ignorant, ugly comments: "This is not just a gay issue"A number of stars soon joined in one the boycott, including singer Ricky Martin and Glee creator Ryan Murphy.It's unclear if John's choice to carry the Dolce & Gabbana bag will impact his newly created cause.Check out the video here for more on the fallout from the feud between the "Rocket Man" singer and the Italian fashion house.
