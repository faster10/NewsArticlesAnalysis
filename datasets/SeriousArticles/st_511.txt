Remember that the key to Carson ' s appeal is that he is so unlike most of the other politicians running for the GOP nod . ( In a Fox News poll released this week , Carson was regarded as the most " honest " candidate in the field . ) That differentiation is entirely anchored in his personal story . If that personal story is undermined in a way that even his own followers have to acknowledge , Carson goes from the brilliant , truth speaking anti politician to just another pol who will say and do whatever he thinks he needs to in order to appeal to voters .
