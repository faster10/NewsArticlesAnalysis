We worked to keep the group intellectually diverse . In fact , many of these contributors have harshly criticized one another ? and National Review ? in the past . We got a strong representative of the religious right ? Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention ? and a dyed in wool libertarian , David Boaz of the Cato Institute . We pulled together popular voices from the Tea Party Right , like Glenn Beck , Dana Loesch , and Erick Erickson , who combine their powerful journalism with activism , along with editors of long standing conservative magazines , like John Podhoretz of Commentary , R . R . Reno of First Things , and Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard . We balanced a Reagan hand present at the creation ? former Reagan attorney general Ed Meese ? with 27 year old Katie Pavlich of Townhall .
