There ' s some things I certainly could have done better today . I could have served better , for sure . I didn ' t serve a high percentage of first serves , Murray said after the match . And from the back of the court , maybe because I wasn ' t hitting loads of balls , I wasn ' t hitting the ball from the back of the court as well as I did against Zverev . But a lot of things went well , too . The movement was good , anticipation . I felt like I closed the match out well . It ' s been a very good start , for sure . But I can still get better , I think .
