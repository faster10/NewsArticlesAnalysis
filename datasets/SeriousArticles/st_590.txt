The city of Flint promptly initiated a proposal to Michigan ' s Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) to use water from their historical backup system , the Flint River .

" This proposed shift was billed as a money saver , " the document notes . " But it put the city in the business of water production , where they historically had been in the business of water transmission . "
