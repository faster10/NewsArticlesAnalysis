The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) recently published a report stating that 62 billion had been mobilised in 2014 from private and public sources , up from the 52 billion in 2013 . India and other countries expressed their annoyance with these estimates , arguing that funding meant for development aid to various countries has also been included in these numbers . Climate funds are expected to be new and additional to development aid because they relate to the historical obligations of rich countries for having captured ecological space . India has maintained that funds for climate finance should be new , predictable , scalable , and recognised as the obligations of developed countries . These considerations would disappear without differentiation .
