A personal turning point came in 2005 , a year before I became a U . S . citizen , when I was traveling through Tokyo . Back then , I still had my Philippines passport and my former male gender marker , but I presented as a woman . I was taken into the immigration office at the airport and questioned for hours about my identity . I have friends in the Philippines where there is no law that allows them to change their name and marker that have these experiences every time they travel . It ' s dehumanizing .
