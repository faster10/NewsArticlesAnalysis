After Alabama got the ball back , and again faced a fourth and 1 , this time on the Auburn 25 with 33 seconds to play , Henry went around right tackle virtually untouched for his first touchdown of the game , extending his streak of consecutive games with a rushing touchdown to 17 . Henry ( 1 , 526 yards , 21 touchdowns ) has joined Mark Ingram ( 1 , 658 in 2009 ) and Trent Richardson ( 1 , 679 in 2011 ) as the only Crimson Tide backs to top 1 , 500 rushing yards in a season and his next scoring run will snap a tie with Richardson ( 2011 ) for most rushing touchdowns in a season .
