Jeb Bush crosses paths with rapper Ludacris
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush crossed paths with rapper Ludacris on Thursday as both men separately addressed the Georgia state legislature. Bush, who's eyeing a 2016 presidential bid, tweeted his apparent excitement about the encounter:Bush spoke before both houses of the state legislature, focusing largely on education policy, and he joked about why he accepted the invitation to speak. "I came here because I was told Ludacris was going to be here," he told the state Senate.Later, before the state House, he added, "I came to see Ludacris, so I've already done that. I appreciate that there's a successful guy who's giving back. And you all giving him this honor is quite appropriate." Georgia lawmakers were recognizing the charitable work done by the Ludacris Foundation, which has donated more than $1.5 million to youth programs in Atlanta. Despite Bush's kind words, it's not clear Ludacris is a fan of the former governor. As he was leaving the statehouse, reporters asked Ludacris which Bush is his favorite, and he responded, "The one outside," according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Greg Bluestein.
