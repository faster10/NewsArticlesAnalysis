Harry Reid undergoes eye surgery, doctors 'optimistic'
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid successfully underwent a lengthy surgery on Monday to repair broken bones in his face suffered in a New Year’s Day exercise injury, according to his office. The Nevada Democrat was released from George Washington University Hospital on Monday afternoon following the surgery. Surgeons removed a blood clot and pooled blood in Reid’s right eye and mended several bones in Reid’s face, injuries that have caused Reid blindness in his right eye. Story Continued Below Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid, said doctors are “optimistic” that Reid will regain sight in his right eye, though “there is no definitive verdict yet.” The surgery took more than three hours and Reid was anesthetized during the procedure. The Democratic leader plans to work from his Washington home for rest of the week as the Senate considers a contentious bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. He returned to the Senate briefly last week for meetings and a Thursday press conference, but has mostly worked from home since an exercise band snapped during a Jan. 1 workout in Nevada and sent Reid tumbling into cabinets, breaking ribs and bones in his face. “Senator Reid will recuperate from his residence this week and continue to monitor the Senate floor closely through meetings and phone calls with his fellow senators, the White House and staff,” Jentleson said. Reid’s office said the senator spent Monday afternoon monitoring the whip count for a vote to break a filibuster on Keystone after Democrats began complaining that their amendments were being limited from consideration. Other Democrats also conveyed the news. “Out of surgery at home, doing good,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) of Reid’s condition as she headed to a Democratic leadership meeting. She and Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Chuck Schumer of New York have running the caucus since Reid’s injury.
