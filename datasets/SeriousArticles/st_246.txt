LN : I don ' t believe that we are really as individual as we think we are and that ' s what makes the profession of acting possible that we can empathize with things that are more than our personal , limited experience . And I think that you do work and like Oprah Winfrey said to me , " you let God walk in the door . " I think it ' s less about going into myself than opening myself just opening myself to the research , the script , the autobiography , the other things that I read , the other things I saw and just trying to immerse myself in a world that I personally don ' t know but I know that my spirit does and can know if I allow myself to open up to it .
