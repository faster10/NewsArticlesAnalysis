The Indian Left is honoured to have the likes of the RBI governor , corporate chiefs like NR Narayana Murthy and Kiran Majumdar Shaw , scientist Jayant Narlikar , intellectuals like Romila Thapar and Krishna Sobti , and other people of eminence .

He further says that this is happening because space of the Left has reduced . How ? This is a dangerous fascistic tendency ? undermining democracy by rejecting dissenting opinion through political labelling and bracketing .
