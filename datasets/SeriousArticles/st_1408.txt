Miller , who said he has been reluctant to make his investigations political , did say it is time the White House starts paying attention to the deteriorating treatment of the nation ' s veterans . He said he has been frustrated by a lack of cooperation from the Veterans Administration leadership , and that Shinseki has not paid enough attention to the medical problems at VA medical centers . Miller also said it is time President Obama pay as much attention to what is happening at VA medical centers as he does to what ' s happening in Washington or Hawaii , a reference to the president ' s recent vacation to his home state .
