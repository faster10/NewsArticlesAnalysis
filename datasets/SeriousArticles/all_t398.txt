Pelosi not committed to attending Bibi's speech
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi left the door open Thursday to not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress next month, in a fresh sign of tension on Capitol Hill around the prime minister’s visit. Pelosi, speaking to reporters Thursday, said that “as of now” she’ll attend the speech, but allowed that members of Congress have busy schedules.

There is a serious unease. But don’t even think in the terms of boycott. Members will go or they won’t go as they usually go or don’t go.” Dozens of Democrats are privately considering skipping the speech because Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) didn’t consult the White House about the invitation and scheduled the event close to next month’s Israeli election. Boehner defended his decision Thursday, saying the invitation was “a very good idea.” “There’s a message that the American people need to hear, and I think he’s the perfect person to deliver it,” Boehner said. “The threat of radical Islamic terrorists is a real threat. The threat of Iran to the region and the rest of the world is a real threat. And I believe that the American people are interested in hearing the truth about what’s happening in that part of the world.”
