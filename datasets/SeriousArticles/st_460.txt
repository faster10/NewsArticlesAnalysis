We didn ' t have any fancy labs for any of this , or gigantic budgets . We didn ' t go through insurance companies or medical labs . We made all of these devices for maybe a couple hundred bucks apiece some for much less . ( the Brainwriter , as we ' re calling it , includes a homemade EEG device based on a prototype that a couple of our team members fashioned out of some electrodes , two nine volt batteries , and an old sock , in their kitchen , at 2 in the morning . I wasn ' t there , but I ' m told there was some whiskey involved as well ) .
