I ' m not gonna divulge anything , but I know what the stories are and what Mitch Hurwitz is doing , and it ' s so layered . It ' s really audacious and amazing . I think a lot of people will miss the work that is involved , the story , the Venn diagrams that are being created , the domino effect that characters have with each other in their various episodes . I know what he ' s doing , and this has never been done on a TV show like this . This makes " Lost " look like a Spaulding Grey monologue . You ' ll have to watch each episode more than once .
