WR Stefon Diggs : He seems to do something every week that has a direct impact on the Vikings winning , and on Sunday it was a 40 yard catch and run for a game tying TD with 1 : 49 left . Diggs broke off a re route from Sherrick McManis , got open in the middle of the field and cut so hard that McManis slipped and fell . He raced down the sideline , spun and bulled his way into the end zone , with the help of a push from Mike Wallace . He was quiet in the first half , but finished with six carries for 95 yards and the biggest TD of his short career .
