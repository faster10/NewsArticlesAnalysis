Boehner on Thursday told reporters that he was happy Netanyahu made the appearance. "Iinvited the Prime Minister of Israel to come because we have gravethreats facing our nation," he said. Netanyahu "was in a perfectposition to help describe that threat to the American people, and forthat matter, the rest of the world."
