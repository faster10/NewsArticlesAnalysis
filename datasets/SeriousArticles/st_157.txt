Christopher : Both books were a lot of fun to write , but I never thought about genre or worried about getting everything to fit . I had the story , I had the characters , and it all just came together . It also just happened to have everything I love about science fiction and fantasy jammed together , but I think that ' s part of the appeal of " Empire State . " " The Age Atomic " is a little more controlled . Having introduced so many disparate elements in the first book , I could focus on telling a more linear sci fi story in the second . It ' s basically all just science fiction . . . or should that be science fantasy ?
