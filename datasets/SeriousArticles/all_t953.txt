Instagram Double Fail: Lindsay Lohan Caught Photoshopping and Using the N-Word
Epic fail? This week, Lindsay Lohan, who has been in France for Paris Fashion Week, came under fire for two different images she posted to Instagram. NEWS: Lilo Credits Her Calvins for Helping to Fight Off Rare Virus The first was a photo of Kanye West during his performance that was captioned with “#kanye&kimAlldayni--a$.” Though the actress quickly deleted the offensive language, fans caught sight of it with several users leaving comments about her inappropriate use of the N-word.  Less than a day later, Lohan caught flak for an image that was appeared photoshopped to make her butt look bigger. While she admitted she cropped the photo, it was just to say she cut her feet out of the frame.  "My feet look red lol- had to take that out. Only real red is my hair,” she captioned the pic. However, a rep for Lilo clarified to E! Online,  "I assure you Lindsay has not tampered with the photo. Nothing more than a filter or use of the upload program (as stated on the image in question) used to upload her candid.” NEWS: Lilo Posts a Topless Selfie to Instagram   Either way, it’s needless to say, these are rookie mistakes for someone who is a notorious tweeter-then-deleter.
