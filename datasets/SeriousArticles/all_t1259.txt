Mystery solved! #TheDress is blue and black
This might not make you feel any better if you're staunchly in the white/gold camp, but a U.K. retailer has come out on Twitter to confirm that the dress that's blowing up the Internet is, in fact, blue and black.Roman Originals posted an image of the Lace Bodycon Dress on Twitter early Friday, affirming that it is blue with black lace, not white with gold lace as about half of the Internet-connected world -- including actress Anna Kendrick -- is convinced it is. The controversy over "The Dress" began on a Tumblr page where a user asked others to help her decide the true color of the dress. The debate dominated online discussion. It racked up more than 20 million views on Buzzfeed, became the number one trend on Twitter and drew a deep divide.The dress is available on the Roman website for $77. It also comes in white -- with black lace.
