Some of this is quite understandable . After all , on 9 11 al Qaeda ' s 19 terrorists killed almost 3 , 000 people in the space of a morning . Since then al Qaeda ' s branch in Yemen tried to bring down with a bomb secreted on a passenger an American commercial jet flying over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 and al Qaeda ' s branch in Pakistan tried to launch bombings on the New York subway system a few months earlier . Luckily those plots didn ' t succeed , but certainly if they had the death toll would have been on a large scale .
