Patrick Schwarzenegger Parties Without Miley Cyrus During Spring Break, Denies Cheating Rumors
Patrick Schwarzenegger is getting defensive. After pictures hit the Internet on Monday of the 21-year-old model in a shirtless embrace with a bikini-clad woman in Cabo over the weekend, Patrick took to his Twitter to deny that he cheated on girlfriend Miley Cyrus. Patrick says the girl in question -- who's pictured smiling up at him with her arms around his neck -- is actually one of his best friends' girlfriends.  "Omg. It's one of my best friends girlfriend...Would NEVER do anything against my GF....., " he tweeted on Monday.  "Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...

" The USC sophomore was in Cabo sans Miley for spring break, but from the looks of his Instagram, he spent the time relaxing more than partying. On Sunday, he posted this selfie of him drinking from a coconut.  "Da coco, " he wrote. The spring break pics come less than a week after Patrick and 22-year-old Miley appeared to be getting serious with one another, even dining with Patrick's mother, Maria Shriver, and his younger brother, Chris, at Palm steakhouse in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Mikey and Patrick have reportedly been dating since last November. NEWS: Miley Cyrus Admits She Can't Spell Schwarzenegger   Watch the video to hear all about Miley's family date with Patrick.
