The US led air campaign has already launched around 8 , 300 air strikes against Isis which have slowed up its advance , but without bringing it to its knees .

He cites three attempts by the US to create a moderate armed opposition which have humiliatingly failed and , on each occasion , extreme jihadists have captured quantities of modern American weapons .
