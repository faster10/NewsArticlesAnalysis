I have a tremendous amount of respect for Les Miles and the job that he s done , Saban said . He s had a tremendous amount of success for a long time at LSU . There probably is less patience at all levels . You see it happen in the NFL . Twenty years ago nobody got fired before the end of the season . Now it happens on occasion . Sometimes coordinators get fired . I do think there s a little less tolerance for people that don t seem to be having success for whatever reasons . Coaches are the culprits for what happens .
