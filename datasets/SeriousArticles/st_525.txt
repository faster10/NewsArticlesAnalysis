We re getting to the point , though , where Sanders needs to decide if he wants more than moral victories . He can continue on his current policy only path , knowing that even if ? or more likely when ? his long shot campaign falls short , he ll have at least pulled Clinton leftward . Or he can risk his particular no nonsense brand and the leverage that comes with it by taking direct aim at Hillary in hopes of knocking her down . There have been hints that Sanders is finally ready to take some swings , but so far he s stopped short of crossing that line . Given how hungry the political press corps is for conflict , if Bernie does attack on Saturday night , it would likely be the lead story on Sunday morning .
