One other reservation about taking a teen to this movie ? I love a love story gay , straight , bisexual or undecided . The chilling part of this film is that it ' s basically the story of an adult woman ( she ' s 5 or 6 years older ) poaching on a high schooler . The issue is glossed over in the movie . But parents should be wary of taking their kids to see a movie that glamorizes sexual relationships between a sexy older person and a teen . Yes , it ' s only a movie . But it is one that can deliver a message .
