I think people come to a Web search engine with a different set of expectations what they want and expect to do , versus their experience on Facebook , which tends to be socially oriented . Also , with a Web search engine , users are accustomed to typing in a set of keywords and receiving documents from the Web that most closely match but with Graph Search , users type in a very specific query using simple phrases to yield relevant results . For example , if users type " show me my friends who like ' Star Wars , ' " or " show me my college friends who live in New York , " Graph Search isn ' t searching based on those keywords but rather displaying the answers to those specific queries .
