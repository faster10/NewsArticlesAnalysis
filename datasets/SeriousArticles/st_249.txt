Yes , CES ' s real edge is at its edge . So the most innovative stuff I saw in Las Vegas this week were at a " hackathon " at Las Vegas ' Palms hotel , a couple of miles from the main convention hall . Organized by AT T , the old Ma Bell teleco that is now reinventing itself as open source technology company , and sponsored by GM , Nokia and Ericsson , this hackathon ( where , full disclosure , I was an unpaid official judge ) invited software programmers to leverage AT T ' s data network to innovate new electronic products .
