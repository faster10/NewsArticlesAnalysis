Conway got uncomfortable and laughed nervously when I asked him to explain his support for gay marriage . The good paying jobs of the future are coming to states with inclusivity , he said . I believe that discrimination is a bright line in the sand . He said he s not surprised that passions continue to run high . Look , Kim Davis went to jail not because of her religious beliefs , he said . She went to jail because she defied a federal court order . We re a nation of laws , and you have to follow the law . Conway said he would sign a narrowly tailored law next year granting clerks some flexibility for moral objections . He s taken some heat from the left for not criminally prosecuting Davis . The only remaining civil remedy would be for the state legislature to impeach Davis , who is still in the first year of a four year term .
