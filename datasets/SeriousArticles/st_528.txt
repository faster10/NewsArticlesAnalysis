O Malley may be running out of time , too . The former Maryland governor finished September with less than 1 million in his campaign account and , unless he finds pay dirt soon , it s going to be a challenge to keep the lights on . Dig into his fundraising numbers , and that challenge gets even more difficult . Of the 3 . 2 million he s raised so far this year , only 8 percent came from small donations of 200 or less . That suggests that many of those relatively few people who have cut checks to his campaign have already hit their contribution limit . O Malley , then , needs to win new friends and fans , and to do it quickly . Given how little coverage he gets on an average day , debates are his best ? perhaps only ? chance to make that happen .
