Donald Trump has been described by The New Yorker magazine as mounting a " hostile takeover " of the Republican Party . Bernie Sanders could perhaps be seen as launching a utopian invasion of the Democrats . Although neither man won in Iowa , it would be foolhardy to count them out of the race . Each will probably win in New Hampshire next week but even if they do not , their poll numbers and large devoted followings will ensure the Trump and Sanders shows remain part of the presidential process for some time yet , and possibly all the way until November .
