What started as a videotaped interview of a homeless man by Columbus ( Ohio ) Dispatch videographer Doral Chenoweth soon turned into a widespread Internet sensation . The man in the video , Ted Williams , had a voice any radio or TV announcer would kill for . In fact , earlier in his life , before falling on hard times , he ' d attended school for voice acting and did some work in radio . After the video went viral , Williams began receiving job offers and even appeared on NBC ' s " Today . " Yet the sudden media attention was too much for him to bear , and he reverted to drinking and other destructive behavior . While the hoopla has since died down , the homeless man with the silky smooth voice won ' t soon be forgotten . Source : The Columbus Dispatch
