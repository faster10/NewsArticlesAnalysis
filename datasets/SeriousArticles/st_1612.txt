Zika ' s suspected of causing a severe birth defect called microcephaly , which causes underdevelopment of the head and brain . Babies with microcephaly often miscarry before they are born , or they die at birth . Those who survive are usually very disabled . Other viruses are known to cause microcephaly if a pregnant woman is infected rubella is the most notorious . But Zika belongs to a family of viruses not known to cause birth defects and birth defects had not been noticed in countries that had Zika previously . It ' s also not entirely clear to what degree cases of microcephaly have increased in Brazil . There are some smoking guns some babies born with microcephaly or their mothers have evidence of the virus . But it ' s hard to test for Zika and there ' s no quick , on the spot test , making research difficult .
