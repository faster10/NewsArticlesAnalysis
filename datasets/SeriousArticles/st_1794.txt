" No Better Than This " isn ' t a perfectly honed set . But Mellencamp has never sounded looser or easier on a record . The most indelible moments are straight up funny . " Love at First Sight " imagines a relationship from back seat grope through marriage , kids and subsequent disasters , before deciding it might be better to go home alone . And on " Easter Eve , " a man and his 14 year old son get hassled in a cafe , slash a expletive up , get thrown in jail , then walk off with the dude ' s grateful wife . It ' s musical storytelling for hard times : far fetched , violent , sexy , played for laughs . It doesn ' t get more timeless , or American , than that .
