I ' m an official at heart and I know when people are motivated and appreciated you get better production out of them , Carollo said . You treat them poorly , they think this isn ' t worth it and they wonder , Why am I doing this when I get yelled at , my name is in the paper and after taxes , I ' m not making much ? Does it say stupid on my forehead ? ' But we do it because we love it . It is a concern if we ' re getting the right talent in officiating . It ' s not always money . We can improve it if we ' re smart about it and get better people , younger people , athletic people whatever it may be .
