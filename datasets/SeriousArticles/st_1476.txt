What comes next is anybody ' s guess . The Russians have announced that they will deploy surface to air missiles in Syria . They were probably always planning to do so , but the incident with Turkey gives them a handy pretext to do so . It ' s unclear how this changes things since the Syrian ' s already have SAM batteries in operation . Moscow has announced the imposition of economic sanctions on Turkey . They have also stepped up their criticisms that the Turkish government and especially , the Turkish Intelligence Agency , MIT , is directly involved in aiding Islamic State militants and other anti Assad jihadists by brokering everything from oil to smuggled antiquities and allowing free passage for militants going to Syria . It ' s estimated that over the last three years over 20 , 000 militants have gone to Syria to fight against the Assad government with the vast majority of them travelling through Turkey .
