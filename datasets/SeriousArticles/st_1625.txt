It doesn ' t sound like an exciting or adventurous job not surprisingly , you don ' t see a character like my grandfather in the movie . But for a quiet , methodical and analytical archivist and the gargantuan task he was up against , it was the perfect match . The Offenbach Archival Depot , first under my grandfather and then his successors , managed to restitute more than 3 million objects . Some of the more prominent collections that he helped to return , both at Offenbach and in later assignments , included the Rothschild family archives to France , the Rosenthaliana and Spinoza libraries to the Netherlands , and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research collection , which ended up in New York .
