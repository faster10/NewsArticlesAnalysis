Lisa Ciacci of Brooklyn , New York As a die hard Cowboys fan , I may have been the most unlikely N . Y . Giants fan last night . I could not be happier for this team . They played their hearts out in quite possibly the best game I have ever watched . Eli Manning came of age before our very eyes and proves once again that he is truly a class act . I hope this loss haunts the Patriots forever . They weren ' t good enough to beat the Giants last night nor will they ever be . This city will surely explode at tomorrow ' s parade it ' s good to be in New York ! GO GIANTS ! E mail to a friend
