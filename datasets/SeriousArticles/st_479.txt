There was no proof Clinton lied about Benghazi , though she could have done a better job of making that point . Granted , her situation was delicate . She couldn t very well say I didn t go on TV and lie my butt off , Susan Rice did , or White House operatives have been spinning national security crises ever since Karl Rove used the Iraq War for a flight deck photo op . You had to parse a sentence or two to be sure , but Clinton never attributed the Benghazi attack to that inflammatory video . She only said others had . Had the committee been interested in anything other than smearing Clinton , a better line of inquiry would have been why she chose to disappear from the administration s post Benghazi messaging operation .
