I know . I m comparing apples and oranges . Hillary s a highly accomplished , well informed adult who has overcome some adversity to arrive at this moment Trump is an ignorant , narcissistic child who fooled us into thinking he did more than he really did with all the money he inherited . Fair enough . But what if Republicans do him in or , more likely , he does himself in ? What if a Rubio Kasich ticket makes Florida hard and Ohio impossible to win ? What if Hillary keeps performing like the ace student she is , but her numbers never move ? ? What then ?
