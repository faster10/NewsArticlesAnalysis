The Obama bracket: Who did he pick to win the NCAA tournament?
Risk averse. That's one description of the president's 2015 NCAA tournament predictions. Boring might be another. President Obama chose three number one seeds (Kentucky, Duke and Villanova) and a number two seed (Arizona) to make the Final Four. Kentucky, which hasn't lost a game this season, is the president's pick to go 40-0 and win the national championship. "Kentucky obviously has a good of a chance as any team. They are prohibitive favorites and for good reason," the president told ESPN's Andy Katz.The president correctly picked the University of North Carolina to win the tournament in 2009. Since then he's had mixed results, whiffing on his Final Four selections in 2010 and 2011, but correctly picking two Final Four teams in 2012, and one in 2013 and 2014. His bracket this year reflects a cautious commander-in-chief. With the exception of 10-seeded Davidson, the president advanced only favorites into the Sweet Sixteen. No team below a 12-seed makes it out of the round of 64 in his bracket. "This is gonna be the year, guys. I'm winning the pool," the president said. The president told Katz he favors rule changes in college basketball - widening the lane, moving back the three point line and shortening the shot clock to 30 seconds or less.He'll make predictions for the women's NCAA tournament tomorrow.
