We don t talk about rain often in California , but when we do it should always be something to note . And rain is in the forecast in Oakland where the Kansas City Chiefs play the Oakland Raiders on Sunday at 4 : 05 p . m . PT . The Chiefs have a fantastic defense , so Oakland quarterback Derek Carr is going to have to get rid of the ball early and often . Amari Cooper could have another big game up his sleeve . Last week Cooper has seven catches for 115 yards again a stingy Titans defense , and that was in the rain , too .
