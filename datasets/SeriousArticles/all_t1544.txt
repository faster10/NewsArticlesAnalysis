Calling all developers: Google I/O 2015 registration is now open
Registration is now open for Google I/O, the company's annual developer's conference. The popular conference is taking place on May 28 and May 29 here in San Francisco. It's Google's chance to offer developers a glimpse of what's in store for Android, Chrome OS, and all things Google. Last year, we got a look at Google's plans to dominate our wrists with Android Wear, as well as Material Design in"Android L," which would become Android Lollipop. And who could forget Google Cardboard, a comical -- but effective -- demonstration of virtual reality for mobile devices.A Google I/O ticket will set you back $900 (about £611, or AU$1,820), though active full-time students, professors, faculty and staff can apply for a discounted $300 ticket (about £204, or AU$394). You have until Thursday March 19 to get registered, though, so you'll want to act fast. Pop over to the Google I/O registration page to apply.
