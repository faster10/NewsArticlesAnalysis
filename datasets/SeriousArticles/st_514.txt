For me , as a Muslim who belongs to a rich culture of Arab , Jewish , Christian , and Islamic traditions , terrorizing human souls is an act against God . Abusing the image and the meaning of a merciful " Allah " is against Islam , especially when it is used by those who claim that they are related to Islam , one way or another . I am always shocked when simple and basic religious and human principles are given wrong interpretations in order to get some gains of power . The real meaning of power in Islam is mercy and love .
