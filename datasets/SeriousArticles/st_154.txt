The Chamber of Commerce and the Karl Rove backed American Crossroads spent north of 2 million propping up state House Speaker Thom Tillis when the candidate himself lacked the resources to go on statewide television .

Republicans are breathing easier , confident they have the candidate with the best shot to beat Democrat Hagan .
