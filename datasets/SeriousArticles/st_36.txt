Once at Dortmund there was exactly the same sort of incident with his glasses . ? You could see when that final goal went in how emotional he is . I ve noticed how much the Liverpool players love to work with him . ? I ve seen one or two games and the reaction shows they are all united . ? He always stood up for his team and he s a bit like a father for the players . ? Also , for the Liverpool fans , when they see they ve got a coach who gives his all they ll back him . Klopp is a very good coach . He suits English football .
