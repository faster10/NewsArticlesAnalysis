The big headline yesterday was the 100 million figure that the Enquirer threw out there . It may have been conjured out of thin air , but it ' s not a ridiculous amount . In fact , I ' d argue that Jackman as Wolverine for four more X Men movies is worth every penny to Fox . There might be some sticker shock to the 100 million figure , but paying the star of am established superhero franchise 25 million per picture is hardly unprecedented . ( Downey famously took home 50 million for The Avengers . ) In fact , compared to the reports of what Warner Bros . is going to throw at Bale to return as Batman , 25 million per for more Jackman almost seems like a discount .
