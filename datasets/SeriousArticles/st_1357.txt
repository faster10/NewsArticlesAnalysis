As human rights activists , we feel despair at the extraordinary savagery of ISIS not just against executed journalist James Foley , but against hundreds of thousands of Shia , ethnic and religious minorities , and other Iraqi and Syrian civilians . We are humbled by the challenge of restoring humanity to the conflicts that roil so much of the Mideast . We recognize that our work , whether it be laying the groundwork for future indictments or seeking secure and dignified asylum for the displaced , in the short term at least , will be limited .
