The votes to block the centerpiece of President Barack Obama ' s climate change pledge are scheduled to come just before the president returns from Paris , where he was negotiating with foreign leaders to slash world carbon emissions . It marks something of a culmination in Congressional Republicans ' long term strategy to undermine faith in Obama ' s promises to world leaders . Obama is likely to waste little time before vetoing the resolutions , as promised .
