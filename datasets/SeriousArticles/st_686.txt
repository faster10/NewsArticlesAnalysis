" Really what we have to do is , you have to inform other people because people don ' t know about it , " said al Saghir , who has family living in the battered city of Homs . " All they know is that , ' Oh , there ' s something going on in the Middle East , ' when really it ' s much more than that . They ' re fighting for their freedom . It ' s something we have guaranteed here in America . We have it no matter what . But these people don ' t have it and they ' re fighting for that , and we need to respect that and help them . "
