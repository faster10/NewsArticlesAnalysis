Samsung Galaxy S6 coming soon: What to expect
Android fans have been patiently waiting for the next iteration in the Galaxy smartphone line to arrive. And it's almost here. Samsung is set to announce the phone Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. There have been plenty of rumors circulating about the details since the fall, along with leaked photos and lots of speculation. Now, just days before the record is to be set straight, Lewis Hilsenteger of Unbox Therapy claims he has the real scoop: two exclusive high-resolution photos and a full list of specs. If the pictures are to be believed, Samsung will be showing off a sleek Galaxy S6 and a Galaxy S6 Edge, which will have a screen that curves over the side, like the Galaxy Note Edge, which was released in November. In his YouTube video, Hilsenteger highlighted the S6's new camera with a large aperture for better pictures in low-light settings and a slimmer, narrower body than the S5.He described the phone as a "more premium feeling device" owing to its having Gorilla Glass 4 front and back and an aluminum frame. The fancy form factor should put it more in line with the status-symbol iPhone 6. It will also have a redesigned fingerprint sensor that will work more like Apple's Touch ID. But the other ways in which it is like an iPhone may be disappointing. The change to the body means no removable back -- which means no removable battery -- and no MicroSD slot for extra memory. The phone will, however, come ready for wireless charging. For the full summary of the rumor mill, head over to CNET.com. Watch Unbox Therapy's revealing video below. Then check in Sunday to see if Hilsenteger got it right.
