He was confirmed by a vote of 93-5 on Thursday.In a message to Department of Defense staff that was made public by the Pentagon, Carter said a top priority would be dealing with congressional funding limits that create "wasteful uncertainty" for defense programs. "To win support from our fellow citizens for the resources we need, we must show that we can make better use of every taxpayer dollar," Carter said.
