In response , Clinton acknowledged , as she has on previous occasions , that she d made a mistake . But she also offered an explanation for her vote , something she has rarely done in the past . President Bush , she told the audience , had made a very explicit appeal that getting this vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections . In other words , a resolution to use force would prod Saddam Hussein into readmitting U . N . inspectors , so they could continue their mission of verifying whether or not he had destroyed his chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons sites . In other words , Clinton was now claiming she voted the way she did in the interests of diplomacy the problem was that Bush went back on his word ? he invaded before giving the inspectors enough time .
