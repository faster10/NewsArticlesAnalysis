People aren ' t tuning into this team because it can best Jordan ' s Bulls by some dry standard . They ' re watching because this greatness is charismatic , just the way it was back with Jordan ' s Bulls . People will obviously celebrate the Warriors more if they achieve historic success , but there ' s power in how the success is happening . It ' s fast paced , fun and unselfish ( 38 assists for the team on Wednesday ) . It makes winning look good , and few things endure better than style melded with substance .
