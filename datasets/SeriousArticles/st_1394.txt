How dare you criticize someone so dominant in the polls ? I really don ' t get this one . If Trump were running second everywhere , it would be less important to criticize him . Even Trump understands this : As he explained in the last debate , he only began attacking Ted Cruz when he started rising in the polls . This line of argument is a form of fatalism : Trump is at about 35 percent in the national polls , therefore the race is over . Nicolle Wallace actually said on MSNBC on Friday , " The voters have now spoken . " Before any caucus or primary ! There is no doubt that Trump is in a strong position , but that obviously shouldn ' t exempt him from criticism , especially when he himself is a one man political wrecking ball .
