The Northeast and Mid Atlantic are digging out and trying to get back to normal after a blizzard for the record books . At least 29 were killed . As much as 40 inches of snow fell in parts of the country . It will take days to get roads cleared , planes back on schedule , and driveways shoveled . School is cancelled for many children . The Federal Government will remain mostly shut down today as DC got about two feet of snow . New York City got a more than expected two feet , and JFK Airport has the biggest snowfall totals in its history !
