Talks are underway in Saudi Arabia to forge some sort of agreement between the Syrian government and opposition groups to end the civil war . ( Only the Islamic State is excluded . ) Because Iran has the most to win or lose in the outcome , and has invested the most in Assad , success of negotiations depend almost entirely on its attitude . Is it really ready to jettison Assad , and more importantly , the security and intelligence services he controls ? Unless the Iranians think he is going to lose outright , they won ' t . And that means more pain and destruction for Syria .
