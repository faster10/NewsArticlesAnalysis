In this case , though , no such argument exists . People purchase the volume of beverage they desire , and in almost every case , plenty of choice exists for smaller quantities . The outcome of barring the sale of anything larger than 16 ounces of Coca Cola or Pepsi at the ballpark will be that more containers will get thrown out as people just buy more units , and that waste will have to be disposed of later . Consumers will pay more and have more inconvenience in purchasing what they want to drink , and will still end up drinking the same amount anyway .
