As a recognizable face and voice , I ' ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to advocate for the health of women and children around the world , from Ukraine to Ghana .

That ' s why I ' m working with the Sierra Club to raise awareness and encourage people to take action by contacting their senators and asking them to support keeping the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards intact .
