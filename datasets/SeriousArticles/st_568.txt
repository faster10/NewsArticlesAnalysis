Though none of these groups have made any significant progress , the main battles are being fought in the groups that are discussing finance . Developed countries are obligated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) to provide money to the developing nations to help them deal with the impacts of climate change . During the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009 , the developed world had committed itself to mobilise 100 billion in climate finance every year from 2020 . While some progress has been made in raising this money for 2020 , for which the countries got eight years , there is no clarity on how this money will be made available every year after that .
