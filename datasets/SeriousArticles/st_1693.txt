Indonesia ' s National Police has responded to Human Rights Watch ' s exposure of this abusive practice with defiance . A senior police official , Inspector General Moechgiyarto , on November 18 confirmed that the National Police required the test for female applicants . But rather than condemning the practice and promising its abolition , Moechgiyarto defended it as a means to ensure the " high moral standards " of the police and reportedly suggested that failure of the test was simply proof that applicants were sex workers .
