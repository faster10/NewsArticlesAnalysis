" I always massage the turkey with cream and salt the night before cooking it . Let it rest overnight in the refrigerator so the mixture can penetrate the bird , and cook it like a chicken : High temperature at first to make it crispy , and then reduced temperature to keep it juicy . It is all about basting , basting , basting . NEVER leave your turkey alone . She needs love every 10 minutes . I love stuffing , but I add dried fruit and meats , like Italian sausage and foie gras . It becomes a stand alone dish at the table . " Ludo Lefevbre , Petit Trois ( Los Angeles , no . 3 )
