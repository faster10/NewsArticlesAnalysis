This brings me to my third , and probably the most likely , explanation : Trump has always been buying support throughout his career and he is still attempting to buy support today . Looking at it from this perspective it makes me wonder what Trump s donations have been to SarahPAC over the last several years . What Republicans are supporting Trump today and how much have they benefited from his political donations ? This assumption is far more realistic than assuming that Trump suddenly changed his ideology late in his life and wanted to solely support Republicans .
