Israeli officials say the missiles launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad into Israel ' s two largest cities , Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , are Iran ' s rockets , which Israelis believe were shipped by Iran in separate pieces like a doomsday Ikea package . They were sent by sea to Sudan and then moved through Egypt and into tunnels to Gaza , where they were assembled for firing at Israel with the help of Iranian operatives on the ground in Gaza . Iran and Sudan have denied that such a smuggling operation exists .
