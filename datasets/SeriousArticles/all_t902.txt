Why Scott Eastwood Passed on 'Fifty Shades of Grey'
Could you imagine Scott Eastwood as handsome billionaire Christian Grey in director Sam Taylor-Johnson's big-screen adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey?

"They had asked me to come in and read and test for it. But they had no script, " Eastwood explains.  "I won't do a movie where there is no script. I am not going to get locked in. And they wanted full frontal nudity. There were some things about it that were not for me. " Though, it's worth noting that Dornan, 32, did not have any full-frontal scenes in the film.  "It's not a bad thing. The movie made a ton of money. It's been a success, " he now says about the record-breaking film.  "It just wasn’t for me. It was not something I wanted to do. I just didn't enter the running. It was like, 'Okay, thank you.' " It's also apparently not something he wants to go to the theaters to watch.  "I’ll have to wait for it to get onto my home channels, " Eastwood says when asked if he's seen the film.
