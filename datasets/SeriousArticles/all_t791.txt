Are Bobby Brown's family members filming a reality show?
Are members of Bobby Brown's family filming a reality show while Bobbi Kristina Brown "fights for her life" in the hospital?According to a report from TMZ, that might be the case -- though there's no confirmation yet from the Brown family. Bobby Brown isn't involved in the production (per his lawyer), but his sisters, brother, and nieces and nephews are reportedly appearing in it, reports TMZ. Insiders on the production say no footage has been shot at Atlanta's Emory Hospital where Bobbi Kristina Brown has been since late January, but there's apparently video showing family members talking about Bobby Brown's daughter and the hospitalization. Bobbi Kristina Brown was rushed to the hospital on Jan. 31 after being found unresponsive in a bathtub inside her Georgia townhome. Since then, there have been very few updates on her condition -- aside from family members asking for prayers as she fights for her life. Meanwhile, her partner, Nick Gordon, has been very active on Twitter, claiming he's been banned from visiting the hospital. Bobby Brown's lawyer, though, said that Gordon was "offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit."In the latest development, Gordon took to Twitter to say he forgives Bobby Brown. The Brown and Houston family members are no strangers to reality TV programming. Bobbi Kristina Brown appeared in the 2012 Lifetime series "Houstons: On Our Own," which aired after the death of her mother, Whitney Houston. Houston and Bobby Brown, along with Bobbi Kristina Brown and various other family members, starred in the Bravo reality show, "Being Bobby Brown."
