While in New York for the U . N . General Assembly meetings last month , Iranian President Ahmedinejad and his Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi suggested that relations between Tehran and Western governments need to improve . They also indicated that negotiations over Iran ' s nuclear program should be re started . Their recent comments came on the heels of several months of outreach by the Iranian president ' s office to the United States and European Union . The current terror plot may have been , in part , an attempt by others within the Iranian government to sabotage those discussions before they can begin . The United States is expected to ask that the Security Council impose additional sanctions against Iran for the terror plot .
