Winning every time out is one thing , but this is quite another . From their gaudy point differential ( a league leading plus 15 . 3 , with San Antonio s plus 10 . 8 a distant second ) to Curry s better than ever individual play ( league leading 33 . 7 points per game , 45 . 6 from three point range , 5 . 9 assists , 4 . 8 rebounds ) , Golden State ? which needed overtime to beat Brooklyn on Saturday and won a tight game against Toronto on Tuesday ( 115 110 ) ? is making the game look easy on most nights .
