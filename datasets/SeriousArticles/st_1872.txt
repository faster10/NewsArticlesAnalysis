I suppose if you were being a pain you d suggest that there s never anything worth noting about the Golden Globes . Every year , they make a failed attempt to predict the Oscars , they honour the oddest people and then finish by hosting a pretty fine party . Much of that is true , but the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , the body that runs the event , has managed to keep the Globes at the front of the conversation for as long as anybody can remember . You didn t see Sky News reporting on the Screen Actors Guild nominations . Did you ?
