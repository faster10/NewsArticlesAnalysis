? ? We don t know the extent of Maclin s injury , obviously , but it was a bad look . Carted off after being on the turf for a while . We were having this discussion the other day , a few of us , and I thought Maclin was the team s MVP this year . Not just the production , and not just the dynamic play making he brought that the team lacked for so long , but there was a real attitude along with it . A toughness . I also wonder how much of the Chiefs being able to hold together after 1 5 had to do with Maclin s confidence in the coaching staff . That s all speculation , of course .
