Drake Gives Philadelphia High School the Best Gift Ever
Drake gave the gift of music to Strawberry Mansion High School. The rapper gave the gift of a $75,000 recording studio to a high school in one of the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in Philadelphia. The studio was finished last summer, but  Principal Linda Cliatt-Wayman told the Associated Press that budget problems and the school’s violent reputation kept instructors away until they got a music teacher, Ben Diamond, in early February.  "We thought we were going to be ready to go in September, " Wayman said.  "They've been dying to get in. " The recording studio was first announced in October 2013 when Drake met with school community members before he performed in Philadelphia  NEWS: Drake's Mom Explains Why He Cries   "This is about you.

"To be able to give them an outlet for things they want to express is very special. "   NEWS: 7 of the Most Inspiring Celebs   Josiah Showell, a junior at the high school, echoed his teacher’s sentiment,  "The studio inspired me to bring out the love of music that I have inside me.
