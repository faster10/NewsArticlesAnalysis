The SDR is not a currency . Rather it is a sort of international asset " reserve " created by the International Monetary Fund . As major countries " contribute " to the IMF , they are allotted these SDRs which can then be exchanged for the other currencies that make up the basket . Think of it as a global banking and lending system unto itself . You ' ll often hear that the IMF is making a loan to a troubled nation . That " loan " is an accounting item , made possible by member contributions to the IMF .
