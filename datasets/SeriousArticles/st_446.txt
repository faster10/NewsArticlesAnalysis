The 92 . 9 FM radio station lists Florida ' s Jim McElwain as the model for a team that fired a mediocre coach , thanks to his fast start in his first season . But they forget that at one point , Will Muschamp was seen as the new star , for the fast start for his Florida Gators . His Gator tenure ended in disaster . Such sports pundits said the same thing for Auburn coaches Gene Chizik ( fired after a disastrous season not long after a National Championship ) and Gus Mahlzahn ( who took a team to the National Championship Game two years ago , but needed to beat Jacksonville State , San Jose State and Idaho just to salvage a possible . 500 record ) .
