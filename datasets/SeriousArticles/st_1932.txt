Key player : It ' s DeAngelo Williams , or perhaps Fitzgerald Toussaint , his backup . Williams got out of a walking boot on Wednesday but didn ' t practice , as he tries to heal from a right foot injury suffered last week . Toussaint didn ' t impress last week , carrying 12 times for 24 yards . If Williams is ineffective or inactive and Toussaint plays for him , the Steelers have to be concerned about being one dimensional without the threat of a run game . Pass protection , especially if Toussaint plays , is a big issue as well .
