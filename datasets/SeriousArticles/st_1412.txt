NEW YORK ? BuzzFeed and Vox Media , popular online media companies , may pull out of the SXSW Interactive festival in Austin , Texas , after it canceled two panels related to gaming and online harassment . The tech festival , held each March , attracts 33 , 000 plus attendees and is part of the larger SXSW festival of music , film , and educational conferences . SXSW interactive director Hugh Forrest said the festival was canceling two sessions : SavePoint : A Discussion on the Gaming Community and Level Up : Overcoming Harassment in Games because they drew threats of on site violence related to this programing . He blogged that maintaining civil and respectful dialogue within the big tent is more important than any particular session . Both panels are related to the online campaign dubbed GamerGate that began last fall , during which women were harassed for criticizing the lack of diversity in the video game industry . The SavePoint talk was to discuss the current social political landscape in the gaming community and the Level Up panel included several women who were harassed . BuzzFeed executives told Forrest they would feel compelled to withdraw BuzzFeed staffers from the event if the panels aren t reinstated . Digital harassment has emerged as an urgent challenge , their letter states . Vox said it would not participate unless organizers take this issue seriously and take appropriate steps to correct it . SXSW did not immediately respond to a request for comment . ? ASSOCIATED PRESS
