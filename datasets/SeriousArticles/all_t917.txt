" Elgort said when asked whether or not men and woman can have non-romantic friendships.  "Actually, that’s not true. Me and Shailene have a really platonic relationship. I’ve never once wanted her sexually, which is nice. But for me, if a person is someone I’m attracted to, and she’s my best friend, hopefully we’re dating. " Not wanting each other sexually may have been helpful when it came to keeping things from being awkward when they had to get intimate during The Fault in Our Stars.
