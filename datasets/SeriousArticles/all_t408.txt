Patrick Leahy to skip Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech
The partisan divide over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s March address to Congress deepened further on Tuesday, with the Senate’s most-senior lawmaker announcing that he will not attend the speech. In a highly critical statement on Tuesday morning, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont called the speech arranged by House Speaker John Boehner “a tawdry and highhanded stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself.” Leahy joins Vermont’s other senator, independent Bernie Sanders, in skipping the speech, as well as a number of House Democrats who have been critical of the address, which comes as President Barack Obama tries to reach a nuclear deal with Iran — an effort opposed by Netanyahu.

I may watch it on TV,” Sanders said on Monday. A separate group of House Democrats is urging a delay in the speech, which comes in the middle of campaign season in Israel.
