Schilling and Mussina , two decorated right handers who thrived in the heart of the high offense era of not so long ago , obviously didn ' t make it , but they ' re heading in the right direction . Schilling in his fourth year on the ballot jumped from 39 . 2 percent in 2015 to 52 . 3 percent . That ' s an important step forward , as getting past the 50 percent mark typically bodes well for a candidate . In Mussina ' s case , he went from 24 . 6 percent in 2015 to 43 . 0 percent in this , his third year on the ballot . He ' s not at Schilling ' s level of support yet , but has more time and is trending properly .
