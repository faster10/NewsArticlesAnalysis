By the mid 1800s , the crypt at the Sedlec monastery had been a popular burial site for centuries , with plague outbreaks and Hussite Wars contributing thousands of remains . In the 1870s a local woodcarver was hired to make creative use of the bones that had been piling up in the crypt . This was no minor task : the ossuary contains the remains of over 40 , 000 people , many of which were used to decorate the chapel . The effect is as beautiful as it is macabre : elaborate light fixtures , arrays of bells , furnishings , splashy wall treatments and coats of arms are all loving recreated from skulls and bones of all sizes . Is that chandelier staring back at you ?
