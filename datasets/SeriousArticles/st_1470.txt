On November 24 , 2015 , A Turkish F 16 fighter used a sidewinder air to air missile to shoot down a Russian SU 24 fighter bomber for straying into Turkish airspace over Hatay province . The pilot , Lt . Col . Oleg Peshkov and his navigator , Capt . Konstantin Murakhtin , both successfully jettisoned from the aircraft . Peshkov was subsequently shot dead by Syrian Turkoman rebels as he parachuted to earth while Murakhtin was eventually rescued by Syrian and Russian Special Forces . A second Russian , Alexander Pozynich , a member of a naval marine unit , was also killed when a Mi 8 rescue helicopter was hit by an American made TOW anti tank missile from an unspecified Syrian rebel group and destroyed .
