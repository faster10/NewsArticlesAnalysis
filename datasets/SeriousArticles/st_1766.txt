It s experience , as Yost put it earlier this week . It s character . It s a group of really , really talented players . But a lot of it I think is a mindset . We re in the biggest stage that you can play in front of and these guys are totally confident in their abilities . They re as cool as cucumbers . They never panic because they ve been through it before and they know that they re capable of doing it again . And it s just something that they believe in their heart that they can accomplish .
