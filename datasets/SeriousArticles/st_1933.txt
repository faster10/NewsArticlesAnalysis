Why they ll lose : The last two weeks have been strange . The Steelers looked terrible against Baltimore , and even the Browns with Austin Davis at quarterback were within a score in the fourth quarter in the regular season finale . Have they lost steam late in the season ? The Steelers ' biggest problem overall is on defense , where they give up too many yards in the passing game ( though , the defense had 17 interceptions , which helps ) . Also , if Williams can ' t play or isn ' t his usual self , the offense might not be able to outscore the Bengals .
