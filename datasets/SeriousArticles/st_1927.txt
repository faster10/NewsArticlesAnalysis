Universal ' s re release " Jurassic Park 3D , " the latest entry in the 3 D re release fad kickstarted by " The Lion King " 3D ' s 94 . 1 million haul in 2011 , stomped away with 18 . 2 million in its first weekend . IMAX screens accounted for 6 million of that figure . The dinosaur film ( read a wonderful oral history of it HERE ) had better start than Titanic 3D , which debuted to 17 . 3 million , but behind Star Wars : Episode 1 The Phantom Menace 3D , which opened with 22 . 4 million . All told , the Steven Spielberg classic might score about 50 60 million , a tremendous result considering it only cost Universal 10 million to convert to 3D .
