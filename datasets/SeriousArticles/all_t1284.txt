Ikea to put wireless phone charging in furniture
Hate the clutter of cords messing up your perfect catalogue-looking living room? Ikea is coming to the rescue. The company will be putting charging stations into some of its furniture so you can charge your phone just by setting it down on the right spot on your end table. The charging will be powered by Qi, one of leading inductive charging technologies. But here's the rub: You have to have a compatible phone to make it work. The new Samsung Galaxy S6 has the capability built it. The iPhone doesn't. Special cases can be put on your phone to give it the wireless-charging ability, but as CNET's Dan Ackerman told CBS News, "I still think we're years off from it being really universal."
