Lauren Conrad: I've Never Been 'Obsessed With the Idea of Marriage'
Despite her ultra-romantic style and the recent addition of a bridesmaid dress collection to her Paper Crown fashion line, Lauren Conrad reveals her very grounded take on marriage in the April issue of Redbook magazine. Thanks to Laguna Beach and The Hills, LC's fans have seen a few of her romantic entanglements play out on the small-screen (who can forget Stephen Colletti, Jason Wahler and Brody Jenner?), but the 29-year-old reality star says her current husband is  "the first person [she] ever thought [she] could marry. " Last September, LC married William Tell, a lawyer, in a rustic-chic wedding along the California coastline.

[But I was] never a person who was obsessed with the idea of marriage, " she surprisingly shares with Redbook. Perhaps it's because she already felt married to Tell before they even tied the knot? Last month, she told UsWeekly that not much has changed between the couple since getting hitched.  "We already lived together, we already were very much partners, and knew we were going to spend our lives together, so you know we had a beautiful wedding and it was so great, " she said. Though when the time comes, don't expect to see LC's children go through their own growing pains in front of millions of viewers.  "I definitely wouldn't encourage my child to do reality television, " she said bluntly.
