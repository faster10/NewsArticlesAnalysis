A bejeweled headdress , created with Swarovski ' s gemstones division , changes color based on the heat generated by the wearer ' s neural activity , thanks to hyper conductive stones and heat sensitive ink . The three sculptural leather jackets are infused with dye formulas that change color in response to different stimuli : friction , the temperature and humidity of the room , and intense heat . In its own room is a fragile ceramic dress called Eighthsense , covered with hand painted pixels that reflect brain activity detected by an accompanying EEG headset .
