A GOOD RESULT FOR POLLSTERS IN LOUISIANA Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie : " There were two winners Saturday ' s Louisiana general runoff . One was state Rep . John Bel Edwards , the unknown Democrat who was elected governor . The other was political polling . . . . . The failure of political polls to capture the late surge to Republican Matt Bevin left most observers wondering whether the polls might be equally flawed in Louisiana . As LSU political scientist Michael Henderson observed , the polls would have to be much further off than the Kentucky polls to miss their mark in Louisiana . In the end , Democrat John Bel Edwards defeated David Vitter by a healthy 12 point margin , not far off the 10 point margin estimated by Huffpost Pollster based on aggregated state poll results . Before we get too self congratulatory , however , it worth noting that looking at the average misses considerable variation across polls which ranged from a 4 point to 20 point margin . The larger lesson is not that we need less polling in state elections but that we need more . HuffPost
