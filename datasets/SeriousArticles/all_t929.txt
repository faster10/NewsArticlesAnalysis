Charlie Hunnam on Full Frontal Nudity: ‘I Have Nothing to Hide’
When it comes to on-screen nudity, actor Charlie Hunnam has nothing to hide. Yet, some wouldn’t know that after the former Sons of Anarchy star joined and then immediately dropped out of Fifty Shades of Grey, which would have potential saw him dropping his trousers as Christian Grey.

But I have done full frontal before,” Hunnam tells Elle Canada. “I did full frontal when I was 18 on the TV show Queer as Folk. But because I was playing a 15-year-old character, the censorship people wouldn’t allow us to put it on TV.” While audiences don’t get to see as much of the 34-year-old actor as they used to, baring all isn't completely out of the picture.
