Ferguson : I really don ' t know . I do know that he ' s extremely happy where he is and he ' s thriving . How much of that entails gratitude to his mother and father is not clear . He ' s read the book and he hasn ' t tried to murder me or anything , so I assume it wasn ' t entirely offensive to him . I ' ve often thought the key to the whole process is how to keep your kid from murdering you , and how to keep from murdering your kid . If you can get through this thing without homicide , I think that ' s a victory in itself .
