Then came Mr Trump . He walked the narrow path to the stage with a small line of admirers to his right . He high fived and touched hands . Then he came upon the 12 year old boy with stars in his eyes . My son handed him the sign and pen . Mr Trump took the pen , wrong side up , with the point of the pen facing him rather than facing the sign . He tried to scribble a signature but the wrong end of the pen didn t allow it . What happened next changed my son s perception of Donald Trump forever .
