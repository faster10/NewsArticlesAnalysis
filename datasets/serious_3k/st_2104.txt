For starters , it ' s the first place I ever heard the term " market price . " Daddy encouraged me to eat whatever I wanted at restaurants no kid ' s menu here so I tried my hand at swordfish . I figured anything so fresh they couldn ' t put a price on it until the day it was served had to be good . And for years , I ordered based on that idea . From the right side of the menu . If it was fresh ( and expensive ) , it had to be the best .
