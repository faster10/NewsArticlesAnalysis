Kat , as he is known , winks often and smiles constantly , whether he just chucked an air ball or drilled an 18 foot fadeaway . I was raised to smile , he says . I m a smiling kind of guy . I like to joke around , be lighthearted , not take things too seriously . His joyful countenance bears little resemblance to the former wunderkind who has been tabbed to mentor him , the one who bangs his head against the basket stanchion before games , who releases primal screams at the sight of loose balls and who made that jersey with the foliage on the collar so desirable in the first place .
