Unfortunately for Lowry , one of his few mistakes Saturday arguably cost Toronto the game . Down 106 103 , Lowry finished an and one lay up with 44 seconds remaining to allow himself a chance to tie with a free throw . He missed following a Warriors timeout , giving the visitors an opportunity to go two for one and make a comeback even more difficult . They didn ' t get a shot off until late in the shot clock , but Klay Thompson ' s missed jumper caromed off Cory Joseph ' s hand and out of bounds to force a free throw contest . Golden State made all six of their attempts after starting just 20 of 30 from the line , and the Raptors saw their last possession desperation chance end with Curry pressuring Joseph into a turnover .
