We re still very much in it , but we ve got to win some games and just got to start now , said Manning , who tweaked his right ankle Sunday and had precautionary X rays taken after the game . He s expected to resume practice tomorrow . We can t get discouraged . We can t have any quit in us . We ve got to keep fighting , continue to have a great week of preparation , practice and then perform at a higher level on game day . Just get some energy back into the locker room , get some excitement and get that winning feeling back .
