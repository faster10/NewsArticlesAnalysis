President Franklin Roosevelt , when taking on the banks during the Great Depression , famously said , " They are unanimous in their hate for me and I welcome their hatred . " ? Cruz is following FDR ' s lead , but substituting Republicans for bankers ( while being married to a Goldman Sachs banker ) . Cruz has shown a real willingness to put Republicans in difficult positions and then to place the blame at their feet when those positions bloom into abject disasters ( remember the October 2013 government shutdown ? ) . Cruz has little interest in making sure practical things , like keeping government agencies funded , are accomplished , at least when there are fundraising lists to be grown . That unwillingness to go along and the ' Is it good for the Cruz ? ' mindset so visible to D . C . insiders has earned him both the support of the angry GOP electorate and many an earful at private weekly lunches held by Senate Republicans .
