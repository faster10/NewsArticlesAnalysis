We starting thinking about what we were doing as the Revolution Against the Absurd . Anyone who has tried to get a medical device for a loved one , and had to negotiate the maze that ' s created by the provider , the hospital , the lawyers , the insurance companies , knows just how absurd it can be . It ' s absurd that in this day and age , an ALS patient would have to communicate with his parents by watching them run their fingers over a piece of paper . It ' s like seeing someone rubbing two sticks together , and thinking , hey , someone should invent a match for these people .
