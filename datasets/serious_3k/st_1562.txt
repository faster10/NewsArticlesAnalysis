" A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel , only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e mail account , is in no position to give free and informed consent , " she said Wednesday . " Such ' consent , ' given under threat of deportation , cannot serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy . In today ' s world , access to a person ' s e mail account is akin to access to their innermost thoughts and personal lives . Allowing security agents to take such invasive measures at their own discretion and on the basis of such flimsy ' consent ' is not befitting of a democracy . "
