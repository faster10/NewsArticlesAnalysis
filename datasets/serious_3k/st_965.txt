The Lady , 209THE LOOK : As red as Dorothy ' s ruby slippers in The Wizard Of Oz , these are super sexy heels . I ' m amazed by how comfortable they are , hugging my foot like a glove . And they might be three and a half inches high , but the slightly sturdier heel makes them easier to balance in than other shoes in the range . BEST FOR : Any occasion as long as you can handle the attention ! WORST FOR : Nothing . They ' re a complete winner . Comfort rating : 5 . Surprisingly blissful .
