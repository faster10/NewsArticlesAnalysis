" I ' d much rather be on the other side and having guys in the lineup , having guys healthy , " James said . " I ' ve always heard that saying of , ' Is it a blessing that guys are out and guys can step in ? ' I think it ' s good for some of the guys that don ' t get to play as much they get an opportunity . But at the same time , I ' d much rather be full and know what we ' re going to have and play at a high level for most of the year so we know what we can fall back on at the end of the season .
