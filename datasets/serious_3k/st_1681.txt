How they got here : The Bengals had a fine season , but the Dalton injury changes their entire outlook . Dalton was an MVP candidate when he broke his thumb . McCarron had some nice moments , but he isn ' t playing to the same level Dalton was , nor did anyone expect him to do that . It seems incredibly unlikely Dalton plays Saturday night , so it ' ll be on McCarron to play well . Fortunately , the Bengals have some great talent around the quarterback position . The roster is stacked from top to bottom . Had Dalton stayed healthy , the Bengals might be the favorite to win the AFC .
