On a short slate like Thursday , with only three games , you want to stuff as many stars into your lineup as you can , and there are plenty to choose from ( Stephen Curry , LeBron James , Blake Griffin , DeMarcus Cousins ) . In order to do so , you need to find some low priced players , and that s why I love Rivers tonight . He has averaged 38 minutes in Chris Paul s absence during the past two games and is expected to draw the start against the Warriors with Paul doubtful to play .
