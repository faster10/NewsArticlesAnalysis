I know exactly why it happened , because I go back and I know what I was doing and what I was putting myself through and trying to do too much , Kubiak said . I kind of ran myself into the ground a little bit . I ve tried to do things different . I still ? I mean , I love the work , so I m going to be up early in the morning working the hours , but I ve also tried to go about it a little bit of a different way ? not try to take on everything myself and understand I ve got good people with me .
