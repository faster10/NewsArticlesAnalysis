" I see a guy that ' s immature , and I see a guy that just doesn ' t get it . ? I ' m hoping he gets it and somebody can be man enough to pull him aside and give him the cold , hard facts : Listen , you ' re a talented player , but there ' s plenty of talented players in this league , and the league will survive without you . Once the owners and the NFL decides to say they ' ve had enough of you , they ' ve had enough of you . It doesn ' t matter what you can do as far as rushing the passer . Ask Ray Rice . In a couple years , you ' re going to get a little older and you ' re going to hurt yourself or you ' re going to hurt somebody else . You ' re going to have a regrettable moment that you can ' t take back ? and something that you love and and work hard and are passionate about is going to be taken away from you . I think you ' ve got some mental health issues . I think you need to get evaluated . "
