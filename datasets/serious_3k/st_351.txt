" Addressing an audience of ? families of gun violence victims , gun owners and gun control advocates , Obama recited a litany of mass shootings during his presidency before he ? paused and choked up at the mention of 20 first graders shot and killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary . " First graders , " he said , as ? tears ran ? down his cheeks . " Every time I hear about those kids , it makes me mad . " In the other corner : ? GOP candidates quickly denounced the plan . Florida Sen . Marco Rubio told Fox News , " This president is obsessed with undermining the Constitution in general , but the Second Amendment in particular . " Meanwhile , a Missouri woman made the argument that if it wasn ' t for the Second Amendment right to carry arms , she might not be here today .
