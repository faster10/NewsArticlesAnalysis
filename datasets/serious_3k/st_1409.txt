Anyone curious about how far Zika will spread need only look at Chikungunya . Chikungunya had never been seen outside Africa and parts of Southeast Asia until about 2005 . It spread quickly after that and once it hit the western hemisphere it took just months to spread across the Caribbean to central and then South America . Experts fully expect Chikungunya to establish itself in the southern U . S . at some point . One piece of good news for the U . S . is that Zika is not likely to spread as fast as West Nile virus did . West Nile virus , which has reached all of continental North America since it was first seen in New York in 1999 , lives in birds and infects many more different species of mosquitoes , giving it more places to lurk .
