Vice President Joe Biden , who has a bad habit of accidentally ? saying what he thinks , had to backtrack a bit yesterday after sort of ? endorsing Bernie Sanders on domestic issues . During a CNN interview aired Monday , Biden implied that Sanders was far more focused and seasoned than Clinton on domestic issues like income inequality , and that domestic issues were " relatively new for Hillary to talk about . " Yesterday on the Today show , Biden tried to spin his comments : ? " What I meant was , for the last five years , she ' s been engaged in foreign policy " as secretary of State ( and we ' ll just let it slide that she hasn ' t been secretary of State for the last two years . We hope ? Biden noticed that at some point . ) Still , Team Sanders tweeted out a link to the interview that described the VP ' s comments as " effusive praise . "
