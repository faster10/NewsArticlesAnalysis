This is , of course , not a comprehensive list of every racist incident that has happened on campus . ? Yet sadly , the first response from many has been to question and reject the veracity of each episode , as if the idea of a black person facing oppression or aggression because of their race is so unbelievable in today ' s America that it must be made up . Apparently it ' s easier for some people to accuse the black community of concocting an elaborate racial conspiracy than it is to confront the difficult reality of racism in America . But if these people would take a second to actually listen to those who are affected by racism , it ' s the only proof they ' d need to understand that the current protests at Mizzou are a necessary response to a very real issue .
