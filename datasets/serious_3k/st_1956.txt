I like to look at things every two weeks . That way you can say ' that part ' s great ' or ' hold it , let ' s talk about this . ' I was just talking to Mike Ledwidge a little while ago he and I do the Michael Bennett books . When I have a first draft , then I will do another , and in some cases I ' ve done , seven , eight , nine drafts . And that ' s the process . I do the outline , the co writer does the first draft , and I ' ll do subsequent drafts . Although my co writers might call it ' Jim screwing up the book , ' but so far , it ' s working well .
