And then I started reaching out to Diddy . He ' s on a set 18 hours a day , but he said he ' d get it done some way , somehow . Talked to Chris Brown . He and his manager Tina Davis said they were on their way to the studio so they told me after I do my part , to bring it over and Chris will do the hook . Before I took the beat over to Chris , Boyz II Men walked into the studio randomly so they took it to their studio next door , laid down all the background vocals .
