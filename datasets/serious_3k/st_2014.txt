Children who would have died if born late in the second trimester in 1973 would more than likely live if they were born now . A Swedish study in 2009 found that preterm babies born late in the second trimester who are given intensive care survive at surprising rates : 53 of those born at 23 weeks live , 67 at 24 weeks , and by 25 weeks , 82 of the babies survive . ( Sweden ' s health care system makes it possible to reliably track survival rates , but the type of care provided there is similar to that available in the United States ) .
