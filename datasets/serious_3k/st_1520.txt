When people commit heinous acts , we try to distance ourselves from them , physically and emotionally . If we believe those acts were carried out by people who are nothing like us , not people like our friends and neighbors but " others , " it ' s a psychological attempt at self protection .

In America , we make people we don ' t like the " other , " especially people who commit evil . But some groups of people are more readily dismissed than others .
