The Etta , 270THE LOOK : Ultra feminine , with a silk rose detail . While they ' re only three and a half inches high , they feel teeteringly uncomfortable , even by Carrie ' s standards . I put this down to the thin sole . Oh , for a comfy platform sole ! BEST FOR : Looking at . I can ' t even wear them sitting down . WORST FOR : Getting blisters . The sharp toe means they pinch and rub like crazy . Comfort rating : 0 . Rhino hide feet only need apply .
