New England ' s defense has been dominant the past two weeks . They have limited the Dolphins and Redskins to just 17 points , and save for a garbage time touchdown in Week 9 , that number would be 10 . If there ' s one area where the Patriots haven ' t been as dominant it ' s against the run . The Giants may actually have the upper hand on a few matchups along the interior line . Center Weston Richburg and left guard Justin Pugh are playing at a Pro Bowl level . The Giants should look to use their four headed running back by committee between the tackles early and often . The last thing the Giants want to do is stop the clock and put their defense on the field for the majority of this game .
