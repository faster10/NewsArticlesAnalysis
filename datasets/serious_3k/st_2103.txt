" And it was a Friday evening and we sailed off just before sunset and went up the Hudson , up under the George Washington Bridge , which is lovely , turned around , now the sun is setting . We go out to the Statue of Liberty and see that at night , as the sky is darkening . And then you turn around and we headed up the East River , and you see the lower tip of Manhattan , and it was a sight and an experience . . . . You never get to see New York like that . "
