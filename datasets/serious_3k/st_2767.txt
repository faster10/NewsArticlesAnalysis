The idea that Vince McMahon would pitch Batista just goes to show that they need as many stars as they can get for the Dallas show in April . A rash of injuries to John Cena , Seth Rollins , Cesaro , Randy Orton , and Alberto Del Rio has forced WWE to scramble when it comes to creating a lineup worthy of a record breaking attendance . The Rock , Triple H and Chris Jericho have all upped the ante , but it certainly wouldn t hurt to have Batista in the fold as well . You have to believe that he d like to make up for his last run , even if it were to be a one off appearance as was suggested . And no word on whether Triple H had any part in the discussions .
