But scoring within the margin of error doesn ' t really imply a tie HuffPollster : " So maybe this means that Trump and Cruz are kinda , sorta . . . tied ? Not really . ' Within the margin of error ' simply means that we can t be 95 percent certain Trump is genuinely leading Cruz in this poll . Pollsters use the margin of error to describe how much error there might be in a poll estimate due to random sampling . It s almost always calculated at the 95 percent confidence level . This means that for a poll with a margin of error of 4 percentage points , you could conduct the same poll 100 more times with 100 different random samples and the results would still end up within a 4 point range in 95 of the polls . When two poll estimates fall within the margin of error such as Cruz s 23 percent and Trump s 25 percent all it means is that we re somewhat less than 95 percent confident that Trump would still lead Cruz if the poll used a different random sample . In fact , there s about an 80 percent chance that Trump actually leads Cruz in the Quinnipiac poll . " HuffPost
