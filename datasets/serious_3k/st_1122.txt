This , clearly , is not a typical ? tennis interview , but one that goes to unexpected places . The start was less forthcoming , covering such ? areas ? as Azarenka ' s pre season ( more about the body than the tennis ) , her health and longstanding foot injury ? ( " it ' s a question I get asked all the time , and I don ' t know how to answer it " ) , her 2016 goals ? ( " I don ' t say my goals . I think it ' s the best way for me " ) . OK , right , then .
