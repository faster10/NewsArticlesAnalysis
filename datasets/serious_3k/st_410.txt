Iran has maintained a narrative that the hostages were treated well , but that is not true . Not all the hostages were treated the same . The two women , Ann Swift and Kathryn Koob , said they were treated " correctly " by their captors , but others , including Al Golacinski , John Limbert and Rick Kupke , were subject to a mock execution , where they were awakened in the middle of the night , forced to strip to their underwear and marched to a room in the basement where their guards made it seem they were about to be executed by firing squad . The guards fired their weapons , but they were not loaded . Then the guards laughed . Why did they do it ? Limbert said it was because " they thought it would be fun . "
