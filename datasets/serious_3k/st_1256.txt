Roy Amara , longtime president of the Institute for the Future , said that people tend to overestimate the effect of a new technology in the short run and underestimate the effect over the long term . That ' s absolutely the case in robotics , where it ' s easy to dismiss early attempts as toys but hard to imagine how robots will fundamentally change our lives over the next few decades . Robots will be able to guard your house while you ' re away , babysit your kids , or keep you company when you ' re alone . Drones could tend to gardens and farms while people control telepresence robots on the other side of the world via heads up displays like Google Glass .
