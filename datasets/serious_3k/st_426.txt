Second , he must get into the policy weeds . A single example : This week Hillary criticized two mergers announced by four health insurance giants : Aetna , Humana , Cigna and Anthem . But she didn t actually oppose them she just called for close scrutiny of them . She does this a lot . Parsing her sentences you find she hasn t come out flatly against the TPP . Policy types close to her say that if elected she ll work with big insurers to reform the market . It may not be the worst idea in the history of public policy but it s a contender . A middle class person over 50 earning 47 , 000 a year may pay 800 a month for a plan with a 5000 deductible . That s not health care , it s a hoax . If Democrats can t do better than what Hillary has on offer they re doomed . Bernie would fix the system . It s a debate we must have .
