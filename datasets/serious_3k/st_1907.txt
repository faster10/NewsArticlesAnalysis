Golden State decimated the competition last month , scoring a league high 113 . 6 points per 100 possessions and outscoring the opposition by a whopping 16 . 5 points per 100 ? head and shoulders above even the 11 . 4 per 100 mark they rolled up en route to 67 wins and the 2014 15 NBA championship .
