How they got here : The Steelers had an unusual year . They didn ' t have Le ' Veon Bell or Martavis Bryant to start the season because of suspensions and began 2 2 . In Week 3 , Ben Roethlisberger went down with a knee injury . When he came back in Week 8 against the Bengals , Bell suffered a season ending knee injury . So the entire Steelers offense was on the same field for only less than a half this season . But the offense has been explosive with Roethlisberger healthy . Starting in Week 9 , the Steelers scored at least 30 points in six straight games . Then came a stunning loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16 , only to have the New York Jets lose in Week 17 , opening the door for the Steelers to get in the playoffs .
