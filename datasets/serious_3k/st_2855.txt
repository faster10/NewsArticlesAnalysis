Zakaria : This is way beyond Dan Quayle . Quayle was a lightweight who was prone to scramble his words , or say things that sounded weird , but you almost always knew what he meant . One of his most famous miscues was to the United Negro College Fund when he said , " What a terrible thing to have lost one ' s mind . Or not to have a mind at all . " Now he was trying to play off a famous ad that the group used to run , " A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste . " And he screwed it up in a funny way . But read Gov . Palin ' s answers and it does appear that she doesn ' t have any understanding about the topic under discussion .
