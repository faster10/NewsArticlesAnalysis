Clark : I get as much as I want from doing appellate work . I handle criminal appeals . That ' s something you can do from home . You review transcripts for technical errors and you write briefs , so it ' s all written . It keeps me up to speed with how cases are being tried today , as opposed to back when I was in court . It keeps me up to speed with the technology they ' re using in courtrooms , the kinds of crimes that are being prosecuted , the kinds of criminals that are coming through . So it keeps me fresh that way . I really don ' t miss the trials and courtroom appearances .
