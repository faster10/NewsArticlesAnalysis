We know the U . S . government has done this to companies large and small . Lavabit was a small secure e mail service , with an encryption system designed so that even the company had no access to users ' e mail . Last year , the NSA presented it with a secret court order demanding that it turn over its master key , thereby compromising the security of every user . Lavabit shut down its service rather than comply , but that option isn ' t feasible for larger companies . In 2011 , Microsoft made some still unknown changes to Skype to make NSA eavesdropping easier , but the security promises they advertised didn ' t change .
