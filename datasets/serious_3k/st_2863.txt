What we cannot afford to do now is to erase the lessons of the global financial crash from our minds in our desire to avoid a visit from the IMF . In fact , it is we who should pay a visit to the IMF . A global institution which has failed to protect global capitalism from itself is no longer fit for its purpose . Imposing austerity as a means to revive business as usual is a moribund strategy . If institutional reform is the order of the day , then the transformation of the IMF may not be a bad starting point . But beyond such reform , where should we turn for inspiration and renewal ?
