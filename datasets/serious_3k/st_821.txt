The most important change , and the first improvement to come out of the tragedy , was a new muster rule . Before , cruise ships could hold the muster , also known as the safety drill , up until 24 hours after sailing ( though to be honest , most did do musters before the ship left port ) . Now , the drills must be completed before sailing . This is important because several hundred passengers who ' d boarded Costa Concordia the day it ran aground had not yet attended a muster and so didn ' t have the information on what to do in case of an emergency when they needed it most .
