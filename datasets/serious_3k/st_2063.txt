NOTE FROM BERLIN : Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus excoriates what is perhaps BEN CARSON s most noticeable rhetorical quirk ? his frequent references to Nazi Germany . You don t have to be German , or a student of German history , to grasp the repugnance of Nazi analogies , but being at the scene of Hitler s crimes helps reinforce the caution against comparing the Holocaust to anything except another genocide . Nothing about which Carson complains ? alleged but unproven IRS targeting of Obama administration critics , what he sees as the chilling effect of political correctness ? comes close to the brutality of Hitler s Germany . http : wapo . st 1PQFfSK
