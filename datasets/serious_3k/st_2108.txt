With a working boatyard and a everyone knows your name dockside bar ( Captain Woody ' s ) , Palmetto Bay gives off a relaxed vibe that transcends labels such as " local " and " tourist . " Our group settled onto the patio at Black Marlin Bayside Grill for brunch a perfect place to dawdle on a lazy morning ( 843 785 4950 ) . My personal favorite : the shrimp hash a hearty combo of poached eggs , delicate shrimp and spicy sausage is like something you ' d expect for breakfast on board a fishing boat . My brother bogarted the sushi nachos with seared tuna and avocado . And the sisters in law did serious damage to the dessert like bananas Foster French toast .
