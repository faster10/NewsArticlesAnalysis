The Lions didn ' t score a touchdown in the first half , and it wasn ' t a matter of not being able to move the ball . They were marching up and down the field at ease , racking up a 218 91 yardage edge in the first half . Detroit held onto the ball nearly twice as long as Oakland . But the Lions simply failed to punch it in , going without a touchdown until Matthew Stafford ' s 5 yard run with 11 : 04 left in the game . Their worst moment came on their first drive , when they had the ball on the goal line but Eric Ebron dropped a touchdown pass , Stafford led Ameer Abdullah too much on another pass , and Laken Tomlinson was whistled for holding .
