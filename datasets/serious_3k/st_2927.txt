It s much more like juggling eggs , Bryant says . You have to handle them with care because you don ' t want them to fall and crack . Traditionally , he is not a man who juggles eggs . He is a man who tempers steel . I know one gear , and I ' m not very balanced in my life , which isn ' t the healthiest way to be , Bryant continues . Some people like that approach and some people don t , and that s where the split happens , the hero villain split . You need to have a villain , an antagonist , and for a long time I ve been this black mamba character . It s how people needed to know me . But when I go full bore into my second act , I think they will know me for something else .
