" We pick up right where we left off , " Cranston says of the fifth season opener . " We ' re cleaning up the pieces from last season ' s huge ordeal where Gus Fring was forced to meet his maker . It ' s not as easy as Walter thought . And as we ' ve discovered over the years , you don ' t really know who Walter White is . I ' m still discovering who he is and I ' m trying to allow myself to be open to him going darker and darker . There ' s physical danger to himself and his family , plus there ' s the emotional danger due to his anger and hubris . It ' s about the evil that men do and where that takes him . "
