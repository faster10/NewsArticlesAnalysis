Famously the site of the world ' s biggest nuclear disaster in 1986 , the 30km radius exclusion zone is mostly uninhabited today , but limited tours have been available since 2002 for travelers who are curious enough to get a glimpse of the industrial ghost town and aren ' t put off by the ominous click of a Geiger counter . Factories , homes , schools , and a particularly creepy abandoned amusement park stand decaying and choked with weeds , but remain much as they looked at the time of disaster . The Ukrainian government has indicated that the exclusion zone will be increasingly open to travelers in the coming years . Just don ' t step on the radioactive moss .
