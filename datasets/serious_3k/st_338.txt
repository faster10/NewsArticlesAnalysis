The Academy ' s swift move to acknowledge the problem , and to initiate modest change , is a good beginning , but may be inadequate as it stands . Whatever changes the Academy endorses , they will need to address two pervasive human characteristics : homophily , the tendency of people to prefer those who appear to be like them ( which I describe in my book , Us before Me , pp . 59 61 ) , and implicit bias , in which biased attitudes and behaviors result from unconscious cognitive processes unbeknownst to the biased person . Even those with the best intentions may be swayed by unconscious racism when they evaluate the quality of an artistic performance or project .
