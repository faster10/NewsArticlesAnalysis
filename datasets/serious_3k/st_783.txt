That ' s been one of the cool things . I said I would never get on Twitter . And I stayed away from it until last December and ( since then ) I literally haven ' t put it down . It ' s a cool way to connect with people all over the world . There have been fans from China and Brazil and everywhere who are constantly tweeting at me or asking things . People ask me about the video game or about how I ' m training . It ' s been fun to keep everybody in the loop of what ' s going on .
