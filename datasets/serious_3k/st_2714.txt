When you have players like we do on this team , I mean , honestly , that doesn ' t take away my freedom or what I feel like coming over half court , " Irving said . " I ' m going to make the best decision for the team and myself , coming up and being aggressive . One pass , two passes , three passes , if we get no passes and someone hits a shot , then I mean I ' m still cool with it . As long as it ' s in rhythm and I feel like it ' s a good shot , I have confidence , no matter how many passes . That ' s an interesting stat though .
