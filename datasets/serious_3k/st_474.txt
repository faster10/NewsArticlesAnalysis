When you press your ABS brakes , you are not braking . You are giving a robot a request . The robot then processes the request , and brakes on your behalf . You just push the brake in a totally natural way , expressing your intent ( i . e . , how fast you ' d like to stop ) . You offer guidance with your foot on the pedal , which allows the robot to do its work by interpreting that guidance and making sure you don ' t skid . This is the processing of a high level desire by letting the technology take care of all the low level details .
