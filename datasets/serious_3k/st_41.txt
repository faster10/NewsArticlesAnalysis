Holes made by guns that shoot 45 rounds in 1 minute , like the semi automatic rifle used in Newtown . Holes inspired by the glorification of the shooters in previous shootings . Their life size faces on the cover of Time magazine , bought by you , and dominating the Internet sites you browse , while the fallen are left in the photo albums of their families . Holes made by the lack of help and understanding in our country ' s mental health . Holes made by the fact that the Newtown children are not the only children we have lost to mass shootings . They are the unfortunate 20 who made us realize the water is up to our throats .
