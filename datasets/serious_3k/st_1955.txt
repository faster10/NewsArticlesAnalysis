Patterson : Oh , yeah , the books , too . I don ' t know . I don ' t feel stressed out . It ' s just a pattern I am comfortable with . I get up every morning and chop wood , and I pretty much do it seven days a week , and I like to do it . I still have time for my wife and my son , who ' s 14 , and at this point , my head is still above water . I think part of it is , you can take on more , and you do , but at a certain point I may say , that ' s it . I can ' t do anymore . I read a fair amount , but I don ' t read as much as I used to , so that ' s suffered a little .
