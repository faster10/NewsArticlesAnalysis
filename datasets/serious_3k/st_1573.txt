Having a program grade papers would apparently free teachers to do other things , but I think it would be a mistake . Why ? As a teacher , I may begin to understand students by their conversation or how they respond in class , but when they actually have to put their thoughts on paper , I can learn a huge amount in a relatively brief time . I can see how they think and feel in relation to the material before them , and if ( and how ) they have problems in making connections , marshaling arguments , drawing conclusions . Needless to say , I can also get a sense of where they are with the material at hand . Have they learned enough to progress to the next stage ?
