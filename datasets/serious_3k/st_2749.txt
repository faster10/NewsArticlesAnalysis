No , they don t . Jane Philpott , Minister of Health in the new Canadian government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , explained to me that the process of approving Syrian candidates is not so different from our usual vetting process . The whole process , she says , takes a few days , from pre interview by international agencies through security screening in Lebanon , Jordan and Turkey by Canadian officials . Philpott told me that Trudeau had made the 25 , 000 refugee target an important element of the party campaign platform as early as last March . And are the Canadian people nervous ? Not at all , she said . There was a tremendous outpouring of compassion once Canadians understood what was at stake . Philpott is herself a refugee advocate . It has made me very proud of my country . ( Polls in September found that three quarters of Canadians wanted to take more refugees , though by the time the new policy was announced , in November , the mood had shifted , with 51 per cent opposing the policy . )
