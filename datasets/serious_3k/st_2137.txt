A woman who grew up with politics in her backyard is no longer with us , she was a graduate from Harvard and Oxford universities and seeing her go down in a wooden casket was a sight bringing down tears in every eye . We all have to go down the ground one day but being assassinated like this is not something we would want for even our worst enemies . She has left a space that will never be filled in the hearts and minds of the nation . She has enjoyed the position of being the first Muslim woman to lead a country as Prime Minister , but this is over she ' s gone , may Allah ( swt ) have mercy on her soul and she rests in peace in a better place . Ameen .
