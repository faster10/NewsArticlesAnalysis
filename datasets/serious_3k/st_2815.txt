" If you watch that game a couple days ago , that ' s really how they ' ve won most of their games . They look all very similar . A lot of offensive mistakes . I think Kansas City does a great job of protecting the ball and taking advantage of opportunities . They ' ve got a good rush , they ' ve got a good front , and they just force the offense into making a lot of mistakes , and that ' s kind of the mark of a good team . That ' s why they ' re at this point . "
