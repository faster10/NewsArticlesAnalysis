After months of wrangling with agencies responding to the spill , Harris wasn ' t willing to stake the county ' s ecology and economy only on boom that captures or absorbs oil . The commission authorized emergency management teams to add skimmers , barges and extra boom , and an air wall they hope will push the oil away . They plan to layer prevention measures in the pass that connects the Gulf to Choctawhatchee Bay , where fresh and salt water mix and dolphins play . Harris said the plan could cost up to 6 million per month , which he hopes will be covered by money from BP .
