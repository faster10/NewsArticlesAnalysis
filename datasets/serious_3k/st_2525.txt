The CNBC report on Tuesday , which cited unnamed sources , did not disclose a possible sale price for the core Internet unit . Analysts and bankers have estimated it could fetch between 2 billion and 8 billion , with many seeing 4 billion as the likely price , but some regard its value as less than zero . The CNBC report indicated the sale process could take a year or more . But one analyst , Robert Peck with SunTrust , said he expected the company to expedite the process . Three to six months is reasonable , he said , depending on who acquires it .
