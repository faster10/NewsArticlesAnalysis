The Tunisian guy who ran the local fruit n veg stall was pale and bleary eyed as I bought stuff from him . This is a dark day , he said . Not just for Muslims but everybody in Paris . Across the street , in one of the tougher bars of the quartier , a group of North African lads was swigging beer . They were stern and grim faced and I caught the sense that they wanted to be seen doing this , as if to say that all that Islamist murder is nothing to do with us ? we belong here too .
