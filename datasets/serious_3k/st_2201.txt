Starting out the game , we re on the road , you can t turn it over . We turned it over a couple of times and got them going , and then combined it with some really poor communication defensively , Popovich said . Too many errors . They jumped out on us in the first half . We played it much better in the second half , but the first half on the road , that communication has got to be good and it wasn t there . So the defense really let us down in that regard . On the boards , Tristan Thompson was great . He murdered us like he always seems to do . So a combination of the boards and poor communication on D was our demise early .
