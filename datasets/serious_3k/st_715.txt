Once I knew for sure what I wanted to do , I kind of looked at the schedule and didn t want to announce it and have the first game be on the road , Bryant said . I looked at the schedule , and thought , You know , can t wait two weeks . I m not the most patient man in the world , still . When I have my mind made up , I don t want to go on a road trip and wait two weeks and lie about not having my mind made up .
