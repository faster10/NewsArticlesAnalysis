" It ' s definitely the wrong angle because it ' s a make or miss league , " James said before the game , when this premise was raised to him . " You make free throws , I understand , that ' s something that should be fundamental , but it ' s a make or miss league . One thing you can ' t do is build wins and losses on whether the ball goes in or not . What you can build wins or losses on is how hard you ' re playing , how smart you ' re playing the game and how efficient and aggressive that you ' re playing the game . ?
