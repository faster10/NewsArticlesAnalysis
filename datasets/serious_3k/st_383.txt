Mullins : Well for me I never ever felt the ownership or any identity with any community of disabilities . I didn ' t grow up being told that I was a disabled child . After the ' 96 games , and I was competing in Division I track at Georgetown and I was starting to get mainstream press . . . where I ' d be on the cover of a magazine that was heralding my speed and athletic prowess and it would say , " Disabled athlete Aimee Mullins runs faster than most people on the planet with flesh and bone legs . " And I thought how does a journalist miss that , and just casually write " disabled athlete . "
