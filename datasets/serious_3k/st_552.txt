When I got home that morning , there were two messages on my answering machine . The first was from a teen who wanted to remind me what collar stays were ( I expected at least one prank call of that level ) . The second was from what sounded like an older woman who wanted to congratulate me for being a " good sport " and a " gracious loser . " She said that it had to be tough for me to relive an embarrassing moment all over , but incidents like those only make you stronger . And she was right .
