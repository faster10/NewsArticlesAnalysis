" I call it ' The Jordan song , ' " Green said after a rugged game in which he took a shot to the face from Bulls forward Taj Gibson . " Every time I hear it , I think Michael Jordan . ' Number 23 Michael Jordan ' about to be said . So , that ' s what the song is to me . I looked at Steph , and I ' m just like , ' Yo . ' And he looked back , like , ' Man , every time . ' That song gets me every time . "
