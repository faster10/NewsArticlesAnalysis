In my brief search I found just one exception , which expressed clearly : " Either use both first names when addressing a married couple or no first names at all . Avoid the Mr and Mrs John Doe . ( it is old fashioned and usually makes the wife feel owned by her husband ) . " Using no first names on mail addressed to married couples is the tradition I ' ve adopted as an adult , never realizing that both my mother and grandmother find it disrespectful because it ' s not in keeping with traditional rules of etiquette .
