I said that I m not a person that can necessarily be labeled because when I was coming out , I was labeled to guys that no longer are in this league , Carolina s quarterback said . And I didn t mean it to come off as a race thing . I didn t mean it to come off as anybody that s being brash or flamboyant about a specific question . I was just saying facts . I m hoping to be a trailblazer , to give an avenue not only for African American quarterbacks but athletic quarterbacks as well . You can be Caucasian , you can have any type of ethnicity outside of African American , and that s what I was trying to preach .
