Indeed , the most direct measure of electability albeit one that should be interpreted with extreme caution this far from the November election does not suggest that Sanders is less electable on the contrary , he outperforms Clinton against the two leading Republican candidates , Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . Both Democrats beat Donald Trump , but Sanders ' margin is 5 . 3 percent ( 46 . 8 to 41 . 5 ) compared to Clinton ' s margin of 2 . 5 percent ( 45 . 3 to 42 . 8 ) . While Sanders beats Cruz by 45 . 0 to 41 . 7 percent , Clinton actually loses to Cruz 45 . 4 to 46 . 0 percent .
