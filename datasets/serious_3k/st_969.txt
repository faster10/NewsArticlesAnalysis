Don ' t want to give a couple of states all the early voting power , every single election ? A rotating regional primary would break up the U . S . into a few segments and let each take a turn going first . Under perhaps the best known rotating primary plan , put forward by the National Association of Secretaries of State in 2008 , there would be four regions ( East , Midwest , South and West ) , with each taking one primary slot ( in March , April , May or June ) . The order of regions would then rotate in each election cycle .
