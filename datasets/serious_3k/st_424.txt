Gowdy kept saying the hearing wasn t a prosecution , but of course it was . If it weren t why would Boehner pick him , a career prosecutor with no background or experience in or out of Congress in either foreign affairs or defense policy to lead it ? The answer is all too obvious and , under federal law and House rules governing the use of property or staff for partisan politics , also unethical . Maybe someday someone will investigate that . For now it serves to testify not only to the vile tone and blatant partisanship or our politics , but to its sheer , useless emptiness .
