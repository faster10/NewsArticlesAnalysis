" It ' s very impressive , " Walton said . " I don ' t know what to say other than every single night , when it ' s a close game and it ' s time to win , no matter how we ' ve played , our guys step up . They love the moment . They play harder , they make that extra pass , they make that extra rotation . When it ' s winning time , it ' s incredible how good they ' ve gotten at locking and getting the job done . "
