LN : I didn ' t know how , and we all didn ' t know how the world would take this film . It ' s not easy subject matter . It ' s heavy but it ' s beautiful and you hope that people would at least open their eyes to see it and then they did . So my first feeling was relief that it had been so well received and then they just kept receiving it and celebrating it and the conversation has been developing and shifting it ' s been so exciting and for me to be part of that celebration and my work to be lauded in all these ways has been amazing .
