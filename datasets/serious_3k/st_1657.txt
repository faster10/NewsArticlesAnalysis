In March 2007 the jig was up for 24 year old Kentucky man Ryan Jordan . For more than a year he had worked as an editor for Wikipedia , making changes and corrections on thousands of articles and serving as an arbitrator on disputes between authors . His Wikipedia profile described him as a professor of religion at a private university . There didn t seem to be anything out of the ordinary about his work no red flags ever came up . But after one Wikipedia user read a 2006 New Yorker profile of Jordan ? who only went by the pseudonym Essjay , which the magazine also used ? the truth about Jordan s identity began to unravel . Not only was he not a professor with expertise in theology and canon law , but he also never received a PhD , as he had claimed , and often used a book called Catholicism for Dummies as his editing resource .
