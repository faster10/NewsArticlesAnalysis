" Sometimes I ' m nice , sometimes I ' m in a bad mood , " Lawrence said . " Like if I ' m at dinner and I ' m eating and somebody wants me to stand up and take a picture that ' s actually helped with my anxiety , knowing that I don ' t have to say yes and I can say no . . . . It is hard because you don ' t want to feel rude , but at the same time , I have to defend my life and my mental wellness . "
