That ' s hardly sufficient grounds to indict the program . It ' s also hard to imagine Islamic State investing more than two years of a terrorist ' s time trying to con refugee officials when a forged passport could gain instant access ? especially since getting referred for resettlement to the U . S . is like winning a lottery . The U . N . estimates that about 10 of the 3 . 2 million displaced Syrians need resettling , and the Obama administration has offered to take a small fraction ? up to 10 , 000 ? in the next year . Those are pretty long odds to successfully plant a terrorist . And the measure pushed by Congress doesn ' t address the broader reality that the Paris attackers where overwhelmingly French citizens . Would lawmakers bar the door to European tourists as well ?
