In the application he filed to the state ' s Advisory Board of Pardons , Wahlberg states that he has " dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others " and that " receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was . " He claims that , despite his use of racist language , the race of the men was not a motivation for his crime , blaming instead the " influence of alcohol and narcotics . " ( Wahlberg committed the assaults while seeking to steal two cases of beer from Lam ' s convenience store . )
