In 1986 , a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery was sentenced to 32 years in prison for violent sexual assault . Eighteen years later , he was exonerated and released based on new DNA evidence . He filed a 36 million suit against local law enforcement . Less than two years into his freedom , however , Avery was charged with the rape and murder of 25 year old Teresa Halbach . With limited physical evidence , the prosecution based its case largely on the grisly testimony of Avery ' s cognitively delayed teenage nephew , Brendan Dassey . Both were convicted . Avery received a life sentence without possibility of parole and Dassey , a life sentence with a chance of parole after 41 years .
