With Trump and Carson sucking up all the oxygen the last few months , and with the debate stages staying crowded , it might be too much to have expected more from Rubio before now . He s a folk hero now for a certain segment of the right , not just for the Harwood exchange but for also playing off conservatives victimization complex by calling the media a super PAC for Democrats and his disembowelment of Jeb ! Bush . He can ride the anti biased MSM wave for a while , but sooner or later he s going to have to account for his plans without resorting to canned answers in front of friendly crowds . We ll see if he can rise to the occasion .
