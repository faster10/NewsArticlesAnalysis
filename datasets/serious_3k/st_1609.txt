In March , the Supreme Court will decide the fate of the latest threat to this right in Whole Woman ' s Health v . Hellerstedt , a case challenging a Texas law that requires abortion clinics to essentially become mini operating rooms and doctors to obtain admitting privileges at hospitals within 50 kilometres . Every major medical association agrees that these unnecessary hurdles do nothing to advance patient safety and , in fact , harm women , while their true intent is to force abortion clinics to close . If the law is allowed to stand , there will be at most 10 clinics remaining in a state with 5 . 4 million women of reproductive age , and women will be forced to travel hundreds of kilometres to find safe and legal access to abortion ? ? a hurdle that would have made it impossible for me , at 18 , to obtain a legal abortion . And Texas is just one of more than a dozen states that have passed these types of restrictions .
