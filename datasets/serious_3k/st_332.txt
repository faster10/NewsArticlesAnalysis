It s been an honor working with Gary since I joined the Mizzou family , said Rhoades . ? Gary is truly a coaching legend as the winningest coach at two Division I institutions while leaving a profound impact on a countless number of young men . We are extremely appreciative of all that he has done for Mizzou . It s tough emotionally knowing that his fight with cancer is bringing his run to an end sooner than any of us thought . ? I want to commend Gary with how open he s been with me the whole time , from the first day he came to my office in May and told me about his diagnosis , all the way to now and when he met with me personally on October 28th to tell me he d made up his mind . ? He s been nothing but first class in how he s handled the situation the whole way .
