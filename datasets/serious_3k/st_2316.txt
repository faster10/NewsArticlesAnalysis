FLINTOFF : Well , that seems very likely . Russia ' s Ministry of Defense said it ' s been bombing rebel positions in the mountains near where that bomber was shot down , but it looks like Russia ' s also planning to increase its reach into Syria by establishing a second air base . U . S . defense officials are saying anonymously now that Russia ' s begun building a second big airstrip at a base southeast of Homs . And they are saying that base could accommodate another 50 Russian planes , so double the number of Russian planes that are there now and possibly as many as another thousand Russian troops . Of course , so far , Russia ' s not confirming any of this .
