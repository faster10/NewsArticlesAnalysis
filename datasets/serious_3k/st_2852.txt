It ' s unclear from the footage how many of the pieces were originals , versus replicas . Webber said he hoped that some of the items were copies rather than the real thing , but added that at least some of those shown in the video were genuine . " Much of the material in the museums was made out of limestone or fragile stone , so if you threw it to the floor it might look as though it was made of plaster of Paris , but really it ' s just fragile . It ' s tragic to see it . "
