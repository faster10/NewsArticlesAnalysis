HB : " It wasn t bad . The biggest thing has just been getting the ankle right while I m playing . It wasn t a specific rehab period where I was like , I m going to play and practice in this many games . It s like , In this game , you ll play 20 minutes . How does it feel ? Eh , it didn t feel too great . Next night , we ll play you 22 minutes . And we just kind of go that way . The toughest part has been the rehabbing , but it s getting there . "
