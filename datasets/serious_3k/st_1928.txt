The Warriors should feel fortunate to escape with a win after logging just 15 bench points , but their ability to close out a win after an up and down performance speaks to the greatness of Curry , Klay Thompson ( 26 points on 6 of 9 from outside ) , and Draymond Green . The absences of Barnes and Bogut saw Luke Walton opt for variations on the Warriors ' usual crunch time with either center Festus Ezeli or the lengthy Shaun Livingston alongside the aforementioned trio and Andre Iguodala , and the results were not always great . But they found a way regardless and saw the Raptors make their share of mistakes down the stretch .
