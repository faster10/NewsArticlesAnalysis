So , if you ' re still curious " what makes the red man red ? " ( Thanks again , Disney ' s " Peter Pan " ) , all you have to do is go to New York City and see the bevy of Christopher Columbus statues , and then go to Ohio and see the wiggy white men painted in red face at the Cleveland Indians game and then end up back in Landover , Maryland , where the white and black and brown Washington Redskins taunt you , and then still ask : " What ' s the big deal ? "
