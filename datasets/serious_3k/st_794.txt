The Big Cheese Drop in Plymouth , Wisconsin , honors the region ' s history as former home of the National Cheese Exchange , which helped establish cheese prices until 1955 . The 80 pound metal wedge , which is lowered from a 100 foot truck ladder , is dairy free , but organizers hand out complimentary bags of cheese wedges to the first 250 families in attendance . The lowering at the Plymouth Arts Center concludes at 10 p . m . to make it a family friendly affair , but the wine and cheese partying continues into 2016 .
