But jellyfish do other harm , which is only just beginning to be appreciated . They flip the food chain upside down . Normally as you go up the food chain , the energy value increases . For example , shrimp pack more energy than their plankton prey , but big fish that eat shrimp are better still . Hower , jellyfish , a very low energy choice compared with shrimp or fish , are sequestering the higher energy of these species into their own low energy bodies . They are , in essence , spinning gold into straw , or turning wine into water .
