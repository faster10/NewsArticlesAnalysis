Don ' t want your dialog with Siri to be heard ? Go to Settings General Siri and turn on " Raise to Speak . " When enabled , and the screen is on , Siri will start listening when you hold the phone up to your ear as indicated by a chime and she ' ll respond to queries through the iPhone ' s earpiece instead of the external speakers . You might even fool some people into thinking it ' s a real conversation . ( For more Siri tricks and tips , check out my post from last year . )
