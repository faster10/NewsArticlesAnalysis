Celeste , 20 , implicates Judge Baugh ' s unquestioned participation " in a culture where representations of Latinas prioritize sex appeal . Baugh ' s claims speak volumes about the way women of color are hypersexualized . Cherice was only 14 , but when Baugh looked at her he saw someone older who was therefore experienced enough to understand , and even control , a sexual situation . She did not fit his image of ' youth ' and ' purity , ' so this 70 year old Judge did not see a young girl who was victimized , but a sexually viable woman . "
