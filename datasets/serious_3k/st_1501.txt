" I used to come to South by Southwest in the early 2000s every year , and we ' d put on a party for Blogger . It ( SXSW ) always falls on my birthday . So I used to pretend it was my birthday party , because we got Google money to throw around and give everyone free whiskey and beer . And we ' d give out Blogger T shirts , which of course had a B logo , like for Biz . And I ' d say , ' Welcome to my birthday party ! Free whiskey for everyone ! ' "
