The choice of a Saudi diplomat as the plot ' s target is not surprising . Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to put down a rebellion by that island nation ' s majority Shiite population who are tied religiously to Tehran . The Saudi government blames Iran for instigating both Bahraini unrest and Shiite protests in eastern Saudi Arabia . So , the Sunni monarchy in Riyadh has been trying to line up a coalition of Sunni Muslim states to oppose Iran ' s ambitions in the Middle East specifically . The timing of Arbabsiar ' s recruitment for the terror plot suggests the assassination is also in part tit for tat retribution for the Saudi military action against Shiites in Bahrain .
