I thought we were going to have to drag my always up for a good time brother , Prentiss , away from South Beach . This laid back harbor feels like a Northeastern style fishing village , complete with blue clapboard buildings connected by a sprawling weathered deck . It ' s New England meets Caribbean cool , polished with Southern charm . The omnipresent music ranges from Jimmy Buffett and Bob Marley by the DJ to jam friendly local bands . Dancing is optional , but you won ' t want to be the only one left sitting . SouthernLiving . com : Great summer getaway
