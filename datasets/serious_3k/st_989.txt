This ? isn t ? a media story . It s a voter story . ? If the only thing Trump needs to rise in the polls is media attention , he could tap dance or honk someone s boob or get plastic surgery or something . He went this direction because he thinks , almost certainly for a good reason , that the voters who have been playing footsie with Cruz will be excited by this proposal and will go back to supporting Trump . In that sense , he s like every other politician out there , going where the votes are .
