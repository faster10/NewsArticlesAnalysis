Bin Laden also ordered that some of the tens of thousands of documents leaked by U . S . Army Pvt . Bradley Manning to WikiLeaks in 2010 be translated so that al Qaeda could better understand " the enemy ' s policies in the region . " And he suggested that his lieutenants reach out to Ahmed Zaidan , an Al Jazeera reporter based in Pakistan who had interviewed bin Laden in the past , so that he could have plenty of time to prepare a report to mark the 10th anniversary of 9 11 . Bin Laden said he didn ' t want Zaidan to interview any members of his family , but he told his team to get in touch with the reporter " promptly " to get a sense of the questions he wanted bin Laden to answer .
