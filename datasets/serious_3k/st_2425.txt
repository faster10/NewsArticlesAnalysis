" We want to offer our heartfelt thanks and appreciation for everything our brothers in U2 did for us in the aftermath of the November 13 attacks . They reminded us that the bad guys never take a day off , and therefore we rock ' n ' rollers cannot either . . . and we never will , " the band said . " We are incredibly grateful to U2 for providing us the opportunity to return to Paris so quickly , and to share in the healing power of rock ' n ' roll with so many of the beautiful people nos amis of this great city .
