You have to be very careful in how you go after Trump . The attacks on Romney over his Bain Capital days were effective because Romney had presented himself as a genial , good natured Mr Fix It who knew how to run a business and create jobs . In that light , pointing out that his company invested in businesses that outsourced jobs was a stinging hit on Romney s image . Trump , on the other hand , revels in the cutthroat nature of business ? he s most famous for telling people that they ve been fired ? and his image is built around the idea that he s a tough and impossibly shrewd businessman . To that end , he uses the politically thorny aspects of his business record to his advantage .
