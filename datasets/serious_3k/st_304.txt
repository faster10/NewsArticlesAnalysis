Perhaps the league is rushing to copy a model that can ' t be copied . Curry is a revolutionary who makes even the tiniest lineups switch proof stick some ho hum 6 7 wing on him , and Curry is snapping into a step back 3 or blowing by the poor sap on the way to the rim . Green does the rest with expert shooters and playmakers dotting the floor around him . No team has ever had so many high IQ wings , all 6 6 or taller , darting around as part of an unbreakable , always yapping string on defense .
