" You can see it , you can sense it , you can feel it and you know the difference between certain teams in our league , " James said . " For the average fan that doesn ' t know , you just look at a Golden State game and then you can look at a Memphis game . Obviously , Memphis , having Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol , they love to pound it into the post and they like to play at a slower pace real deliberate , get the ball into the post and let guys work off of that .
