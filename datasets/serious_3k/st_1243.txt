The Texas video was the fifth released by the group . Before its release , Melaney Linton , president of the Houston Planned Parenthood clinic , told state lawmakers last summer that it was likely to feature actors ? pretending to be from a company called BioMax ? asking leading questions about how to select potential donors for a supposed study of sickle cell anemia . Linton said the footage could feature several interactions initiated by BioMax about how and whether a doctor could adjust an abortion if the patient has offered to donate tissue for medical research . She also said Planned Parenthood believed the video would be manipulated .
