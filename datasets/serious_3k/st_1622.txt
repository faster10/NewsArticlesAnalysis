One of the many Super Bowl factoids circulated every year has it that 325 million gallons of beer are consumed by Americans on Super Bowl Sunday . That s roughly one gallon for every man , woman , and child in the country . Assuming kids are staying away from the suds ( most of them anyway ) , for this figure to be correct adults would have to drink an average of 1 . 3 gallons of beer , the equivalent of 14 12 ounce bottles , on Super Bowl Sunday . ( Side note : Stay off the roads during and after the Super Bowl broadcast . )
