Over the past several years , actor Charlie Sheen has made headlines for his destructive behavior , short lived marriages and alleged substance abuse . Yet despite the steady drum of rumors and allegations , he continued to show up and dutifully film his TV show , " Two and a Half Men . " That is until he had his meltdown . While the seedlings of chaos began to sprout at the end of 2010 , things took a turn for the worse in early January , when he was rushed to the hospital for " stomach pains . " From there , Sheen became the center of media attention , making news for his bizarre behavior , crazy rants and admittedly addictive catch phrases . There was constant speculation over whether the show would drop him , and he was eventually fired after blasting the show ' s creator . While Sheen has since cleaned up his act , those few months of insanity are ones we won ' t soon forget . Source : People
