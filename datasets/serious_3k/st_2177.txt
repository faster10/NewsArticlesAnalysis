Meanwhile , Chinese punters are looking for respite . Liu Yue , 26 , majored in finance at the University of Liverpool . Sometimes I feel the more economic knowledge I gain , he says , the less I earn from the Chinese stock market . Liu avoided last year s share rout but this week has cost him more than 90 , 000 , including his principal . Still , he isn t pulling out yet . I wish our government would intervene less and deregulate more , he says , and respect the market rules . But can Chinese regulators stop meddling ? The year is early but signs are not promising .
