All of this gets to something important . Sanders and Clinton have real and legitimate differences that don t stem from virtue or villainy as much as they reflect their critically different positions in American political life . After a decade as mayor of a small , liberal city ? where , at most , he needed 7 , 000 votes to hold his seat ? Sanders represented a small , homogenous state on the periphery of American life , first in the House , then in the Senate . And for as much as Vermont has changed partisan hands ? it backed Eisenhower , Nixon , Ford , Reagan , and George H . W . Bush before beginning its blue streak ? it has always been a relatively liberal state , where political tension is more regional and economic ( rural versus urban , labor versus capital ) than ideological or racial , with a liberal Republican political class that endured until liberal Republicanism withered and died in the wake of the Reagan and Gingrich revolutions . Which is to say that , as long as Sanders could straddle the state s divides ( for example , on guns ) and deliver to constituents ? which he did , consistently ? he had space to stand as a uniquely left wing figure in American politics . His incentives never pressed in a different direction .
