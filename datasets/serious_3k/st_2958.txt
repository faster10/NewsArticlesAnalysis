K . government ? and others in future ? to restrict in work benefit payments to EU workers for four years after they come to the country . Mr Cameron wants to make the U . K . a less attractive destination . Key unresolved questions : how long would the brake apply and for how long could it be extended ? The EU is already guaranteeing that the U . K . will qualify for the mechanism . The proposals also include a raft of other measures to allow the U . K . to reduce other benefits ? including slimming child benefit payments .
