Carolina s offensive line has overachieved this season , but its individual members would not fare well in solo matchups against Denver s pass rushers . Left tackle Michael Oher lacks the necessary balance to handle Ware . Left guard Andrew Norwell has improved his lateral agility since his rookie season , but not enough to consistently fend off Malik Jackson , the NFL s most laterally explosive nickel defensive tackle not named Michael Bennett . Center Ryan Kalil would be positioned to help the guards , but the Broncos can use certain front alignments to dictate where that help goes . You can bet they d force it to go to the Trai Turner vs . Derek Wolfe matchup , ensuring single blocking against Jackson . And , of course , there s still right tackle Mike Remmers facing Von Miller . Remmers has risen to big occasions before ( J . J . Watt in Week 2 comes to mind ) , but counting on that to happen again is like trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice , which goes against Coaching 101 .
