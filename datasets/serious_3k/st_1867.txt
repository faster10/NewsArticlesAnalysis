Will . i . am : We were poor . We couldn ' t afford video games . So I would go to my friend Calvin and Douglas ' house to play his Nintendo or Markey ' s house to play the Atari 2600 , Intellivision or Colecovision . We ' d always go to Markey ' s porch , and he used to have them there . We had to pay 15 cents to play one of his games , whether it was Pong or Combat . You remember Combat and having those graphics ? Just think about that . Wow !
