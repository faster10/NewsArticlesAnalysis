Since beating Alabama 9 6 in overtime in Tuscaloosa in 2011 , the Tigers are 0 5 against the Crimson Tide ( which to LSU fans , means against Saban ) , including the rematch later that year in the BCS national championship . And since then , even as Alabama has continued it run near the top of college football and mostly ? atop the SEC West , LSU has clearly slipped . In Miles first seven seasons through 2011 , LSU was 75 18 , with a national championship in 2007 and two SEC titles . Since then , the Tigers are 35 14 and only 19 12 in SEC play .
