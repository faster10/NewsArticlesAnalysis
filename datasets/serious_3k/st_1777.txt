" During the investigation , thousands of birds died of dehydration when there was a water system malfunction that people didn ' t notice for two or three days , " said Paul Shapiro , vice president of the Humane Society of the United States . " Hen ' s legs and wings and more were found stuck inside of the wires of the cages , trapping these animals , preventing them from gaining access to food or water . Some of the floors in these barns were so packed with dead flies that our investigator described the experience as similar to walking on top of Rice Krispies . "
