The directing category had only five slots . Adam McKay , who grew up in Malvern and is better known for writing and directing numskull Will Ferrell comedies , filled one of those with The Big Short , his smart , snappy breakdown of the 2008 housing bubble and ensuing economic collapse . Irishman Lenny Abrahamson received his first Oscar nomination , for the gripping tale of abduction and parenting Room . George Miller got his first directing nod , for his relentless , rip roaring sequel , Mad Max : Fury Road . Tom McCarthy also landed a first directing nomination , for the investigative journalism drama Spotlight .
