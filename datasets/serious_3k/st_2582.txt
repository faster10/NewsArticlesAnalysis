Lucas gave it to them with a movie that used dazzling technology and a cast of young unknowns to tell a good old fashioned adventure story . Star Wars created a whole new world of planets , spaceships , lightsabers and androids , but its characters came straight out of the old Saturday matinees and sci fi flicks that Lucas ? now 71 ? adored as a kid . Mark Hamill s Luke Skywalker was a classic farm boy , albeit one from a dusty planet called Tatooine . Harrison Ford s Han Solo wore the white shirt and vest of every movie pirate since the 1930s . As for Carrie Fisher s Leia Organa , she was literally a princess .
