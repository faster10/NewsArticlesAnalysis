Turning to domestic politics , Hagel echoed Obama s State of the Union plea for less rancour and mutual suspicion during the election campaign . My advice to Mr Trump and all the candidates on both sides is focus on uniting this country , not dividing it , he said . I have been struck in this presidential campaign by the focus of most of the candidates , and most of the ones who are leading , on dividing America . That s dangerous . That s not who we are . I thought President Obama spoke to this pretty well last night . It doesn t solve problems . It exacerbates problems , it deepens problems .
