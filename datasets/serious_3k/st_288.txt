Sure , you ' ve been told to " follow your dreams " and " do something you love , " but it ' s never really that easy , right ? For one Philadelphia native , it was . The Philadelphia 76ers launched a voting contest to name the team ' s new mascot but didn ' t use social media to promote it . So self described " social media sponge " Jerry Rizzo took it upon himself to create Twitter handles for the three mascot finalists . At first , the team shied away from the extra social media help , asking Rizzo to hand over the Twitter handles and back away from Twitter . But the CEO soon realized there was a real opportunity to grow the team ' s social media presence , and ultimately offered Rizzo a social media position with the team . He gladly accepted .
