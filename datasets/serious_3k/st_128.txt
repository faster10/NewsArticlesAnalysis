Christopher : After my next novel for Angry Robot , " Hang Wire " an urban fantasy about ancient gods and serial killers in San Francisco comes my first novel from Tor Books , a dark space opera called " The Burning Dark , " which is about a forgotten war hero , a dead cosmonaut who never existed and a demon from Japanese mythology . That hits in March 2014 . I certainly have more to write in the world of " Empire State " and " The Age Atomic , " but it ' s a case of " watch this space " !
