Trump s much ballyhooed showmanship is just more evidence that , far from leading the troops , he s just doing their bidding . As an entertainer , he knows the secret to playing to a crowd is finding out what they want and giving it to them . One of the things that sets him apart from the other candidates is his accessibility . Most candidates have a layer of people between themselves and the public so ? communicating with the candidate requires setting up carefully prearranged meetings . Trump , on the other hand , is a Twitter obsessive who sits there , no doubt personally much of the time , retweeting stuff directly from his followers . He always reading his audience and tweaking his act to meet their standards .
