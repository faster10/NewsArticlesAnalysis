Then there ' s the serviceable role in the GOP that Carson plays . What other GOP presidential candidate would in their wildest and weirdest dreams ever consider cutting a rap video to promote their candidacy . The idea behind this is to showcase him as a candidate who can relate to the " hood . " This seemingly gives lie to the notion that the GOP is strictly a know nothing party chock full of unreconstructed bigots . The notion of Carson as a presidential candidate touches a deep , dark and throbbing pulse among legions of ultraconservatives who think that Obama and many Democrats are communists , that gays are immoral , and that the healthcare reform law is " slavery , " as Carson infamously quipped , meaning a tyrannical intrusion by big government into Americans ' lives . Mainstream GOP leaders can ' t utter this idiocy . They must always give the appearance that they are above the dirty , muddy , hate slinging fray , so they leave it to a well paid stalking horse like Carson to do their dirty work for them .
