SpaceX failed Sunday in its third attempt to land a Falcon 9 rocket on a barge in the open ocean . The rocket was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and performed well in flight . It approached the floating landing pad off San Diego at a proper touchdown speed , but one of its legs collapsed , causing the Falcon 9 booster to tip over and explode . " Well , at least the pieces were bigger this time , " SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted . SpaceX is developing reusable boosters to reduce the cost of its space missions .
