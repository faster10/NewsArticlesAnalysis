To say expectations will be low for his next debate outing is a gross understatement . Nevertheless , it is not enough to be not awful . He could use some of those forceful moments ? perhaps against someone not as skilled as Sen . Marco Rubio ( R Fla . ) ? that go viral , a confrontation in which he actually prevails . He could take on Trump on immigration or Carson on his plan to vaporize Medicare . But he needs to create ? not just talk about ? the contrast between informed conservative leader and dilettante .
