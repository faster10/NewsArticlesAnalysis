I remember many of my African American relatives and friends who told me they were not going to see " Beloved , " no matter how good it was or who was in it , because they simply did not want to watch a movie about slavery ' s legacy . Some of these same folks , on the other hand , tell me they were psyched about seeing a movie , however " incorrect " on several levels , in which a black ex slave secures freedom for his wife , kills every white man who stands in his way and gets away with it .
