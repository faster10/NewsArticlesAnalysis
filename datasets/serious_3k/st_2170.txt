It was back in mid 2015 that the Oculus was primed for a Q1 2016 release . While it was originaly supposed to be followed soon by the Oculus Touch controller , that ' s reportedly been held up in development . The Rift will instead ship with an Xbox One controller . Be warned however , your everyday gaming PC might not even be able to handle the Oculus ' power . Until technology progresses further along the gradual price degradation scale for at least the next couple of years , Virtual Reality might be limited to gamers willing to invest large sums in high end gaming systems . On the plus side , a lot of major game developers are already working on choice titles custom built for VR compatibility , so you ' re likely to be spoiled for choice by then .
