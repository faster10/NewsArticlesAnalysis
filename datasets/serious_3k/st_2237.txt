One of the explanations could be the multiplicity of threats . You know that since the Charlie Hebdo attack , five major terrorist attacks have been prevented by the French security service . You have to know that also more than 10 , 000 people are considered suspects by the French domestic intelligence service . Watching 10 , 000 people at the same time is not a simple issue to do . In addition to this , as the first results of the investigation have shown , two of the attackers were able to present themselves as refugees coming from Syria who went through Greece . Therefore , they played with this game of identities . We can assume that in many cases you had terrorists who came to Europe as false refugees from Syria .
