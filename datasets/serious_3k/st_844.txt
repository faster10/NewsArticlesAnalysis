In preparation for the Games , the tributes are assigned a mentor someone from their District who fought , and won , a previous competition . Katniss ' s mentor is an aging , washed out , often drunk man named Haymitch . At first Katniss worries that he ' ll do more harm than good , and he does have some untraditional training methods . But at the end of the day he turns out to be an intelligent , clever guide and an advocate for Katniss and her other District competitor , Peeta . Apply this knowledge to your own work situation . Oftentimes it ' s hard to talk to your manager , because you don ' t want to compromise your working relationship . Instead , seek out someone in your office whom you admire and can learn from but don ' t necessarily work with on a day to day basis . Invite him or her to coffee , and explain that you ' re looking to expand your internal network and learn from others who have different roles within the company . Chances are he or she would be happy to serve as your mentor and would likely find the relationship mutually beneficial . Having someone outside of your team that ' s on your side and willing to advocate for you may prove valuable , should you have issues with your boss or your job down the road .
