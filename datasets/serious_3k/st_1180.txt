Oh , yeah . My kids are grown , and I feel that I can afford the time to just be a little , you know , a little more experimental about what I do with my time away from the movies and the TV shows , which are still my main drive . James Murphy just came through this project , Canon ' s Imagination . This is year two of that , and last year we did it and my daughter Bryce directed the film , and people send in pictures targeting their own photographs for certain narrative categories . And then the public votes and they narrow it down to 10 , and last year I chose one from each category and handed it over to Bryce and she had to direct a movie . And it was successful . It was a great creative experiment . With James Murphy , we wanted somebody from the music world , and of course he ' s so creative and visual and a really talented and intelligent guy . So I ' m actually dying to see what he does with this exercise . I think I ' m going to be inspired by him . Theoretically , I ' m supposed to be offering some guidance and support , but I think he ' s one of the ones I ' m sort of most curious about seeing work with this whole program .
