" Let me state clearly : your relations with those two countries are a matter for you and you alone . But let me also say we , like you , want a Pakistan that is stable , democratic and free from terror . We , like you , want an Afghanistan that is secure , free from interference from its neighbors and not a threat to our security . We , like you , are determined that groups like the Taliban , the Haqqani network or Lashkar e Tayyiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on Indian and British citizens in India or in Britain . Neither should they be able to do so against our people , whether soldiers or civilians , from both our countries who are working for peace in Afghanistan . Our interests are your interests , so let us work together to realize them . "
