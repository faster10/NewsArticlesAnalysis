She added , This is a difficult vote . This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make . Any vote that may lead to war should be hard , but I cast it with conviction . My vote is not , however , a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or for unilateralism or for the arrogance of American power or purpose . A vote for the resolution , she argued , is not a vote to rush to war it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of our president . And we say to him : Use these powers wisely and as a last resort .
