" You try to do your part and contribute , " Manning said . " When you ' re not able to contribute because you can ' t participate , you try to be patient to work yourself back into your position to be able to participate and try and make a contribution .

It ' s a great honor to be going back to the Super Bowl , playing in Super Bowl 50 .
