Dimitrov , to his credit , dug in . He pushed Federer around the baseline and grabbed the second set , 6 3 . Nerves can be an issue for an aging champion , for he knows that his opportunities for further glory are shrinking fast . But no matter how hard Dimitrov pushed him , Federer stayed as cool as if it were 2006 . He almost seemed to relish responding to Dimitrov at full flight . ( Before the match , Federer , the most determined attacking player in the sport today , described defense as " the base " of his game . ) In the third set , the teeter totter quickly flipped back , with Federer jumping out to a 3 0 lead . He took it 6 1 and closed out the match in a tight fourth set .
