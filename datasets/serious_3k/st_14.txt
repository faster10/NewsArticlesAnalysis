A couple of guys are banged up on this road trip we needed a couple of guys to step up , he said . It feels good to get it going myself . For me , it s that familiarity , the more you touch the ball , you re ready to go . I just got a long stretch in the second half where I got to kind of catch the ball and move it a couple of times and get into that rhythm and flow . And once the ball comes back to you , you can make something happen . That s a big part of it .
