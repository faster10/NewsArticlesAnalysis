Why they ll win : The Bengals ' defense can match up with the Steelers . They allowed a 79 passer rating , fifth best in the NFL . The Bengals got 21 interceptions and allowed just 18 touchdowns . Between Carlos Dunlap and Geno Atkins , Cincinnati can rush the quarterback very well too . Roethlisberger threw just one touchdown in 84 attempts against Cincinnati , with four interceptions . He didn ' t throw for 300 yards in either game . The Bengals aren ' t going to shut out the Steelers or anything , but they should feel good about at least limiting Roethlisberger and his crew . ?
