HB : I am afraid I completely disagree with that . If it is moral leadership , why didn t she ask the German people if they really want to accept one million migrants into this country ? This has happened in the last month , 300 , 000 migrants have not even registered . They are in Germany , somewhere , we don t know where , we don t know what they are doing . People are distressed the communities have to deal with this . And they are at a breaking point . So , moral leadership I don t think so .
