The other cost is time . The X Men movies are huge productions that block out months of an actor ' s calendar . Making another long term commitment to the franchise also means saying no to other , slightly more nuanced characters that come down the pike . And as a capital A Actor , Jackman is in his prime , at the perfect leading man age when glorious good looks are knocked slightly askew by just the right weight of world weariness . Since joining the X Men , he ' s mixed in a few interesting performances The Prestige , The Fountain but you can ' t help but wonder about all the roles he had to turn down because Wolfie had to be fed . ( Psst , Chicago and Drive . . . ) Fox will certainly make it worth his while , but does Jackman really want to be 49 or 50 and giving a variation of the same Wolverine interview where he ' s describing his calorie intake ?
