McDermitt : I knew the comic but hadn ' t read it . Once I found out who it was I was playing , I went back and quickly caught up . It was very informative to see the choices ( creator Robert ) Kirkman made that they didn ' t necessarily go with ( on ) the show . I was able to bring some of that from the comics into the character and that brings something to what we ' re doing . I had to put it down for a while , because I was afraid I would influence it too much . I was a giant fan of the show and didn ' t want to be the one that ruined it . ( laughs )
