The Popes of Blackness rarely agree on anything . One thing is certain Davis takes on a difficult role and breathes life into a hero who is inspiring , enraging , familiar and extraordinary . It is odious that the nominating committee gravitates to black people playing into conventional stereotypes . Nevertheless , that is not Viola Davis ' fault . Given the state of the union , I think most any actor would be lucky to get work as a tree , forget about the layered role of a conflicted domestic in America ' s civil rights era South . It is an incredible part , and Davis nails it . Not everyone is happy about that .
