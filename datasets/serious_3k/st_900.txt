All this said , this is not 1999 . When then Defense Minister Mordechai left the Likud , he joined a cascade of respected , veteran leaders who had broken with the young , brash and inexperienced Prime Minister . Fast forward to today , and it is the veteran Netanyahu , a steady hand and a known commodity ( for better or worse ) who is firing a brash , inexperienced Lapid in the name of proper governance . The reality is that while public opinion currently holds Netanyahu at fault for the political crisis , it remains at a loss as to who might replace him .
