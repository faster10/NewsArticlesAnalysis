All is well in your government . There cannot be a cry go out for freedom , or for property rights , state sovereignty , local government closet to the people ? government by the people ? for the people . No , we cannot allow policing power be in the hands of We the People s elected county Sheriff . We the great bureaucracies rule and have unlimited power over these lands . We can buy up everything and every man s soul with their own money and with their 18 trillion dollar debt . We are prospering . We own the state government and their land . We buy and control their schools and their sheriff . We control the water in the river and under the earth . We control the airways , even the signals that pass around the world . We , the bureaucrat , are the supreme .
