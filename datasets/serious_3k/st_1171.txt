New York Giants : No , no , no , no , no . Just no . Not this time . The 2015 Giants are not the 2007 or even the 2011 Giants , and the 2015 Patriots are not slipping up here . We can fully respect Tom Coughlin ' s history against Bill Belichick and Eli Manning ' s history against Tom Brady and still believe Brady will eat up the worst defense in the league ( 422 . 8 yards allowed per game ) on this particular Sunday . And while Manning was able to stay with Drew Brees on his historic day in New Orleans two weeks ago , the difference here is the Patriots have a defense that can stop teams . Patriots 42 , Giants 28 . Dan Graziano
