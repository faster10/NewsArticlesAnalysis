It is impossible to say which of these scenarios is most likely . The prosecutor would not and could not have filed charges if she believed that Martin simply attacked Zimmerman , who fired because he reasonably feared for his own life .

One possibility , admittedly speculative , is that the prosecutor concluded that Zimmerman illegally confronted the victim with a weapon without just cause , and that that criminal act led to the shooting .
