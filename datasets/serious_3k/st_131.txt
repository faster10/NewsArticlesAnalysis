OBAMA , WITH NO ELECTIONS LEFT TO LOSE , DROPS MENTION OF FOSSIL FUELS : President Obama ' s final State of the Union address made no mention of an " all of the above " energy policy , nor of natural gas or fracking , and it only mentioned oil to either criticize it or point out how much less the U . S . is importing . As Pro ' s Andrew Restuccia and Elana Schor report , instead of playing to the masses , Obama whacked climate deniers , saying , " You ' ll be pretty lonely , " while praising his administration ' s achievements in joining the world in an agreement to curb greenhouse gases , and for increasing renewable generation . And , as if that weren ' t enough , he all but announced the arrival of new climate change fighting policies that are likely to make production of fossil fuels more expensive .
