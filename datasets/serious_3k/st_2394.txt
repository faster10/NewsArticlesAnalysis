The Eastern Conference champions are probably going to get a whole lot better in the next few days . We can refocus on not just on winning games but how we re playing . Curry added , I could ve had a different perspective and said , I want to get everything that I could get , wait it out , test free agency that next year ? and who knows what would ve happened ? But tonight it didn t go our way . But ending up with our first loss , you can kind of appreciate what we were able to accomplish .
