In addition to winning the show , Pope , 23 , is still coming to grips with the fact that she sang " I ' m With You , " one of her " all time favorite songs , " with its original vocalist , Avril Lavigne . Pope has long admired the Canadian singer . " She ' s always had that thing about her that always spoke to me , which is being who she is and not apologizing for it , " explains Pope . " That ' s something that I have trouble with , honestly . I do care about what people think about me sometimes , and sometimes it affects me in a negative way . Her music has always been there to remind me to not care what other people think and be myself . "
