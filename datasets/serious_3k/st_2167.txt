It s not an overstatement to say that Netflix has transformed how we watch television ? the platform has grown almost 10 fold in users since 2000 , and reportedly accounts for 36 . 5 pc of all Internet traffic during prime time ? twice that of its closest competitor , YouTube . In 2014 , it brought in 5 . 5bn in revenue , more than HBO s 5 . 4bn , albeit with a much slimmer profit margin . Over the last year , the company s international audience has been the biggest driver of user growth ? more than 35 pc of subscribers are currently non US , and the percentage is going up .
