" If I asked you what most defines Donald Trump supporters , what would you say ? They ' re white ? They ' re poor ? They ' re uneducated ? You ' d be wrong . In fact , I ' ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump ? and it ' s not race , income or education levels : It ' s authoritarianism . That ' s right , Trump ' s electoral strength ? and his staying power ? have been buoyed , above all , by Americans with authoritarian inclinations . And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate , among Democrats as well as Republicans , it ' s very possible that Trump ' s fan base will continue to grow " : ?
