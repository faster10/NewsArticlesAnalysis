My purpose in life is to provide women in need options for a better product and or create and develop a product that meets the specifications of each and every woman no matter their size , amount of area , or specific shade or hue . That is why I created a breast prosthesis called AugMe that focuses on specific color matching and contours from skin to prosthesis . I work for a large media corporation so my insurance paid for the custom prosthesis that cost 4 , 000 . However , for those women who don ' t have private insurance , Medicare does not cover custom breast prosthesis . Until Medicare changes their policy to cover custom breast prosthesis , there will be little demand for AugMe or any other custom product . I have now joined forces with Dr Susan Cassidy , the CEO of another custom prosthetic company , CountourMed , to hopefully change Medicare ' s policy . We are currently awaiting their decision after presenting letters from breast cancer professionals and organizations as well as seeking congressional attention .
