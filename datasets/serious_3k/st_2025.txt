A Missouri state task force recently approved a 1 . 1 billion stadium plan north of downtown St . Louis that asked for 300 million from the NFL , 250 million from the Rams , 150 million from St . Louis , and the state contributing the rest , about 400 million . The Chargers have squabbled with the city of San Diego for more than a decade about getting public money for a stadium , but the city has a proposal that could be voted upon this summer if the Chargers opt not to join the Rams in Los Angeles . The city of Oakland has never submitted a formal stadium proposal .
