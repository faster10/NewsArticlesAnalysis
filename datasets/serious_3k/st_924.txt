" So without a song or a script I am stepping onto a stage that we all share : the mystery of life . While in Tucson we set up some amps and drums in the garage . . . We just did what we have always done , only this time there was no stage . There were no spotlights and no audience . We made music every day for a week . . . just for us . For the joy of making music . For the joy of being together . For all of the reasons I ever picked up a guitar or sang a tune in a Fargo , N . D . garage back in ' 59 . I have truly come full circle ! We played songs I grew up with , songs the kids grew up with , songs we wrote , songs that had meaning and memories for us all . No agenda , no set list , no tickets to sell . . . This was all we have ever done , and all we could do . So we did it . "
