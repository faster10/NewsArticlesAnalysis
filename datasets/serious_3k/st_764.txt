How about that Giants pass rush ? Robert Ayers has been by far their best performer with an 83 . 3 out of 100 , which according to PFF grades as a high end starter but not quite a Pro Bowler . Next best is Cullen Jenkins with 70 . 2 , which would grade him as borderline starter . George Selvie and Kerry Wynn are 1 2 on the team in number of snaps on passing downs , but their pass rush grades are 44 . 2 and 41 . 7 respectively ? replaceable , according to PFF s grading scale . The Giants also just lost their highest graded defensive tackle , Johnathan Hankins , for the rest of the season . Jay Bromley ( 69 . 7 pass rush grade ) is likely to step into Hankins role .
