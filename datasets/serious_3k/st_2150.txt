Along the way what happens to our bodies and minds astonishes and horrifies us and sometimes it s easier to simply not look . Weiland was always among the prettiest , the skinniest , the most Bowie besotted , the most conscious of his rock star status rock star . Vanity kills It don t pay bills , ABC once sang . I once interviewed Scott for Spin . It was , if you can believe it , via fax ( I still have the sheet with his handwritten answers ) and he confessed that Bowie was his man , which is ironic since Bowie is probably rock s greatest survivor and slipperiest character , whereas Weiland only barely escaped the 90s as part of the supergroup Velvet Revolver and some STP reunions .
