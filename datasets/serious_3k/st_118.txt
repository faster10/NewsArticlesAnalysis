In reinventing Bush as a badass , campaign consultants may be trying too hard . What s good about Bush can t be improved by undoing what s good about him . When people say he appears weak , they may be simply observing who Bush is . Not so much weak as a good , mid 20th century WASP who was raised properly , is polite and considerate , knows not to interrupt or raise his voice ? and is , therefore , completely out of place in a presidential race in a post Bush , post WASP , Kardashian world .
