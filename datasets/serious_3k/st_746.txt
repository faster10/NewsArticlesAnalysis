In a written statement , a spokesman for the Orange County Public Schools said Burruto was treated like any other player . " Anthony was given the same opportunity as all other students to try out for the Dr Phillips High School baseball teams , " wrote Dylan Thomas . " He was among 63 student athletes who were evaluated for a position on either the varsity or junior varsity squads . With only 40 roster spots , Anthony and 22 other students did not make either team . As a sophomore , Anthony has the chance to vie for a position on a school team again next year and we hope he will . "
