In three days , I could not walk . I was blind , paralyzed , unable to talk or eat . I had a sore throat , body aches and my whole body itched . Blood started coming out of my eyes . I couldn ' t sleep . I was awake with pain all of the time . Once , my soul left my body . I saw my body lying down . I almost went insane . I thought , I am going to die , I will not make it . Every single day I cried . Ebola is a very dangerous disease .
