CARIG : Mets captain David Wright emerged as one of the brightest stories of the season , returning from a long layoff brought on by his diagnosis of spinal stenosis . This offseason , he ' s due to continue back rehab . From now until the end of his career , he and the Mets must walk a careful balance , adhering to a strict pre game regimen while Wright must be honest about his own physical state . This is all the more reason that the Mets will look to protect themselves with strong options at third base . Murphy could fit in such a role if he were to return . Wilmer Flores could do the same . But it ' s more likely the Mets re sign free agent Kelly Johnson , who could offer insurance at third base while also seeing time at second base if Dilson Herrera isn ' t ready to take the spot out of spring training .
