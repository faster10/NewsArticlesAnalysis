' I missed my 50th and everything because I had to feed him . I was also supposed to go on holiday to celebrate it but we needed to be here for Thomas . . It ' s worth it though . I was a lost cause and doctors told me I was in a worse state that they had seen for a long time . But I made it though and Thomas is the same . If there is a chance , you have to fight , whether it is for your cat , your dog or you family member . '
