Hope , not walls , is the best protection against terrorism , says Jamal Nassar , a political scientist at California State University at San Bernardino , who was born in Jerusalem two years before Israel was founded in 1948 . You cannot build a wall around the world . People will find a way , tunnel under walls , fly over . They will find a way if they are determined to bring about violence . Conversely , Nassar says , when there is light at the end of the tunnel , people will move forward and try to improve their lives .
