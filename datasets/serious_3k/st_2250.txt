The MSNBC Telemundo Marist poll also finds that a generic Democratic presidential is tied with a generic Republican at 45 45 , while that lead expands to 20 points among Latino voters , 56 36 . To put these Latino poll numbers into perspective ( the poll had an oversample of 264 Latino voters ) , Barack Obama defeated John McCain among Latinos by 36 points in 2008 , 67 31 . And he beat Mitt Romney by 44 points in 2012 , 71 27 . While this is just one poll , it should produce a little caution in Democratic circles that Democrats will need to boost these Latino numbers to win in 2016 .
