The Losers are some kind of CIA black ops squad , but only for a nanosecond . There are five of them , each with his own wardrobe fetish and each with a prescribed skill set : Clay is the leader ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan from " Watchmen " ) , and he looks good with one shirt tail hanging out . Jensen ( Chris Evans ) is tech support and comic relief in a series of nasty T shirts . Cougar ( Oscar Jaenada ) is a sniper and never separated from his cowboy hat . Pooch ( Columbus Short ) is the driver and family man . Roque ( Idris Elba , aka Stringer Bell from " The Wire " ) is second in command , a knife expert with a scar down his cheek .
