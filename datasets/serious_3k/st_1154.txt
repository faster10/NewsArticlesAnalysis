A 20 year old man asked the advice site Go Ask Alice , Does the fact that I enjoy stimulating my anus while masturbating have anything to do with my sexual orientation ? The answer : When touched or massaged , the prostate ? about a half inch inside the opening of the anus ? is a spot in men s bodies that heightens sensations during many a male masturbation session , including at the time of orgasm . Why here ? This area is kind of like the Space Shuttle launch pad : it s where the fluids of ejaculation gather just before they take off up the shaft of the penis .
