In which Beyonce sings , Avicii program some electronics and Chris Martin sings now I m feeling drunk and high , so high , so high several times . OK , now it s a party . Bey s vocals pop up at the start ( she provides her own backing vocals , like a one woman Destiny s Child ) and in the chorus ( actually , all the way through ) but this is not a duet , sadly . It is unexpectedly poppy , and radio likes nothing more than party songs about multi millionaires being drunk and high in the chorus . If you liked Coldplay s Rihanna collaboration Princess of China , you ll like this . If you liked your Coldplay in stadium rock mode , maybe not so much .
