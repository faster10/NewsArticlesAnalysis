That " pretty compelling reason " might be introducing Wolverine to some new super friends , like the Avengers . The razor sharp comic book character first appeared in a 1974 Hulk comic and he later joined forces with the Avengers in print . The only thing standing in the way of some X Men Avengers movie synergy is studio politics . ( Fox licenses the X Men characters from Marvel , which is now owned by Disney . ) When asked recently about that crossover opportunity by Collider , Jackman was more than enthusiastic , claiming that he ' d even inquired to Marvel about that possibility . " I understand at Marvel they ' ve got The Avengers , they ' ve got a lot of big things going on , but at some point I just find it almost impossible that there ' s not a way to bring Iron Man , all the Avengers characters , Wolverine , the X Men characters , Spider Man , and somehow get them in together , " he said . " I ' m in for it , I ' m totally up for it because I think that would be really exciting for fans across the board . "
