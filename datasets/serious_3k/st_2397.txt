And there s a lesson for our ruling class there : Calling Trump a fascist is a bit much ( fascism , as Tom Wolfe ? once reported , is forever descending upon the United States , but somehow it always lands on Europe ) , but movements like fascism and communism get their start because the mechanisms of liberal democracy seem weak and ineffectual and dishonest . ? If you don t want Trump ? or , perhaps , some post Trump figure who really is ? a fascist ? to dominate things , you need to stop being weak and ineffectual and dishonest .
