The whistle blew before Amendola caught the pass . In the ESPN booth , former official Gerry Austin said that if the whistle blew before the pass was caught , the play was a " do over . " Not only did the officials blow a whistle by mistake , they got the part about when it was blown wrong too . Steratore , in a pool report after the game , said that the officials huddled and determined that Amendola had caught the ball before the whistle blew . Had the officials correctly determined that the whistle blew with the ball in the air , the down would have been replayed . Steratore also explained that the line judge " lost track of maybe where the ball was at that point and almost by its own definition , inadvertently blew the whistle . "
