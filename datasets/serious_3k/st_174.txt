But they were connected through Mexican actress Kate del Castillo . She ' s famous on both sides of the border . And if you ever watch that TV show " Weeds , " she was Pilar in that . She also starred in a Telemundo hit as a cartel leader in a series called " La Reina Del Sur , " " The Queen Of The South . " And she caused quite a stir . In 2012 , she actually posted on social media what was interpreted as an open sympathetic letter to Chapo Guzman . Reportedly he read that post and through lawyers began corresponding with her . He wanted her to produce a film about his life story .
