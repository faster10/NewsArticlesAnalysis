' You can look at the fact the club had three coaches before I arrived but I ' ve never been one to worry about what may happen tomorrow , just try and control today . I was excited not worried . I knew there would be little money , that I couldn ' t bring my own staff but fortunately after a few days I found I was working with quality people . I ' m confident I can make any team better . I ' ve lived with pressure since I was 18 . My family instilled the same principles , there ' s no magic formula , just a belief that if you work hard , life will treat you well . '
