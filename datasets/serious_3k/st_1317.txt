Had the 747 in Wichita tried landing on a runway as short as the one the much smaller 737 touched down on over the weekend , I don ' t think it could have stopped in time to avoid going off the end and at the very least wrecking the airplane . Modern airliners have two things going for them " great brakes and powerful reverse thrusters " and in the case of both the 737 and the 747 before it , it was a good thing they did . I wasn ' t there to witness either event , but I ' d be shocked if the smell of superheated brake pads wasn ' t in the air .
