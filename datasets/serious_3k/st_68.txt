The more concerning injuries for the Vikings are still among the defensive linemen . Defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd ( knee ankle ) missed last Sunday s game and will miss a second another this week in Chicago . Also unavailable Sunday will backup defensive end Justin Trattou ( foot ) . He hasn t played since Week 2 , but before the week s practices began he hoped to get on the practice field at some point . It did not happen . Floyd s backup , Tom Johnson ( knee ) , was a full participant at all three practices this week and is listed as probable for Sunday s game against the Bears .
