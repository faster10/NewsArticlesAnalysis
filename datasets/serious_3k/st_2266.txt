A spokeswoman for GE did not comment directly about Warren s past criticism and how it might affect GE s dealings in Massachusetts . Instead , the spokeswoman , Jennifer Erickson , said in a statement : We value our relationships with elected leaders at all levels wherever we have a presence and look forward to working more closely with Senator Warren , Senator Edward J . Markey , Governor Charlie Baker , and other Massachusetts officials . That said , the city itself ? its universities , its workforce , and its commitment to innovation ? were the determining factors in our decision to locate our new headquarters in Boston .
