Obviously , these aren t simple cast offs . Sia has co written Diamonds for Rihanna , Pretty Hurts for Beyonc , among others . She co wrote the first single Alive with Adele and Tobias Jesso Jr . , for possible use on record breaking Adele s 25 . You can hear how Adele would have made this work , another empowering tale of survival after heartbreak with huge emotional swings . But it s the edge in Sia s voice , on lines like You took it all , but I m still breathing , that makes the song a success .
