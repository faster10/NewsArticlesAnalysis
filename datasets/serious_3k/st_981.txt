According to Matthew 16 : 17 20 , Jesus said to Peter : " Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah , for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood , but by my Father in heaven . And I tell you that you are Peter , and on this rock I will build my church , and the gates of Hades will not overcome it . I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven . "
