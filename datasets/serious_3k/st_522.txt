This postfeminist approach is by no means anti feminist . Rather , it draws on a model of women s liberation that thrived in the past , lives in the hearts of most Americans and is ripe for resurgence : equity feminism . Equity feminism stands for the moral , social and legal equality of the sexes ? and the freedom of women ( and men ) to employ their equal status to pursue happiness as they define it . It s the feminism of anyone who has said , I m not a feminist , but . Equity feminism does not view men and women as opposing tribes . Theories of patriarchal oppression are not among its founding tablets . Put simply , equity feminism affirms for women what it affirms for everyone : dignity , opportunity and personal liberty .
