The photos don ' t represent the standards or the training or the values of the United States armed forces . Our soldiers and our leaders know you don ' t pose with dead enemy bodies , and there ' s a lot of other things that you don ' t do . We maintain these standards . I think the men and women of the armed forces have done a remarkable job , our leadership has done a remarkable job . No one ever expected when this conflict started that we ' d be in it almost 11 years later , a volunteer army would have held together and done so very well . This is an exception , and I know the military will take their proper measures .
