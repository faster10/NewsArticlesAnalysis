Since 2008 , folks in Vincennes , Indiana , have celebrated New Year ' s Eve and their locally renowned melons with a Watermelon Drop . But instead of slowly lowering a glittering sculpture of a melon ( boring ! ) , they drop a bunch of actual watermelons that plummet toward the ground and burst open upon a raised wooden " splatform " ( haha ) . A crane hoists the melons inside the event ' s centerpiece , an 18 foot wooden watermelon that looks like a green blimp , before letting them fly at midnight . Cheers and fireworks follow .
