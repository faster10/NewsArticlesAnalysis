I still feel like I can match it with the best guys in the world out there , Hewitt said . If you didn t get old then I d obviously love to keep playing . The adrenalin rush , the buzz and the goose bumps that you get from coming out ? and for me playing in Australia in front of my home crowd , that s the biggest thing I m going to miss from the game . I just love doing it , I love competing , I love pushing myself and I ve had one hell of a ride .
