As usual , Apple teed off its announcements with happy recent stats . I was aware that the Mac has outpaced the rest of the PC industry in sales growth for years , but I didn ' t know that the MacBook is the best selling notebook line in the U . S . , and the iMac is the best selling desktop . Those achievements are more evidence that Apple ' s Mac strategy build premium machines , sell them profitably and don ' t obsess over market share doesn ' t mean that it can ' t end up with impressive market share anyhow .
