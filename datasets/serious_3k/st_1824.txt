String out Derrick Henry : If Henry is running north south , he s going to break one ( or two ) . He s done it against every team he s played . A defense has its best chance of success against him if it can get him moving along the line of scrimmage looking for a hole rather than finding one , however small , right after taking the handoff and crashing through . If Clemson s All American DE Shaq Lawson can t go , it s not a good thing , but it might encourage Alabama to attack more toward the edge of the line . That provides a sliver of a chance for Clemson to string Henry
