Key player : No need to get cute here , everyone knows that it ' s McCarron . McCarron hasn ' t been bad , with a 97 . 1 rating . He hasn ' t thrown an interception in three starts , though he lost a costly fumble in overtime at Denver . He has looked very confident and he won ' t be scared by starting a playoff game , not after the big games he started at the University of Alabama . He ' ll need to make a few plays , but the Bengals don ' t need him to carry the offense . He just needs to have a solid , mistake free night .
