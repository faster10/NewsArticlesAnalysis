( Side note : Trump is not the next president . Those worried he could be don ' t have enough faith in conservatives . And more debates that let Sen . Marco Rubio and business executive Carly Fiorina shine , and that let them and the others talk , should make it clear Trump is not the guy . He has , however , done a good , if unintentional , job bringing up issues we need to discuss and calling attention to the character traits we expect ? and won ' t tolerate ? in a president . )
