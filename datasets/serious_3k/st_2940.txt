TONY ROMO WAS THE REAL MVP OF THE LEAGUE LAST SEASON . HIS STATS WERE BETTER THEN RODGERS . YOU PEOPLE ARE SO DUMB . COWBOYS WOULD 6 AND 1 OR 7 ZND 0 IF ROMO WAS THE QB . COWBOYS LOST BY 7 LOST BY 1 LOST BY 3 LOST BY 6 THEY DIDN T GET BLOWN OUT EXCEPT FOR THE PATS GAME . SO YEAH I CAN SEE THE COWBOYS WINNING OUT I COULD ALSO SEE 6 AND 1 . THE COWBOYS WHEN FULLY HEALTHY ARE THE BEST TEAM IN THE NFC . They are the best in the east when healthy . You all will be crying when the Cowboys punch there ticket into the post season cause the Giants can t close them out . You haters will be the league is rigged . There is no way the Cowboys should be in the playoffs . Cause 8 and 8 will win the east this season
