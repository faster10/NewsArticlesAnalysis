" My memories of growing up in St Petersburg are very positive . I grew up without parents , but with my grandfather . But I didn ' t feel that I was really abandoned I had enough love from him . During the week I was in the boarding school and when I came home every weekend I had fun with my friends . I was not cold in winter I ' m telling you this because many people expected that I suffered from hunger . The Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s was OK . Of course I didn ' t have the luxury that children have today , but I had freedom . I had time to read which was very important generally for Russian children . It gave me a sense of the wide world and gave me a wish to see the world . "
