Pope Francis made his decision to visit Lampedusa after hearing about the deaths of refugees whose boat capsized off the coast of Sicily in late June . Several of the refugees clung to the fishing nets of a Tunisian flagged vessel before the fishermen cut the nets loose , sending at least 10 people to their death . Many of the bodies were never recovered . " When , a few weeks ago , I heard the news which unfortunately has been repeated so many times the thought always returns as a thorn in the heart that brings suffering , " Francis said . " And then I felt that I ought to come here today to pray , to make a gesture of closeness , but also to reawaken our consciences so that what happened would not be repeated . "
