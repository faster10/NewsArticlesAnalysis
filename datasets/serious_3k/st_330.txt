" Why would we come at the police in a disrespectful way when we work with the police in the community all of the time ? " Cook said . " The police are up here every day . There were four police cars here this morning when I pulled into work . The police have picnics during the summer in our parking lot where they bring their kids and children to meet and greet and have fun with us . So why would I disrespect a group of men that we have complete respect for in the community that helps us every day ? "
