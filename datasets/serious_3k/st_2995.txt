Over the past few years , Republicans in Ohio have shown themselves to be quite adept at offending voters . They did very well in the state ' s midterm elections two years ago . After regaining total control of the Ohio government , they passed a bill restricting the collective bargaining rights of nearly all public employees not only teachers and other government workers , as had been the case in Wisconsin , but also police and firefighters . The bill was overwhelmingly defeated when placed on the ballot in November 2011 , and the anti Republican momentum generated by the legislation rolled into this year ' s presidential contest .
