Ebola is also demonic because of the stigmatization you face as a survivor . I always try to stay positive , even though it is hard for me , physically and emotionally . After surviving , I returned to work in the same hospital ward where I worked before , treating Ebola patients and giving them hope . I tell them I was a victim of Ebola , and I survived . When they refuse medication , I make an example of myself . I say , " I want you to do the same thing to be like me . "
