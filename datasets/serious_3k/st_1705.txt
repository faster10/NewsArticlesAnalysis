It took a little longer than that with considerably harder graft but considering some feared we had seen the last of Tiger , this was a tentative return to form . If there was a turning point , it came at the 11th on day one , when he missed the green right and saved par with a quite fabulous chip . Anyone who had the chipping yips , it was said , would still be there now , trying to get up and down . Woods would have known the world was watching his every tic , too . His golf has not been without flaws since , not least his driving , but his short game was a weapon around Augusta , as it once was .
