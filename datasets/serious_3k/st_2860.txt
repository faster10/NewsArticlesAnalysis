Oddly enough , the best moments are darker ones . " Princess of China " is a ballad about loss and regret , co starring Rihanna . It ' s a partnership that probably came together over champagne brunch at Jay Z ' s , but its synth fuzz groove is offhandedly seductive . It ' s followed by " Up in Flames , " a minimalist slow jam . Martin sings nakedly about how breakups can feel like the end of the world , or maybe it ' s about the actual end of the world . Either way , as end times lullabies go , it ' s pretty sweet .
