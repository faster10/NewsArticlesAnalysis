I discussed my decision to publicly tell the Supreme Court about my abortion with my family . They uniformly expressed support ? ? from my 17 year old daughter , who said she would be disappointed in me if I didn ' t ? to my 83 year old mother in law , who exclaimed with dismay , " I can ' t believe we ' re still having this fight ! I thought my generation had won this right for you ! " to my mother , who wished that she had had the choices that were available to me . Since the brief was made public , I ' ve heard from countless other attorneys ? ? friends , colleagues and strangers ? ? who also feel compelled to share their own stories .
