It ' s arguably unfair to compare " Cougar Town " to its own 3 . 4 premiere last year ( from which it ' s down 47 percent ) . The show debuted in the fall on Wednesday nights with a lead in from top rated " Modern Family . " Whereas last night ' s time slot in a few short months has been haunted by the short lived " Man Up " ( which premiered to a 2 . 4 rating ) and " Work It " ( 2 . 0 ) . " Cougar Town ' s " 1 . 8 rating is about average for this slot , but that ' s not great considering the two shows that mainly generated that number were cancelled . It ' s lead in , " Last Man Standing , " had 7 . 6 million viewers and a 2 . 0 rating .
