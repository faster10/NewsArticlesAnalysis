If you are worried that your Christmas bird won ' t give enough juice for a decent gravy , make a rich home made stock with fresh chicken wings , onion , carrot , bay and thyme . Add a couple of rashers of smoked bacon , 3 tbsp redcurrant jelly and a glass of wine or port . Cover with cold water then simmer very gently for 45 minutes . After straining , pour into a rigid container and freeze for up to six months . Use as a base on the day and you ' ll have a rich tasting gravy in no time .
