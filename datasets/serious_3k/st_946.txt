While the vast majority of Airbnb users are making beer money , those who are lucky enough to own multiple properties in New York or can rent out their home are doing much better . According to the data , 127 New Yorkers are making between 100 , 000 and 350 , 000 a year in Airbnb rent . That s a nice windfall for people who presumably don t need it , but if any are renting their homes for fewer than 30 days a year , they are breaking the law . Not surprisingly , Airbnb declined to release that information .
