Whitney Anderson of Irving , Texas I never really got the chance to know much about this woman . I ' m still a teen , trying to figure out this mess we call our own democracy . But I can say this . For anyone to be slaughtered is a shame . It ' s crazy to think young adults like myself have had to grow up in a time where planes are flown into buildings , wars are dragging on and dragging us down , and now a revered and respected woman is dead , only because she was trying to better the world . I can only hope my future children don ' t have to live like this , and that the only time they hear of things like this is in a history book .
