The same concerns apply to the celebratory events , including this Thanksgiving , when both children , Jude and Truman , will be able to sit at the table , to eat all the food , and to begin to comprehend what this holiday is all about . Granted , they are still just 2 and 1 and a little bit messy in their eating habits so a big , splashy dinner in a dining room would be less appropriate than a smaller gathering of family and friends in the Tenant House at the farm in Bedford where I live .
