In 2010 , the eye doctor turned into a United States senator in the space of a few months . He shared many of his libertarian father ' s very specific policy ideas , but he shared them from a much more accessible persona .

Instead of agitating to abolish the Federal Reserve , why not ask for some oversight ? Instead of a foreign policy that amounts to a simple protest of the federal government itself , why not just be more careful in picking our battles ?
