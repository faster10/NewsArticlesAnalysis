Bengals secondary : As it pertains to its on field play and what the secondary did before the whistles sounded on each play , Cincinnati ' s defensive backs actually had a comparatively strong night . They only gave up one touchdown pass , and it was off a circus catch that could go down as one of the best in postseason history . But it was what two members of the Bengals ' secondary did in the final two minutes of the game that earns the entire unit " down " marks . If only Vontaze Burfict and Adam Jones aren ' t flagged for 30 yards of penalties on arguably the definitive play of the game , perhaps we ' re discussing a different outcome .
