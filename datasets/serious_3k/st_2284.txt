The fact that Pakistan s civil and military leaderships avoided becoming embroiled in Yemen after the Saudis put tremendous pressure on Pakistan , despite ministers from the UAE also hurling twitter threats at Pakistan at the time in support of their GCC senior partner , was a huge confidence inspiring development for Pakistanis . Once again , the recent unilateral announcement by Saudi Arabia of Pakistan being one of the 34 or 36 country coalition against terror took Pakistan by surprise , such is Saudi Arabia s arrogance . But once again , Pakistan s military and civil leaderships navigated the choppy waters skillfully whilst remaining on the same page , and got away with bog standard diplomatic language without any new military commitment . It goes without saying that sharing intelligence etc . where Daesh is concerned is common sense and should not inspire suspicion or fear , even if it is being done with Saudi Arabia .
