" Be enthusiastic and see it as an opportunity . You have nothing to lose , zero . In all my years in tennis , Djokovic is one of the very few players , if maybe the only one , who has no weakness . If he ' s playing his game , and he ' s feeling good , I don ' t know of too many people who can beat him . But there are going to be days when something may not be clicking for him , and that ' s when you can beat him , that ' s when you might have your chance . "
