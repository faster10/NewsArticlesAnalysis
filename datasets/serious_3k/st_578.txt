You could argue that without Alan Rickman in Die Hard , there would have been no Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs , no Jeremy Irons in The Lion King , no Gary Oldman in . . . pretty much everything . And there certainly would have been no Alan Rickman in Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , emoting to the rafters about calling off Christmas and carving out innards with a spoon because " it ' s dull , it ' ll hurt more . " Rickman became so identified as the prototypical villain that it ' s interesting to note he never played another straight baddie after that . ( Your daily trivia : the villain in Arnold Schwarzenegger ' s fourth wall busting Last Action Hero was written for Rickman , literally the script features the movie ' s young hero calling him by name but after Rickman begged off , Charles Dance took the part and wore a T shirt to the set reading " I ' m cheaper than Alan Rickman ! " )
