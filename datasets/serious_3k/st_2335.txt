Concerning Syria , in the aftermath of the quagmire in Iraq , it would be expected that president Obama would not want to put boots on the ground . If the US were to put massive numbers of troops in Syria it could and would likely easily become a proxy war against Iran and Russia . Russia and Iran have different goals in Syria than does the US . The US ' s goal has been to topple Assad and use the Syrian opposition fighters to aid in the endeavor . On the other side of the equation , Iran and Russia are trying to keep Assad in power and there are reports that they are not always fighting ISIS but are taking on the Assad ' s opposition . But alas , Obama has been forced to deal with the reality that without US leadership , ISIS is likely to remain a troublesome force in Syria and the refugee crisis from the civil war with Assad will continue .
