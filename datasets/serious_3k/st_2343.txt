The Panthers don ' t often send blitzers after the quarterback they ranked 21st in blitz percentage , per data pulled from Pro Football Focus ' game tracking . When they do send an extra rusher , it ' s typically Davis , who had a very productive season with 5 . 5 sacks in addition to his typical run game and coverage brilliance . The Panthers will also mix in the occasional secondary blitz , as you saw with Josh Norman coming off the edge last week on a play that turned into a long touchdown for Tyler Lockett .
