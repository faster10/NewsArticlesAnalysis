The other candidates , no dummies , knew what Trump was up to ? but they had plenty of incentive to cut the Texas Tea Party hero down to size , and they whacked Cruz early and often , especially on immigration and his annoying habit ( to them ) of demeaning the conservative credentials of any Republican who opposed him . Paul was particularly cutting , pointing out Cruz s support for a comprehensive immigration reform compromise ? before hardening his position to oppose anything that smacked of amnesty . What is particularly insulting , though , is that he is the king of saying , You ' re for amnesty , Paul said . Everybody ' s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz . But it ' s a falseness , and that ' s an authenticity problem .
