Melis has been a strong voice both to the media and at the islanders ' monthly meetings with the salvage managers , environmental experts and Franco Gabrielli , the government ' s commissioner for the Costa Concordia disaster . She agrees that now , when the removal of the ship is a top priority , may not be the best time to bring up life post Concordia , but she wants people to start thinking about the future again . Plus , she points out that it could take up to two more years for workers to remove all the salvage implements they ' ve put in place , all the while the port views will be marred with cranes and rigs . " Leave them , " she says . " They offer far more good than harm . "
