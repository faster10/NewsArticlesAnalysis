TE Benjamin Watson : Oops . I went on the radio Sunday morning and suggested that Watson ' s career high 127 yards in Week 6 were a bit fluky , but that he could still have nice performances with something like six catches , 60 yards and a touchdown once in a while . Shows what I know . Watson had nine catches for a new career high of 147 yards and a touchdown . . . . I still don ' t think you can count on 100 yard games consistently from the 34 year old for fantasy purposes , but maybe Jimmy Graham really was the only thing standing in his way these last few years .
