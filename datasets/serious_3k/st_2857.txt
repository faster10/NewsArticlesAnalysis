Aided again by Brian Eno , Coldplay are still dabbling in the kind of cool weird artiness they truly went for on 2008 ' s " Viva La Vida . " But where that album sometimes seemed like a self conscious attempt to diversify their sound , with a world music vibe and U2 style sound effects , this time Coldplay have integrated the " Enoxification " ( as they call it ) into their own down the middle core : Check out the cascading choral vocals that augment Martin ' s soaring refrain on " Paradise . " Prominent elements prop up the sonic cathedrals : Jonny Buckland ' s guitar , which is riffier and more muscular than ever , and Euro house synths that wouldn ' t sound out of place at a nightclub in Ibiza .
