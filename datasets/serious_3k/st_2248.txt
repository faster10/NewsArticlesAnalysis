The Patriots aren t so lucky . Though the team is known for its gamesmanship when reporting injuries , 16 of the 21 players listed on their injury report are classified as questionable . That includes several of the team s most important players , including tight end Rob Gronkowski ( knee back ) , wide receivers Danny Amendola ( knee ) and Julian Edelman ( foot ) and linebacker Dont a Hightower ( knee ) . It would be something of a surprise if any of those players were to sit against Denver , though the Patriots did lose a key player earlier in the week when they placed linebacker Jerod Mayo on season ending injury reserve .
