George A . Sorial , an executive for The Trump Organization , responded to the news of the debate , noting that the Trump Organization has plans for significant investments at the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland , as well as at the Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeen , according to CBS News . " Any action to restrict travel would force The Trump Organization to immediately end these and all future investments we are currently contemplating in the United Kingdom , " Sorial said in a statement . " Westminster would send a terrible message to the World that the United Kingdom opposes free speech and has no interest in attracting inward investment . This would also alienate the many millions of United States citizens who wholeheartedly support Mr Trump and have made him the forerunner by far in the 2016 Presidential Election . "
