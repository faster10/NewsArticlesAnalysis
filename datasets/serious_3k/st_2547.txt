The news couldn ' t be better for Warner Bros . , which with the exceptions of The Great Gatsby and 42 has badly struggled at the box office in 2013 . Films like Jack the Giant Slayer , The Hangover Part III , Beautiful Creatures , Bullet to the Head , and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone have massively under performed at the box office , so Man of Steel ' s success is a welcome change . " We ' re thrilled , " says Dan Fellman , the studio ' s president of domestic distribution , " and it will fly through the summer . We ' re going to have legs on this film . "
