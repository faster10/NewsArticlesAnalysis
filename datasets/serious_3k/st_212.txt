? ? The Chiefs can beat either of their potential next opponents . That s a different thing than saying they will beat them , or even that I ll pick it ( like that matters even a little ) , but it s all there . They ve already beaten the Broncos , in Denver , and should ve beat them in Kansas City . This is presumably the best ( or , at least , healthiest ) Peyton Manning will be , with two weeks off , but it s impossible to feel good about where he is physically .
