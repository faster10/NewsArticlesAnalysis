The problem with new Tiger , though , is that as desperate as he appears to march on , obstacles line his path , like tree roots . In some cases , exactly like tree roots . At the ninth , playing out of the Augusta pines , Woods found such a root at full pelt on his follow through . He dropped his club like a red hot poker , face creased with pain . Woods claimed that a bone popped out in his right arm , right there , but he reset it . There was a degree of scepticism about the extent of that injury , but either way it continued to bother him for several holes and was rotten luck .
