Li : Absolutely . There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail . But he presented himself very well . He was very respectful , reasonable , had a human touch , he cared about Dalian , he cared about its people . He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys . He made a clear cut with his wife blamed many things on his wife , especially the things that he claimed he did not know . Also , his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations . Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well that was also a surprise , in many ways .
