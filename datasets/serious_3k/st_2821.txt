It s something I wanted to tell them man to man rather than at a banquet or by text . It was important to me they knew it , Manning said Monday night at the opening night festivities of the Super Bowl . What I said was this could be it . It doesn t mean it will be . I told both of them I really enjoyed these games . These guys have been a part of it . Brady is going to play until he s 70 . Belichick is going to coach until he s 90 . Maybe I ll find the fountain of youth .
