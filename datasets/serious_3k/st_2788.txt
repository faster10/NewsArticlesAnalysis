This doesn t excuse the consequences of Clinton s policy choices . But it is important context . If , at times , Sanders and Clinton feel like they re talking past each other , it s because they are ? a fact obscured by this fight over the meaning of progressive and who , exactly , it covers . It s why this primary will stay angry and polarized . Clinton can t embrace a sharp , ideological message without jeopardizing her transactional and consensus based politics , while Sanders can t do the reverse ? move toward the consensus ? lest he harm the strength of his appeal .
