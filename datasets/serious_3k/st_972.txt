NEW HAMPSHIRE : HOME OF THE OUTLIERS Ed Kilgore : W hen polls come out with startling numbers , we may be looking at an important trend ? or just an ' outlier ' poll that distracts from what ' s really going on . As it happens , the most recent polls of the Republican and Democratic fields in New Hampshire offer findings that leap off the page and fly around the room cackling madly . An American Research Group survey shows John Kasich surging into second place at 20 percent , with only Donald Trump ( at 27 percent ) beating him . And a University of New Hampshire poll for CNN and WMUR shows Bernie Sanders trouncing Hillary Clinton by a 60 ? 33 margin . NYMag
