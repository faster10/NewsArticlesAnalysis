We re expecting a brilliant experience in Belgium . I think it will be hard to match the atmosphere in Glasgow but they re getting 13 , 000 people which is 4 , 000 more than Scotland . I think we ll have 1 , 300 travelling supporters ? 10 of the allocation . Davis Cup is so intense because the noise levels make every point mean something . Even at 1 1 , 15 15 you feel you have to win the next point otherwise the world is going to end . That s the hardest and most draining part ? but that s the beauty of the Davis Cup .
