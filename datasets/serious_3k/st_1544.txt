In this regard , I give Clinton credit for putting forth a plan that builds on certain aspects of the health care law . As it stands , the ACA requires most plans to provide free preventive services . She proposes to further hold down out of pocket costs by providing sick visits to low and middle income families that don t count against deductibles . She proposes a refundable tax credit for excessive out of pocket costs , paid for by rebates from drug manufacturers and taxes on wealthy households . She wants the authority to block or modify unreasonable health plan rate increases , and build on the ACA delivery system advances that promote quality of care over quantity of care .
