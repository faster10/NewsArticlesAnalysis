Street View ' s developers believe images like the ones taken from atop Mont Blanc appeal to two types of people : those who dream to one day set foot on its peak and those who know they never will . " It gives you a deeper level of respect , whichever group you fall into , " Yick says . " There are folks like myself who know this community of mountain climbers exist , but have never seen images that capture what they do in this way .

The image of Ueli Steck ice climbing is particularly breathtaking . It looks fake , like a movie set . You can ' t believe it ' s real or that these guys do this for fun all the time . "
