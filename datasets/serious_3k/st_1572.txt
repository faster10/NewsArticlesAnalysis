Regardless of the messy divorce between Cleveland and Blatt , the point at the center of all this is simple : In order for a team to succeed in the NBA , the best player needs to be on the same page as the coach .

It all sounds terribly cliche , but locker room dynamics like this can affect how a team performs . If things with Blatt were never going to improve and the Cavs thought Lue could be a better leader , then a change had to be made .
