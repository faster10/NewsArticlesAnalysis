Everybody always ask me who was better , MJ Michael Jordan or Kobe because I played with both of them in their heyday , in their prime . Kobe was great and I mean great , one of the best ever . But MJ , he was out of this world . Who would you want to take the last shot in a game , MJ or Kobe ? MJ , right ? OK then . I m taking No . 23 , MJ . But I have so much respect for Kobe and I know that he s at peace now and he s going out and having fun .
