Miller : It ' s not just basketball , I think sports in general . You know he ' s already said yes , " I think we should have a BCS " playoff system for deciding the nation ' s college football championship , and I think everyone agrees with him . I think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school , collegiate and professional ranks . . . . For sports in general , it ' s good to have a person in the White House who ' s physically fit , who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country .
