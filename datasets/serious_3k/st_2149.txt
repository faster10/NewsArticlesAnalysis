Of the icons of my generation , there are not as many dead as my parents generation and this certainly isn t some kind of contest , but there are quite a few . Others have simply quieted : the Gallagher brothers , Beck , Courtney , Billy Corgan . We just don t know what to do with ourselves . We re just trying to reach our 50s , where there s not even the memory of youth , and many of us can finally give up the ghost . ? This is no guarantee , of course . Look at John Entwistle of the Who , dead in a Vegas hotel room in 2002 with strippers ? and blow . But it increases our odds of dying old and ugly ? ? well , not ugly , but older at least .
