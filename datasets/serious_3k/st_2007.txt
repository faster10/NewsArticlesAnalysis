" Never Ending " brings on " Love on the Brain , " which sounds more rooted in 20th century musical arrangements than most of Anti up until that point . Instead of the album ' s signature EDM atmospherics and unintelligible ( or at least hard to decipher ) lyrics , " Love on the Brain " brings Stax soul to the table , with male back up singers responding to Rihanna like the Pips . " Must be love on the brain that ' s got me feeling this way , " she sings . " It beats me black and blue but it f cks me so good And I can ' t get enough . " Problematic ? Very . Punk ? Absolutely . But counter to most of Anti ' s bad girl mood music , Rihanna ' s actually singing here , full voice and powerful .
