Mourinho ' s charisma was key to him winning over players at the time . ' You saw it with Jose from the beginning , ' said Kluivert . ' Though he hadn ' t played , he wasn ' t a big name , he had charisma towards the group . The things he said really communicated . That was the most important thing . He knows how to talk to people as an individual and that was the difference with him . Everyone is different so you need to deal with them individually and he did that . Sure , he helped me . He helped everyone . '
