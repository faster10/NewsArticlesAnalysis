I got to watch in the pit , right on the edge on the stage . I understood something that I never even really had thought about before . He really communicates , whereas I think some of the other hip hop artists they were great performers and they were dynamic and charismatic but on a consistent basis , every idea seemed to be a communication . I always thought that about Sinatra . It ' s a connection . It ' s a story they ' re telling you . And I was kind of knocked out by that . I ' ve never seen Eminem live , but in our movie , 8 Mile , I felt like that was happening .
