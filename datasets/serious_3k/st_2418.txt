Baseball on the radio , though , remains free . Unlike viewers of cable TV or subscribers to satellite radio , fans of home team games on their hometown radio stations don ' t have to pay a cent to listen . The sound of it all is very much what the sound has been forever . Because the pace of the game is leisurely , local play by play announcers , over a 162 game season , develop a relationship with their listeners unique in sports . They have to talk a lot , even when there ' s not much going on down on the field , and the audience grows accustomed to , and comfortable with , their relaxed voices and their heard but not seen personalities .
