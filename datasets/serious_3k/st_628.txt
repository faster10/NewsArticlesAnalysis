A bit further north in Tampa , rain isn t much of an issue , but the wind is . Gusts could reach more than 20 mph Sunday at Raymond James Stadium , where the Atlanta Falcons play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday at 1 p . m . ET . With Jameis Winston on a hot streak , he ll still make some big play and passes here at home , but another huge component is running back Doug Martin . He s going into week 13 as the number 3 fantasy running back and this is a very appealing match up for him . Lock him in as a solid RB1 this week against the Falcons .
