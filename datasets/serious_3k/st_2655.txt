" The president of the United States is asking us to increase the debt limit . But on Tuesday night , he didn ' t even address it . And I don ' t think the American people will tolerate increasing the debt limit without serious reductions in spending and changes to the budget process , so that we can make sure that this never happens again . The other night , all he did was call for more stimulus spending . I think our team has been listening to the American people . They want to us reduce spending , and there is no limit to the amount of spending we ' re willing to cut . " House Majority Leader John Boehner , " Fox News Sunday "
