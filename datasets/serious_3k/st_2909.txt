When it comes to the The Walking Dead , Glenn s death is all everyone can talk about . In this case , the new episode makes a blunt statement about Steven Yeun s TWD character by what is not named in the credits . The new The Walking Dead episode heavily focused on a Morgan flashback , although we were left wondering if Rick Grimes hand may have been zombie infected before The Walking Dead Season 7 even arrives . It is also possible we have a gay Jesus to look forward to based upon The Walking Dead Season 6 spoilers ? no , we are not joking .
