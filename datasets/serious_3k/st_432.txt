( EW . com ) My relationship with the who should play Christian Grey timeline goes as follows : I wanted Matt Bomer the entire time I read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy . . . right up until Charlie Hunnam was announced . Then I inexplicably got very excited for Hunnam ' s portrayal of the troubled billionaire . And now that Hunnam has dropped out of the film , I ' m left feeling 50 shades of empty and confused . Do I want Matt Bomer again ? Or do I want someone like Hunnam , with a lesser known face ( or one that ' s usually covered in hair ) ?
