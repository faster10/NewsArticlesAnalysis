I mean , no doubt in my mind he ' s going to be the MVP on Saturday night , " Manning said . " What he ' s done in the short time being an NFL quarterback he ' s been awesome . It ' s the best word I can think of . He ' s been a great passer , he ' s been a great runner , he ' s been a great leader . You don ' t go 17 1 as a starting quarterback without being awesome and that ' s what he ' s been this year without a doubt .
