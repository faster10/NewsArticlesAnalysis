Nobody wanted to see it come to an end , said Golden State guard Stephen Curry . Thirty three was within our grasp . Although this was not the longest winning streak in National Basketball Association history ( the 1971 72 L . A . Lakers won 33 games in a row ) their 24 0 start this season shattered the previous record of 15 0 which was shared by the 1948 49 Washington Capitals and the 1983 84 Houston Rockets . The Bucks also stopped the Lakers streak in 1972 . Some of it had to do with health , as starting forward Harrison Barnes has missed two weeks , Andrew Bogut has endured back troubles and Klay Thompson sprained an ankle . We know that , our guys know that and we ll keep working at it . It s harder on the road and when you re constantly winning to focus on the little details .
