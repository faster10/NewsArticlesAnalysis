" One year doesn ' t make a trend and probably two years doesn ' t either , " Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby told ESPN . com on Sunday . " We always knew some years we were going to love the model , and other years we ' d wish we had a chance to play one more game . The one thing we still have to ponder , it was stated that part of the reason why Michigan State jumped over Oklahoma is there was the 13th data point issue . It appears we ' re at some disadvantage , but on this occasion , it didn ' t keep us from getting in , but on some other occasion it might like it did last year . I think we have to continue to be thoughtful about it . "
