Miller : I would not mind picking him up on my squad if there were 10 guys and we had to pick , he could definitely be in my squad . Because he knows what his strength is making sure that everyone gets involved , and that ' s the kind of point guard I want . Those are guys like Magic Johnson , Mark Jackson , John Stockton , it ' s not all about them it ' s about let ' s make sure our team is good . He ' s going to get the ball to everyone .
