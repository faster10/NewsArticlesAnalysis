Was it a Tweet that caught the attention of the world this week ? Yes , but just because Rose has rightfully stood up for her own sexuality before doesn t mean we should automatically applaud what she did this time around . For instance , Matt Nedostup at Someecards wrote , She took down Future President West with a single tweet , using all of the venom and personal information that only an ex can provide . But at what cost ? We all know personal details about what our exes like in bed , but exposing that information as a way to make them look bad only boomerangs on the accuser , and in this case , makes it seem as if Rose concurs that there s something disturbing about West possibly having enjoyed being on the receiving end of manual penetration .
