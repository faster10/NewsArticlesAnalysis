It actually is hard even for me . I did have a challenging time playing it , but once you get in the groove it ' s not too bad . It is fairly realistic though , and that ' s one of the things I really wanted to have in this game . It ' s going to be interesting to see how people like it . I ' ve been getting people sending me messages on Twitter constantly about it . It is a way to get off the couch and get active instead of sitting there with the controller and just tapping buttons . It ' s much more interactive than regular games are .
