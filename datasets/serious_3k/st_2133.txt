The Chiefs averaged a very solid 4 . 8 yards per carry . Second year back Charcandrick West rushed 22 times for 110 yards , cracking the 100 yard barrier for the first time in his career . His 1 yard plunge in the third quarter was also the first touchdown of his career . Also , after getting stuffed near the goal line in the first half , West helped ice the game on three straight runs to close it out in the fourth quarter . He did this , by the way , against a Steelers run defense that ranked sixth in the league entering the contest . Kudos to West and a much maligned offensive line for getting the job done in crunch time .
