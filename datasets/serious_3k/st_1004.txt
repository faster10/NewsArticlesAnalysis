" Obviously we know we ' ve got some guys that could go after free agency , " Collins said . " But this game and I truly believe this it ' s about having good starting pitching . It ' s going nowhere . ? The future is pretty bright still . Instead of saying , Wow , we ' re losing this guy and this guy and this guy , ' we ' re still going to run some pretty good pitching at you every night . Hopefully we can get some guys back here and some guys signed . If not , go out and find somebody else , but we ' re still going to be able to compete . "
