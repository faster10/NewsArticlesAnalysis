RN : I find it quite dicey , it ' s a case of uncertainty , not knowing what is going to happen . . . however I ' m actually endorsing the present government because he president Goodluck Jonathan has contributed immensely to the growth of our industry call me selfish call me what but I ' ve been in this industry for 25 years , no government ever spoke about my industry like this one . He gave us audience , he listened to us , he gave several grants to help the industry , he sent so many of the practitioners outside to big film schools . . . he ' s giving money for distribution so for all these reasons .
