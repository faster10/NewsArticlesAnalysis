Most pollsters report a single margin of error that is based on the sample size and an estimate of 50 percent , because it would be very confusing to put a different margin of error on each number . However , when considering whether a candidate is leading , it s important to remember that numbers further away from 50 percent have smaller margins of error . With 14 Republicans still in the race , none are likely to get to 50 percent any time soon and for all of Cruz ' s sunny numbers lately , it ' s still a bit premature to say that he ' s polling in the same league as Trump .
