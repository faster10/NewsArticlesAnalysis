Gay rights groups cheered on Monday when a draft document from a group of bishops and priests suggested the church could be more welcoming to the gay community . " Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer to the Christian community , " they wrote . " Are we capable of welcoming these people , guaranteeing to them a fraternal space in our communities ? Often they wish to encounter a Church that offers them a welcoming home . " But on Tuesday the Vatican backtracked from its statements , saying it did not want to create " the impression of a positive evaluation " of same sex relationships .
