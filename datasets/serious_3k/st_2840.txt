Abu Salha says that he was inspired to go to fight in the Syrian " holy war " by a lecture by the notorious Yemeni American militant cleric , Anwar al Awlaki who said this about traveling to jihad : " It ' s like a cliff , you jump off the cliff but you don ' t know if the water is deep or shallow . . . . You just have to jump and put you ' re ( faith ) in Allah that the water is going to be deep and you won ' t be harmed . "
