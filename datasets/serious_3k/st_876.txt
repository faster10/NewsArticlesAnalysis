No dice . In lieu of more quality time spent with promising acts like girl group 2Squar ' d , country singer teacher Kendra Williams , and music instructor Brandon O ' Hara , we got entire segments devoted to the likes of a defective Justin Bieber doll ( if Justin Bieber dolls had been around in the ' 80s ) and motormouth yawns like Ashley Nothing At All Like Pink and Ashley Ghost Hunter . ( The ensuing inter judge antics re : ghosts was pretty much the dumbest thing I ' ve ever seen , and I ' ve been watching " Dancing With the Stars " for 13 seasons . )
