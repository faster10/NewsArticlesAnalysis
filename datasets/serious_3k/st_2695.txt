It sounds crazy , given where they rank statistically , but the Giants ' coaching staff has done a commendable job with this defense this year . They have major personnel deficiencies at every level . They have a collection of rookies and backups and undrafted try hard types who give outstanding effort every week . They ' re opportunistic , meaning that not only do they seek and force turnovers but they tend to do something with them . They have three defensive touchdowns so far . So even though they ' re a net liability , they do make a contribution . That ' s commendable .
