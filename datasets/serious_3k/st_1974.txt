However , just because I like birds doesn ' t mean I am predisposed to liking a movie with a lot of birds in it .

In addition , a good film needs to have something to it in addition to the surface subject matter . What I am trying to say is , just because this is a film about birding doesn ' t mean it ' s a film about birding .
