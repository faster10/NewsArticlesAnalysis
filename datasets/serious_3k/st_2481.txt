That s how much they adjust , Casillas said . They were saying Don t worry about the stuff we had in training camp because we re not running any of that stuff anymore anyway . Ya ll laugh . It s kind of comical because at first I was like How the heck am I supposed to learn the defense ? When I was out there the first couple of weeks , they were saying calls to me and I m looking like What the heck does that mean ? And they d be like Don t worry , we ll get you squared up on it JC .
