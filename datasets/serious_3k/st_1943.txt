I think they are the future for the Lakers , but I still think they need a veteran in there , the scout said . I like Clarkson . I love his aggressiveness . He s elevated into a pretty decent shooter . And I really like Randle talent wise . He s a little undersized four ( power forward ) . But his quickness and athleticism is unmatched . I think he gets in a hurry sometimes . But once he learns how to slow down , I think he s going to be a beast . D Angelo , he s still trying to find his way . I think the talent is there . I m just not sold on him yet . From what I ve seen , I m not convinced that he s ready yet . But he s got to play to develop .
