In the coming days , you will relive much of the Brady Manning history , all of it indisputably worth it . The short story is this : Brady has won 11 of the 16 previous meetings , Manning only 5 . In the AFC title game , Manning leads , 2 1 . The latter is worth noting because the home quarterback has always proven the victor , the most recent outcome a victory by Manning and the Broncos in Denver two years ago , when former Patriots receiver Wes Welker knocked out defensive back Aqib Talib and when Brady was forced to play with a pass catching corps that included Austin Collie , Matthew Slater and Matthew Mulligan .
