Modi praised the way France responded to the November 13 attacks in Paris . " Terrorism is a challenge for entire humanity . France has shown that at a time when people were being killed , the country did not shake from the path of development . President Hollande is correct that terrorism is a challenge , just like global warming . India and France are two countries who have a deep faith in humanity and we are committed to wipe out terrorism and India is completely with you ( France ) in this regard , " Modi said at the summit .
