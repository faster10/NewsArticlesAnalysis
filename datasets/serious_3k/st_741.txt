4 . St . Louis : Plenty of Rams fans are wondering if the city will get an NFL team again . Here ' s a historical fact that will make them feel better : The last city that lost the NFL entirely and never got it back was Portsmouth , Ohio , in 1934 . Since then , teams have come and gone , but no market hosting an NFL team has gone permanently vacant . That doesn ' t mean St . Louis will get another team soon . It means that it will very likely draw the eye of another NFL owner someday . Much like San Diego , a lot of that depends on stadium viability , political support and public outcry to get another team . An economic rebound would be nice , too but that can be said about most major cities in the Midwest .
