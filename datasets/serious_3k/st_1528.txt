Abbas ' s death will not add anything to the regime ' s reputation for brutality but it will attract , hopefully , the international community ' s attention to the prison inmates in Syria . I feel they became the lost ghosts that nobody is trying actively to help . The pain and horrific torture they go through should be enough for the entire world to try to help but somehow the politicians are busy reading between the lines asking questions about al Assad ' s degree of control . Who cares if he is the one in control or not ?
