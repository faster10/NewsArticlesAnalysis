When Shakil turned up at my door , she was a petite girl , dressed in skinny jeans and she looked modern . She asked me if I thought she was pretty , and she kept looking at herself in the mirror . She seemed so self obsessed . That day I met her I didn t see a single Muslim bone in her body . I asked her if she was religious and she said she wasn t . Because she confessed the affair to me after I left him , I told her she was welcome to him . But I warned her about him . He is the most vile man I have ever known . Even talking about him makes me feel physically sick . I told her that he would change her , and would force her to cover up like he did to me and his other ex wife . But she laughed it off , she didn t believe me .
