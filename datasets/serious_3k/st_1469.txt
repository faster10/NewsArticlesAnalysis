Nikki Beach was the brainchild of Jack Penrod , who became the largest McDonald ' s franchise owner in the State of Florida in the 80 ' s . Tragically , the billionaire ' s daughter Nikki was killed in a car accident . Penrod decided that , rather than mourn his daughter ' s passing , he would celebrate her life for years to come . In 1997 , after a complete renovation , Nikki Beach Club was opened . The venue and its sister properties all over the world are a continuing homage to Nikki Penrod and the Nikki Beach brand is meant to exemplify all that she was as a person beautiful , fun loving , a trendsetter and cutting edge in every way .
