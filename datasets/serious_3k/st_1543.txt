Hold your fire , fellow progressives . I ve been advocating for single payer since the late Ted Kennedy starting talking about Medicare for All , long before a lot of you kids were born ( and while we re at it , get off my lawn ! ) . And as a member of the Obama team back in the day , trust me , I know the Affordable Care Act s got some warts . But it exists , it s working , it s embedding itself in the lives of millions of households and equally importantly , in the way we deliver health care .
