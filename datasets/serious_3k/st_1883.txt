In that light , I ve reconsidered the ending of The Peanuts Movie , especially when I think about how happy it made not only my kids but pretty much all the kids in the theater . Charlie Brown isn t rewarded on the baseball field or in the classroom or in the eyes of any of the wah wahing adults whose opinions , in this world , truly don t matter instead , the movie remedies , for a moment , the greatest injustice readers of the comic have always known : that Charlie Brown is a good man unappreciated by those he wishes were his true friends . To see his worth acknowledged , no matter how unfamiliar the scene was , felt , in the end , lovely . Charles Schulz famously justified the endless failures of his most beloved character by observing that winning is great , but it isn t funny . Most of The Peanuts Movie is very funny indeed . Its ending , however , isn t funny ? but it is pretty great .
