Cerone : We ' re always trying to find that balance . To NBC ' s credit , more often than not , we ' ll turn in a script or a cut of an episode , and NBC will say , " Take it further make it more extreme . " They ' ll push us to make it darker . They understand the way people watch television , at least for this kind of show . David Goyer and myself are censoring ourselves with what you can and can ' t do on television , and it ' s NBC that ' s telling us to take it further .
