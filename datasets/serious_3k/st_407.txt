Islamic extremism has been a major concern for Russian President Vladimir Putin , said Ian Brzezinski , senior fellow at the Atlantic Council . " Despite his government ' s defense doctrines stating that the U . S . and NATO is Russia ' s greatest threat , I have always felt that Putin regards Islamic extremism to be the most immediate threat , " Brzezinski said . " Putin cut his teeth destroying the Chechens . He regarded their rebellion as a manifestation of Islamic extremism . He also bolstered his own personal popularity in Russia by demonizing the Chechens as Islamic terrorists and by brutally crushing them . "
