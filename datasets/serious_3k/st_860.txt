CARIG : While Murphy ' s heroics earlier in the postseason put his best qualities on display , his struggles in the World Series also exposed some of his less desirable traits . The Mets have no appetite for a long term deal . But they likely will give Murphy a qualifying offer , partly because there ' s nothing to lose . If he accepts , the Mets get an impact bat that brings defensive versatility . Most importantly , it would come with no long term commitment , thus negating concerns about his defense becoming more diminished with age . If he declines the offer , the Mets will receive a draft pick when he signs elsewhere , which is a near certainty .
