That s always been a thing that we focus on every single year , it s been yards after contact , Packers tight ends coach Jerry Fontenot said this week . We haven t been as good as we have been in previous years . That seemed to be something that Jermichael was especially good at . Our expectations were high , and I think we re very capable of breaking tackles and gaining extra yardage and to do it to the best of our ability is all we ask . I don t expect to turn anybody into something that they re not , but we can definitely improve on .
