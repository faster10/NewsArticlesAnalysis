Houston Texans : It ' s OK with Texans players if everyone picks against them . They ' ve said this week they recognize they ' ll be the underdogs against the 8 0 Cincinnati Bengals . Texans coach Bill O ' Brien says the Texans have worked to improve both their rushing offense ( 32nd in yards per rush ) and run defense ( 23rd in yards per rush ) this week as the Texans have had two padded practices . O ' Brien said his team looks better , but that he needs to see that happen in a game before saying for sure . The Bengals have given up only three rushing touchdowns all season and field a strong rushing attack with backs Giovanni Bernard and Jeremy Hill . They ' ll prove a steep test for the Texans ' improvement . Bengals 23 , Texans 20 . Tania Ganguli
