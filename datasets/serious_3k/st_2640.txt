We , in the West , did not earn our good luck . Many people in the world would risk their lives for a tiny taste of our good luck . Some of them do , and some of them die . Some of them don ' t die , and a whole new hard path starts . We who are lucky should certainly try and help some of the people who are much less lucky , but it ' s time to face up to the fact that we can ' t help all of them , and we sure as hell can ' t do it like this .
