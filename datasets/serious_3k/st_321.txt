You can ' t answer if you don ' t know the question : Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer . A witness should always wait until the question has been completely asked . First , someone is typing the questions and answers into a transcript , and interruptions end up looking like someone spilled Scrabble letters onto a piece of paper : Unintelligible . A witness should only answer the question asked , lest he volunteer information to help the other side . And , if a question hasn ' t even been finished yet , a witness can ' t possibly limit the answer to the question asked he doesn ' t know what the question is yet ! Best practice ? Wait until the question is complete pause and ask yourself if you understand the question if you do , ask yourself if you know the answer to the question if you do , only answer the question asked .
