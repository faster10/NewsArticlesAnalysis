As a male music lover , Beyonc finally converted me to the Beyhive . It was the first of her five albums I cared to play more than once , not for the overall sexiness of the whole project , but ( I swear ) for the quality of the entire record from start to finish . Rihanna may never have taken this long between albums before . It stoked hopes that Anti would be that Rihanna masterpiece she never needed as a superstar in today ' s post millennial , singles driven music industry . The album that ( straight ) guys could play and actually want to hear over and over . That needn ' t be RiRi ' s barometer for success , at all . That ' s just what I was hoping for .
