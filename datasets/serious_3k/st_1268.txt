Maybe our lifestyle is different . I focus on my own development I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills . I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation . In Palestine where I live , surprises can happen at any time , and I don ' t want to be caught off guard . I want to make my future secure by being a really good person . I deserve to live .
