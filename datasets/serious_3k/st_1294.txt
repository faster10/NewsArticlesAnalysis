So what exactly is happening here ? Is Russia trying to intimidate Turkey by repeatedly violating its airspace and if so to what end ? Was the Turkish response an overreaction ? Should the Turkish response have been more calibrated ? Turkish fighter pilots are also highly trained professionals . They do not open fire on a Russian plane , even if it is in Turkish air space , without being given direct orders to do so . In fact , it was in both Erdogan ' s and Putin ' s interest to stage such an incident . While there is a logic to their actions , it is also a very dangerous game , one that could very easily spin out of control with deadly consequences .
