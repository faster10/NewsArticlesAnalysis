I almost caught Fear bola from a good friend when he told me : " You better believe I ' m worried about Ebola . Sure , the docs say , ' Don ' t worry . It ' s not airborne . You must touch fluid to get it ' . . . but what if a person on plane or subway sneezes , sending fluid particles at me or a few drops on the seat . . . . That ' s not airborne to docs . . . but that ' s fluid and now I have Ebola . Yeah , I ' m very afraid . "
