The reality is that traffickers have taken advantage of the institutional weakness and corruption of municipal governments to control local police and politicians . The poverty and marginalization of the peasants who have no access to credit , have to pay high prices for seeds , fertilizers and transport for their products , and lack the technology necessary for crops with high market value create an opportunity for traffickers , who employ them in the production of opium poppies or cannabis . And although they are paid at low rates , their illicit incomes are still higher than what they would receive from traditional crops . If it weren ' t for prohibition , however , the illegal crops would not be profitable .
