LENNON : Other than trading Matt Harvey for Xander Bogaerts , we don ' t see an obvious fix this early in the offseason , but there ' s still 3 1 2 months before spring training . After seeing Curtis Granderson become the team ' s MVP from the leadoff spot , the Mets won ' t be in a hurry to move him lower in the order , unless they feel like signing another option such as Gerardo Parra . There are some issues here , though . Using Michael Cuddyer in a platoon with Lucas Duda at first base might help the Mets feel better about the backloaded 12 . 5 million they owe Cuddyer in 2016 . Juan Lagares may be more of the offensive threat they envisioned after elbow surgery this winter , but we ' re still not sold on Wilmer Flores at shortstop , especially after he vanished at the plate during the postseason . As Alderson showed , he prefers more flexible offensive players , like Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe , to shelling out for one big bat , so look for him to scour the bargain racks again this winter .
