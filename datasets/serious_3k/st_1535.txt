Ricardo Gomez of Buenos Aires , Argentina I ' m a big Pats fan , and I was sad to see that last play when Manning escapes the Pats ' defense and throw that pass , the one that put the GIANTS OFFENSE so close to the touchdown . Anyway , I think Pats are still the best team in the league , and I was there that snowy night when Brady got us to the Super Bowl at the last second with ( Adam Vinatieri kicking ) that amazing field goal ! So GO PATS ! GO ! ! !
