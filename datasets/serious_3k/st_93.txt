The Broncos AFC Championship game against the Oakland Raiders , the defending Super Bowl champs , on New Year s Day 1978 marks a stark line of demarcation in the team s history . Before : One playoff game ( just days earlier against the Pittsburgh Steelers ) , the worst AFL team ( a miserable 39 ? 97 ? 4 record when it was said and done ) , four winning seasons since 1960 and zero respect as a franchise . Since : 39 playoffs games , seven Super Bowls , two world championships , 10 AFC Championship Game appearances , 14 division titles and 20 playoff wins .
