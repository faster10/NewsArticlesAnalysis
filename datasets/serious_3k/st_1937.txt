It ' s a paradox . We treat children according to their developmental culpability , with a colossal exception : If the consequences of their behavior are really serious , we instead deal with them according to the outcome even though the biological genesis of that behavior remains exactly the same . If a child punches an adult , the child may land in juvenile court . If a child punches an adult , and that adult falls and dies , then the child might be in adult court . Same root causes of bad behavior , different judicial outcome . The neurology remains the same in all cases , but we inconsistently demand disparate treatment .
