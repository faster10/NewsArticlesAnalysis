BARBARA BUSH : Jeb has been a very good father , a wonderful son , a hard worker . His heart is big . When push comes to shove , people are going to realize Jeb has real solutions . Rather than talking about how popular they are , how great they are . He ' s doing it because he sees a huge need and it ' s not being filled by anybody . Of all the people running , he seems to be the one who could solve the problems . I think he ' ll be a great president .
