" I was getting back down to work when I remembered that there was a great speech in that movie Sneakers , " Bogen said . " I knew it would be really helpful for my own speech , so I got out the DVD . I ended up watching the whole movie before I realized that the speech was actually in Dave . But I didn ' t watch that movie , because it was 1 a . m . , and I really needed to get cracking . That is , right after I organized my DVD shelf , which had gotten really out of control . "
