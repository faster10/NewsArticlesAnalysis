Bush Vows To Cut Internet Taxes
Speaking to a group of young voters at a Michigan campaign stop, Republican George W. Bush boldly pledged to cut Internet taxes in half, and waved off suggestions by some in the crowd that there are, at present, no taxes levied on the Internet. “I speak to technology companies all the time, and they all want to know if I favor taxing the Internet,” Bush told the audience. “Well, I don’t, and if I’m elected, I will cut Internet taxes in half.”Asked by a reporter why he was pledging to cut taxes that don’t exist, Bush responded that he was a Republican.
