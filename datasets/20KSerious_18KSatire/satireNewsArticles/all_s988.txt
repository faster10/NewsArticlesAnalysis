Comedy fans in mourning as Jim Davidson tragically confirmed alive and well
British comedian Jim Davidson is ‘alive and well’ according to sources close to him this morning. Jim Davidson did not die unexpectedly at home yesterday, and continues to breathe the same air as the rest of us. A spokesperson for Davidson’s management team told reporters, “We can confirm that Jim is still with us, and working on new material. It’s about black disabled people – you’ll love it.” Upon hearing the announcement about Jim Davidson, comedy fan Simon Williams told us, “This is such tragic news so soon after the death of Rik Mayall.” “It’s almost like God doesn’t want British comedy to thrive any more.” “He’ll probably let Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown live to be 100, just you watch.”
