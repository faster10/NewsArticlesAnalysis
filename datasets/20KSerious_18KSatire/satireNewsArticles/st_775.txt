" I don ' t know , I guess there ' s just something really goofy about being , like , ' Hello , my name is Frank , and I ' m a cop , ' or whatever , when that ' s not who I am at all , " said Harris , adding that it is especially weird doing this on the set of a movie because " the whole thing is make believe but everyone has to act like it ' s real . " " Sometimes they give me a hat or something to wear , or I ' m supposed to speak with an accent , and then I feel especially silly because it ' s like , ' Why am I wearing this hat and talking in this funny voice ? This is so weird and dumb , you know ? ' "
