" Some men ignore their trucks for years , and then , when rust spots appear , they act surprised , " Maurer said . " By that point , though , it ' s too late . So I always tell truck owners to cherish the early years and make the most of them . You can ' t undo the damage you do to a truck , and when the warranty expires , you can ' t go back in time and relive those years . "
