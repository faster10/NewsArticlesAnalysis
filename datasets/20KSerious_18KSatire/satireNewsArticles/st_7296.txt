" If this Stretch doll is unsafe , heaven knows how many other things pose a danger , too , " Grange said . " Like those Holly Hobby EZ Bake Ovens . They baked , like , these tiny little cakes with this high wattage light bulb . That can ' t possibly be safe . We ' d better get one in here and do an accidental burn hazard spec test . I ' m so psyched to test one of those things . I loved those . "
