Kanye West: “I Could Tightrope Walk From the Sears Tower To The Hancock Building”
After Nik Wallenda tightrope walked between two skyscrapers 70 stories above Chicago on Sunday, native Kanye West claimed that he could tightrope walk from Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) to the Hancock building, a distance of two miles and 110 stories tall. Wallenda, whose feat was witnessed by 20 million viewers with countless social media shares and likes, successfully walked from the Leo Burnett Building to atop the Marina City. Kanye, not to be outdone, made the claim that he also could and would tightrope across the entire city of Chicago. “I could do it no problem. I’m the best tightrope walker alive,” Kanye told WGN News. “I’m from Chicago and I can do it better. I’m God’s gift to walking on rope.” Wallenda, who was observed praising God several times during his tightrope performance, resonated with  Kanye. “He was praising me the whole time on that rope. We all heard it. Praise God, praise Jezzus. It’s all the same name. Don’t you know that? Kanye, being a proud Chicagoan, has always tried to be the most important celebrity from his city. “So, move over Oprah, I’m the king of this town. I’ll be God floating above Chicago.” Weeks of preparation went into producing Nik Wallenda’s tightrope stunt. Kanye seemed to brush off the notion that he needed to train and prepare to achieve such a feet. “I don’t need no pole to balance with. I have perfect balance. Do I even need a rope to walk on? I changed my mind, I’m gonna fly. You can call me Super Kanye.” The Wallenda camp celebrated the successful tightrope walk by eating Chicago’s famous Italian beef sandwiches at Portillos when they heard of Kanye’s rant. “All I know is God loves all of his children,” Wallenda told the Chicago Tribune. “If he can tightrope over two miles at 110 stories, I’ll be back to break his record.” Wallenda is said to have enjoyed the sandwich.
