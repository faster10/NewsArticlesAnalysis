Sen . Jeff Bingaman ( D NM ) said of the request : " Our conduct has been exemplary throughout recent months , yet we have not been allowed to hold Congress outside once this year . I note also that the Supreme Court has made two trips to the National Air Space Museum as a reward for merely completing its work . This out of doors congressional session has been a long time coming , and we are fully confident that the president will see fit to grant it to us . "
