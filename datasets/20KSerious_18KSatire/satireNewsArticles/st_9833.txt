" " Whether it ' s the inner city kid who was raised by his grandmother and still thanks her before and after every game , win or lose the scrappy , rawboned center from the middle of nowhere who ' s never been to a city this big before and just played his heart out in a tough loss or the undersized kid who didn ' t let a severe case of the flu stop him from giving the game , his school , and his teammates all he had , I ' m just really impressed with what I ' ve seen this year .
