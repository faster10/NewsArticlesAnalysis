" Even the kids who live in the Section 8 housing over by the interstate will not go near Jeremy , " Newcomb said . " There isn ' t one fourth grader who can tolerate the way he talks , walks , eats , smells , kicks at the chair in front of him , sniffs constantly God , he always seems to be sick , doesn ' t he ? He wipes his nose right on his hand . But if you offer him a Kleenex , he sticks his tongue out at you . He is way too old to be doing things like that . Ugh . Jeremy Halcote . Yuck . "
