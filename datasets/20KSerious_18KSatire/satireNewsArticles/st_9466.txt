" It becomes very frustrating when you give , and you give , and you give , and you get nothing in return , " said Jackson , holding back tears . " And after you ' ve exhausted yourself from all that giving , you leave work and have two measly hours of sunlight before it gets dark or starts pouring down rain on you out of nowhere . It ' s like the environment doesn ' t even care . And what ' s with the leaves everywhere ? Every fall , with the goddamn leaves ! What are we , your servants ? We ' re supposed to pick up after you ? Jesus , if I find one more leaf or fallen branch clogging up my gutters , I swear to God , I ' m going to snap . "
