" Her curtains are sun faded to a sickly pale yellow , her area rugs have large holes produced by thousands of footfalls , and the vinyl tablecloth in the dining room was past its prime when her middle aged daughters were still teenagers . I ' m an appraiser , not a psychiatrist , but I ' d say Mrs Hoagland has all but handed in her cards . "
