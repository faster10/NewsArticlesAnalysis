" We ' re out there on the floor , debating the pros and cons of the thing , but I just wasn ' t into it at all , " Dreier said . " Then it hits me : What does it matter if the stupid bill goes through or not ? It ' s not like it ' s gonna change anything . H . R . 2372 won ' t make any more difference than H . R . 3843 , which reauthorizes programs to assist small business concerns , or H . R . 1000 to amend title 49 , United States Code , to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration and for other purposes . "
