World Trade Center , which stars Nicolas Cage as a dedicated Port Authority officer who stumbles on secret evidence amid the rubble and carnage of the terrorist attack , tells a story quite different from what Stone called " the official government line " about the event . According to the film , at 8 : 46 a . m . , a lone commercial airliner flew diagonally through the North Tower of the World Trade Center , maintained a circular holding pattern for approximately 17 minutes , then struck the South Tower before heading to the Pentagon .
