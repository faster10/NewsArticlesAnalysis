" Last week , this group of women started throwing ice cubes at Shawn , " Lang said . " When he just ignored it , some guys reached behind the bar and started chucking entire handfuls at him . Finally , Shawn stands up and says , ' I ' m so on fire tonight , I could use a cooling off . ' So he takes one of the ice cubes that went down his shirt and pops it in his mouth . I ' ve tried to talk to him , but he ' s just determined to be a jackass . "
