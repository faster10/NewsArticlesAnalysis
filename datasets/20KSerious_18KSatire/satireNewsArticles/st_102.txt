" The majority of American adults find work cutting into the middle of their days exactly when leisure is most effective , " said Adam Bernhardt , the Boston University sociology professor who headed the study . " The hours between 9 a . m . and 6 p . m . are ideally suited to browsing stores , dozing in front of the television , and finishing the morning paper . Daytime hours are also the warmest and sunniest of the day , making them perfect for outdoor activities . Unfortunately , most Americans can ' t enjoy leisure during this time , for the simple reason that they ' re ' at work . ' "
