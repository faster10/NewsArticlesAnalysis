According to Christ , the beauty and perfection of the Qur ' an ' s Surahs are without equal in all creation , encompassing and surpassing both the Judaic Torah and the New Testament Gospels of His apostles . The former Christian messiah went on to cite Surah Aal ' imraan 3 : 67 , which reads , " This day I have perfected your religion for you , completed My favor upon you , and have chosen for you Islam as your religion .
