" I didn ' t really know Brian or his family very well , so none of this hits home for me , " said local mother Jessica Winger , who noted that her children didn ' t grow up with Tillerman , didn ' t play Little League with him , and didn ' t see him every day in school , and admitted that , even if they had , she probably wouldn ' t remember him . " I can ' t say life in Winden Falls has changed in any noticeable way since Brian ' s death . And to be honest , it never really crossed my mind to keep him in my thoughts and prayers . "
