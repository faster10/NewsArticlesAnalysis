GASTONIA , SC Eight months ago , Larry Dunne was alone . He didn ' t have a friend in the world . But all that changed with his baptism at the New Hearts Fundamentalist Church . Ever since becoming a born again Christian , Dunne has a friend through Jesus . " Let ' s see , there ' s Richard and Janet and Craig , " said Dunne , a data technician at Quill Paper Distribution . " Oh , and Brent , too . He stands next to me in the choir . Now that I ' m saved , I ' ve got a whole bunch of friends . "
