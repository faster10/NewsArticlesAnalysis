" Let me make this perfectly clear , " Clinton said . " Never at any point did I tell Ms . Lewinsky to lie . Neither , for that matter , did I ever tell her how or where to lie . I may have said , ' Honey , could you shift your leg over a little bit here ? ' or ' Sweetie , try arching your back a little more , ' but that is certainly not the same as telling her to lie , or advising her as to what specific position to lie down in . "
