" We were all so young and gung ho , " McGlade said . " We thought we ' d better do our job if we didn ' t want the troupe as a whole to suffer . When you ' re on set , the cast is your family . Once you ' ve been in a food fight with someone , there ' s a bond that can never really be broken . It ' s hard for non actors to understand what it ' s like under the hot lights of the studio . "
