‘Mantards’ Look To Dominate The Beaches This Summer
Only the finest New York fashion designers would be hip enough to be able to call out upcoming summer fashions this early in the season.  Several male models showed the same amount of chutzpah by strutting down the catwalk in newly created ‘Mantards.’  The unique summer beachwear trend for 2015 was the talk of the annual fashion expo this past week. “Men work hard on their bodies too and we wanted to create something that really allows them to show it off,” says fashionista Lindsay Pulman.  “And enough of those hairy chests and backs.  This Mantard focuses primarily on the buttocks and groin area.  With so many older men using the Viagra and enhancement products, why not show it off?  Chests and arms are out this year so we’ll be making sure those are covered up.  Ladies want to see those muscle bound thighs and a tightly lifted buttocks.  The Mantard will surely make for an exciting summer season.  We cannot take responsibility for the population boom that may occur given the amount of sensuality that this will bring to your neighborhoods.” The Mantard material is a cotton, Lycra, spandex, polyester, and pleather blend that is reportedly waterproof and buoyant.  As with any new trendy outfit, you are encouraged to accessorize but the Mantard alone will retail for around $169.  None will be multi-colored but the solid colors will be offered in every color of the spectrum. You have to know someone who knows someone inside the most exclusive fashion circles to own a Mantard this year.  Start kissing someone’s ass who can get you one.  It will be worth it.
