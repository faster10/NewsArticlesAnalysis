" I totally woke up my neighbor in the room across the hall , " Rosenblatt said . " He looked like he might hit me , so I tried reasoning with him , but it came out all wrong . Instead , I found myself saying that the multiplicities and contingencies of human experience necessarily pose a threat to the tendency of any arbitrary power or ' authority ' to dictate oppressive hierarchical social structures or centralize power . Ergo , any attempt to establish hierarchies and centralized power according to arbitrary dichotomies of ' right ' and ' wrong ' behaviors was therefore not only morally and philosophically , but also politically problematic , and , in fact , oppressive . Man , did that ever not work . "
