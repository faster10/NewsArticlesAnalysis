Jeff and Irene McArdle , whose sixth grade daughter Annie had suffered exposure to lesbianism , were moved by the outpouring of support they felt from the community . " Our neighbors , the Slumans , have three children who were in Kimble ' s class , so they certainly had their own troubles , " Irene said . " But when they found out that our Annie had tried out for the volleyball team , which was coached by Kimble , they sent us a bouquet of flowers and a note saying they were glad Annie didn ' t make the team and was safe again . Knowing people care really helps you get through something terrible like this . "
