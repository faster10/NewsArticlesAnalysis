" When our old receptionist Janice left last year , we had a party that lasted maybe an hour , " Roberts said . " There were maybe 10 people left by the end . You ' d figure that on a Friday , people would want to go home and get a head start on their weekend . I didn ' t leave my party until 10 : 30 , and it was still going strong . If anything , it seemed to be picking up speed . "
