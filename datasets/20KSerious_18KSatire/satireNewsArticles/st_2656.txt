" Sometimes , when confronted with the majesty and mystery of God ' s vast creation , we can get a little overwhelmed . That ' s where jokes can help us keep our feet on the ground and bring the whole process down to Earth , " Lundegaard said . " It ' s like the time Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson went camping . There they were , staring up at the stars , and Sherlock asked , ' Watson , what does this beautiful sight mean to you ? What can we learn from this ? ' Well , Watson thought about it as hard as he could and , finally , he said , ' Well , Holmes , it means we are all just insignificant dots in a larger whole , and that even though the universe may be unfathomable , there is a larger plan , ' and this and that , on and on , until he was so confused he didn ' t know what to think . Finally , Watson gave up and said , ' What do you think , Holmes ? ' "
