The 3 ' x 6 ' varnished oak veneer end table , which Hennings said should easily fit into the GMC Jimmy of her new boyfriend , Dave Klapisch , was purchased by the former couple at a yard sale in July 1996 . Also acquired at the sale were a Rubbermaid juice pitcher and a tape dispenser , custody of which is currently in doubt .
