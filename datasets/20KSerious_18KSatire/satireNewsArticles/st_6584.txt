Although Davis is a member of the Campus Outreach Network for Tibetan Autonomy , as well as the Campus Anti War Initiative Coalition and the Campus Crusade Against Rape , her political awareness seems to have dissipated during the summer . According to sources close to Davis , the political science and women ' s studies double major has neither volunteered for the local chapter of the Free Tibet campaign nor organized a Tibetan freedom rally in her hometown of Lyme , CT . Davis has not passed out one pamphlet , and she has neglected to sign an online petition that has been sitting in her e mail inbox for weeks .
