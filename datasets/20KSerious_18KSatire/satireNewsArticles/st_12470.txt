" Unfortunately , country radio stations nationwide have ' She ' s Gone Back ' in heavy rotation , " NTSB spokesman Howard Stivoric said . " The steel guitar ' s wail invokes that cold , hard , lonely road she ' s taking back to where her heart ' ll stop breaking , and , well , that makes anyone who hears it want to turn right around and get on back to where they came from . For a country that transports 85 percent of its perishable goods by truck , a heartbreaking ballad like this one is bad news . "
