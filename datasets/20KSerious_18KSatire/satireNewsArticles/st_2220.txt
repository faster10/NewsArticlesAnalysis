At approximately 5 p . m . , Bishop began the 45 minute task of unwrapping the Radio Shack ET 290 Lighted Dial Trim Fone , entombed deep within eight protective layers of packaging . Upon opening the outer cardboard box , he encountered a four sided cardboard phone mount which slid out after a pair of styrofoam product stabilizing blocks were removed . After dismantling the inner cardboard mount , he discovered a freestanding polystyrene shell molded into the shape of the phone ' s handset and base , with two compartments for the phone ' s cord and optional wall mounting screws , both of which were enclosed in factory sealed miniature plastic baggies . Bishop then removed the polystyrene casing and cut through the underlying layer of protective bubble wrap , giving him access to the phone itself , which was housed in a multi twist tie sealed plastic bag .
