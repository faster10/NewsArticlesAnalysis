" A group of us went out for drinks at McGarvey ' s Tavern , " said Jerry Pittman , a mutual friend of the couple . " We were all having a good time until Frieda took offense at some joke Henry made about the waitress . She sat and glared at him for 10 minutes . It might have made everyone uncomfortable if Frieda hadn ' t scrunched her face up like a 6 year old letting everyone know she was mad . "
