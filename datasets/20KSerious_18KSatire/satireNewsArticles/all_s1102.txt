Kanye West has history of storming stages
Kanye West came just short of storming the Grammy stage when Beck was announced as the recipient of Album of the Year. Although West did not go so far as to take over the microphone as he did six years ago at the VMAs when Taylor Swift won the award for Best Female Video, his appearance, then disappearance did lead to a number of people from West's earlier life to come forward. Former kindergarten teacher Ms. Elenore Leonard, now 78, reports that a five-year-old West on more than a few occasions would take offense at not being the first in line to receive his hot lunch. \"Little Kanye,\" said Ms. Leonard, \"would so often butt the line and take the styrofoam container out of the hand of whichever child was first in line and then announce to the class that it was pure racism that he wasn't first. Thing was, though, we were an all-black classroom.\" The stage-storming behavior continued into third grade when a now eight-year-old West took exception to his female friend Elanna Moore not being awarded the top prize in a school spelling bee. After Moore had been knocked out in an early round for misspelling \"clothes\" (she spelled it \"close\"), West attempted to take the first-place certificate out of the hand of principal Sherman Walters as he was about to hand it to spelling-bee winner Sherry Hill. \"Everyone here know Elanna be spelling words better than anybody.\"
