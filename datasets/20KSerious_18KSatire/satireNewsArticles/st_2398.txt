" There ' s this one part where he ' s a real smart ass , and I feel like that ' s pretty hard to fake , " said Brouger , who went on to list all the films he could remember in which Spacey acts like an prick , and then later said that he wouldn ' t be surprised if Spacey ' s offscreen persona fell somewhere between his characters in Swimming With Sharks and American Beauty . " And take The Negotiator , for example . Even though he ' s a good guy in that , he ' s certainly not likable . Well , he ' s likable because he ' s kind of a prick , but I don ' t think that works as well in real life as it does in the movies .
