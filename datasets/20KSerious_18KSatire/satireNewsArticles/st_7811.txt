Nolan promised the new film would whisk children of all ages into the fun four color world of Gotham City , and delight them with whimsical surprises , including an extended car chase through a paint factory , zoo , and outdoor wedding a new Batmobile whose onboard computer is programmed with a childlike personality able to honk its horn to signal approval or retreat into an alley when scared and a humorous subplot concerning the inability of Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) to get a Murphy bed to stay down .
