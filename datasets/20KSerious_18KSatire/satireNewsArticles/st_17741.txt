" Mom made us go to stupid therapy , because she said we had to learn to communicate as a family , " 12 year old daughter Amy said of the sessions the family has been attending since March . " Now , every Tuesday from 6 to 7 p . m . , we sit in a circle and listen to Mom talk . It ' s driving everyone crazy , but try telling her that . She won ' t hear you , because she ' s too busy going on about her boring ' needs . ' Hello , there are other people in therapy here . "
