Cardinal Innocenti ' s campaign promise isn ' t the only one stirring controversy in the Vatican . Archbishop Emeritus Giovanni Canestri of Genoa was recently slammed for promising to reduce confessional penances for all Catholics by at least 10 Hail Marys , 10 Novenas , and 5 Our Fathers by 2004 . And , in a controversial interview in the March issue of the German magazine Stern , Archbishop Joachim Meisner of Cologne stated that , if elected pope , he would loosen the definition of a " viable fetus , " allowing abortions for Catholics well into the second trimester . In the weeks since the interview ' s publication , Archbishop Meisner ' s approval rating among Catholics has doubled , prompting outrage from lesser known cardinals .
