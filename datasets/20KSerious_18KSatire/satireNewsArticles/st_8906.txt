Signs will be posted to warn regular drivers that they must drive either under 30 mph or over 90 mph , and that their auto insurance is void in the special lanes . Additional wordless signs , intended for the reckless drivers themselves , will feature the icon of a swerving 1988 Mercury Grand Marquis with subwoofer lines emanating from the body and a mattress tied to the top with a single length of twine .
