" When Michael started working here , I thought he was really cute , " said Samantha Ringley , a coworker of Litwin ' s at Yellow Moon Graphic Design . " I didn ' t want to be wasting my time , so I asked him outright if he was gay . He started laughing and said , ' No , no , no ! ' After laughing for a long time , he said , ' I guess you could say I ' m straight but not narrow . ' "
