" As I said in John 16 : 21 , every life is precious , " Christ said . " This means every life , not just those who have already been born . My father , the Lord , feels the same way I do . In Jeremiah 1 : 5 , He said unto the prophet Jeremiah , ' Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , before you were born I set you apart . ' The unborn fetus is a sacred , living creation of my Father in Heaven and should be treated as such . "
