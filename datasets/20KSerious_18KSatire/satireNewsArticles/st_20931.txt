" I know that on his 21st birthday , he and some buddies took a road trip to Tahoe and went skiing , so maybe he just bummed around there for a while ? said Mark Murphy , recalling how his father was fond of repeating that particular story . " Wait , no he was born in ' 63 , so I guess that trip must have happened in 1984 , which means he still had a whole year of school left . I guess he could have stuck around Davis for a bit after graduation , but it doesn ' t sound like the kind of place you ' d stick around in at that age . It ' s just weird how the next thing I know about him is that he started dating Mom four years later in Boston . "
