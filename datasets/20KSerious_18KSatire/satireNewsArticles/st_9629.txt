" I ' m happily unmarried , and that really blows my parents ' minds , " Anna said . " Tim is getting married in October , and it ' s okay for Jack not to be married , because he ' s a guy , and he ' s only 21 . But not me . Mom thinks I should have a husband and a bunch of screaming babies at my feet . I ' m sorry , but if not wanting that puts me on the outside , so be it . "
