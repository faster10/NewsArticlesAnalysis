Said Ruutel , " We added each other to our MSN Messenger Friends lists and started forwarding each other funny internal memos . Arnold sent me an MP3 from his brother ' s kesco band , a traditional form of Surinamese music . Then I sent him a PayPal payment for just two kroon and said I was donating my budget surplus . We had a good laugh over that one . "
