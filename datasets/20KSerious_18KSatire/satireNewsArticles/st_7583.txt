" At Christmas in the quad , there ' s a contest for the best decorated lounge , and I know we ' re going to win , " Lorimer said . " Misako taught us origami , and we decorated the tree and with hundreds of little white birds . Then we made a sign that says ' Peace On Earth ' in English and Japanese . She ' s so awesome . "
