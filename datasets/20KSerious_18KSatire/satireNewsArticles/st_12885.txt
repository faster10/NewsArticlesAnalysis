That General Him Self , WASHINGTON , has told the Apron Wearers , these BAKING MEN , to take their Sifting Tools to some other Province , where their sinister Symbols of Whisk Rolling Pin might meet Success with Men of less Liberty , and where Lucifer ' s own Confections be gladly et , thus permitting their Destiny to fall into the floury Hands of the FREE BAKERS , but not in America here , where Men are Free to live and trade and toil as they will under the Claws of None , save for the benevolent Free Masons , and the Families Prescott , and Astor , and Winthrop , our Republic ' s serene and supreme Saviours and Over Lords for all Eternity .
