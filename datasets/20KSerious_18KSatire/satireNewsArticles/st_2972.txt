" We ' re doing everything we can to ensure the safe return of the ski , but as of now , we have very , very little to go on , " said Pitkin County sheriff Joe DiSalvo , confirming the missing equipment is one half of a pair of Rossignol S80s belonging to a part time Aspen resident . " The important thing is that we not panic . I assure you , we ' re using every resource at our disposal to find this ski and bring it home safely . "
