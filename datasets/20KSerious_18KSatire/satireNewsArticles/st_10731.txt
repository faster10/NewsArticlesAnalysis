" I must help these poor souls any way I can , " Hurley said . " If I don ' t get them to give over their bodies and souls to Jesus , they will be left behind when Jesus returns to sweep up the righteous with Him , sparing them the agonies of Armageddon , carrying them with Him to Heaven on the prophesied day of the Rapture . In the battle at the end of time they will be punished horribly by foul dragons and the demonic armies of Hell itself . "
