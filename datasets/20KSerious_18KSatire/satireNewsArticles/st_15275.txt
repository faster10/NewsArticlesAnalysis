" I don ' t like having to keep the kids in their little water wings , " said Michelle Barerras , a Grand Junction , CO , third grade teacher .

It ' s being replaced with a special ' Swimming Is Fun damental ! ' unit with an emphasis on surviving high waves and avoiding waterborne automobiles . Why ? "
