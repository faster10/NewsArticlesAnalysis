Tootho , a wild , disease ridden 2 year old rat from the urban hellhole known as subterranean Manhattan , has been impressing everyone from subway patrons to municipal sewage workers with his unflappable determination . Tootho may be a flea covered vermin with a 30 foot tapeworm in his lower digestive tract , but when it comes to making it through one more day in the city he loves , he has a look in his eyes that seems to say , " I demand more food sources . "
