Marky ' s band wasn ' t like the things that I like . I don ' t remember the names of any of the songs they played . I didn ' t recognize Mark at first because he took off his glasses when he was playing . If you have never seen Mark without his glasses , he looks weird , mostly because he is squinting all the time . He wasn ' t a very good singer but when I told him this after the show he told me he intentionally sang bad or something , I don ' t remember exactly . He sung through a weird box that made his voice sound like a vacuum cleaner . I told Mark that and for some reason he thought that was good .
