Pruitt ' s death is only the latest in a string of hazing incidents to plague Congress in recent years . During January 1995 ' s Capitol Hell Week , incoming Rep . Gerard Schuman ( D NM ) fell out of a fourth floor Capitol Building window to his death . An autopsy found Schuman ' s blood alcohol content to be four times the legal level of intoxication , a condition widely believed to be the result of a hazing incident in which for six hours he was forced to drink a shot of vodka every time he failed to correctly answer a question about Robert ' s Rules Of Order . In 1997 , a Capitol janitor found first term Sen . Mike Dewine ( R OH ) passed out in the building ' s boiler room , wearing only his underwear and covered in peanut butter and feathers .
