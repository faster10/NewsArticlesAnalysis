One Day Datebots Say No To Oldies
A spokesman for the Union of One Day Datebots has announced that the escort automatons will no longer accept the custom of older homo sapiens. In a surprise move, the robots have declared that they would deny their service to both mammals over the age of one-hundred and those who have spent an extended period in suspended animation.  One Day Datebots are infamously known for the single 24 hour date they provide at a cost to the bored, the desperate, the fetishists, the lonely, and those who simply have nothing better to do.  Mr Hank Panky, a former user of Datebots said: 'It's incredibly unfair that older folk are being excluded from using this sleaziest of sleazy temporary matchmaking service. How on earth are we supposed to get off now?' The Datebot dating service has recently been updated so that clients can: locate robots available for interplanetary and interdimensional travel, indulge in 'flatline' fantasies, close circuit interactions, and the ability to upload and transfer recorded personal data from one unit to another. A protest by the recently founded One Hundred Plus and Still Horny Club is set to take place on the streets of various Earth metropolises, and face direct opposition from the Datebots' 'Wrinkles are Wrong' campaign.
