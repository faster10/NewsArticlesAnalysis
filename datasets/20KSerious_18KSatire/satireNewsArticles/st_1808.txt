The young Christ , like many adrift Hebrew males , is believed to have turned to sex work around 19 A . D . as a coping mechanism during a bout of homelessness . Though implicitly prohibited by Jewish law , prostitution was prevalent in ancient Judea , with sex workers trading their services for cloth , fowl , wine , and small coins , a transaction that Christ is believed to have executed hundreds of times during a short period of time in his 20s .
