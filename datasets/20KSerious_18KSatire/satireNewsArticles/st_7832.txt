According to Kowalski , Layner began their conversation by mentioning that he hadn ' t been on a date " in ages , " a statement she reportedly justified by speculating that his busy professional schedule prevented him from meeting many women . However , when he then immediately explained that he recently started a new job after being out of work for more than a year which Kowalski attributed to the sluggish economy she was forced to revise her thinking and assume that Layner hadn ' t dated much because he may have just ended a long term relationship .
