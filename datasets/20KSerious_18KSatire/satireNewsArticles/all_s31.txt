Paul Krugman says you forgot something
Economist Paul Krugman thinks that for someone who’s not an economist herself, the article you wrote about him was pretty good. You adequately covered his background, and you clearly laid out his arguments why, in this sluggish economy, government expenditures need to remain high and interest rates need to remain low. It’s just, well, you know. You referred to him as “New York Times columnist Paul Krugman,” and, well, usually, it’s “New York Times columnist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman,” Krugman said. “New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize winner” is another option, he said. He wants you to know that it’s a question of convention, really, more than brandishing his accolades. But it’s a good article. It really is, he says.
