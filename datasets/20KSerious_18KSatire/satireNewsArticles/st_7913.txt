The Dale Earnhardt Memorial Wall of Fame will be open to the public after the conclusion , in whatever form , of the Daytona 500 on Sunday evening , as soon as race officials have declared the track area safe again . Fans are encouraged to leave flowers , memorabilia , or personal items at the foot of the wall for Earnhardt or any other recently deceased racer , as long as items are in good taste .
