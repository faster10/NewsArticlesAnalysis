" For too long , thou hast ignored the entreaties of thy Lord to let go of your wickedness and hatred and live together in peace , My children , " God said . " Thou hast refused the lion to lie down with the lamb , and My rod and staff have been of no comfort to you . Instead , you have continued to kill each other without ceasing . The time has come for that to stop . You want to keep running each other over with tanks and strapping dynamite to yourselves , killing women and children in pursuit of your extremist political positions , that ' s just fine . Let ' s see how well you carry out your murderous agendas under 800 feet of water . "
