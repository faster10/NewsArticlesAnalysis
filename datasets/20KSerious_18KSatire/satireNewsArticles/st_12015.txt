Though Wharton , 83 , has proclaimed things to be a shame in the past , her current usage of the word has been a growing cause for concern . Witnesses report that in the past 24 hours alone she has applied the term to a fallen tree , a graduation card to a grandchild that arrived late , and a news story about a golf course .
