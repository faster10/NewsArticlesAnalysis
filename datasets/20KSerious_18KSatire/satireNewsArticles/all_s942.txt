Wombles to tour seminal ‘Keep on Wombling’ album
The Wombles of Wimbledon are to reform to perform their classic ‘Keep on Wombling’ album. The Wombles were some of Britain’s favourite 70s non-paedophile – at the time of writing – music stars, and ‘Keep on Wombling,’ is considered a highpoint of their work featuring the profound ‘Womble of the Universe,’ and the thought-provoking ‘Hall of the Mountain Womble.’ Lifelong Wombles fan Simon Williams was thrilled. “This really is great news,” he said. “It’s going to be special, Uncle Bulgaria is known to be a real perfectionist so I can’t wait to see how he manages to perform ‘Invitation to the Ping-Pong ball’ live.” “This is definitely their best album, they started to sell out a bit after this and just do lots of commercial stuff, but stuff like ‘Tobermory’s Music Machine,’ is the essence of what the Wombles were trying to do.” The Wombles announcement follows a recent trend of music acts performing sets of albums from Brian Wilson and ‘Pet Sounds’ to Underworld and ‘Dubnobasswithmyheadman’. The popularity of these tours shows no sign of waning and fans hope that rumours of similar tours from St Winifred’s School Choir, the Goombay Dance band and Scooch are true.
