In the program , a boy named Mark becomes trapped in a nightmarish , Technicolor parallel universe populated by anthropomorphic talking hats . The central villain is Hoo Doo , an evil magician played by Reilly in horrifying makeup and facial prosthetics . Poor puppetry and cheap special effects contributed to the show ' s queasy , disorienting feel , as did the presence of dwarf actors inside the hat costumes .
