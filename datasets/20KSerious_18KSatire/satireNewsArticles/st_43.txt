" This war is not about oil , " Rumsfeld said . " Our decision to intercede against this dictator and not against the dozens of other ruthless dictators in the world is not about oil . France and Russia ' s opposition to this war is not about the purely coincidental fact that both countries have lucrative , pre existing oil contracts with Iraq . Furthermore , the interest of many U . S . corporations in the war has nothing to do with oil , either . This war is about liberty . Oil wells deserve liberty , too . "
