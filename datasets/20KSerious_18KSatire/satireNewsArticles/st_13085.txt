" This kind of thing isn ' t as uncommon as we ' d all like to think , " Ohlmeyer said . " A woman finds herself in a situation where she isn ' t employable . Or maybe she has interests like child rearing , cooking and home maintenance that keep her from getting a job . So what does she do ? She cooks up a scheme to entrap a man using her body as the bait . It ' s frightening , but it happens every day in this country . "
