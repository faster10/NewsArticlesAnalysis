" In conclusion , I would just like to say to all the gays and lesbians , against whom I have spoken out so vociferously throughout my career , I am sorry , " Thurmond said , shedding tears . " If an old man like me , set in his ways , can in his twilight years open his heart to a new understanding , not only of homosexuality , but also of himself , then perhaps it is not too late for all of us to see the truth . I hope you can find it within yourselves to forgive me . "
