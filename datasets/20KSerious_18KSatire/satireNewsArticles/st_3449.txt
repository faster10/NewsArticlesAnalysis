" When you enter Feltz Foods or any other supermarket chain , you should be aware that discounts can occur without warning , " Ludovic said . " Often , these supermarkets play by their own rules , such as claiming to honor the lower prices of competitors when they are only referring to advertised prices . Unless you feel you can fully comprehend the fine print and are capable of membership in a savings club , the best way to handle these situations is to politely decline any offers and calmly exit the store . Saving a few cents on kidney beans is not worth the stress and bewilderment . "
