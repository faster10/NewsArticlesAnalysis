" Kobe Bryant ' s is the knee all joint fluids dream of building up in , " the semi viscous mix of blood and uric acid said during a press conference at the Lakers ' training facility . " There were times , especially during the first two rounds of the playoffs , when I had to pinch myself and say , ' Holy crap ! You ' re inflaming Kobe Bryant ' s right knee ! Kobe Bryant . Not some role playing knee like Andrew Bynum ' s knee , or Kendrick Perkins ' knee , but Kobe freaking Bryant ' s . ' "
