" We have already approached NASA about the feasibility of launching Blockbuster store payloads to the solar system ' s outer planets , " Blockbuster CEO John F . Antioco said . " Our two tiered franchising strategy is to have several hundred stores on the moon , Mars , the main belt asteroid Ceres , Jovian moons Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto , the A and C rings of Saturn , and the Kuiper Belt asteroid KX 76 by late 2075 . From there , we should be able to open a Blockbuster on every corner of this spiral arm of the Milky Way by 2500 . "
