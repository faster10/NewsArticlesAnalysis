" I think we all believe that Barry has taken steroids , and that they made him into a hulking monster who rewrote the record books . But they didn ' t turn him into a hulking monster who drugged his wife and children into unconsciousness before strangling them to death and hanging himself from a weight bench . And in these troubled times , Bonds ' performance is one we can all reluctantly applaud . "
