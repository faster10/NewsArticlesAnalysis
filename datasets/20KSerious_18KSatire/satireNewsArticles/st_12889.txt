For Harris , rock is the only topic of conversation and the only form of entertainment . While other men his age go on dates or enjoy the sunlight , Harris haunts the rear corners of local rock clubs like The Paradise , where he sits alone , hunched over a notebook . During the day , he works in his windowless bedroom compiling facts about the city ' s rock history for his web site , BostonRockScene . com .
