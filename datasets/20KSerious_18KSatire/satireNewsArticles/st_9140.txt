The incident was not the first to mar a special assembly at Crestwood Elementary . In October 1997 , a performance by the instrumental group Eight Autoharps A Guiro was twice interrupted by cries of " Boring ! " from the back of the auditorium . This past March , a man dressed as Freddie The Fire Safety Frog was shoved from behind by a third grader invited onstage to participate in a " Stop , Drop Roll " demonstration .
