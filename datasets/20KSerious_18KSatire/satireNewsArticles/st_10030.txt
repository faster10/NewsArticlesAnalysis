AKRON , OH They say the family that sits silently together stays silently together . And no one proves that old adage better than the Bladners . Whether enduring an uncomfortable outing at a local restaurant , attending an unpleasant community event , or simply staring blankly at the television , this tight knit clan always makes an effort to spend plenty of awkward , silent quality time together .
