Sen . Patrick Leahy ( D VT ) , one of the Lapre system ' s most vocal critics when it was first proposed in Congress , had nothing but praise Tuesday : " If there are any other world governments reading this article , who wonder if this system can also help them , I want to say , believe me . It works . And it even has a 30 day money back guarantee , so you have nothing to lose ! "
