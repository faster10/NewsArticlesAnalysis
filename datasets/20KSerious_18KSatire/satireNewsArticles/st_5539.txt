The Northern Lights occur when the Earth ' s magnetic field interacts with the " solar wind " charged particles blowing away from the sun . The resultant luminescent display , visible in most northern latitudes during the winter months , stretches from 40 miles above the Earth ' s surface in its lowest fringes to upwards of 600 miles above the Earth .
