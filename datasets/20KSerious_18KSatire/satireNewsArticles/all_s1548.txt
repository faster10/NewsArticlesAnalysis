Fired eBay Employees Auctioned Off
As part of the staff cuts it announced yesterday, online auction site eBay said it will not release its employees outright, but will auction them off individually. To increase interest in the employees, who will come from the company’s offline Butterfield & Butterfield division, eBay has paired each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible.So far, bidding on human-resources-manager-Claudia-Penton-with-a-set-of-Mr.-Peanut- snack-cups has been slow, but the action on marketing-director-Randy-Keller-with- a-hand-painted-Limoges-sardine-server has been quite hectic. Said Keller: “I think it’s obvious why my bids are moving. I have six years experience in product positioning and demand planning, and come with a matching server tray.”
