The last photo in the scrapbook shows Diane with her husband and their 2 year old daughter . The studio portrait was particularly difficult to come by , as Diane has not spoken to either of her parents for four years . Hemmer obtained the photos from her daughter ' s mother in law , Candace Minsky , whom she ran into at the grocery store . Rather than reveal the rift between herself and her daughter , Hemmer explained that she ' d lost all her photos to a roof leak .
