" I didn ' t question the Lord when He struck down my beloved wife Emily with cervical cancer , " Gurshner said . " I didn ' t question Him when I was dismissed from my job and put on Social Security . I didn ' t question Him when He commanded me to dig a three foot ditch around my house and fill it with charcoal briquettes , and I don ' t question him now . I , James Harold Gurshner , will kidnap the Ford CEO , as that is the will of the Lord . "
