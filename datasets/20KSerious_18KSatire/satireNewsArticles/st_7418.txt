To arrive at their conclusions , study directors first identified the average yearly costs and benefits of life . Tangible benefits such as median income ( 43 , 000 ) were weighed against such tangible costs as home ownership ( 18 , 000 ) . Next , scientists assigned a financial value to intangibles such as finding inner peace ( 15 , 000 ) , establishing emotional closeness with family members ( 3 , 000 ) , and brief moments of joy ( 5 each ) . Taken together , the study results indicate that " it is unwise to go on living . "
