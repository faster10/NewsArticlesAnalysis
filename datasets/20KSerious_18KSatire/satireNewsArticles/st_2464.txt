" In the lunchroom at work , I usually sit alone , " Glick said . " But a few months ago , I tried sitting down with a couple of paralegals , just to see what would happen . They didn ' t groan and scatter like my classmates would have in high school . In fact , my coworkers didn ' t appear to notice me at all . Their conversation continued uninterrupted , and no one seemed ill at ease . I didn ' t even get a single wayward glance . After about five minutes , I got up and walked off . Now , I just eat at my desk . "
