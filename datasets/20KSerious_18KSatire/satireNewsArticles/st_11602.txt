" Somehow , people keep coming up with the idea that I want them to kill their neighbor . Well , I don ' t . And to be honest , I ' m really getting sick and tired of it . Get it straight . Not only do I not want anybody to kill anyone , but I specifically commanded you not to , in really simple terms that anybody ought to be able to understand . "
