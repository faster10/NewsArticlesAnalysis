Scott Stapp to Reunite with Creed, Vows to Record “Most Insane” Album Yet
Tallahassee, FLA — Saying that they were taking advantage of the recently elevated public profile of singer Scott Stapp, the Tallahassee-based alternative-rock band Creed has announced their intentions of a reunion, including a new album and tour. “For the last several years the fact was that Creed, as a functioning musical outfit, had been resigned to the dustbin of rock history,” The statement began. “Though it was nice to take a step back from the insanity of rock and roll for a while, we realized that thanks to Scott’s recent publicity it’s time to get into the madness again. Creed is BACK!” Though not officially disbanded, Creed had been on creative hiatus since 2012. “We kind of drifted apart after Scott had developed a severe case of writer’s block,” The statement continued, “All of the new material he had been presenting to the band sounded similar to everything else he had written. The same themes, lyrics, musical tempos, everything. We decided that instead of pumping out the same tired, formulaic, bland and downright boring album over and over again, we would give ourselves, and the public, a break. It’s obvious now, though, that Scott’s creative juices are flowing again! His new stuff is fresh, inventive, and original. It’s totally crazy!” The new album, tentatively titled “Florida, Personified”, is scheduled for a summer release.
