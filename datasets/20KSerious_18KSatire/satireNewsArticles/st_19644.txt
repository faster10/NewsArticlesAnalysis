" No woman , in this state or any other , should ever receive care from a medical professional incapable of climbing an 18 foot wall , " said Governor Phil Bryant , adding that it was " ridiculous " that women had been living in a place where doctors could perform abortions without first surmounting an obstacle approximately three times their height . " Any physicians lacking the necessary upper body strength to pull themselves up and over an 18 foot wall have no business performing such a potentially dangerous procedure . "
