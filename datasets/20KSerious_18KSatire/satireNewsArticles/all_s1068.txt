Bill Cosby promises "fun for all" at Ohio show
Embattled comedian Bill Cosby is scheduled to appear as \"a stand-up guy\" in a comedy show (of sorts) in Ohio, one of the few states in America, besides Florida, where Bill Cosby is actually considered amusing. The comedian will \"perform\" live in Sandusky, Ohio (no relation to disgraced pedophile coach Jerry Sandusky).  However, in the wake of multiple alleged allegations of the alleged rape or alleged molestation of alleged women over a period of several alleged decades, security has allegedly been bolstered in advance of the alleged comedian's alleged appearance. There are likely to be protests by the few Ohioans old-fashioned enough to believe that molestation is a crime and that an alleged criminal should not be able to continue to \"perform\" in public, nor should he be permitted to advise other black men to \"pull your pants up,\" as Cosby has allegedly ordered African-American youths to do. \"Nobody wants to see your black ass,\" he allegedly told black youths. \"Clean up your act, black peeps!\"  Critics suggest that Cosby follow his own \"damned advice.\" Security has been bolstered for the performance, not over concerns of protesters mobbing the event, but over concerns that men may be bringing their wives and girlfriends to the event. \"He can't be trusted around women,\" a female security guard suggested, \"he gave me a jello pudding pop once, it was the worst experience of my life.\"
