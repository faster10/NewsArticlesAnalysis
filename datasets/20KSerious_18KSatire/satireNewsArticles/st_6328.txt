The president addressed a special joint session of Congress Tuesday to rally support for a proposed 4 , state of the art shoebox for The Colonel . The taxpayer funded box , Clinton said , would be constructed of cardboard and feature a removable top and approximately six breathing holes in its side . He noted that the box would serve a dual role , functioning as both as a home for The Colonel while at the White House and as a carrying case during presidential trips abroad .
