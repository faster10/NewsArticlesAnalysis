" Misako ' s room is so great , " said freshman Rachel Alarie , 18 . " She ' s got cool toys all over the place , like stacks of these Japanese comic books called manga and posters for weird Japanese cartoon movies . And she has a PlayStation that only plays Japanese games . Everyone ' s completely addicted to this one weird game where a little man shaped like a domino walks through a grocery store . Once I stayed up until 3 a . m . playing it . "
