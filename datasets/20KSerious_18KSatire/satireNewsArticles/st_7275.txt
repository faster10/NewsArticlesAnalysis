Calling every woman special in her own way , Barbierri explained that he always tries to touch upon the individual qualities of each woman he greets . For example , if she happens to be drinking something through a straw , he ' ll ask if she wants something else to suck on . If she seems to be in a hurry , he ' ll ask where the fire is , and then subtly suggest that it may be , in fact , in his pants . And if her nipples are visibly poking through her shirt , he ' ll inquire if she is cold , and gallantly offer to warm those beauties up for her .
