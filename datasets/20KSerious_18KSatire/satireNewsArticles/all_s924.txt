‘Razzle: The Movie’ announced as follow up to ’50 Shades of Grey’
Producers of the new ’50 Shades of Grey’ film are so confident of its success that they’ve already announced a big screen adaptation of magazine ‘Razzle’. “People, mainly men, are incredibly passionate about Razzle magazine,” said Razzle producer Chris Paul. “So it’s important that everyone’s favourite bits from the magazine are in the film; Beccy from Wokingham sprawled naked on a Ford Cortina, made-up true stories about the reader’s incredible sexual stamina, and penis enlarging machines.” Lifelong Razzle reader Simon Williams was thrilled. “This is brilliant news,” he said. “It’s great that it’ll properly take the stigma away from Razzle.” “I thought that when that ’50 Shades of Grey’ book came out, it would take the stigma away but people still looked at me funny when I read me Razzle back issues on the Tube.” There is a concern that the younger audience will find it difficult to relate to the idea that pornography wasn’t always freely available on the internet but was actually something people had to actively search for in the hedgerows of country lanes around the country. Mr Paul was unconcerned, “No, trust me, Razzle will appeal to all ages. We might even dump some promo-porn in the hedgerows ourselves.” It is thought that if the Razzle adaptation is a hit we can expect adaptations of ‘Men Only,’ ‘Fiesta,’ and ‘Red Hot Shaven Ravers’.
