" I brought Rei a pair of gabardine pants with a salsa stain on the left leg , " Bern said . " But when I got the pants back , the stain was still kind of there . It was faint , but if you held it up to a bright light , you could see it . I wonder if maybe not getting rid of the stain was her way of telling a white , middle class oppressor like myself to mind my own business . "
