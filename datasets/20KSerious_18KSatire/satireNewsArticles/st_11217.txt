" There ' s this place in the neighborhood called The Crowbar that we ' ve been going to lately , " Ayler said . " We have the best time there , dancing and checking out all the guys . Sometimes , we ' ll just sit at a table with a pitcher of beer and rate all the guys ' buns as they walk past . It ' s so hilarious ! "
