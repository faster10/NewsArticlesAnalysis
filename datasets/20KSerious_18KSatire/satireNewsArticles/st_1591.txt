Among the 71 , 000 freed cows were 450 Jerseys from the Cumberland Dairy Farm near Prairie du Chien , liberated by a team of activists in a midnight raid . The cows were loaded onto trucks , then transported 100 miles north and freed in a forest clearing , where , as of press time , all 450 were standing around eating grass .
