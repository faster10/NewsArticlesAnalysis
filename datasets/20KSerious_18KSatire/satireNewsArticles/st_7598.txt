As the saying goes , you can ' t keep a good man down . Or , in this case , a good rat ! Despite pesticides , traps , flooding , a constant lack of food and the universal hatred of almost all other life forms , Tootho the Rat just refuses to die ! Will this toothsome rodent eat and do absolutely anything to survive ? You bet he will !
