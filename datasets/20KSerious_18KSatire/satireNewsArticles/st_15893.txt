" No one is safe ! " said President Clinton in a televised address from his campaign headquarters , which were recently relocated to an abandoned shopping mall . " These are not your friends , family members , and loved ones ! They will not respond to emotion ! They are vulnerable to fire , but the only way to stop them is to destroy the brain , or sever the spinal cord ! They must be destroyed on sight ! "
