" It wasn ' t always easy , " Dvorak said . " I certainly had my share of disappointing salaries . There were times when wondered if 56 , 000 was something I could attain , or if it was even what I really wanted . I guess it ' s normal to question what you want to make for the rest of your life , but still , it ' s embarrassing to admit that I once seriously considered 49 , 800 . "
