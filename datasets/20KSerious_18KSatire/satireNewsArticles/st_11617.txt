Said Angela Schlosser , a day nurse who witnessed the Divine Manifestation : " An incredible , booming voice said to Timmy , ' I am the Lord thy God , who created the rivers and the mountains , the heavens and the earth , the sun and the moon and the stars . Before Me sits My beloved child , whose faith is that of the mustard seed from which grows mighty and powerful things . My child , Timmy Yu , I say unto you thus : I have heard your prayers , and now I shall answer them . No , you cannot get out of your wheelchair . Not ever . "
