In order to create the illusion of filmmaking achievement , Bay was first filmed in front of a green screen while being presented a " dummy " award , a green cylinder roughly the size and shape of an Oscar statuette . Technicians next analyzed a real Academy Award borrowed from Ben Affleck , whom Bay directed in the 2001 film Pearl Harbor , in order to build a digital model . The team then took the raw motion capture footage of Bay accepting the dummy award and painstakingly rotoscoped the digitally rendered Oscar into every frame .
