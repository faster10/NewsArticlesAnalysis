" I do not understand why all these people hate me , " Chen told reporters . " I run a good laundry . My family has owned and operated this business for nearly 60 years . I grew up here in this neighborhood . We do dry cleaning , starching , pressing everything you need , no problem . We have good prices and even do emergency rush jobs for only small additional fee . I have done nothing wrong . "
