" We continue to do everything in our power and explore every possible lead both Cartesian and phenomenological to locate the aircraft as quickly as possible , " said Malaysia ' s civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman , who went on to say that authorities were still actively seeking tips from anyone claiming knowledge related either to the flight , or to the mechanisms by which consciousness arises , or to the question of why anything physical and finite exists instead of nothing at all . " At this stage , we can ' t rule anything out : not crew interference with the transponders , not a catastrophic electrical failure , not the emergence of a complex topological feature of space time such as an Einstein Rosen bridge that could have deposited the flight at any location in the universe or a different time period altogether , nothing .
