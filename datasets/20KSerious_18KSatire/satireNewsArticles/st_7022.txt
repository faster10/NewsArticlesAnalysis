" When we finally finished , Sen . Jesse Helms ( R NC ) started jumping up and down on the bridge yelling , ' Yes ! We did it ! ' and then he slipped and fell in the water , " Sen . Tom Daschle ( D SD ) recalled with a smile . " It was a little scary , because at first he didn ' t come up to the surface . But when he finally did , he just started laughing . Then I started laughing and , before long , everybody was laughing . And when I reached into the creek to pull Jesse out , he pulled me into the water instead ! You better believe everybody was cracking up after that happened . And , boy , did we ever splash each other . "
