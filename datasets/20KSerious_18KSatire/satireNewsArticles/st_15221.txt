" Governors have consistently abused state sponsored euthanasia , using it as a sort of barbaric crime control method , " said Lillith Tinsely , a spokesperson for Amnesty International , the organization responsible for convincing the Supreme Court to reexamine lethal injection . " Ethically , the procedure should only be used as a last resort , such as in the case of rapists or convicts who have committed incest . Otherwise lethal injection is murder , any way you look at it . "
