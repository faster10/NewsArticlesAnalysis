Since early last year , a growing number of states have indefinitely postponed the termination of prisoners by lethal injection until the Supreme Court rules on the matter .

Department of Justice , an estimated 14 inmates have been killed monthly by botched illegal injections since the ban took effect , compared with an average of 12 killed each month in successful illegal executions .
