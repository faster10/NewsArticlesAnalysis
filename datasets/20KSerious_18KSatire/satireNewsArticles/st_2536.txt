In addition to ketchup packets , the Turnbee pantry is crammed with hundreds of other restaurant condiments . Among them are single serving packets of Taco Bell " Mild " sauce , Arby ' s Horsey sauce , soy sauce from the Wok ' N ' Roll at Millcreek Mall , McDonald ' s Chicken McNuggets hot mustard sauce , pats of Shedd ' s Spread Country Crock from Ponderosa Steakhouse , and a selection of Smuckers jellies and jams from several Erie area diners .
