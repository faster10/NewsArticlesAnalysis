" I don ' t care what faith you are , everybody ' s been making this same mistake since the dawn of time , " God said . " The Muslims massacre the Hindus , the Hindus massacre the Muslims . The Buddhists , everybody massacres the Buddhists . The Jews , don ' t even get me started on the hardline , right wing , Meir Kahane loving Israeli nationalists , man . And the Christians ? You people believe in a Messiah who says , ' Turn the other cheek , ' but you ' ve been killing everybody you can get your hands on since the Crusades . "
