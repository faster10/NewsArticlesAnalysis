" I found a great Cheap Trick Dream Police tour shirt at a garage sale , " Ciszek said . " I couldn ' t believe my luck , but then I got home and realized I had one exactly like it buried under my other band T shirts . Until I can figure out what to do with these things , I ' m cutting myself off . It ' ll be hard , but I gotta do it . "
