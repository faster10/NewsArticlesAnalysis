" We had a few traffic snarl ups along Boylston Street by people who weren ' t ready for three trucks with bunting on them to come down the street in the middle of the day , " said officer Chris Cashion . " No arrests for public intoxication , no overturned cars , and only one woman bared her breasts . And it was a homeless woman who does that to all the truck drivers . "
