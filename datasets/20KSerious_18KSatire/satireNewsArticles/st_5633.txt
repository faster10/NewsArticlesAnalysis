" The orbital prison will be completely self sustaining , " said ISP lead engineer Li Xuanzhi , explaining that refuse , waste , and 100 randomly selected prisoners will be jettisoned into space twice each week . " The station will be equipped with thousands of custom built solar panels for converting sunlight to electricity , which will then be used to simultaneously power the entire facility and put detainees through electroshock torture . Moreover , a progressive new electrical grid will enable guards to adjust the temperature in individual cells to either negative 15 degrees or 110 degrees Fahrenheit . "
