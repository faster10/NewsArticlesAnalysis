Americans Told to Have Sex with the Dutch
Reacting to a new          report claiming young people in the Netherlands are less likely than their American          counterparts to          get pregnant or carry sexually transmitted diseases, U.S. health officials today announced that America’s teens          should have sex with the Dutch.   “If this study is correct, young people in the Netherlands are much          safer for our young people to have sex with,” said Health and Human Services          Secretary Tommy Thompson. “Therefore, if you’re going to have sex anyway,          the U.S. government would like you to do it with a Dutch person.”  Thompson added that officials in the Netherlands were not asked their opinion        on the new “Dutch sex is safe sex” program. “They might have said no,” he        explained.  Across the United States, meanwhile, thousands of high school students          were busily amending their virginity-till-marriage pledge cards, promising          to remain chaste until they meet a citizen of the Netherlands.   I want to wait for my true love,  And so I pledge this now much, I will remain a virgin till, I take my wedding vow I meet somebody Dutch.
