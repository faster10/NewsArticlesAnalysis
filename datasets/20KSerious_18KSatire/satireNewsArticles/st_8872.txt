" Sometimes Jeff will come by , hang out for a bit , " said friend Dan Werner , who graduated from high school with Koegle in 1989 . " We ' ll maybe watch hockey or go get a bite to eat if one of us is hungry . After a while , he ' ll say , ' Well , guess I ought to get going , ' and he ' ll take off . "
