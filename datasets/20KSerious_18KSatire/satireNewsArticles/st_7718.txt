" If I want to go out for pizza or a movie , all I have to do is ask , " Ella said . " I used to wonder why , and now I understand : I ' m supposed to be happier than my sister . I ' m really cute , and I get to have whatever I want my sister has a really big nose , so she doesn ' t . I bet Mom and Dad love me more , too . Who could blame them ? "
