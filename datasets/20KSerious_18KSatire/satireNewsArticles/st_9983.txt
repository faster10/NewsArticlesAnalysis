" As with any other health and safety issue , the key to prevention is education , " said David Baron , who started the foundation after his son was killed in a Cleveland area Regency Hotel laundry chute in 1997 . " If you accidentally drop a Nerf football or , as in Michael ' s case , half a Snickers bar down a laundry chute , walk down to the basement to retrieve it . At the very least enter the chute feetfirst . "
