" I ' m extremely proud of this book , which I think I ' d really have to call my life ' s work or , at least , the work of my life thus far , " Simmons said at a launch party sponsored by publisher McSweeney ' s and hosted by Malcolm Gladwell , who did not manage to find an opportunity to speak . " And it ' s a great book , if I do say so myself . I still think of myself as the Cousin Oliver of sportswriters , but today I feel like Dr J in 1983 . "
