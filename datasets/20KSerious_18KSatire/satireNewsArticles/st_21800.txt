" As I lose , I gain , " Angelou said . " I wing home to a place long forgotten . I swell as I recede , taking in all that has come before me . I molt . I shed . I diminish . But I feel no loss for I am free . My song slips its long confinement and joins the celestial roar . I was made of water , now I am air . I lose as I gain , but again I lose . I lose . I lose . "
