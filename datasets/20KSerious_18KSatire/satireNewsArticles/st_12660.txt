Everybody ' s doin ' the Kookamunga Twist ! At all night parties held in the country , kids are putting on dance records known as " techno " and doing a new dance called , that ' s right , the Kookamunga Twist ! The parties , called " raves , " go on all night , sometimes until three or four . Sounds fun , guys . Can I come over and give it a try ?
