" I ' m completely surprised I always felt that we could count on Quinn to totally blow it , but this is whole different side that we could never imagine , " Browns head coach Romeo Crennel said . " I anticipated that he would hand off the ball to the first defensive lineman he saw . I even game planned for it , keeping a fullback deep in the backfield to tackle him if he started running the wrong way . But then he goes and throws a basic little dump off pass to Cribbs in the flat and it turns into a touchdown . "
