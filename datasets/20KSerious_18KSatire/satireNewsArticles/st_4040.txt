Disappointing scene in Las Vegas as boxer Hector Ansada failed to kill his opponent Kent Sudder in the ring today . Despite Sudder ' s clearly out of shape physique and a referee with near criminal level tolerance for violence , Ansada was not able to deliver the final death knell that would have snuffed Sudder ' s spirit forever and send over 10 , 000 bloodthirsty spectators home happy .
