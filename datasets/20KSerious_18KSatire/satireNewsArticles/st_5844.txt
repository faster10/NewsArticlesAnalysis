Like many U . S . operations in Iraq , Operation Desert Santa has met with some resistance . A convoy transporting fruitcake and gingerbread came under rocket attack Sunday night just outside Checkpoint No l in Basra , and unidentified bands of Iraqis exchanged gunfire with Marines operating an armored Humvee simulated sleigh ride in a Baghdad suburb . In spite of these troubles , regional commanders report progress , with only eight U . S . casualties resulting from the operation .
