" At any given time , day or night , an estimated 45 percent of the nation ' s over the road truckers are idling on the shoulder , in waysides , or in truck stop parking lots , listening to Mr Hardin ' s ballad of infidelity , loss , and heartbreak , " said Russell Knutson , a spokesman for trucking giant Schneider National . " There ' s been an alarming number of loads that don ' t make it to their destinations . And the ones that do make it are usually behind schedule , because they ' re being loaded , transported , and unloaded by crews brought low by the thought of a good loving woman a man loves best packing everything up but her wedding dress and going back to the town she never should ' ve left .
