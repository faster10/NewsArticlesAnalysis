" A few years back , we did a yard sale , and I remember selling a ceramic mixing bowl , " Gretchen Farrell said . " It had a small chip in it , and I thought we didn ' t need it anymore , but before long , I started to miss it . Luckily , I found one just like it at the Anconas ' , and I got it for a song . It even had a chip in the exact same place . Amazing . "
