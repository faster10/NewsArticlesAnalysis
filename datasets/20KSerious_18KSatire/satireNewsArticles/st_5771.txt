When asked about His future plans , Christ said His next move will be to undertake the Hajj , the holy pilgrimage to Mecca all Muslims are required to make at least once in a lifetime . After that , Christ said He hopes to take a few months off to rest and meditate before starting the next phase of His ministry : traveling to churches around the world and imploring the Christian faithful to stop believing in Him .
