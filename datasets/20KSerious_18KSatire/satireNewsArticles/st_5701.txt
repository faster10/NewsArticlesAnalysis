" One time , we made something that looked like a ladle , but it had holes in its cup and a handle that bent down 90 degrees . The foreman told us that it was a soda can holder for an automobile . If you are lucky enough to own a car , sit back and enjoy the journey . Save the soda beverage for later . "
