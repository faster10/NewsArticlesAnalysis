" Why convene to donate time , money and personal resources to a being which exists only in fabulous legends and mythological ancient texts ? If we were to keep doing that , week after week , why , we ' d feel ridiculous , wouldn ' t we ? Plus , we ' d look pretty stupid as well . It ' d be like talking to a wall , and frankly , I ' ve got better things to do with my time . And I sincerely hope all of you do too . "
