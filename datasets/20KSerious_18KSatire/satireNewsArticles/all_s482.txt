Secret Obama-Wall Street Deal Revealed: Obama Wants US to Default
Documents obtained by the National Report from a source at a major Wall Street investment bank have revealed a scandalous deal formed between the bank and President Obama. According to the documents, the bank has been depositing tens of millions of dollars into an offshore account linked to President Obama. In return, the President has assured them that the US will default on its debts. In the last 10 days, the bank has ordered over $300 million (USD) in short sells on government bond backed funds, which could be worth well over a billion dollars in the event of a government default. This shocking revelation sheds insight into why Obama has adopted an unyielding “No Compromise” policy on the budget fight. By assuring that he successfully blockades Republicans’ earnest efforts at reaching a budget deal, Obama guarantees that the budget fight will continue past the deadline to raise the debt ceiling. Once the debt ceiling deadline has passed, the US will begin defaulting on its bonds, while Obama and Wall Street make millions. National Report attempted to contact Congressman Darrell Issa’s office for information regarding upcoming investigations into this matter but as of press time no response has been received.  Full versions of the obtained documents will be posted once approved by the National Report legal staff.
