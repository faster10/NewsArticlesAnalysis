Man Who Didn’t Watch Game of Thrones Forced to Fake It At Work
When all the talk around the morning coffee pot was about Game of Thrones, 33-year-old accountant Delwyn (not his real name) felt he just had to get in on the conversation with something insightful that cut to the chase. “I really love the Throne…all knifey and everything,” he said when there was a pause in the excited talking. Puzzled co-workers looked at Delwyn like he was a simpleton but he was pretty confident that there was in fact a throne in the HBO fantasy/drama TV series so he forged ahead. “I mean I like the Game part too but that Throne…oooo man…now that’s a Throne.” Delwyn is among the estimated 114 people who didn’t watch Game of Thrones and is also among an even smaller group of 48 who don’t know what the hell a Wildling is and only vaguely know that the series is about Lords and Ladies offing each other back in feudal days. “Once I realized it wasn’t just some fucked up reality show, I googled Game of Thrones…gratuitous sex and violence sort of appealed but for some reason I kept on flipping back to Mike and Molly,” said Delwyn. “Best I can tell Ygrette killed Pyp, then Jon killed Styr the Magnar of Thenn, then Olly killed Ygrette which really pissed off Jon and he stormed off to go kill Mance.” “Still don’t know how the Throne fits in to all that.” The HBO season four finale drew an estimated audience of 24 million viewers topping the 22 million who watched the final season episode of the fantasy/drama series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. “I don’t think I nailed ‘em with my Throne comment,” admitted Delwyn. “Hell, I got all boned up on that World Cup football crap just to be ready. And all they want to talk about is Game of Thrones?” “I was going to say, “I really love the new soccer ball…all artsy and everything.” Would have wowed ‘em.” “Now I’m going to have to get a Game of Thrones hoodie like everyone else I guess.” Full Disclosure: The author has not watched Game of Thrones.
