Federal authorities described for reporters a dramatic scene in which smoke bombs and flash grenades will fill the air as agents in gas masks methodically sweep through the individual ' s residence rifling through drawers , overturning furniture , slashing upholstery , and smashing in his car ' s windows to search for his legally obtained guns . The plan reportedly calls for ransacking the house as thoroughly as possible to provide the most dramatic visuals when television news outlets and other witnesses arrive on the scene , with several agents confirming that they ' ve been explicitly instructed to find a framed picture of the homeowner on a hunting trip with his sons , smash the glass , and leave the shattered photo face up on the living room floor .
