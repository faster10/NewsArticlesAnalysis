Seymour police chief Ron Byrne said the attack could easily have been avoided . " When I come to schools to talk to kids about the importance of dragon safety , one of the first things I tell them is , always be sure to turn around completely if you think a dragon is stalking you , " said Byrne , who happened to attend Sunday ' s show with his three year old son . " This monkey did not do so , and now he ' s paying for it . "
