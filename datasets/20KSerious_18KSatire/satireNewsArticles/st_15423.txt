Though he and Maas have dated for almost two years , Bertram reportedly did not recognize the severity of his girlfriend ' s near chronic dependence on getting out of the house and doing stuff until six months ago , when she insisted the two attend a free outdoor concert in their neighborhood . Since that time , Maas has asked an estimated 11 times to be taken to dinner , 17 times to go grocery shopping , and , on 20 separate occasions , has expressed a desire to go on a meandering walk without a fixed destination , purpose , or time limit .
