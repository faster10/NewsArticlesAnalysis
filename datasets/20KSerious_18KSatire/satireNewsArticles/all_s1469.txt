Hot Yoga Blamed for Global Warming
A new study by the Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF), a nonprofit "nutrition" organization with close ties to the meat industry, blames hot yoga for global warming.  The WAPF report has created a lot of additional heat for Bikram Yoga founder Bikram Choudhury, who, in addition to facing recent allegations of sexual harassment and even rape, is now accused of harassment of the environmental variety. According to Joe Mercola, D.O., of WAPF, "The gas used to heat the hot yoga studios, together with the gases emitted by hot yoga participants as they detox, is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire meat, dairy, and egg industries combined. And Bikram Yoga is, by far, the leading perpetrator." "Fortunately," added Mercola, "the solution to climate change is clear. Do less yoga of any kind, and avoid hot yoga altogether. And eat more meat."
