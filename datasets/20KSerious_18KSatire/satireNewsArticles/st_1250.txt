" Alternative spring break rules ! " said Michigan State University sophomore Nate Sherman , part of a student group who traveled to Waveland , MS to help a local family rebuild its three bedroom home . " Nick Torcello made this wicked beer bong out of some flexible ducting and a paint can , then we had a caulk fight and took bets on who could punch the biggest hole in the drywall with his head . We didn ' t get back to the work site until , like , 2 : 30 the next afternoon . "
