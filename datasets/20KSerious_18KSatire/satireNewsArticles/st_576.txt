" I saw some kid wearing a Sex Pistols T shirt the other day he couldn ' t have been more than 9 when the Pistols did their Filthy Lucre reunion tour , " Tolbert said . " I was like , ' You can listen to the music , you can wear the T shirt , but I was there . ' I had fifth row seats at that goddamn stadium , man , right up front , close enough to see Johnny Rotten ' s wrinkles . Did you see an original member of The Clash play during Big Audio Dynamite II ' s last tour ? Did you see two of the four original Ramones play at the KROQ Weenie Roast in ' 95 ? You did not , but I did . I swear to God , they ' re like a joke , these people . "
