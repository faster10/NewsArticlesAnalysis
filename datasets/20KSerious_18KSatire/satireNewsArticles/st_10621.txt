Utterly free to mingle with fellow incoming students in the Student Union or attend any of the numerous Welcome Freshmen activities being held across campus until the wee hours of the morning , Melton opted to leave his fifth floor dormitory room only once , at approximately 9 : 15 p . m . , when he entered the hallway and positioned a dry erase board on his door . Melton reportedly then gazed down the corridor , waved at a fellow student entering the hall bathrooms , drew a smiley face on the board , and retreated back inside before shutting and locking the door .
