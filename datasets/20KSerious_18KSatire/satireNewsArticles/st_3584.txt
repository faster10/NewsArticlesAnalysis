" If Bill Bradley wants to be president of the United States , the most powerful man on Earth , don ' t we have the right to know what kind of judgement he has ? Don ' t we , the American voting public , have the right to know if we ' re electing someone incapable of exercising good decision making with regard to popular music ? " asked Dolores Whittier of Pomona , CA . " The point is not merely that he was once into the Spin Doctors . The point is , knowing that he was into them , who would he be into as president ? Matchbox 20 ? Smash Mouth ? Sugar Ray ? Those guys who did the ' I get knocked down ' song ? We need to know about our leaders ' pasts if we are to have any hope of a better tomorrow . "
