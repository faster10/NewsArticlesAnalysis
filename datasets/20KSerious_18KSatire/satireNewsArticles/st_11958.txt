Several larger North American corporate states are already using GM farmers to perform specialized or time sensitive tasks . Monsanto Idaho has successfully used a gene gineered strain of Mountain Anderson farmer , noted for its ability to scale great heights and farm potatoes on the sheer faces of Rocky Mountain cliffs . A similar genetic model was used to create the MegaHusker , seven of which now cultivate 85 percent of Nebraska . Likewise , McCormick Beatrice has vastly increased the shellfish and kelp harvest off the Oregon coast by using fin and gill equipped Eugenic Mermen .
