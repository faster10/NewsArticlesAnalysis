People who demand to be forgotten online ‘can’t remember why’
Google, Bing and the other search engine have been deluged with requests from people asking to remove details from their past that may appear when people put their name in a thingy. But many found they couldn’t remember exactly what it was they wanted removed. One man from Cheltenham whose name can’t be used because we’ve forgotten it said; ‘Better safe than sorry. If people put my name in Google or Crosby they’re sure to find out stuff that, frankly, I’d rather not remember. So much so that I can’t even remember it now. But that’s not the point. I don’t want to remember it, whatever it was, so best if I ask the internet search engine to remove all stuff that comes up that is linked to my name.’ In contrast, one woman from Harlow said her memory was embarrassingly clear. ‘Oh god, yes, every detail,’ she said. She told us exactly what it was, but unfortunately we omitted to write it down, although we do remember sniggering at the time. It may or may not have involved a baked potato. Contacted later, the woman, who prefers to be anonymous said she couldn’t remember supplying the details of the embarrassing and professionally damaging incident in her past. ‘It’s just as well because if you did remember you would have linked my name – Enid Smythurst – to the incident with the fire engine and the clown costume. You would have put it in your online edition and I would have had to demand that it be removed. Luckily that doesn’t need to happen as you have appeared to have forgotten that the accident with the boomerang led to me receiving a 6 month suspended sentence and a ban from Colchester’s Asda.’
