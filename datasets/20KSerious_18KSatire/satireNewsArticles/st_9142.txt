Rumsell has urged those responsible for the attack to step forward . If no admission of guilt is made , he warned that all fourth graders will be kept inside during lunch recess for the next month , making everyone suffer for the inappropriate behavior of just a handful of disrespectful students . Rumsell said fourth graders can thank their misbehaving classmates , not him , if such a punishment is handed down .
