Bill Fletcher , in the hopes that he could make special mention of the company ' s plight in his sermon and encourage the congregation to keep CEC MidCorp and its shareholders in their thoughts and prayers . Touched by the request , Fletcher instead organized a bake sale to raise money to help CEC MidCorp build the tungsten carbide plant it had dreamed of opening .
