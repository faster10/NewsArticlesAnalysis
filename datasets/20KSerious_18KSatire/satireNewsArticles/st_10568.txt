" My earliest memories are listening to Enrico Caruso 78s on my parents ' Victrola , " Coletti said . " When I was seven , they took me to see Renata Babek in La Gioconda . What a thrill that was . I remember asking my mother why there were no other children in the audience . She told me they were all across town at Carnegie Hall watching Tchaikovsky ' s Queen Of Spades . "
