" The movie is pretty good , I guess , " read one comment card from a test screening audience in Culver City , CA . " I liked the Al Pacino character , but I had a hard time buying Jennifer Lopez as a lesbian . I also really , really wanted Affleck and Lopez ' s characters Larry and Ricki to die , to get shot or blown up or run over by something . I would prefer to see the blood and the looks on their faces . "
