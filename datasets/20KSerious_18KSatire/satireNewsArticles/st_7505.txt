" We were entering the Paramount Pictures lot for their studio tour , with Cousin Oliver bringing up the rear , " Horlick said . " As we all passed through the turnstile , we were stopped by a studio guard . At first , we all groaned , because we were afraid we were in trouble , and that Oliver had jinxed us . But were we wrong ! The guard had stopped us to say that Oliver was the one millionth person to go on the studio tour , and his prize was a chance to be in a movie with his friends ! So they dressed us up in old fashioned clothes , and we threw pies at each other , just like in an old silent movie ! It was the most fun we ever had , and it was all thanks to Oliver . "
