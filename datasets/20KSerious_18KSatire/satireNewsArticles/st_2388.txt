On Sept . 13 , during a shopping excursion to Wal Mart , Wenger purchased one flag to hang outside his front door , another for his car radio antenna , and a flag pin for his coat . A full page insert from The Utica Observer Dispatch provided another flag , which he placed in his garage door window . A fifth flag , in his office , was a gift from a coworker . After donating 20 to the Boy Scouts , he received another flag , bringing the total to six .
