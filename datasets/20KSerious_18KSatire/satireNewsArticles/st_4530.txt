The historic " Resolute " desk , traditionally used by the president , was made from the timbers of the HMS Resolute , an abandoned British ship discovered by an American vessel and returned to England as a token of friendship and goodwill . When the ship was retired in 1880 , Queen Victoria had the desk made and presented it to President Rutherford B . Hayes . It is currently housed in the living room of Washington , DC body shop employee Mike Koharski , who found it on the curb outside the White House .
