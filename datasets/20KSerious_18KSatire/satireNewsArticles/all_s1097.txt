Glastonbury To Host Classic Bands Weekend
There was some great news today when Glasgrambury organisers Sir Mickey Earies and his daughter announced a unique Festival weekend experience. Speaking at the launch for the event which will take place the weekend before the traditional Glasgrambury Festival, Sir Mick explained, 'Not all music fans are young and vibrant and want to see the current stars and bands. A lot of music lovers are a little more experienced shall we say, and remember the old bands and singers of the 60's and 70's.My Dad came up with the plan to get as many of the older super group types as he possibly could, to come together and treat the crowds to a real retro weekend.' Sir Mick went on to further explain that it hadn't all been plain sailing. 'There's been a few difficulties as you can imagine. Not everyone was available for one reason or another, deaths, and so on. It's been hard to book everyone we wanted for the weekend extravaganza but we are excited to announce that confirmed to play so far are, The Two Degrees, Crosby Nash & Young, Dave Dee Beaky & Titch, The Three Tops, Peter Paul & Mary's Sister, Diana Ross & a Supreme, The Dave Clarke Three and Lulu.'  Other artists will be confirmed over the coming weeks subject to good health and availability.
