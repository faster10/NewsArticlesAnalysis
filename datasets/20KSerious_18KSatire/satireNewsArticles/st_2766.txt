According to residents , what the teenager will do next remains their chief concern . Though he is not currently in possession of a shopping cart , residents believe that he may in fact steal one from the nearby Stop Shop , simply for the sake of inconveniencing others . Some have even speculated that the teenager may be planning to burn dead leaves later this afternoon , possibly with the cigarette lighter to which he no doubt has access .
