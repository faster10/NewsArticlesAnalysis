Washburn joins the ranks of a growing number of high school stars to skip college , including Lamond Broward of Asheville , NC , a 7 ' 1 " center who was a McDonald ' s All America selection for four consecutive years . Broward , who graduated high school in 1995 , is currently a permanent fixture on the furthest stool from the door at the bar of Mickey ' s Beef and Bar in Asheville , and is slated to commit an armed robbery while drunk early next month .
