" We ' ll probably watch Falcons Bucs , which should be pretty good , " Patek said . " You can always count on someone looking dumb trying to tackle Michael Vick , or how every sportscaster loves John Lynch and Mike Alstott just because they ' re ' throwback ' white guys . And , if I still have some steam , I ' ll probably invite everyone back to my place to watch the Packers Vikes game at 8 : 30 . Favre always gives you something to work with . "
