" The house will be rebuilt , or perhaps it won ' t , " Farber said of the destruction . " Perhaps an entirely new building will be built there , one that ' s not even a house . Or maybe it will remain a vacant lot , and a tree will grow there , and some day , long after I and everyone I know has died , young children will come here and play in its branches . "
