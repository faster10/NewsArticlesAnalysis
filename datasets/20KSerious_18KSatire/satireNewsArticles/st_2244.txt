" If I ' m in a maximum security prison , I need to figure out who ' s important and who ' s not , " Kroll said . " There ' s always the possibility I ' m going to have to be somebody ' s bitch , so if that happened , I ' d want to be with somebody who ' d protect me . But I might be able to avoid all that because I was pre law as an undergrad and could be useful to the other prisoners for legal advice . "
