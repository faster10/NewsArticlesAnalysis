Scientist predict life
Scientist at a university affirm that there are an endless number of planets in the known universe and based on this fact there are also many planets with civilizations billions of years more advanced than our civilization.  A new telescope developed by NASA is able to detect the atmospheric chemicals of distant planets to show the existence of complex organic molecules and other types of molecules. This helps to identify the types of advance civilization that exist there.  "We have determined that human like creatures inhabit most of those planet and they are not too different from us," said microbiologist Danial Haybird. "It's incredible that they think like us and they have self awareness," Haybird continued.  Researchers used computer simulations to predict how their bodies might look based on their gravity.  With computer simulation it was determined that only three types of hands can exist in the universe that would be capable of manipulating mirco technologies.  "We were able to create an image which is 90 percent correct." explains Haybird. All planets have a fundamental association with each other and we are the evidence that the universe is filled with life because we are part of that association.
