" Dick Cheney ? No , sir , Dick Cheney is dead , " general store owner Doug Leffert said as he packed groceries into a box . " Last person to see Cheney alive was Tommy Williams , the feller that killed him . Yeah , blew him up . Knocked him down with a propane tank and shot it . Heck of an explosion . Burned down the mess hall , too . All anyone found left of Cheney was his eyeglasses . "
