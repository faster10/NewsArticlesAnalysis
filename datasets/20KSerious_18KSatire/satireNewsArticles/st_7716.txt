" Girls who aren ' t as cute as I am will want to be friends with me , because if I like them , they ' ll feel less ugly , " said Ella , adding that , conversely , the opinion of a girl covered in gross freckles wouldn ' t matter in the slightest . " I bet I can make them do my homework or carry my books or anything I want . If they don ' t , I can stop being their friend , and they ' ll be really sad and have to be friends with girls who look as ugly as they do . "
