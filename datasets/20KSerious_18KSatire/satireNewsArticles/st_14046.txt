Sources said Trump then gingerly scooped up an injured pigeon and inspected the homemade splint on her broken wing , noting to himself that the limb probably needed a few more weeks to heal . According to accounts , the 70 year old came upon the wounded bird last month while walking through Central Park to sit and read beneath his favorite shade tree . Trump is said to have immediately taken the bird in and has reportedly spent nearly a month nursing her back to health .
