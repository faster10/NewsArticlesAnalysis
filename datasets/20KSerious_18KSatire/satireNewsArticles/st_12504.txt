Heaven , according to the New Testament , has " brilliance like a very costly stone . . . of pure gold , like clear glass . . . " with " twelve gates . . . each gate a single pearl . " Yet the pope , who spoke from the afterlife , said heaven is nothing like the " solid gold city " detailed at length by John of Patmos in the Book of Revelations .
