" The system does an excellent job taking into consideration things that poll voters don ' t even think about : strength of schedule , whether or not the team won their conference , total distance the teams ' fans are willing to travel for bowl games , average amount spent on souvenirs by alumni , and grade point average . After all those things , it ' s Ohio State , baby . And only Ohio State . "
