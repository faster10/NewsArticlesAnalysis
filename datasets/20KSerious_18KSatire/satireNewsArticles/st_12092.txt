Monday ' s arrest is only the latest in a long string of legal troubles for the controversial Greenspan , who has had 22 court dates since becoming Fed chief in 1987 . Economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on CNN ' s Moneyline , during which he unleashed a profanity laden tirade against Bureau of Engraving Printing director Larry Rolufs and punched host Lou Dobbs when he challenged Greenspan ' s reluctance to lower interest rates . In November 1993 , he was arrested after running shirtless through D . C . traffic while waving a gun . And some world market watchers believe the international gold standard has still not recovered from a May 1998 incident in which he allegedly exposed his genitals on the floor of the Tokyo Stock Exchange .
