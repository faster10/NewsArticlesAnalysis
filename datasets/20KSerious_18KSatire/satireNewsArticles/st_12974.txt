" I believe Mr Horkheimer has enormous subconscious resentment that the most significant astronomical find in years was made by two amateur astronomers and not by him , " said noted psychiatrist Dr Eli Wasserbaum , who recently visited Horkheimer in the hospital . " He blames himself and is tormented by guilt that he was not watching when the comet appeared . During my visit , over and over , in a half conscious murmur , he kept saying , ' Why didn ' t I keep looking up ? Why didn ' t I keep looking up ? ' "
