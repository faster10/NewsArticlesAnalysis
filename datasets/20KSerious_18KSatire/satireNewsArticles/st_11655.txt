Thus far , God has not played favorites , thanking such fallen off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong . The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little known likes of Baby Tragic , DJ Phreek Malik , and Da Ill Collector MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip hop community has heard of them . All rappers , God explained , are equal in His sight , and none are too small to escape His notice .
