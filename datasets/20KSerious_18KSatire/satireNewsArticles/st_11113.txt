" My mom won ' t let me play with my RoboFighter because of those dumb kids who died , " said 10 year old Jeremy Daigle of Somerville , MA . " I used to set up army guys around the RoboFighter and have it run over them and conquer Earth for the Zardaxians . But now I ' ll never see it again , all because three stupid idiots had to go and wreck everything . "
