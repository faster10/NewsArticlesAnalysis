According to leading puppet psychologist Dr Gary Wisniewski , violence has grown increasingly common in the puppet world . " Puppets have very limited free will , " said Wisniewski , whose clients include such celebrity puppets as Howdy Doody and X the Owl . " They are controlled by strings or by a human hand , and are continually forced to mouth the words of others . In addition , their environment is limited to the small , cramped puppet theater stage . As a result , many puppets develop deep feelings of helplessness , anger and frustration , feelings that can very easily lead to violence . "
