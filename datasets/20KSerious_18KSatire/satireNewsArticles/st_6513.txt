" Right after the operation , Dr William Homsey handed me a newly minted two bits with the Statue Of Liberty on it , " Pfaff said . " I can ' t see too good anymore , but I could feel with my thumb the outline of the Empire State with proud Lady Liberty holding up her torch . As soon as they took me out of intensive care , I went straight to the official U . S . Mint state quarter collector ' s board on my nightstand and stuck the coin right in the New York slot . That was the best I ' d felt in a while . "
