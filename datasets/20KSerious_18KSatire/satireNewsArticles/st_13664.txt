" I spent a lot of time on Sunday tracking my maid down , " said Edwina Haversham , head of the Haversham Insurance Trust Ladies ' Board . " I had to find out her name , and then I had to get her phone number from one of the other help , and then I actually had to speak with her family . It was a horrible , exhausting bother , and for what ? Just to find out that she ' d been killed , and I had to hire a new girl anyway . "
