" I ' ve had a long time to think about what I ' ve done to you all , and I realize now that it was wrong , " Hurricane Katrina reportedly told residents . " I knew I shouldn ' t have been coming in so fast , but I guess I didn ' t know my own strength . A lot of people have blamed the levees , but if I ' m truly honest , I knew they wouldn ' t hold . It was stupid of me , and for that , I apologize . "
