" My friends , I ' m not going to be around much longer , so I want to tell you this , " said McCain , a decorated Vietnam war hero . " I am for same sex marriage if it ' s implemented in an incremental way that makes sense . I am for a woman ' s right to choose . I believe that human beings have caused this planet to overheat , and that those of you ignoring this issue should be ashamed of yourselves . Immigrants who arrived here as children should be given a path to citizenship . And the income gap in this country is unacceptable . I have always believed these things . And I also believe that this party ' s hard turn to the right is detrimental to the well being and progress of this entire country . "
