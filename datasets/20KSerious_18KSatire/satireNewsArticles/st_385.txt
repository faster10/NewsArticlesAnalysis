" Riyadh Fashion Week is the place to be to check out the newest styles and kill the women wearing them , " said local fruit seller Salman Awad , who claimed that this was his favorite of the six Fashion Weeks he ' s attended , as he was able to take out the eye of a model wearing a brocade tunic at Tuesday ' s Vivienne Tam show . " My friends and I made sure to line up outside the tents before dawn to get good seats close to the front . It ' s a lot easier to hit them in the head that way . "
