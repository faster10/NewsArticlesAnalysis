" Speaking of children ' s sermons , here ' s a funny little story for you , " Lundegaard said . " This pastor was talking to a group of kids and , to illustrate a point , he asked , ' Does anybody know what ' s small , furry , has a bushy tail , and runs up trees looking for nuts ? ' All the kids were silent but , finally , one little boy said , ' Well , I know the answer is Jesus , but it sure sounds like a squirrel to me ! ' "
