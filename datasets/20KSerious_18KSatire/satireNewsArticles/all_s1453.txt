Comet Lovejoy in near miss with International Space Station
The Cosmos - Astronauts aboard the ISS were carrying out a critical damage assessment after part of Comet Lovejoy C/2014 Q2 struck the Station's septic tank and sent six months' of space shit into the Quadrantids shower. Emergency works to the tank's blow-out converter have temporarily fixed the problem according to Station commander Yuri Gagarin who emerged from decontamination to post an update. "A chunk of the comet hit us at oh-six hundred," Gagarin explained as an extensive hose-down continued. Lovejoy's trajectory was being videoed by ISS crew who likened its erotic - uh, erratic! - trajectory to a drunk in charge of a juggernaut just as a piece of the comet tail struck. The huge green-colored sun-grazer had been orbiting around the constellation Lupus the Hare close to low-lying Sirius the Dog Star. "We're calling it a Hare of the Dog incident," Gagarin added. Space plumbers will now work around the clock to unclog the Quadrantids shower before any more contaminated debris hits the fan.
