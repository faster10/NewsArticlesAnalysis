Bill Cosby Rape Accusations Absolutely Without Merit, Greedy Charlatans Exposed!
On Tuesday the worldâ€™s first self-proclaimed supermodel, turned desperate gold digger Janice Dickinson, accused Bill Cosby, the American comedian, actor, author, television producer, educator, musician, activist and veteran stand-up performer, of rape during an interview on Entertainment Tonight (ET). Dickinson is the latest among a handful of sleazy harlots of ill-repute to come forward publicly in their declining years to cash in on a mega payday before the 77 year-old preeminent black comedian of TV and film stardom can enter the afterlife and rest in peace. Itâ€™s a terrible sign of our times thatâ€™s becoming all too familiar involving elderly women who once imagined themselves as big Hollywood starlets but whose limited faux careers at best put them on a list of B-rate talent who now are desperate to see their names grace the front page headlines and to collect a fat payday at the cost of a successful minority. Cosbyâ€™s successful career has made him second among black actors / entertainers for net worth which makes him a fat target for these talentless drug addled aging B-list sluts who feel cheated out of the fame and stardom they insist Cosby stole from them. Martin Singer, Cosbyâ€™s attorney responded to the allegations stating the story is â€œa lie.â€ Singer pointed out that Dickinsonâ€™s insatiable rape fantasies of being made helpless to be violated by a man of color was revealed on ET and directly contradicts her previous statements in her autobiography and during a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer. â€œThat interview a dozen years ago said, â€˜she didnâ€™t want to go to bed with him and he blew her off,â€™ â€œ Singerâ€™s statement said Wednesday. â€œThe only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off. Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinsonâ€™s own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie.â€ Itâ€™s a shameless ploy frequently used today by long forgotten bitter old hags whose narcissism will not permit them to realize theyâ€™ve always been an insignificant side note to someone elseâ€™s life. Fearing their irrelevant lives and meager careers have long been forgotten these troubled Hollywood Boulevard tramps often become consumed by their insecurities and feelings of utter worthlessness leading to depression, self-contempt, and disgrace. Most of these depreciated old skanks will fabricate some ludicrous tale of sexual assault decades after they claim the incident(s) occurred. This way they can destroy reputations, smear an individualâ€™s successful career, and in this case taint Cosbyâ€™s good name by rousting a bunch of dizzy unattractive lesbians, obese sweathogs whoâ€™ve angrily remained virgins throughout life since even a blind man knows when heâ€™s latched onto a pig and the worthless women libbers whose bitterness and hatred of men will bring these old whores out to join any crusade involving a paltry and insignificant woman who screams sheâ€™s a victim though no evidence exists to support their fabricated malicious and destructive fictional accounts of abuse. And in todayâ€™s digital age where any moron can claim anything they want and spread it across the Internet weâ€™re already seeing the damning effects of groundless accusations. In spite of not having a single shred of evidence against Cosby, Netflix, NBC and TV Land have terminated future projects involving Cosby, or have removed Cosby entertainment from their programming. These inconsequential women well know the wreckage they can cause by making unsubstantiated and baseless allegations. They also know important luminaries whoâ€™ve earned their wealth and reputations through hard work, education, charitable works and living a moral life in the footsteps of Jesus will settle out of court to avoid enormous legal fees, courtroom drama and bad press. Aiding and abetting these talentless dried up old skanks is knowing when to strike. In order for their rape fantasies of being banged by a well hung black stud and mega-superstar to work in the court of public opinion these Godless sluts know the right time to strike is well beyond the ability of forensic science that could be used to either support their allegations or clear Cosbyâ€™s good name. Now it doesnâ€™t matter if the accused did it or not, all that matters in the court of public opinion is the ability of these fading and forgotten B-list hacks to shed a tear and make up any story thatâ€™s barely plausible in order for them to hit the jackpot thatâ€™s always eluded them in life. Remember this devious and desperate money grabbing fraud only works as long as there is no evidence to challenge the accuserâ€™s lies. Using this scam gives these Godless tarts unrestricted license to level any charge against this decent, charitable God-fearing Christian family man. If any of these blown out, high mileage paltry strumpets of the night possess a shred of decency they know their fat payday is coming with no possibility of prosecution, a messy and inconvenient fact finding investigation and without the possibility to summons witnesses who could contest the accuserâ€™s gratuitous sexual fantasies of being helpless and conquered by the strapping big black buck of Cosbyâ€™s youth. Bill Cosby, is the black father us white kids never had growing up. During the 60s, 70s and 80s Americaâ€™s youth respected and looked up to Cosby and tried to emulate his success, his genuine integrity and his passion for life. And the fact remains unchangedâ€¦ there isnâ€™t a grain of truth nor a single shred of evidence other than the words of these bitter and desperate old nasty hacks against the man.
