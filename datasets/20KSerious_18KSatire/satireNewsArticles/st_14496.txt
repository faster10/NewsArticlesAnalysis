Although Hayes has not yet responded to Knightley , he confirmed that several additional replies have already arrived from the actress , each longer and more involved than the last . A letter from Knightley postmarked two days ago contained a variety of highlighted newspaper clippings related to recent happenings in the actress ' s life and career . Another postmarked the same day contained an 80 point questionnaire with such queries as " What is your favorite cozy thing to do on a rainy afternoon ? " and " Do you think I ' m cool ? Dont lie , lol . "
