Inspired by Whitehouse.gov Petition, Obama Will Issue Executive Order to Federally Recognize Muslim Holidays
In a White House press briefing held Friday, Press Secretary Jay Carney responded to questions posed about the multiple whitehouse.gov petitions currently advocating federal recognition of Muslim holidays, such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Press Secretary Carney noted that: “While these petitions have not yet reached the required 100,000 signature minimum to warrant a response from the White House, President Obama personally feels that this is such an important issue that he has decided that the White House will address them now.”   “President Obama will make use of his ability to declare federal holidays through executive orders to declare both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha federal holidays until Congress is able to make them permanently recognized holidays. President Bush utilized this power to declare a federal holiday in remembrance of President Ronald Reagan. The White House feels strongly that since the Christian holiday of Christmas is a federally recognized holiday, Muslim holidays should also be recognized.” This policy decision should not be a shock, as President Obama has previously shown strong support of the Muslim community, including personally funding a Muslim museum during the government shutdown. Additionally, American cities have been inundated with requests to abide by Muslim laws, including one instance in which Muslim residents voted to implement Sharia Law.
