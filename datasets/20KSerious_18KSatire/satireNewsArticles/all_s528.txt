Top Naval Brass Claims, “We Have No Record Of Robert O’Neill Ever Serving In The Navy”
Rob O’Neill has forsaken his sacred oath to the US government by going public with the top secret information that it was he who pulled the trigger on Al-Qaeda terrorist, Osama Bin Laden. O’Neill isn’t being hailed as a hero by his Navy brothers, quite the contrary, many officials are even saying they’ve never heard of the supposed Navy Seal, accusing O’Neill of being a fraud who is merely going public for publicity. Navy spokesman, Samuel Jefferies, told National Report, “I’ve seen the photographs of him in uniform and have heard his admissions, but we have no record of a Robert O’Neill. No SEAL would ever go public with classified information. It’s absolutely disgraceful and not the sort of behavior we instill in our solders.” O’Neill, who stated in an interview with the Daily Mail that he was the person who pulled the trigger and killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011, is currently declining any further contact with the media. It’s speculated he could be gearing up to publish a book about his top secret mission. The supposed hero is set to give a full interview later this month with Fox News. In addition to taking credit for the killing of Bin Laden, O’Neill also claims to have played the lead role in the rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates and prides himself on being rewarded as many as 52 times including two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars with Valor, a Joint Service Commendation Medal with Valor, three Presidential Unit citations, and two Navy/Marine Corps Commendations with Valor.
