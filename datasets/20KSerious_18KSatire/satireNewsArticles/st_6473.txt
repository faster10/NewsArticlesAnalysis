" The Church already had 450 years of Italian popes , " Maradiaga said . " After 27 refreshing years with a Polish pope , do you really think people are going to want to go back to Italian popes again ? Just because the Vatican is in Italy , that doesn ' t mean the pope ' s got to be Italian . With so many Catholics in South America , the times call for a Latin man of God to don the miter . And that Latin man of God is going to be me , may He strengthen my faith with proofs . "
