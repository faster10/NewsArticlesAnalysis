" She had such a big crush on him , it was crazy , " Harrison said . " She ' d call his house and hang up . She ' d draw pictures for him , but never send them . If she wasn ' t looking him up online , she was talking about him endlessly . She finally got the courage to e mail him , but he never responded . I don ' t think I ' ve ever seen her so depressed . The only reason she finished Order Of The Phoenix was because she knew it would outsell all his books put together . "
