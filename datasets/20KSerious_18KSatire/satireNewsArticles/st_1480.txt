" A lot of the time , I ' ll have to plug in my laptop or Kindle so I can keep using it , but the electrical outlet is just this white piece of plastic that doesn ' t move or give me badges or anything there should be some display there that I can look at instead , " said Elizabeth Cantanzaro of El Paso , TX . " And when I look at my remote control for my TV , all the buttons just have a bunch of numbers on them . Who wants to see that ? Those should all be screens too . "
