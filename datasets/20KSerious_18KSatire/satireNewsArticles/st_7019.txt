" I was really scared to lean back and fall into Orrin Hatch ' s arms , " Sen . Carl Levin ( D MI ) said of Saturday afternoon ' s " Open Arms " workshop . " After all , this was a man who blocked countless pieces of legislation I ' d tried to pass over the years . But when I finally worked up the nerve to do it and he caught me , I realized I ' d just been saved from physical harm by someone I thought was my enemy . Right then , my eyes were opened , and I thought , hey , I ' m around good people in Congress . "
