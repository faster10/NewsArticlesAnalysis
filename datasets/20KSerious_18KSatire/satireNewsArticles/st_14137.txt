" Coach Fayerweather was probably the most brilliant offensive mind in the history of Northamptonshire football , " said Garrett , adding that Fayerweather began the centuries old line of coaches that eventually went on to include Bill Walsh , Dennis Green , and Brian Billick . " His scheme at the time was based on his strong belief in a very conservative , run heavy approach . He faced a lot of criticism from his peers for having what was considered to be a puritanical coaching philosophy , and so he and much of his staff decided to leave England for the New World . "
