Cured Ebola Doc Sneezes at NYC Press Conference
The press conference started out without incident, as scores of medical workers, hospital officials, politicians, and reporters crowded around the cured doc to wish him well as he was released from a NYC hospital.  Warm wishes, hugs, and handshakes were exchanged as folks pushed and shoved to get as close as possible to the main attraction and make sure they were part of the photo opportunity.  Then it happened. A loud sneeze erupted from the "cured" doc, just as he stepped up to the microphone to address the crowd. Uh-oh.  A mad rush to the exits followed. End of press conference. The Ebola doc took it all in stride, asking the one lone reporter (an always-prepared former Boy Scout, he was wearing a hazmat suit) who remained, "Hey man, can you spare a tissue?"
