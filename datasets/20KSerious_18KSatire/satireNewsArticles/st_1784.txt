" What ' s puzzling about this , " Cambridge University archaeologist Sir Ian Edmund White said , " is that skeletons would not benefit from harvested crops , as any food taken orally would immediately fall through the hole behind the jaw and down through the rib cage , eventually hitting the ground . Our best guess is that they scared away a group of human farmers , then remained behind to haunt the dwelling . Or perhaps they bartered goods in a nearby city to acquire skeleton accessories , such as chains , coffins and tattered , dirty clothing . "
