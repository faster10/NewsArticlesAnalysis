" I know I might be listening to my heart more than my brain here , but something inside me keeps telling me to go for it , " Milch said . " I ' ve never wanted to do anything else . I ' ll take low pay , I ' ll work under fluorescent light , I ' ll telecommute if I have to just let me do what I ' m meant to do . "
