The incident is considered the worst failure to impress a Lundegaard at Hampton Middle School since 1988 , when eighth grader Rodney Siefert purchased a pair of boat shoes in an attempt to impress Jennifer Lundegaard , then 14 , Becky ' s older cousin . The attempt turned tragic when Siefert made the sartorial blunder of wearing the boat shoes with socks , incurring the derision and scorn of his more fashion forward peers .
