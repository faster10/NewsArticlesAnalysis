ROCKFORD , IL Nick Sundin used to be neurotic about littering . The 37 year old pediatrician admits he kept trash bags in his car , and would even pick up and throw away garbage he found on the street . Since boyhood , Sundin said , he was keenly attuned to the environmental degradation littering caused , an attitude triggered by the famous Keep America Beautiful " Crying Indian " public service announcement he saw on television as a young man .
