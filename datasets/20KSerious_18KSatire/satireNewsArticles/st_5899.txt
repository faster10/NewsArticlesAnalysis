For those who still want to worship , if not God , but just something , Leobald has started a Sunday morning group called The Church of Imaginary Make Believe Land , where churchgoers will have their choice of nonexistent beings to submit to . Some of the worship selections include Poseidon , super agent James Bond and fabled storybook character Peter Pan . " I ' m worshipping Peter Pan , " Gladys Fye , 108 , said . " I do so love his adorable little pointed green shoes . Oh , that Tinkerbell with her magic dust . "
