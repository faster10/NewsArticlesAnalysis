" Dear Mother and Father Anderson , " the most recent letter read , " Thank you once again for your generous gift . I was able to get my immunization shots and enough milk and flour to feed myself and to buy some new clothes for school . Because milk was cheaper this month , I had a little money left over and was able to buy materials to fix my football , or , as you call it in America , soccer ball . "
