" The word ' nigga ' means different things depending on how it ' s used and who ' s saying it , " rap legend and Public Enemy frontman Chuck D said . " Judging from context , God obviously wasn ' t being derogatory . He was using ' nigga ' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene . At one point , He said , ' I wanna give a shout out to Ad Rock , MC Serch , and my man Dan The Automator all y ' all is real niggaz in My all benevolent sight . ' Considering the fact that Ad Rock and Serch are Jewish , and the Automator is Asian American , it ' s clear God isn ' t talking about race here . He ' s just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him . "
