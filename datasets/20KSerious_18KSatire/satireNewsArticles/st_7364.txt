" If there ' s anything I ' ve learned from Arthur ' s passing , it ' s that you need to cherish every moment you have with your customers , whether they ' re rewards members or not , " said ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson . " Even our most beloved customers who regularly fill up their RVs are going to die eventually . It happens to everyone . " " It ' s important to keep the consumers you care about close while you still can , because when they pass away , they ' ll never register another point of sale transaction with you ever again , " added Tillerson , appearing to hold back tears . " But it ' s just so hard . There ' s nothing I want more than for Arthur to pay 100 to fill up the tank of his Chevy Silverado one last time . "
