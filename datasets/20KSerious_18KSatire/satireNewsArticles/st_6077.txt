Davis went on to say that certain events , such as massive , uncontrollable wildfires across the U . S not just restricted to the American West , but in areas including Florida and New England would render climate change deniers open to reevaluating the decades ' worth of data that show the planet is warming at a catastrophic rate . Additionally , Davis said that for the community to begin believing a single word of any scientific journal article corroborating climate change , every one of Earth ' s glaciers would have to retreat at a rate exceeding 20 miles per year , and each of the skeptics , individually , would have to go a decade without seeing naturally occurring ice anywhere .
