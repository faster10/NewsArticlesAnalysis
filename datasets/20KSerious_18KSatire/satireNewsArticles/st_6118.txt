" Clinton bought the Louis Rich brand turkey roast , and had he bothered to look at one of the hundreds of flyers littering the store ' s entrance area , he would have found a 25 cents off coupon for Jennie O turkey roast , which is practically the same thing . And why must he always buy Charmin toilet paper , when Scottissue is just as good but cheaper and has even more sheets per roll ? "
