Pope Francis Named ‘Australian of the Year’
Today the Australian government officially named Pope Francis as Australian of the Year. According to a press release on the Ministry of Arts website, the Holy Father was personally chosen for the 2014 honor by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and has been invited to an awards ceremony in Melbourne on March 17. The move comes just weeks after Abbott nominated Prince Philip of the United Kingdom for knighthood. That action puzzled many as Australian knighthoods are typically reserved for Australian citizens, and because Prince Philip, who is married to the reigning British monarch, presumably had enough titles already. Somehow Abbott’s government appears to have made the same mistake twice. Today’s decision has already attracted the predictable wave of criticism from those who don’t understand why an Argentinian living in Europe should be given such an honor.  In a press conference in Canberra this morning, Abbott defended his controversial choice. “Pope Francis has been a shining example of good moral behavior throughout the world,” he argued, “and millions of Australians follow his spiritual leadership. “Although it is true the pope has never actually been to our country, he has said some very nice things about Australia in the past. And I had the chance to meet him once in Rome and I found him to be a very nice bloke. “I would like to point out that Argentina, like Australia, is in the Southern Hemisphere. He understands our climate. He knows what it’s like to celebrate Christmas in the heat of summer. So as far as I’m concerned, he’s one of us.” A representative for the Vatican says Pope Francis does not intend on attending the awards ceremony next month, but issued a statement thanking Australia for the offer. “Pope Francis wishes to thank the Australian people for their warmth and generosity. The Holy Father will be praying for Prime Minister Abbott, who appears to be suffering from some sort of brain abnormality.”
