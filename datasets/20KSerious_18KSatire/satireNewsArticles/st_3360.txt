" Say what you want about Bonds , but he ' s not a murderer , or even an attempted murderer , " San Francisco Chronicle reporter and co author of Game Of Shadows Lance Williams wrote in Sunday ' s edition . " The only thing I believe Bonds did was inject himself with Winstrol , Deca Durabolin , insulin , testosterone , synthetic testosterone , testosterone decanoate , human growth hormones , Norbolethone , Trenbolone , Clomid , and possibly commercial racehorse laxatives , all in order to make himself a better athlete . Not to allow himself to gut shoot a gentleman ' s club bouncer , but to become a better athlete . A better athlete it doesn ' t seem so bad when you think about it like that . "
