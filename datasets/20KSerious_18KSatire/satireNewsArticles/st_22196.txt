Flight 43 left New York ' s LaGuardia Airport on schedule last Thursday at 10 : 17 a . m . en route to Los Angeles with no indication of any suspiciously bad entertainment activity aboard . Black box evidence indicates that , 40 minutes after takeoff , the crew walked through the cabin and asked passengers to close their window screens . The audio recording goes eerily quiet after a flight attendant can be heard announcing that Big Momma ' s House 2 would be shown .
