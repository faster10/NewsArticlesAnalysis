" I thought they ' d talk to me when I got my period last year , but they never did , " Lister said . " Mom told me about tampons and pads and becoming a woman and how this meant I could get pregnant now , but nothing specific about sex or condoms or anything like that . It looks like I ' m going to have to bring it up after dinner next week . I only hope I can find a natural way to start the conversation without it coming off all wrong . "
