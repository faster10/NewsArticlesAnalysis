Making the case all the more controversial is the neo Nazis ' demand that the ACLU ' s entire 315 person staff be in the building at the time of the blaze . Strongly opposing the request are New York City police commissioner William Bratton , fire chief Ed Holm and mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who said that all 315 will die if trapped in the 47 story building during the blaze . ACLU attorneys responded that they will request a federal appeals hearing if the City of New York attempts to stop them and their fellow ACLU employees from perishing in the Nov . 25 blaze .
