" As it stands , our current zip line infrastructure must be rebuilt from the ground up if zip lining is to remain viable for the millions of workers , students , and business travelers who rely on it every day , " American Public Transportation Association president Michael Melaniphy told reporters . " Right now , if someone wants to travel by zip line , they must crowd into long lines and wait for extended periods before riding along a patchwork of rusty cables and end posts , many of which haven ' t been refurbished since they were first erected in the 1950s . Frankly , the fact that we ' re still commuting on the same zip line technology our grandparents used is embarrassing for a nation as advanced as ours . "
