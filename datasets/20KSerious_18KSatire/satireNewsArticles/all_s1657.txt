Remaining Kula Shaker fans to breed
THE last two people who listen to the music of Kula Shaker are undergoing enforced breeding to prevent the extinction of their kind. Dr Nathan Muir, a scientist specialising in the preservation of rare and endangered music fans, said: “We were very lucky to find two Kula Shaker enthusiasts still alive and of breeding age.  “We discovered one on a Britpop e-forum in Slovakia, and the other teaching a Bikram yoga class in the market town of Cirencester. From then on, it was just a case of getting them together in a warm, comfortable environment, and hoping that nature took its course.” “We have been playing Tattva on a continuous loop, but unfortunately there has been no progress so far in terms of producing offspring. “Of course it is possible they may both be of the same gender, they still have that ambiguous hair.”
