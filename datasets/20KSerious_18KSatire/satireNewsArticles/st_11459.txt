" Misclassified for almost 100 years as a giant squid tentacle , recent reexamination proved that the specimen was actually the tentacle of a previously unknown species of octopus , " said Dr Daniel Brenner , the Pepsico marine biologist and niche marketing expert in charge of the new undersea campaign . " Though the specimen represented only a small section of the animal , analysis indicates it was part of an animal that was likely more than 100 feet long a massive creature not unlike the sea monsters of ancient lore . That kind of size means that , if they do exist , they can probably work up a powerful thirst . "
