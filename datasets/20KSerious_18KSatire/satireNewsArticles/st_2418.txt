One friend told reporters she was deeply shaken after Belson mentioned he was having trouble with his landlord and then , an entire week later , told her the matter had yet to be resolved . While many of Belson ' s problems reportedly go away by themselves or are rendered moot by the passage of time , sources explained that some apparently have to be actively solved . Indeed , several visibly aghast acquaintances confirmed that certain hindrances in Belson ' s life can persist for months or even years , as has been the case with his chronic lower back pain and his emotionally distant relationship with his father .
