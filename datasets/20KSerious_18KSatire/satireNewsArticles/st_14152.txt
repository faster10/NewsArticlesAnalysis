" When I think of how much of my life I owe to Joe Paterno , I don ' t even know where to begin , " said Sandusky , who confessed to feeling " overcome " while attending the former football coach ' s funeral . " I think it ' s safe to say I wouldn ' t have been able to lead the life I ' ve led , wouldn ' t have grown into the man I ' ve become , if it hadn ' t been for his leadership . I can ' t even begin to imagine what would have become of me if not for Joe Paterno . "
