Condoms No Match For Women Determined To Start Family
When does a contraceptive (or “condom”) work as designed but fail to prevent pregnancy?  When the woman retrieves the condom after sex and reinserts it inside out, that's when.  Once the bane of only professional athletes and millionaires, condom “stuffing” has become mainstream among women hoping to get pregnant by the man of their choice.A condom "stuffed" by insertion into the vaginal cavity and against the cervix. In a condom stuffing ploy, after coitus a woman secretly picks the soiled condom out of the bathroom waste bin and deploys it into her vagina.  If properly inserted pregnancy can result as easily as unprotected sex since sperm can survive for as long as 48 hours after ejaculation. Condom stuffing has resulted in a number of shocked -- and -- disappointed suitors.  “They tell you a condom offers protection, but only if the woman you’re sleeping with stays away from it when you’re done,” said “Tony,” a 33-year-old Santa Marino podiatrist.  “I stuck the [condom] in the trash, and she dug it out and took it with her.”  Tony’s ex-partner gave birth to a baby girl four months ago, and paternity test confirmed it was by his sperm.  By court order, Tony pays child support of $1,500 per month for a child he chooses not to visit.
