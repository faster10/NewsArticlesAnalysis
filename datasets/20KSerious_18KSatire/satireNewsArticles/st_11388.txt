" Ich liebe Das Kracken Ha s ! " says apple cheeked waitress Heidi Schtrundle . " This is the only place in East New York where you can cook up to the hearty oompah rhythms of the Krack Barrel Polka . Also , if you ' re a lady who ' s broke and still needs a hit , you can just let Hans have some fun under your Dirndl . "
