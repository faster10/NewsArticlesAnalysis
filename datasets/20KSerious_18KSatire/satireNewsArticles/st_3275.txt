According to witnesses , the recent college graduate arrived at the party sometime during the mid afternoon barbecue without any visible bruises , abrasions , or long scratch marks down the left side of his face . As the afternoon progressed , Girard enjoyed an estimated 12 Miller Lites before moving on to rum and Cokes , shots of tequila , boxed wine , and Miller Lite again . By 10 : 30 p . m . , onlookers said , Girard had played more than a dozen games of beer pong and badly scraped the insides of both arms attempting to climb a nearby oak tree on what he misinterpreted as a dare .
