" I guess I was supposed to tell him to call me Chris , " Reinard said . " I didn ' t like him calling me ' Mr Reinard ' the whole time , but I didn ' t know if it was okay to interrupt him to say ' Call me Chris . ' And then also , it felt weird to just say it out of nowhere . Like , ' Call me Chris . ' "
