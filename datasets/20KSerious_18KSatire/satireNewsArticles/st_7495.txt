Quigley also told reporters that in the last eight months he has made several additional changes to the e mail ' s content . For example , last March the word " ridiculous " was un bolded , in April it was changed from uppercase to lowercase , and in June it was omitted from the e mail ' s first paragraph altogether . In addition , Quigley ' s boss is no longer referred to as " Mr Big Shot , " and a paragraph criticizing the company ' s " nepotistic habit of promoting unqualified employees " has instead been replaced with a paragraph about how difficult it must be run a successful company .
