" I ' ve already used the time my dad , in a drunken rage , burned down the house , " Kingley said . " I used the time my grandmother died and everyone in my family missed the funeral . I used the stuff about the summer the river dried up . I even used that corrupt police officer my cousin dated , even though I only met him once . I just don ' t have any more memories with that kind of dramatic heft . "
