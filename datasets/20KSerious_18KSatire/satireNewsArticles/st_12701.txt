" I ' m totally going to live in Bigelow Hall , " Knopecke said . " They let the students paint the hallways , so everywhere you look , there are these huge murals of all sorts of cool stuff , like Pink Floyd album covers and that Cuban guy with the beret . There ' s also a computer center that ' s open 24 hours a day . On top of that , there ' s a study lounge on each floor where you can go if you need to cram for a test and don ' t want to be distracted by your roommate or whatever . "
