" I would consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of even the first four years of this incredible delay , " said Steven Tani , a pilot and International Space Station flight engineer . " Now all that ' s left to do is wait for my security clearance , sit through the first of 10 mandatory physical examinations , and proceed with the six month period of microgravity acclimation training so that we can start to begin getting this delay underway . I just hope it doesn ' t take as long as last time . "
