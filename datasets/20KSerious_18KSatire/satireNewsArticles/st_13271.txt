" I was walking around to all the tables , handing out sampler CDs , " Schweiber said . " I hate to be without a Heineken in my hand , lest someone think I don ' t stand behind the beer , but I must ' ve drunk eight or nine bottles in about three hours last night . Maybe more . I wasn ' t really keeping track . All I know is , when I got up this morning , I had one hell of a headache , every last Heineken beach chair was gone from the trunk of my car , and there were about 20 Heineken Green Room stickers stuck to my pants .
