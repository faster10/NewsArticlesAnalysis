" I think I ' ve outdone myself this year I bought the president a box of cigars and a brand new fountain pen , I got Condoleezza Rice a beautiful blue blazer , and for my wife Lynne I bought a diamond necklace , a new winter coat , and this neat little motorized airplane ornament to hang on the 9 11 towers , " Cheney told reporters while perusing the windows of New York ' s famed Park Avenue shops . " And for grandson Samuel I bought about a million toys and games and 9 11 nutcrackers . I probably went a little bit overboard , but it ' s his first 9 11 , and I want it to be as special as my first 9 11 . "
