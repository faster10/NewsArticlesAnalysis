" In death , I can say the things I never found a way to say in life , on account of my being a horse then , " Barbaro said . " I want to say thank you . Thank you for believing in me . Thank you for your kind letters and your prayers . And thank you for making my get well cards extra big , as my eyesight just ain ' t what it used to be . "
