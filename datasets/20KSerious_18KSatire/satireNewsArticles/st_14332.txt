The NASM will display Glenn in his original 1962 vintage flight suit , which he wore for his historic orbital space flight , until December 2004 . Beginning next year , Glenn will alternate monthly between his 1962 and 1998 spacesuits . On occasions of historic import , Glenn will be displayed in appropriate livery , such as his WWII flight suit , his Korean War full dress uniform , or the navy blue and gray suits he wore during his four terms in the Senate .
