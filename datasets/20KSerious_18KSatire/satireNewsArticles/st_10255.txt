" We have already begun a large scale investigation into the individuals purportedly planning these attacks , " said Mueller , adding that the head of the militant group allegedly responsible for the plot has been identified as deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden . " The current whereabouts of Khalid Sheik Mohammed , a Kuwaiti terrorist operative believed to be orchestrating the hijackings , are estimated to be somewhere in the Guant namo province of Cuba . We have offered a 25 million reward for his capture , and we are happy to say that he has already been apprehended and brought into U . S . custody . "
