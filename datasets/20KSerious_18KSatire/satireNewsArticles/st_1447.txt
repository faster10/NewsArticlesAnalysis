Bring Yourself To Work Day is a special workplace event observed five times weekly , and sometimes more , in every factory , office , warehouse , restaurant , and retailer of goods or services worldwide . The event has been used for generations in the U . S . and other industrialized nations as a way to instill in the workforce a sense of responsibility through repeated exposure to a largely unfulfilling work environment . It also introduces otherwise inactive adults to the benefits of steady employment and the importance of punctuality .
