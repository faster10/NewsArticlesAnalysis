" Bret has taught me that I enjoy walking quite a bit and that I would like to continue doing so in the future , " said family friend Leo Harris , 43 , remarking upon how hard it would be to perform simple tasks such as getting into a car or putting on pants without the use of both legs . " I look at him and appreciate how much I don ' t ever want to be an amputee or a paraplegic or bedridden or anything like that . It ' s a lesson I really owe to Bret . "
