" I don ' t work on Mondays , so it ' s going to catch everyone by surprise when I come in that morning and start shooting , " said custodian Karl White , 51 . " I ' ll seal off all the exits over the weekend and hide my AR 15 in my closet . That way , when I get there at 9 on Monday , I can just grab it and lay waste to everyone , especially Mr Kelleher .
