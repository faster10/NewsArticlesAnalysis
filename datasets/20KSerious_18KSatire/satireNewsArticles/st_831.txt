Sanborne received the legal sized envelope , marked as " An Urgent Message From Robert Redford , " on March 22 , but put it aside to be opened along with his bills . The Marsing resident justified his delay , explaining that he did not initially notice that the envelope was rumpled as if by careless handling , and was scrawled over with the words " HELP ME , " " DANGER , " and " PLS CALL PLICE sic . "
