" Look , I get it : A bunch of kids died , and it ' s really sad or whatnot , and blah blah blah , but it ' s not the end of the world here , people the beat goes on , " a visibly agitated LaPierre said . " Hell , people die in car accidents every day , and we don ' t make a big stink about that . We don ' t shut down just totally shut down everything for weeks so we can talk about it over and over and over again , do we ? Of course not . Oh , but I guess I ' m the bad guy for suggesting we get our priorities straight and stop acting like a bunch of mewling babies because of 20 dead kids . Is that it ? I ' m the bad guy ? "
