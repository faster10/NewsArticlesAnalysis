BERKELEY , CA A clear typographical error was discovered yesterday in the latest issue of MangaMash , a fanzine devoted to hardcore Japanese speed metal bands and Sanrio Hello Kitty novelty kitsch products . The error , an obvious incorrect usage of " your " instead of " you ' re , " shocked and disappointed MangaMash ' s estimated dozen readers , who for over 11 months and three issues have come to value the fanzine ' s commitment to journalistic excellence .
