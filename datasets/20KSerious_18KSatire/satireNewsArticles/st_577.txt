" ' Punk revival ' . . . what bullshit , " Tolbert said . " Anybody who says punk was ' back ' in the ' 90s doesn ' t know what they ' re talking about , because punk never went away . Sure , you didn ' t hear about it as much in the mainstream corporate media , but punk was always around for the true believers like me and my friends . "
