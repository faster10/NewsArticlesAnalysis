" Nothing against Donald Driver and Greg Jennings , but if I can ' t throw it to Randy Moss , then I want to throw it to Antonio Freeman , Robert Brooks , and Don Beebe , " Favre said . " I bet with them , I ' d have more of a chance of throwing for , say , 3 , 899 yards and 39 touchdowns , with maybe as few as 13 interceptions . Who knows ? That kind of production could even get me another MVP award , although of course that ' s much less important than leading the ' 96 Pack to another Super Bowl victory . "
