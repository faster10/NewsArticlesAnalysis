" In Argentina , Mr Clinton will be free of the constant accusations of wrongdoing that plagued him as U . S . president , " Emory University political science professor J . Arthur Lydall said . " Scandals are far more common and accepted in South America , as corruption has long been regarded as a natural part of the political process . A business deal like Whitewater would never have been questioned , much less investigated , if it had occurred in Argentina . And no longer will Clinton have to worry about being accused of sexual misconduct by the likes of Paula Jones , Monica Lewinsky and company : In the far more sexually permissive atmosphere of Argentina , he will enjoy a veritable harem of nubile mistresses without suffering any damage to his political or social standing .
