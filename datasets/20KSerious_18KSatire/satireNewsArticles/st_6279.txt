The Fox , described by FBI sources as a continental , sophisticated David Niven type with an irresistibly captivating charm and a devilish lust for diamonds and precious gems , has evaded the efforts of Interpol to track him down for more than 30 years . Investigators say their efforts at capture have been frustrated not only by the agile , cat like ability of the Fox to steal away across rooftops with the aid of special grappling hooks , pulleys and sophisticated rope gadgets , but also by his chameleon like mastery of all manner of disguise .
