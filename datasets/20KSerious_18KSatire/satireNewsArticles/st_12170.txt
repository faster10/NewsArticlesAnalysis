" I absolutely adore Martha , " Brinkworth said . " I ' ve gotten so many terrific ideas from her , like how to pick your own wild berries and make preserves out of them and how to refinish antique garden hand tools . I even saw an episode which showed Martha in her own hen house . Raising your own chickens wouldn ' t that be so fun ? "
