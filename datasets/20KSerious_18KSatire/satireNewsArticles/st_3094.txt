" The floodwaters have receded , but the damage to our city is so severe that it will be quite some time before we ' re back at full strength and ready to totally demolish the personal lives and finances of thousands of human beings , " said Mayor Lorenzo Langford , who urged cooperation with disaster relief personnel in working to restore the city ' s ability to systematically bankrupt people and hurl them into a desperate spiral of misery and debt . " Atlantic City has always been a proud center for turning scores of innocent people into self destructive alcoholics and gambling addicts , and hopefully , with hard work and targeted federal funding , we can return to doing what we do best .
