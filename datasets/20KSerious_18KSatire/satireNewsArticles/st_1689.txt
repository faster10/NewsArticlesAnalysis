" I ' m in here six days a week , and all anyone asks me is if I know the name of Smurf arch nemesis Gargamel ' s little black cat , " Jarry said . " Why doesn ' t anyone ask me about 17th and 18th century Delftware metalwork ? Or pre Federal American period furniture ? Or even a simple question about Depression glass or old maps or decorative brass door knobs ? By the way , it ' s Azrael . "
