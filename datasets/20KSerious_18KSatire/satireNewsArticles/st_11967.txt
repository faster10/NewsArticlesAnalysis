" I was as a fawn mesmerized before a serpent , helpless before its untoward advances , " said Mrs C . Clemmons Burroughs , estranged and disgraced wife of the noted industrial magnate , now cloistered in the Philadelphia Home For The Ruined Woman , run by Carmelite nuns . " I considered myself as sworn to my mate as any wife , secure in my devotion , until I granted a single dance to Reginald at the Industrialists ' New Year ' s Ball . One dance , and I was enraptured one week , and my reputation ruined one month , my marriage followed suit . I urge our leaders to take any action , invoke whatever power possible , pass whatever law necessary to stop the predations of Reginald St . Croix , Esquire ! "
