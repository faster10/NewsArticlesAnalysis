Although , hold on , it just occurred to sources that another good way of describing the state of the job market would be to use boats . So if job growth were up , you ' d compare it to a really fast speedboat . And then when job growth was down , you ' d say it was like some kind of slower boat . Like some kind of tugboat ( slugboat ? ) or something .
