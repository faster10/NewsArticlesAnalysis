Kamma h na first came to international prominence in 1997 , when five of its members boarded a New York City subway car and held 42 hostages in a state of transcendent serenity for seven hours while performing atonal syllabic chants . The group then claimed responsibility for a severe 2004 outbreak of interconnectedness in central London , later traced to a 23 year old Kamma h na sleeper cell operative who sat cross legged in Trafalgar Square and read aloud from The Gateless Gate collection of 13th century Zen koans .
