" I was sure it was going to happen the first day when we spent half an hour looking for a parking spot by the boardwalk , " said Olivia , 15 , recalling how her father , who was driving the car , cursed and pounded on the steering wheel after accidentally passing by an available space that was quickly taken by another vehicle . " He got really annoyed and told us to turn off the radio , even though he was the one who put it on in the first place . Things were looking pretty bad , but everyone calmed down when he found another spot a few blocks away . I think that was the closest call we ' ve had . "
