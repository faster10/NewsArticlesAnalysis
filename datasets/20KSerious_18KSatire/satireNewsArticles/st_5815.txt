Though some say the media led Christ to quit basketball , many contend He quit after being betrayed by teammate Kevin Willis during a 1994 Celtics Hawks playoff game . With three seconds left and the Hawks trailing by one , Christ was wide open underneath the basket for an easy layup . Instead of passing to Christ , Willis took a wild shot from three point range , missing the net completely . After the game , a visibly upset Christ stretched out His arms and said , " Kevin Willis , why hast thou forsaken me ? "
