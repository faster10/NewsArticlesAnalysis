" I feel like I really went back to Batman ' s roots and discovered the character ' s true essence , " Nolan said . " And that essence turned out to be in the Batman comics from 1940 through 1970 , the 1960s Adam West series , the 1970s Super Friends episodes , the actually quite enjoyable films of Joel Schumacher , and Batman ' s cameo appearances on Scooby Doo . These were my creative touchstones as I completed my trilogy . "
