" Even if Miss Lewinsky let the stars get in her eyes and the moon steal her heart , Clinton may be guilty of talking out ' n both sides of his mouth . My old dad himself ruled that , once a man got hitched , he had to throw his old date book over the fence , buy a new one for five or ten cents , keep it ' til it ' s covered with age , and write his wife ' s name on every page . Fifty years later , I stand by my daddy ' s words . "
