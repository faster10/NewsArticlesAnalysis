On September 3 , Plantation Owner SMITH witnessed an extremely humourous Sight , that of a diminutive Slave Child of four yrs . carrying a heavy Wicker Basket of yams much Larger than his own Person ! " His hands barely fit around the Basket , and you could hardly see his Face , the Negro Child was so Miniature ! " said a giggling SMITH who watched the child struggle with the Basket for one and one half hours Time before the Honourable Plantation Owner went Inside to Rest before Supper . The Slave Child is posted for Sale .
