Said Huson : " In centuries past , many women didn ' t have a lot of fabric for blankets , so they were forced to make quilts out of whatever bits and pieces were lying around . Of course , to mimic these elaborate patterns , modern quilters buy yards of brand new cloth from fabric stores and cut them up to resemble precious scraps . "
