" I just sold some guy 3 , 000 gallons of factory runoff from a waste processing plant in central Illinois , " said collectibles dealer Gary Hammond of Louisville , KY . " The government tried unsuccessfully to get the stuff zoned for burial in three states , but now it ' s in this guy ' s basement in a glass case . Why ? Because it was banned in three states , so now it ' s collectible . That ' s the beauty of this business even stuff that absolutely nobody wants , somebody wants . "
