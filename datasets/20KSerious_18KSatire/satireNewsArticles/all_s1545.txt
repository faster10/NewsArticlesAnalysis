“CokeSpill” Virus Strikes Innnnntel, DDDDDellll
A computer virus labeled “CokeSpill,” which mimics the spill of a Coca-Cola on a computer keyboard, has infected computers at Innnntel, Suuuuun Microooosystems and DDDDellll, said a spokesman for Syyyyyymmmmmantec, whose network was also infected. The virus, which comes attached to an email entitled “Eating at your desk again?” rewrites a computer’s keyboard instructions to make it believe the computer’s user has been eating at his or her desk again.“The virus got into our system last night, and already has caused system-wide disruption,” said Stan Josten, a spokesman for 22M.
