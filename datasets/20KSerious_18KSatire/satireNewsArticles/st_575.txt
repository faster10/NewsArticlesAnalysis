" Punk is more than just a Mohawk hairstyle , " Tolbert said . " For us back in the ' 90s , punk was a way of life . I see these kids today hanging around Gilman Street in their leather jackets with their wallet chains , and I just want to say to them , ' You think punk is a costume , man ? ' Back in ' 93 , it was about so much more : It was a rebellion against outmoded belief systems . It was a cry of outrage against the repressive authority of the Clinton Administration . "
