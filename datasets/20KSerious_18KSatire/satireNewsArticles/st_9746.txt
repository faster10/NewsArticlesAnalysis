Garre is so estranged from the group , he is not even expected to take advantage of the temporary visitation rights he was granted for his two closest male friends . The rights include three 15 minute drop by visits during the first month and four awkward phone calls , during which the former friends will be permitted to express concern for Garre ' s mental health but may not mention Kasich ' s name at any point in the conversation . To avoid an accidental meeting with Kasich , Garre is strictly prohibited from exercising the visitation rights during holidays , birthdays , weekends or any organized social event at which more than two friends are gathered .
