The South Parishioners of Pastor Theo Leobald ' s First Congregational Church of Holy Christ In Heaven will not meet next Sunday morning for a coffee social and morning Bible study as they do every week , gathering in fellowship and offering thanks and praise to God on high . The reason for the cancellation ? Simply the fact that , according to Leobald , God does not now , has never , and will never exist .
