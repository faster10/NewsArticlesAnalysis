Clinton , a die hard Star Wars fan ever since the 1977 release of the original , has rarely disrupted his official duties for Star Wars related activities . Notable exceptions include a May 1983 hiatus from the Arkansas governorship to see Return Of The Jedi on its opening day and a 1995 trip to an Arlington , VA , Star Wars convention to obtain the autographs of actors Anthony Daniels , Jeremy Bulloch and Femi Taylor , as well as Jedi Academy trilogy author Kevin J . Anderson .
