" The social structure of an ant colony is extremely complex , with individual members occupying such castes as soldier , messenger , and larvae attendant , " said Penn State entomologist Dr Gerald Dudek . " At some point , the Playscovery Cove ants become cognizant that their hierarchical structure has been stripped away , rendering their already near meaningless existence totally futile . There seems to be a breaking point at about the 22 day mark when the dejected ants begin to die off en masse . "
