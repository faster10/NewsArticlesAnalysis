" Obviously one ' s better than the other one is perfect but no matter how many times I try to tell them that a no hitter is also a pretty amazing accomplishment , they just don ' t get it , " Verlander told reporters . " What ' s worse is that they pretend they ' re really proud , and in some ways they are , but I can tell by the tone of their voice that it ' s forced . I know if I told them I threw a perfect game they would be genuinely ecstatic , even though they have no clue what that means . They just know the word ' perfect ' is before ' game . ' "
