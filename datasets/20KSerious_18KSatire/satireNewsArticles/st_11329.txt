" A rock can take millions of years to form , but it only takes a second for someone to skip a smooth pebble into a lake , and then it is gone . " Dr Kaiser said . " Perhaps these thoughtless rock skippers don ' t care if they leave our planet completely devoid of rocks , but what about our children ? Don ' t they deserve the chance to hold a rock and toss it up and down a few times ? "
