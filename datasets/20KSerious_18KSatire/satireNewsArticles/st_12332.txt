In 2002 , McMurrough monitored the MRI activity of nearly 10 , 000 test subjects between the ages of 25 and 40 as they described all emotions they had experienced in the past six months and rated each for its intensity , duration , and whether it would be conveyable to others by mail . To identify targets of further study , McMurrough ' s team referenced that data against a matrix of all possible combinations of the neurotransmitters that catalyze human emotion .
