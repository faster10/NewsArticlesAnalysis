" As my hero Mahatma Gandhi once said , ' You must be the change you wish to see in the world , ' " Bush said . " Besides , this is not the will of the American people . This is my fight . I will not let my personal convictions affect my obligation to the American people . Nepal ' s plight has touched me deeply , and to take direct political action without the mandate of the American people is to go against everything democracy stands for . "
