Kleibert went similarly hyper last Thursday , when Tim accidentally overslept , leaving him just 25 minutes to get to his job at a local grocery store . He was awakened by Kleibert , who yelled , " It ' s quarter after ! Do you hear me ? Quarter after ! " Ten minutes later , as Tim pulled out of the driveway , Kleibert stood on the front steps , shouting , " You ' ve got to eat breakfast ! You can ' t just not eat ! "
