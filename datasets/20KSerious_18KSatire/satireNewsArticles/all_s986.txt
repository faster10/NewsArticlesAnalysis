Jay-Z drops hyphen after being repeatedly referred to as ‘Jay hyphen Zee’
Rapper Jay-Z has finally put an end to everyone referring to him as ‘Jay Hyphen Zee’ by removing the hyphen from his name, according to reports today. The rapper was said to be increasingly frustrated by radio DJs and television presenters around the world referring to him as ‘the rapper Jay Hyphen Zee’ before playing his records. Jay Hyphen Z told us, “The hyphen has been the bane of my existence ever since I became Jay-Z instead of Shawn Carter.” “I wish I could go back to my younger self and tell him that people will keep pronouncing that goddamn hyphen.” “He would probably think I’m an idiot for thinking that, but then I’d tell him that in years to come it will be such a big problem that I will have to release a whole load of PR announcing the removal of the hyphen.” “Then HE will look like the idiot.” Music journalists have spoken at their surprise that the hyphen wasn’t supposed to be pronounced. Rolling Stone music journalist Simon Williams told us, “What do you mean you don’t pronounce it? It’s right there in his name – it would be rude to ignore it, surely?” “But I guess if he’s now ‘JAY Z’ this means he wants us to shout his name all of the time?” “I think he’s going to get pretty tired of that pretty bloody quickly.”
