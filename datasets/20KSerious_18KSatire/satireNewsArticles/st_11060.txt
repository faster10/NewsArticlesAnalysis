" Every morning when I clip myself to the cable before work , I know I ' m going to be standing up there on the platform forever just waiting for my turn , " said Oakland , CA resident Matthew Marshall , adding that , even after he leaps off , he too often finds himself stuck dangling in place when his zip line sags . " If they could just put in one direct , high speed zip line across the bay so that I could quickly get between here and my job in San Francisco , it would make my life so much easier and shave hours off my zip line commute each day .
