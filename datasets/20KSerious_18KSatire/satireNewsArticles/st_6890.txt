" Loot , coin , shekels , cabbage , clams , scratch , ducats , benjamins , dead presidents whatever you call it , one thing ' s for sure : This is the real stuff , all right , " said Sen . Thad Cochran ( R MS ) , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . " Pretty soon , those farmers are going to be living large , raking in more than 140 million from the Federal Deferred Grazing Assistance Program alone . And that ' s just one of more than 30 emergency funding measures passed by Congress . No doubt about it , these farmers are gettin ' paid . "
