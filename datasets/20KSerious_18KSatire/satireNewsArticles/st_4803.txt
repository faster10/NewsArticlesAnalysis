" My fellow Americans , I am proud to announce to you that , as your president , I will put my reputation and my arm on the line for Game 1 of the World Series , " Bush said in a televised press conference this morning . " I have heard people say that I cannot do this at my age , or that the president ' s job is not to pitch in the World Series , or even that they don ' t think I still have my high heat . My friends , I aim to prove them all wrong this Saturday in Chicago . "
