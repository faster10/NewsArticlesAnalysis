Over the past few months , Herchwick ' s behavior has become especially erratic . In April , he began covering his face when exiting his favorite eatery , the Portage Road Sizzler Steakhouse , shielding his identity from Plefko County paparazzi . Since early May , he has been spotted grocery shopping at Banjo ' s Food Ranch as late as 11 p . m . , hoping to avoid the swarms of local fans which plague him whenever he shops in the afternoon . And on June 3 , his 1995 Pontiac Bonneville was seen in the lot behind Larry ' s Tip Top Inn , where Herchwick had gone , it is presumed , to drown his sorrows in drink .
