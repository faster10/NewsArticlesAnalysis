Simon Bates and Bruno Brookes to host ‘Facebook Gold’ feed
Former Radio One DJs Simon Bates and Bruno Brookes are the latest addition to the growing roster of Colin Taylor’s ‘Facebook Gold’ feed, joining Tony Blackburn and ‘Diddy’ David Hamilton. ‘Facebook Gold’, which re-posts some of the Eastleigh-born and bred bank clerk’s best-loved status updates launched today, with Colin’s post of exactly one year ago ‘Ordered caramel macchiato on the coffee run #NomNomNom’ introduced by an ebullient Blackburn. ‘It’s a thrilling opportunity and I’m delighted to be on board,’ Brookes told reporters. ‘I mean, everyone remembers what they were doing when they first saw ‘Can’t believe how useless TalkTalk customer services are.’ I’ll be introducing some of the more hard-hitting posts.’ Taylor, 47, promised that ‘Facebook Gold’ would contain something for everyone: ‘There will be posts to suit all tastes, as well as some of my choicest tweets, re-worked for the Facebook format. With seven years of status updates to choose from, there’s plenty to choose from, but I will be focusing on people’s all-time favourites. So that will mean plenty of outings for the likes of ‘Wow, haven’t listened to any Stereophonics for ages. They still ROCK!’ and memes like ‘Today is the first day of the rest of your life, so CELEBRATE! – The Dalai Lama’’ Meanwhile Simon Bates will be hosting a ‘golden hour’ inviting Colin’s dozens of friends and followers to guess the year of posts as well as hosting a special daily ‘Our Tweet’ where he will tell the true stories behind such enigmatic status updates as ‘Just don’t ask…’ from 2008 and ‘Am going to sulk for the rest of the day’ from 2011. Meanwhile Colin has promised his friends and followers that he will continue to post fresh status updates, saying that he is ‘keen not to rely on past glories’. His latest post ‘Can’t wait to see this on Facebook Gold in a year’s time! Lol!!’ introduced by 1 Xtra’s Charlie Sloth, receiving a record three likes.
