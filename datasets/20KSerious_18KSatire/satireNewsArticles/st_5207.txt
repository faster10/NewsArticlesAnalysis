" Unlike the typical feline that appears in Cat Fancy , Mr Paws does not behave in a manner that can in any way be considered adorable or cuddly , " said Neil Kilmer , Cat Fancy features editor and cat enthusiast . " During the entire time I observed Mr Paws , not once did he climb into a paper bag and stick his head out quizzically . Nor did he ever unroll any lengths of ribbon or yarn , afterwards innocently looking up from the entangled mess as if to say , ' Who , me ? ' Finally , if that weren ' t enough , he never fell off the edge of a tree branch , gripping it precariously with his fuzzy little paws and ' hanging in there , ' so to speak . "
