" I ' ve already got a bunch of stuff planned out , " Patek said . " Unlike a lot of teams , there isn ' t a single marquee player on the entire Texans defense . So whenever a player makes a tackle , I can say , ' Man , that guy ' s almost good enough to play for Florida State . ' Or if they throw the ball to , say , Jabar Gaffney , I could say , ' Well , you know what they say : Throw the ball to Gaffney a few hundred times , and he ' s eventually gonna burn you . ' Or , if you can ' t think of anything else , you can always just sarcastically praise their ' vaunted punting game . ' "
