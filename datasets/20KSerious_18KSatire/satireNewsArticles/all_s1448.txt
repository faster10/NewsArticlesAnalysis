Martians kicking up dust on planet Mars!
Martians have been kicking up dust on the red planet and earthbound, frustrated scientists have no idea why! Clouds of red dust have been spotted exploding above and beyond the martian surface. The ginormous clouds are spewing into the universe and here on earth scientists cannot fathom out what the hell is causing the eruptions! Martian mad specialist, Professor Zweistein (one more than Einstein), attempted to explain what is going on:  "It is obvious that Martians are planning a massive invasion of planet earth after seeing images of ISIS beheading their victims on the internet and observing allied forces being totally inept in eradicating the pest, they have decided to enter the war! "Huge Martian spaceships will soon arrive and liquidate the scum, but in return they are demanding full control of the planet after the massive cock-up humans have made since history begun!" Professor Zweistein was last seen in a straight-jacket being goose-marched out of the building! In the interim the martian clouds seem to have subsided, thank the heavens, but huge dark clouds have been observed heading towards planet earth so just in case the Professor was not completely insane, Wil Smith has been informed! More as the massive dark clouds blot out the rays of the sun and ISIS members commit mass suicide, Allah seems to have abandoned ship too!  ISIS, your time is up, they are on their way!
