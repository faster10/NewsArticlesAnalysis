" Clinton and a guy in a tie ? I think I saw that on television , " said D . C . area tavern owner Jim Blakely . " Clinton was meeting some guy , and they shook hands and , if memory serves me correct , I think they expressed mutual admiration and shared optimism about the future . They showed a brief clip of it , but I had the sound off in the bar because the jukebox was on , so I didn ' t hear what it was about . "
