" That theater ' s been around for generations , and I want my kids to grow up with it just like I did , but honestly , what can I actually do to help ? Nothing really , when you think about it , " said local business owner Alex Simmons , who admitted to reporters that , while the theater ' s had a great run , he couldn ' t remember the last time he actually set foot in the building . " The Orpheum is a downtown icon , no question . But the thing is , we already have a nice movie theater , and no one really goes to plays all that much anymore anyway . And to be honest , having some new stores and restaurants could be kind of nice . "
