Push To Legalize Psychedelic Mushrooms In Washington
The push to legalize psychedelic mushrooms has arisen from a recent study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology that investigated the efficacy of psilocybin in helping smokers quit their addiction to tobacco products. While the findings of the Johns Hopkins University study were not conclusive, they were promising enough for a group of sponsors to propose that mushrooms containing psilocybin be legalized. The group of sponsors has not yet been made public, but it is speculated to be a coalition of private citizens and state lawmakers. Washington-based author Barry Harper has been vocal in his support of the proposed initiative. “We hoped that after they legalized marijuana that our mushrooms would be next. Thankfully the study at Johns Hopkins helped prove what I’ve known for years – that these mushrooms are medicinal. Besides helping smokers quit, psilocybin also boasts mental health benefits that aid those in need to live happier and more fulfilling lives. I support these brave souls that want to help psychedelic mushrooms be removed from the Schedule I list here in Washington.” Much like with Initiative 502, the mushroom initiative faces an uphill battle of opposition before it is put before the voting public. While no official statements have been made, it is assumed that the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs and the Washington Association for Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention will both be in opposition. It is unknown where current Governor Jay Inslee falls on the issue as he was opposed to Initiative 502, but has proven to be a staunch supporter of upholding Initiative 502 after it was voted into law. Initiative 502 was placed on the November 2012 general election ballot and passed by an approximate 56 to 44 percent margin.
