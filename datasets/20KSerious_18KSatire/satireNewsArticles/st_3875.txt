" My drawers have not been gone through by any man but Willie " Skipbone " Jackson , " Dobbs said . " Neither Slim McGee nor Melvin Brown has ever been in my drawers . Nor has Sonny ' Spoonthumb ' Perkins , nor any of those other no good jokers down by the railroad tracks . My policy has always been to keep my drawers closed to everyone but Mr Jackson , as I am his woman and would never treat him so unkind . "
