" Look at that coat , " Buster said . " Thick and soft . . . And his color ! Varying shades of rich and lustrous gold . As for me , I ' m sort of a rough , dull black , and I know it . I ' ve known it since I figured out that the strange , scentless dog in the mirror is me . Ever since then . . . well , I try my best not to whine , but it ' s hard to live with the fact that I will never measure up . "
