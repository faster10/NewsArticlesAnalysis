Oh no ! It looks like John McCain ' s in a lot of trouble , and the election is only a few days away . That shouldn ' t be too much of a problem , though , because my entire campaign this year was only a few days long , and I won . Mr McCain seems like a nice man , a lot like that old guy who mops up the cafeteria after school , so I ' ll help him out with some campaign advice that worked for me !
