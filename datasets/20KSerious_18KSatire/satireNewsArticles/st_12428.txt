Despite the resounding victory , Hawaii was not without its own blunders . Their defense failed to hit the cutoff man once all game , and whenever first baseman Aaron fielded a ground ball , instead of stepping on first base to record the out , he would throw it to the empty bag , causing the ball to skip into right field . Hawaii could have potentially won the game by the 10 run mercy rule had they not consistently run themselves out of innings . The most flagrant baserunning gaffe came in the fourth , when Adam forgot how to go back on the basepaths .
