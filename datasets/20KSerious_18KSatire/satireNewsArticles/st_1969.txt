" I dreamed of the tail end of a black car a car trunk , " Lufler said . " When I put my hand on the trunk , it turned into a heap of neatly piled leaves . Then I woke up . But I don ' t own a black car , and when I searched my trunk for a rake , I didn ' t find one . I don ' t hold much stock in the paranormal , but what does it hurt to pursue all avenues ? "
