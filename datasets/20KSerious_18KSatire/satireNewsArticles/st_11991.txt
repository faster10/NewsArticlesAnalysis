Authorities have launched an investigation to determine how 89 year old World War II veteran Samuel Kaminski was released to Walter Crowley ' s family , while Crowley , 86 , was sent to Kaminski ' s home . Cedar Sinai administrators said the mistake was discovered when Crowley was brought to the hospital for a routine checkup and doctors realized he had shrunk five inches since his last appointment , nearly six months prior .
