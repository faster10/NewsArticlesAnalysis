NASA's study of magnetosphere has Obummer seeing red
President Barry Obummer is madder than Michelle on PMS at the news that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, for short) is spending one billion dollars "that could be better spent on propping up Obummercare," Prezident Obummer complains, on a mission to study Earth's magnetic fields. On Thursday, NASA launched four identical drones into orbit somewhere over the rainbow to study the magnetosphere. The spacecraft will fly in a pyramid formation, six to 250 miles apart, so as to avoid collisions, in order to obtain 3-D views of something-or-other. "I tried to explain it to the prezident, but it's a little too technical for him," a NASA rocket scientist said. "You don't got to be no rocket scientist to know how many peeps a billion dollars can subsidize on Obummercare," Obummer protested. "If they be wanting to study magnetic fields, why they don't buy a pair o' freaking magnets," the prezident whined, "and point them at each other. They'll act just like Demcats and Publicans or me and Michelle." NASA said the study is "important," but was unable to explain why in terms that the prezident or Congress could understand. "I thought I done killed them eggheads," Obummer said, "when I cut they funds." The prezident said, further, that he didn't believe that the magnetosphere actually exists. "It be fantasy like my promise, 'If you likes yo doctor, yo kin keep yo doctor."
