" I had a layover in St . Louis and had about an hour to kill . There was a gift shop called ' That ' s Something Else ' in the C Concourse , so I figured , ' Hey , I should pick up something for Mom , ' " said Troy Hadler , 25 , who now lives in Alexandria , VA . " I picked her up this little teapot , and when I gave it to her , she was so touched , there were tears running down her face . I was glad she liked it , but she liked it so much , I kind of felt sorry for her . "
