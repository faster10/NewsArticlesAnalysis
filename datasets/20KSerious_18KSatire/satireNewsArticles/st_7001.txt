Joe Manchin ( D WV ) , who claimed to have gridlocked straight through his lunch hour , despite protestations from concerned aides . " I think a lot of people out there may not realize just how much gridlocking we do here in Congress . They think we just sit around passing bills and turning the wheels of progress all day .
