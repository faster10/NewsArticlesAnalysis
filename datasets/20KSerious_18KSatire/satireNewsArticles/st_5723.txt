The controversy is expected to heat up Friday , when hearings begin at San Francisco City Hall . The hearings , which are expected to last several weeks due to the long list of academics and activists who wish to speak out against Chen , will determine if his presence in the community can be prosecuted under local " hate crime " statutes . Chen ' s opponents argue that the launderer should be ruled a violation of San Francisco ' s anti hate speech municipal code , established in 1990 to guarantee persons of color a living environment free of " offensive and emotionally damaging racial language or imagery . " If convicted , Chen could face fines of up to 20 , 000 and up to 15 months in prison , as well as mandatory attendance at anti racism workshops .
