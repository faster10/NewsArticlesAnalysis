" One of my friends in college made me a mix tape that I used to play while I studied , " Bergkamp said . " Unfortunately , she didn ' t write down any of the people . I ' m pretty sure there were a couple of John Coltrane songs on there , but I don ' t know which ones . Ever since then , if I ' m just chilling out reading a magazine , I ' ll put on a jazz station , but I never really catch who plays what . "
