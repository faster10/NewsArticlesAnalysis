Added Lufler : " Anything could have happened in that gap between the first snow and the discovery that the rake was missing . Maybe the rake was lent out without my knowledge , or maybe someone just ' helped himself ' to it . You know , I ' d like to quiz that Norquist kid down the block . Well , he ' s not even a kid anymore , but I heard he used to break into people ' s houses and watch television . I wouldn ' t put rake snatching past him . "
