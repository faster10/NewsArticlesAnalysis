" When a patient comes in to visit me because they have malignant tissue in their breast or under their arm , the first thing I say is , ' It would be much better if this hadn ' t happened , ' " said Dr Sydney Drysdale , head of oncology at Johns Hopkins Medical Center . " I tell them I have studied this illness for decades , I ' m the foremost expert when it comes to the spread of cancer , and then I look them in the eye and say cancer is literally the last thing I ' d want in my body . I tell them it ' s not a death sentence , but that it certainly could be . It ' s cancer . You shouldn ' t get it . "
