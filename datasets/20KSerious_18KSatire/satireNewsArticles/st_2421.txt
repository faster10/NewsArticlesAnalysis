" You can only watch TV for so long , " Kaiser said . " After a while , you need something a little more mentally stimulating . That ' s when I like to crack open one of my favorite books about TV , like The Nitpickers Guide To Star Trek or The Real Real World . Or , if I ' m tired of television altogether , I ' ll read up on the making of Titanic or flip through one of my many video or music guides . It ' s a relaxing and contemplative time for me . "
