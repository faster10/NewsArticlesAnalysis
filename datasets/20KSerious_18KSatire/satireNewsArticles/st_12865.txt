A loyal and noble Canine brought much merriment to his Owners this week last , when the hirsute Hound was chained to an oak Tree , and in excellent IMITATION of modern day Savages , began to Bark with Wild Temperament , Dug holes into the soil as Slaves in search of Escape are witnessed to do , and even Evacuated his Bowels in plain sight in the manner of INFERIOR MEN .
