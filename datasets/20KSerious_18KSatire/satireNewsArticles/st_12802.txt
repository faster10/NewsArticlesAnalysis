" There is no way an HMO can properly function bound by such a rule , " said PhysCare Plus member accounts departmental supervisor Toby Francis . " HMOs must be free to disclose patients ' medical , personal , and financial information to insurers . How else can we determine what treatments a patient is or isn ' t eligible to receive ? If someone needs a new lung and they don ' t have the necessary funds to pay for it , how are we supposed to know not to perform the surgery ? I can ' t tell you how many cost overruns have been rung up as a result of doctors providing life saving operations in accordance with the Hippocratic Oath , only to find out afterwards that the patients weren ' t covered . In a case like that , the surgery turns out to be for nothing . I get burned up just thinking about it . "
