" My Howie has done his best in that thankless job for 17 years , and he has a very stressful position . It was bad enough before . The poor man , he would come home and have to sit in front of the TV for hours just to decompress , " said Iris Petersen , wife of longtime Williams Broderick employee Howard Petersen . " But ever since this new character showed up , he stays up nights unable to sleep , thinking about how this kid is angling for his job . We don ' t have a lot of savings . It ' s hard for a man of his age to start over in a new career . He can ' t digest his food , and he ' s been drinking more , too . I don ' t know who this Timothy Benson person thinks he is , but he must enjoy making a good man suffer . If you ask me , he ' s some sort of a monster to torment my husband this way . "
