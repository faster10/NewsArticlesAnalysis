" I ' m glad Brandon has had a better go of it than me , " Raschi said . " He ' s never known what it ' s like to work three jobs while putting yourself through school . As a father , it makes me feel good to know he ' ll never have to unload boxes at a cannery in the morning , scrub toilets in the university buildings all afternoon , then drive a cab until sun up with only a scratchy AM radio for company . Then again , that really stinks that I had to do it but he doesn ' t . "
