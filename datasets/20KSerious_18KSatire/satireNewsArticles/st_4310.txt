" From New York City to London , Madrid , and Paris , we will not cease until every major metropolis is left in a state of total nirvana , " said Rinpoche , brandishing a pink lotus flower before claiming that Kamma h na will seize any opportunity to aggressively instill a deep seated sense of oneness in all Westerners . " We offered the unenlightened governments of America and Europe a chance to embrace the Eightfold Path , but you have refused . Now , we have no choice but to impose a peaceful spiritual reawakening upon you . "
