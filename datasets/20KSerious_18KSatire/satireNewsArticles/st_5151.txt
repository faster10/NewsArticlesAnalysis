" I had never seen a scarier group of people , " said Raleigh resident Max Sherwood , who was enjoying a quiet , calm Raleigh evening in the park with his mother . " They all had scraggily looking beards and they reeked of sweat and alcohol . They were screaming things like ' We did it ! ' and ' Stanley ! ' When I politely asked them who Stanley was and not to cuss in front of my mother , well , that ' s when they came after us . "
