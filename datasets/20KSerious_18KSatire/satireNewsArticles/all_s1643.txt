The Mash guide to the BBC links deleted by Google
SINCE the ‘right to be forgotten’ was established by the European Court, search engines’ links to news stories about the rich and powerful are vanishing every day. In a bid to counter this creeping form of censorship, the Daily Mash presents a selection of the BBC news stories to which Google no longer links. – 122 stories referring to the ending of The Sixth Sense, requested for removal by M Night Shyamalan so first time viewers can be stunned when they discover Bruce Willis was dead the whole time. – Four stories referring to Wayne Rooney’s liaison with escort Helen Wood, requested for removal by Helen Wood. – 52 stories about Bradley Wiggins because we all like Chris Froome now. – Three images of William Hague playing Frank N Furter in a very amateur production of The Rocky Horror Show. – A story about a link being removed to a story about a link being removed to a story about Justin Timberlake’s collection of sex pumpkins. – A gardening feature about achieving a balanced composting mix, which mentions, in passing, the time Alan Titchmarsh fed a corpse into a woodchipper.
