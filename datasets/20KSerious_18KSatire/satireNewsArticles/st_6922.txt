" We are not saints , we are elected officials , " Sen . Wendell Ford ( D KY ) said . " Our job is to represent , unfairly and with unethical prejudice and forethought , the powerful and influential citizens within our respective constituencies to whom we owe our political careers , trading in the long term good of the people for short term material and political gain , for the ill of all . And that ' s what evil is all about . "
