" I must have faith that the Lord will help me , " said Aitape Bulolo , a Protestant fisherman who spent 11 days clinging to the top of a tree while waiting for flood waters to recede and watching the hogs he raised feed upon the corpses of his family . " I know my wife and daughters are with Him now in Heaven , and that He is sparing me for some greater purpose . This horrible tragedy has only strengthened my faith . God is love . "
