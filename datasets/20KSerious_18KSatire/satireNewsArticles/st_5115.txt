" The backstabbing among these holy men has grown fierce , " United Catholic League president Frank Donovan said . " Take Ash Wednesday just a few weeks ago . Cardinal Claudio Hummes was presiding over a live televised mass in S o Paulo when , right in the middle of the recounting of the Third Station of the Cross , an unidentified man in the crowd repeatedly yelled for Hummes to ' tell them about the shame of Sister Maria . ' Then the man started screaming that sodomy is a mortal sin and that he ' had pictures . ' It created quite a stir , particularly when Hummes lost his temper and denied knowing any Sister Maria . After the man was apprehended and questioned , he said that a man in a red hat had promised him liquor if he yelled those things within earshot of reporters . "
