" Knock , knock , knock , " said Ken , rapping his open palm on the pillow . " I ' m home from Circus City . I got the plug , and I got a movie on DVD . I got it because I know you wanted to see it . Come out , and we will make some microwave popcorn , and we can watch the movie on the couch . It ' s a movie with kissing in it . "
