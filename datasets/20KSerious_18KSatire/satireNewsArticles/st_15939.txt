As if by magic , the newly ponytailed Kauske instantly felt energized and youthful , and the change showed in his appearance and lifestyle . He stopped wearing suits and neckties , and purchased a number of collarless shirts , which he began wearing to work along with casual Dockers khakis and sockless loafers . He changed his office environment as well , purchasing a new exercise treadmill , a poster of a soothing waterfall , and a miniature desktop Zen sand garden , complete with tiny rake .
