" It ' s a stain on a wall , and nothing more , " said the Rev . Clement McCoy , a professor at Oral Roberts University and prominent opponent of evolutionary theory . " Anything else is the delusional fantasy of a fanatical evolutionist mindset that sees only what it wishes to see in the hopes of validating a baseless , illogical belief system . I only hope these heretics see the error of their ways before our Most Powerful God smites them all in His vengeance . "
