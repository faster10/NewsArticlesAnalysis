Affordability is a key criterion for the wanted mower , Zablocki said . " Sure , I could max my credit card and get an expensive mower , maybe a 1 , 995 Simplicity 600L with hydrostatic transmission , full power takeoff and an overhead valve engine . But that ' s not what I ' m after . I know an affordable mower is out there . . . somewhere . And I ' m not giving up until it ' s in my garage . "
