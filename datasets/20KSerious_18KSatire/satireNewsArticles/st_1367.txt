" Terrorist hijackings , buildings blowing up , thousands of people dying these are all things I ' m accustomed to seeing , " said Dan Monahan , 32 , who witnessed the fiery destruction of the Twin Towers firsthand from the window of his second story apartment in Park Slope , Brooklyn . " I ' ve seen them all before we all have on TV and in movies . In movies like Armageddon , it seemed silly and escapist . But this , this doesn ' t have any scenes where Bruce Willis saves the planet and quips a one liner as he blows the bad guy up . "
