" As soon as the news coverage about gay marriage started , my mom called me up , " said Burton , who works as a nursing home administrator . " Of course , she didn ' t directly ask me when I was going to marry Laura . First , she asked how Laura and I were getting along , and how business was at Laura ' s shop . But then she reminded me about my dad ' s heart disease and told me that he could go at any time . When she started to talk about how nice it was at my brother ' s wedding , I told her I was late for my yoga class . "
