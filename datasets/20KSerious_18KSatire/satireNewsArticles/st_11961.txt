We ' re not likely to soon forget what happened when that MegaHusker went on a three day drinking binge in downtown Omaha last year . He sang ' He Stopped Loving Her Today ' for three hours at close to 150 decibels and blew out windows as far away as Lincoln . Traffic was stalled for a week while he slept it off on the downtown highway interchange . "
