He was always talking about how great things were in college , back around ' 89 , ' 90 , when he had a band called The Trials and this hot redheaded girlfriend named Trish . Christ , if I ' d had to listen to the Melvins or his Trials demo tape one more time , I would ' ve strangled him . But he said it was the only thing that cheered him up , so I let it be . "
