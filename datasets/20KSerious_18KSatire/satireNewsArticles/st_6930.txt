Wyden , a member of the Senate Select Subcommittee On Having Congress Outside , said there is a grassy , well shaded spot less than 100 yards from the Capitol that would be perfect for holding Congress . " This spot to which I refer is easily large enough to accommodate the members of both houses , " Wyden said . " Furthermore , there are plenty of rocks on the ground that could be used to prevent our legislative papers from blowing away , should a breeze occur . "
