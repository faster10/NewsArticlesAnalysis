Hey , did anyone besides me see that great touchdown in the Bears Packers game ? It was phenomenal . I mean , he had the ball , he ran with the ball , and then he dove over the guy into the end zone , and he still had the ball ! TOUCHDOWN ! I mean , neither one of them is my team or anything , but boy , that was really something to watch . It was like poetry without any words .
