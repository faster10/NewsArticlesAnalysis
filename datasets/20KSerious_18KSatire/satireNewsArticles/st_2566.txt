" I figured , maybe if he hit it off with some of my other friends , I could pass him off to them , " Blakely said . " Well , one night , after hanging out at a bar with six or seven of them , Spencer informed me that he doesn ' t like my friends because they ' re ' too mainstream ' for his tastes . Yet , he ' ll still want to tag along any time I make plans with them . And he always finds a way to corner me into a conversation about the things he wants to talk about , like his kite building or his obsession with WWI . So , even when I ' m with others , I ' m still only with him . "
