Before Sheehan moved to New Orleans , he was a struggling coho salmon fisherman in Oregon ' s Klamath Basin . However , when the Bush Administration relaxed federal protection of the endangered fish , Sheehan ' s catch became contaminated with mercury . He gave up fishing and moved to Oakland , CA , where he opened a free clinic , which lost its federal funding in 2002 for giving out oral contraceptives to poor women .
