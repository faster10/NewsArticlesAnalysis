NIPPERSINK , MI In the ' 80s , this little town made its name in the news with a local eccentric old coot decked out from head to toe in thousands of buttons . In the ' 90s , it was the goofy car nut who converted his Chevrolet to look like the Statue of Liberty . Now , as residents and law enforcement officials learned recently , this tiny Great Lakes fishing community has a local character who stands out with a zany hobby all his own : oddball Matthew Malbert , an otherwise unassuming pharmacist and school board member , has a special passion for ritually murdering and dismembering at least 27 known victims .
