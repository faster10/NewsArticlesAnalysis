When the president finally appeared on TV , it was George W . Bush addressing the nation , not Bill Pullman or Harrison Ford . At the conclusion of his address , Bush did not grab a leggy blonde reporter out of the crowd and kiss her .

The dead and injured did not , like Jon Voight , stand up in their wheelchairs as the music swelled . And Ben Affleck was nowhere to be seen .
