After a two year hiatus , Jesus Christ returned to the NBA last night , taking the court with his former team , the Atlanta Hawks . Christ , who quit the sport in May 1994 to focus on spreading His message of universal love and compassion , made His triumphant return last night against the Bulls , just in time for Easter Sunday .
