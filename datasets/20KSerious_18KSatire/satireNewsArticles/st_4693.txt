" They were basically a thank you to Asinius Pollio for preventing the seizure of Virgil ' s land by the Triumvirate when they ordered the lands on the far banks of the river Po distributed to veterans of the victory at Philippi . They are so sublime , so inspirational . But why should I speak , when Virgil can do so himself ? And far more eloquently , I might add . "
