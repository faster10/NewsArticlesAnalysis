" For so long , I thought that hanging out with my friends was the only way for me to have any fun , but it turns out I can have just as great a time without them , " said Bradford , who according to sources hasn ' t had a drink or a night out with his buddies since 2012 . " It was tough at first , but now that alcohol ' s out of my life , I finally understand that I don ' t need companionship to keep myself entertained . Now , I can have a perfectly enjoyable evening , by myself , watching TV , all without having so much as a single friend . "
