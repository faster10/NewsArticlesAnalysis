" If you see Cheney , do not try to stop him yourself , " police officer Brian Doan said . " He is extremely adept at cutting , stabbing , slicing , or skewering victims using whatever implement he comes across . And , whatever you do , keep all machetes well out of reach , way up on really high shelves . The last thing you want to do is tangle with Cheney when he ' s armed with one of those things . "
