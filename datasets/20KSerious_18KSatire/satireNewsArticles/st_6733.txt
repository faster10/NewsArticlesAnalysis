" You will be missed , Chris , " read a note from Francisca Morales , 17 , a local high school student who wrote that she felt " empty , just totally empty " after Dehaene ' s death . " I still remember the day you almost hit me . I was crossing the street on the way to school . You were so drunk then , Chris . And I still think of you that way , even though I know you ' re never coming back . "
