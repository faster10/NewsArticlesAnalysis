Students who are seen wearing " red flag " items such as thick eyeliner , long coats , tattoos , Marilyn Manson T shirts , non designer jeans and the color black are now required to attend special makeover sessions with a trained psychiatric professional , who will assess the student ' s potential for nonconformist behavior and then outfit him or her in Tommy Hilfiger jeans , Gap T shirts and Abercrombie Fitch baseball caps with a curved brim , on penalty of expulsion .
