" We did not leak this reprimand , and we do not know who did . But what I do know is that this kind of misconduct is completely unacceptable from Vice President Gore , " Smith said . " A mandate to look busy is clearly outlined in the job description he was given and required to sign when he was first hired for the position . And the vice presidential instructional videos Gore was required to view as a trainee further underscore the importance of looking like you ' re getting something done at all times . You can bet we ' ll remember this infraction at Gore ' s next scheduled employee evaluation , and I for one will be outraged if he doesn ' t receive a below average job performance assessment . "
