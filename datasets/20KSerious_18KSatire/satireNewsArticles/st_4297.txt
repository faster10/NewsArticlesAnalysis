" If you ' re disappointed by what you see on the outside , just imagine how horrifying you must be on the inside that ' s the message we ' re trying to convey to our customers , " said Revlon president Lorenzo Delpani , stressing that all of us are born into a terrible nightmare of tortured consciousness , a condition that he told reporters is unfortunately as immutable as it is meaningless . " You can try to obscure it all beneath lip liner and eye shadow and bronzer , but at the end of the day , you ' re going to have to wash it off , and then what ' s left ? It ' s just you , staring back at a grotesque , aging nothing consumed by doubt and regret who has made no meaningful contributions to the world . "
