Downing is by no means Captain Bananas ' only fan at ViviTech . " I never get tired of that crazy little guy . Every time I see him , he always puts a smile on my face , " said Dwayne Stebbins , a chloroxylene chemist who has enjoyed plenty of the monkey ' s hilarious antics during his study of the long term effects of stove cleaner ingestion on primates . " I remember this one time , we forced 2 . 7 liters of flammable lighter fluid paint thinner mixture down his throat oh , the look on his face ! A few hours later , he really cracked us up when he defecated the entire volume of undigested chemicals onto a lit bunsen burner . I tell you , you haven ' t truly seen ' monkeyshines ' until you ' ve seen liquid flame pour from Captain Bananas ' anus . "
