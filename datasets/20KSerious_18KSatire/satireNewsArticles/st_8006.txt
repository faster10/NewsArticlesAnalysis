" Last Sunday , Rob and Ben invited me to ' the art museum . ' I figured they meant one of the big ones down in D . C . , like the National Gallery or maybe the Corcoran , " Deeds said . " But then I find out they mean some place called the American Hearing Aid Museum in Gaithersburg . Who wants to spend their Sunday looking at antique hearing aids ? "
