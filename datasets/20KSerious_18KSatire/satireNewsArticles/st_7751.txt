Although neither Grandma Sarah nor Uncle Brian has visited the house since , 3 year old Rebecca said she knows that Daddy will be back soon , because she has a ballet recital next week , and Daddy promised he would be there to watch her . According to Rebecca , not only is Daddy going to come out of his hole to see her , but he ' s also going to have all of his hair back when he does . In addition , Daddy won ' t be saying all that silly stuff like " I ' m so sorry , my princess " and " You ' re going to have a beautiful wedding one day . "
