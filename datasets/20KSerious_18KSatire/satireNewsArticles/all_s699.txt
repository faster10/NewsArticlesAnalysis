Shocking Truth Behind ‘The Bachelorette’ Andi Dorfman, Josh Murray Split; Couple Finds Out They’re Blood Relatives
In an unprecedented mind-twisting turn of events, the world of reality television has once again fooled the gullible masses of the mega-hit ABC reality series ‘The Bachelorette’. Andi Dorfman, the main character on the tenth-season of the hit reality television series, has revealed the bizarre and suspicious reason behind her split with contest winner Josh Murray.“After we enlisted the assistance of a professional genealogy expert, mainly as a joke to find out if we were some crazy distant relatives, the findings ultimately devastated the both of us. Josh Murray is my biological uncle. We both vomited when the document was shown to us, proving it,” A visibly shaken Dorfman told journalist Marlon Harvick of the Atlanta Daily Journal.As the news was leaked earlier today, fans of the show, which surprisingly numbers in the thousands, are understandably both dumbfounded and suspicious of this brain-rattling revelation. Mary Gregory of Athens, Georgia thinks it is indeed too shocking of a coincidence to actually believe. “There is just no way! They just happened to find this out now? Or was the show rigged from the start? I am starting to question the overall authenticity of reality television,” she said.The public is demanding answers from reality TV producers. “Was the show rigged? Is it just a coincidence of monstrous proportions? Obviously, this is one gigantic can of worms that has been ripped open,” said viewer Miranda Jordan. “This stunning news will no doubt keep us all entranced in front of our television for days.”ABC officials have not released a statement regarding Dorfman’s claim.
