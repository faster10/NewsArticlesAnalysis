LAGUNA HILLS , CA It is a typical Sunday in this conservative Orange County suburb , as the parishioners of Holy Christ Almighty Baptist Church gather for morning worship . Organ music descends from the rafters as the wholesome looking congregation files quietly into the building . Seated in orderly rows , the assembled families stand for the minister ' s blessing and open their hymnals to sing .
