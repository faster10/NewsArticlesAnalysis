" It has been a very long search , but our job isn ' t done , " said Tom Bergeron , the current host of the long running ABC show . " If we had set out to collect , catalog , and air some of the funnier home videos in America , the show would be off the air already . But everyone involved agrees that , when we chose the word ' funniest , ' we made a promise to our viewers . This show will not stop airing until we ' ve delivered on our promise , and found that video . "
