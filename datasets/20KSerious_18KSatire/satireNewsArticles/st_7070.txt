Since the ratification of the Constitution , an astounding 14 . 7 million ducks have died in the passage of legislation . While congressional resolutions to honor events , institutions , or people generally result in the demise of no more than 2 , 500 ducks , sources said each bill related to financial policy or security programs inexplicably takes the lives of at least 90 , 000 ducks .
