Since receiving the nametag , Mullen has employed many tactics to avoid wearing it . Refusing to give in to a job requirement he called " totally exploitative , " Mullen first protested by pinning the nametag in such non regulation locations as beneath his kitchen apron , on his Rage Against The Machine baseball cap and on his pants zipper . When management intervened , Mullen moved the nametag to the proper location , over his left breast , but covered his name with masking tape and wrote in " Kitchen Slave . "
