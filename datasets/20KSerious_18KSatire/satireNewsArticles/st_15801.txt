Initially proposed by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation in 1938 and revived by the L . A . Department of Water Power in 1985 , the 10 billion minority drainage system will draw nearly 100 million gallons of water a year from non Caucasian residents via an elaborate network of pipelines individually inserted into their bodies . The water will then be pumped to various aquifers and reservoirs throughout the city , where it will be processed and made available for public consumption .
