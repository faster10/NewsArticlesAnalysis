" At the estimated impact velocity , this asteroid would hit with a force approximately 10 million times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , immediately leveling all structures within a 150 mile radius , " said Donald Yeomans , head of NASA ' s Near Earth Object Program , who confirmed this would include any Nordstrom stores within that area . " While it may bypass Earth completely , there is a 15 percent chance its orbit could intersect with ours , with an impact almost certainly acidifying our oceans , triggering a collapse of the food chain , reducing the operating hours of Nordstroms nationwide , and ending civilization .
