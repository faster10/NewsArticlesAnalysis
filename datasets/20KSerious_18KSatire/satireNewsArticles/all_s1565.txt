A new report by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology stating that pregnant women can fly safely until their 36th week is “misleading and dangerous,” according to a 28-year-old Minneapolis woman who, just 30 weeks pregnant, suffered a broken leg and several bruised ribs shortly after takeoff Friday. Responded ACOG spokesman Dr. Daniel Fisch: “Airplanes.”
