" I can ' t do this anymore , " Burns said . " The more baseball that is played , the more I have to document . But it ' s futile . The documentary will never end , because in order for it to end , baseball itself would have to end . I ' m always playing catch up ball . The Tenth Inning , The Eleventh Inning , The 2 , 945th Inning . Christ , how many more of these things will I have to make ? "
