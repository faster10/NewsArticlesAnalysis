" They can talk all they want about how much punk means to them , but the simple fact is , they weren ' t there , " Tolbert said . " These kids today have no sense of history . They don ' t know about Pennywise . They barely know about Epitaph Records . Most of them don ' t even know about Green Day ' s legendary appearance in ' 94 at the L . A . Coliseum . It was a watershed , one of a kind moment in the history of youth rebellion , and if you didn ' t live through it , as I did , you ' ll never get it , no matter how punk you pretend to be . "
