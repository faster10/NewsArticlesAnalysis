Microsoft Hacker Still A Mystery; Sun Releases Sun Office, Sun 2000
Microsoft executives continued to insist today that whoever hacked into their computer system did not gain access to the source codes of its major products. However, Redmond officials conceded they may never learn the identity of the culprit or culprits. In an unrelated note, Sun Microsystems surprised industry observers this morning by releasing Sun Office, Sun NT, and two operating systems called Sun 2000 and Sun Me (Millenium edition).
