Though no manatee had ever addressed Congress before , this is not the first time an endangered species has attempted to make itself heard in Washington . In March 1999 , nearly 100 St . Croix ground lizards appeared on the Senate floor during debates over regulation of timber operations in the Southeast . In February of this year , Chief Justice William Rehnquist suffered contusions when a small herd of bighorn sheep burst into the Supreme Court chambers during opening arguments of EPA v . Western Montana Mining Company .
