U . S . agricultural workers are grateful to be rolling in it after the long dry spell . " Thanks , Uncle Sugar , " said Norman Billups , a Comanche , TX , cattle rancher . " Usually , when it comes to laying out the cash , you ' re tighter than a steer ' s ass in fly time . But this is quite a pile , no doubt about it . Thanks to you , we ' re flush again . "
