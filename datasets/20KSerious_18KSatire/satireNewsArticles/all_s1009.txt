Did Taylor Swift Write A Song About Shooting African Americans?
A bootlegged song, said to be a Taylor Swift rehearsal track called “Just Pull The Trigga” has made its way onto the Internet, reportedly leaked by an anonymous recording studio employee who felt the song was “irresponsible and harmful.” A link posted to an obscure underground music bulletin board led to a song called “Just Shoot Him Girl” containing the lyrics: If he breaks your heart in two You can break his kneecaps too Would it be so wrong of you Just pull the trigga And shoot that n—- Swift has dramatically changed her music style to the delight of some, but not all of her fans. “She’s tried to shed the country image and go full-blown pop, but if this song is hers,” says Nashville talent agent Maya Tinnear, “she must really want to reach out to a new audience.” This will not be the first time Swift’s music has been overshadowed with accusations of racism. Her “Shake It Off” video was accused of promoting negative stereotypes, a charge refuted by the video’s director. Recent shootings of African-American males across the country have dominated headlines, and the subject matter and timing of this song – if released – would certainly attract attention and controversy no matter who wrote it. “This could very well be a case of professional jealousy,” said Tinnear. “Taylor Swift is one of the most popular and successful superstars of her generation. A lot of people resent her for that which is an unfortunate part of the music industry. This could be the work of a clever but malicious rival.” Sources are unable to verify whether or not Taylor Swift did indeed write and perform the song. No comment yet from Swift or her management team.
