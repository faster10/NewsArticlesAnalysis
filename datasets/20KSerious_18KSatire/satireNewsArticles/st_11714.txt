" The Lord thy God has warned you and warned you , but you have , in your hatred and selfishness , chosen to turn away from Him , " read a press statement from God , delivered by seraphim and cherubim acting as His earthly agents .

Children of Israel and Palestine , you who would not repent your sinful ways and live together as God ' s children , prepare to face your doom under the unstoppable deluge of the Lord ' s retribution . "
