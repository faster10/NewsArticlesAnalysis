" This is a sad , shameful day , not only for Raleigh but for the state of North Carolina , " Mayor Charles Meeker said Wednesday . " I still do not understand exactly what caused these ' Hurricanes ' to hold their strange celebration in our streets . But I think I speak for all of North Carolina when I say I hope that they never repeat whatever it is again . "
