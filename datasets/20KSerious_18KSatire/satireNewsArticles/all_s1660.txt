Stonehenge tunnel will be mystical, Clegg tells druids
NICK Clegg has pledged that the Stonehenge road tunnel will be a very mystical experience. The self-styled deputy prime minster reassured worried druids by claiming the road will be a ‘portal to the mind of Merlin as well as a dual carriageway’.n He said: “Shimmering, white robed figures, who seem almost real, will wave at you slowly while beaming their ancient wisdom directly into your brain.n “And if you wind your window down you may even hear some kind of weird, ancient music. Possibly made by a gong.n “You’ll have to drive very carefully, because trust me, you are going to lose your shit.”n Clegg added: “This is the merging of ancient and modern engineering. You can contemplate both the ageless mystery of the Henge and why you’re in such a hurry to get to the Homebase in Andover.”n Druid Julian Cook said: “Communing with Merlin in a tunnel will be very mystical. Plus, I have a Volvo XC90 which can hold seven druids if two of them are quite small.”n  n  n
