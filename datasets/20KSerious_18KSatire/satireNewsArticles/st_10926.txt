" We live in a land governed by plurality of opinion in an open electorate , but we are now under siege by adherents of a fundamentalist , totalitarian belief system that tolerates no dissent , " Attorney General John Ashcroft said . " Our most basic American values are threatened by an enemy opposed to everything for which our flag stands . That is why I call upon all Americans to submit to wiretaps , e mail monitoring , and racial profiling . Now is not the time to allow simplistic , romantic notions of ' civil liberties ' and ' equal protection under the law ' to get in the way of our battle with the enemies of freedom . "
