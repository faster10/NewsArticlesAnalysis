In an attempt to assuage the confusion and fears of many Raleigh citizens , the Carolina Hurricanes public relations team , in partnership with the National Hockey League , has issued a statement saying that the " gang " had in fact been playing " hockey , " and that North Carolina did , in fact , have a hockey team . The team has also set up a crisis center offering free first aid to anybody who was injured during the riots and free counseling for anyone who wants to learn about the sport of hockey , its rules , its history , and possibly buy discount season tickets for next year .
