" Adult consumers know the risks involved in using our products , " Hershey ' s chief counsel Marvin Black said . " They know that if not used in a responsible manner , there can be some negative consequences . But this is true of anything in life . Further , the decision to use our products is one that has always been left up to the individual . The Hershey Corporation has never forced anyone to use its products , nor has it ever intentionally added substances to its candies to increase addictiveness . If consumers are hooked , it is only because of said candy ' s overwhelmingly delicious chocolate goodness . "
