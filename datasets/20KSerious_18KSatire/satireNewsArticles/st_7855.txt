" Stenulson Americans are consistently denied the opportunities enjoyed by Gates Americans , Iacocca Americans , and Bush Americans , " Stenulson said . " If Stenulsons were visible in high profile positions at Hagler Heating Cooling and on the Shaker Heights Jaycee Daze organizing committee , young Stenulson Americans would have people they could look up to and aspire to be like . Our community needs more role models if we are to be as successful as these other groups . "
