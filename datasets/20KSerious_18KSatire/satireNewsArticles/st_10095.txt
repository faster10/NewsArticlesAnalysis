Baumer ' s beverage is made with the use of a tea bag , a prissy little package of delicately scented , finely shredded leaves wrapped in a thin gauze and festooned with a bright yellow label tied to a string so that the user need not scald her tender digits in the hot water . Baumer , like all the other hens and dandies known to enjoy tea , must " steep " the drink , which is a term for gently lowering the bag into a teacup holding the hot water .
