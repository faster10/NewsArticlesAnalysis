" I was driving near Saratoga Springs the other day , alone , when out of my passenger window I saw Barbaro galloping across an open field , " said Davis Hammersly , who was in the crowd at the 2006 Preakness when Barbaro suffered his career ending injury . " At first I thought I was seeing things , but I ' m sure it was him . Same long face , same brown coat , same mane , tail and everything . "
