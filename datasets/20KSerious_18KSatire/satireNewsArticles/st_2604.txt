" If we ask to buy a Halloween costume from a store , she has a total conniption , " Jenny said . " Every year , she tells us that with a little imagination and elbow grease , we can have better costumes than the store bought stuff . I don ' t know how many times I ' ve had to be a California Raisin for Halloween because she won ' t let us go out and buy something cool . "
