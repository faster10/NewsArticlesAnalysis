" Andy ' s going to need a place to stay , and I have a couch with his name on it , " Sterling said . " It ' ll be so cool to have him crash here . It ' ll be just like when we were in college . We can stay up all night and make fun of infomercials , and we can watch all the games together . It ' s going to be great . "
