" When I was younger , my attitude was ' Never give in , ' " Seversen said . " Nowadays , my attitude is ' Get real , dumbass . ' If I have any advice for all the young aspiring painters , novelists , and rock musicians out there , it ' s probably that they should quit following their dreams before they rack up a lot of credit card debt . The sooner you accept your real job , the sooner you can start to build up seniority and get on board with the pension plan . "
