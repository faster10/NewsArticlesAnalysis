If approved , the new restrictions would go into effect sometime around Thanksgiving , before the busy holiday travel season . Customers who have already purchased tickets for flights scheduled to take place after the ban ' s enactment will receive a voucher good for travel to their final destination by bus or train . Should such transportation prove unavailable or inadequate , passengers on most major airlines will receive either a portion of their airfare refunded or a coupon redeemable for a future flight , from which they will also be banned .
