" The gathering of television actors , writers , and producers that will take places over the next 180 minutes is so inconsequential in every way that it really shouldn ' t be occurring , " Duke University historian Dr Sharon Lynch said . " A common test applied by historians is to ask : Would the course of human history be the same if an event like this didn ' t happen ? Is it difficult to nail down a reason as to why this event is happening in the first place ? Do the event ' s invitees include someone who has been involved with the television show Grey ' s Anatomy ? "
