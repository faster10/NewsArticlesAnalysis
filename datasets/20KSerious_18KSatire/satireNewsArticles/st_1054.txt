" I ' m not allowed to bring a book on board , and I certainly can ' t sleep , so talkative passengers tend to target me , " Gillam said . " I ' m on anywhere between two to four flights a day . Usually , people just talk about their kids or jobs , but this week , I ' ve heard about everything from working at Disneyland to breeding Wheaten Terriers . It ' s really not that bad . Although I am kind of tired of talking about how many airlines don ' t serve dinner anymore . "
