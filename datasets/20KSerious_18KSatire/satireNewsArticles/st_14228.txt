The Jews first built the pyramids between 2686 and 2181 B . C . under enslavement by numerous pharaohs . Only after Moses , a prophet of the lord Yahweh , rose up to lead them were they able to escape into the desert and relocate to the promised land of Israel . According to published reports , the Jews spent 40 years in the desert subsisting on an unleavened bread product and water , which was found by smashing magical scepters into rocks .
