This worked really well when I was running this year . One day Hannah Becker stopped by school to say hi to everyone and show off her new baby , Willa . I picked Willa up and walked around a little with her , and all of a sudden , lots of people came up to see me . If you carry a baby around all the time , you ' ll always have the PERFECT excuse to tell people your campaign message . Also , Mr McCain , the baby will make you seem cuter .
