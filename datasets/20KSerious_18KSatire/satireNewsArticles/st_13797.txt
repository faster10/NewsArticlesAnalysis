" Our goal is not only to put a Gromdar in each home , but in each room of each home , " said Shanes , noting that ever since he built the first laboratory sized Gromdar as a graduate student , he ' s envisioned a world in which every citizen has access to a private , portable Gromdar . " Gromdar technology has been around for years , but until now , we haven ' t been able to bring Gromdars to the consumer market . Now we have a chance to make Gromdars such an integral part of daily life , people will think , ' Can you remember a time without Gromdars ? ' "
