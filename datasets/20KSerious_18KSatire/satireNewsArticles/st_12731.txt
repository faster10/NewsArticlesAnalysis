" Let ' s face facts , " Le Mons owner Ruth Hazelwood said . " My tenants aren ' t just any ordinary kind of people . They ' re used to the very best , and have high standards for their cultural environment . It is important that , as displaced Manhattanites , they continue to enjoy the elite lifestyle they ' ve grown accustomed to . By providing them with these services , we not only insure customer satisfaction , we can charge their parents even more . "
