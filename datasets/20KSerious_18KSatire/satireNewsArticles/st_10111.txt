The typo marks the first error for MangaMash since last year ' s April November issue , in which " New York " was spelled " New Yrrok . " " That wasn ' t like a real mistake , " said Pelks , defending the earlier error . " That time I just totally typed it wrong by accident . I know how to spell New York . " Pelks maintains it was late at the time , and he was " really tired . "
