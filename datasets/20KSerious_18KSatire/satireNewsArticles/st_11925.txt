" When these morons see cell phone footage of us slamming a battering ram into some regular guy ' s home and then running out of there with his gun safes , they ' ll completely lose their shit , " said Special Agent Donna Adelwright , describing the panic that will set in for millions of pro gun advocates across the country when the video that the ATF furtively leaks online goes viral . " I seriously can ' t wait . The message boards on their websites will be completely flooded with people frantically asking if anybody else was taken down and whether this was just the government ' s first wave . They ' ll be going berserk . "
