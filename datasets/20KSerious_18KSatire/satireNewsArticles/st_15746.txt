By the late 1950s , the lawn mower had become a central point of dispute between the two groups . In 1964 , Daoud Mikhail founded the Palestinian Lawnmower Organization around the central tenet of the " right of return " of the mower from Israel . When Israel refused to recognize the PLO , frustrated Palestinians resorted to chopping off the branches of Israeli trees that extended over Palestinian lawns . In response , Israel razed 40 , 000 acres of olive groves , beginning a cycle of escalating violence that would include Palestinian suicide bombings , Israeli bulldozing of Palestine ' s lawn , the erection of a much larger fence between the two nations ' properties , and the 1973 Yom Kippur War .
