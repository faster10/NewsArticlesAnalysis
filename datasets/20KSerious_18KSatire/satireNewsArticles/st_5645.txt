" There were times I got completely caught up in it , I must admit , " said Bob Costas , who hosted NBC ' s frontline Olympics show for the duration of the Games . " It was a fantastic job , all things considered , when you realize what China was up against . Think about it they had to make people believe that a 10 year old gymnast was actually a young woman . They had to make people believe that a Jamaican man could work hard and run fast , which frankly isn ' t something the average American is prepared to think . And they had to make people like swimming for almost two weeks . I still don ' t know how it was achieved . "
