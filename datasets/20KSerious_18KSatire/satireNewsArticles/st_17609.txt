" Hank Aaron is a hero , an excellent man , and a great ambassador for the game of baseball , " Selig said during a press conference to announce the findings . " We ' re proud to have finally set things right , hopefully once and for all . And I have to tell you , some of the home runs that we discovered were just monster shots . One was hit off of Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix that went 576 feet , and Hank wasn ' t even that big of a guy . Just naturally strong and gifted , I guess . "
