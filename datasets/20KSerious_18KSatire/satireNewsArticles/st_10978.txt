" The freshmen keep getting hazed , but they ' re afraid to press charges or even speak out about it , " Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D CA ) told reporters . " I remember a few years ago , there was a new representative named Sam Haskell who was forced to masturbate onto a piece of bread and then eat it . He was one of the few who went public with his hazing , and , from that day on , he was treated like a total pariah by fellow legislators . Every bill he ever proposed died in committee . "
