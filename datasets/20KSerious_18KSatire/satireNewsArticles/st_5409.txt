Last February , Cheney received a bill for 2 , 000 for a coronary procedure that was only partially covered by his HMO . In a call that was recorded for quality assurance purposes , Cheney argued for nearly 20 minutes with an associate customer service representative identified only as " Heather . " Cheney grew progressively more belligerent on the phone , until Heather said , " Sir , if you continue to use that type of language , I will have to end this call . "
