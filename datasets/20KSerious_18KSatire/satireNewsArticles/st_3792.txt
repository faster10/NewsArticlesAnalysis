" Here at Iowa State , we have a remarkably diverse student body , with literally dozens of non whites , " Iowa State director of student affairs Andrea Driessen said . " We thought a picture with at least one non white happily interacting with whites would be a great way to show off this fact . Unfortunately , we didn ' t have any pictures of whites and non whites actually interacting , so we had to make one up . "
