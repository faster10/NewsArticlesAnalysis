" America is a nation in crisis . As a people , we are lost in the wilderness , " Clinton said . " Our forefathers taught us to put our faith in participatory government of the people . Where has that false hope led us ? The U . S . Constitution is an empty , invisible dream ! Reject it and all false gods ! Worship the calf of gold ! "
