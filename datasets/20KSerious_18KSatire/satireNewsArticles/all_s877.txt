Forgotten Channel 4 Big Brother contestants finally released from captivity
Nine Big Brother contestants received an official apology from Channel 4 today, after being accidentally left in the Big Brother House since its last showing on the channel four years ago.  Two stunned producers discovered the group, who had formed a primitive society around their Big Brother ‘God’, when returning to the show’s previous location in Borehamwood. ‘We assumed that we had angered Big Brother in some way and were consequently a part of a never-ending task that the whole world was watching’, said one contestant Emma Davis, nervously cradling her two-year-old son who was born in the jacuzzi in the garden. ‘We jokingly asked BB for booze and party food for the first few months but nothing appeared, so we began pleading and praying, hoping something would turn up. We assumed it was all part of the game to construct a rudimentary society and establish a brutal regime of trial by BB tasks.’ ‘We spent at least three-hours in the diary room everyday, pleading with our one-eyed ruler to ward off a second coming of Davina McCall, the demonic shampoo saleswoman who left us here’, added Emma, who worryingly named her child ‘Big Brother’s Little Baby’. Following on from the shocking discovery, a major search is now underway over at Channel 5, who purchased the rights to the once popular reality show. ‘We’ve received several worrying reports of celebrities disappearing’, explained a Channel 5 spokesman. ‘The likes of Frankie Cocozza, Keith Chegwin and Chico were all contestants in the house, but literally nobody has seen or heard from them since’.
