This holiday season , families everywhere will gather to enjoy the magical traditions of winter : cross country skiing on a snowy dale , singing Christmas carols door to door , and building a fat , jolly snowman with Jack Frost nipping at their noses . But while most families will need to venture into the great outdoors to sample such holiday glee , one lucky family will enjoy the spirit of the season without going anywhere . For the Randall family of Chicago , a winter wonderland awaits right in their own home !
