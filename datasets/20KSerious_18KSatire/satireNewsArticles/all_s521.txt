Donald Trump: I’m A Better Attorney General Than Eric Holder, Says Donald Trump
Donald Trump, real estate tycoon and reality television host reacted to the announcement of Attorney General Eric Holder’s resignation by tweeting “I’d make a better Attorney General than Eric Holder any day of the week.” The since deleted tweet comes in the midst of Trump’s fifth corporate bankruptcy filing. Trump Plaza in Atlantic City ceased operations on September 16, and Trump Taj Mahal is expected to close in November. Trump opened the $1 billion Taj Mahal in 1990 while the U.S. economy was in recession. Trump’s previous bankruptcy filings in 1991, 1992, 2004 and 2009 were connected with over-leveraged Atlantic City casino and hotel properties. The anticipated closing of yet another casino will deprive the resort town of nearly 3,000 jobs. Speculation that “The Donald” may again run for president is alive and well. In May 2013, the New York Post reported that the mogul had spent more than $1 million toward electoral research.
