" Mr Bush is trying to tip too little , too late , " Gore said . " For years , he cheated the Hispanic community , calculating his tip by doubling the tax , even when dining in states where the restaurant tax is a mere six percent . Look at the record : He consistently undertipped Hispanics during his tenure as governor of Texas . And now he is trying to make up for all of that with a single 20 bill . My fellow Americans , I do not believe that , in his heart of hearts , Mr Bush knows how much to tip . "
