" Warren will have to go back to stand up , but he ' ll get to play slightly better venues , " Scudder said . " Maybe he ' ll even go on Best Week Ever a few times , or get one time appearances on other sitcoms . At least he ' ll be known as ' that comedian who used to have his own show . ' That ' s a lot better than not being known at all . "
