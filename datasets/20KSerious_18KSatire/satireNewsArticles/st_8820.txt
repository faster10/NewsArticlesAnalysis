" Mistress Varla slapped a collar around my neck and started walking me around her basement like a dog , " Traden said . " Usually , the collar is on nice and snug , but this time it started to slip right off . I felt bad for her , so I tried holding it on with my chin while I was crawling around , but she caught me . Man , she beat the holy hell out of me for that , which normally would be great , but in this case it seemed like she was just upset with herself for making a rookie mistake . Who wants a dominatrix with confidence issues ?
