According to Banjo ' s Food Ranch sources , Willis ' lines in the 14 minute video were : " When I first started working here , I was afraid to smile and speak up to customers . But , luckily , I had a manager who challenged me to , as he put it , ' break the ice . ' So , one day , I came to work with a new attitude , and I greeted every customer I saw . And you know what ? It was fun ! "
