According to Amaechi , who spent most of his NBA career on the bench and only averaged six points and two rebounds per game , he knew at an early age that he was different from all the " normal players " when he went undrafted out of college , was unnoticed during his first season in which he only played 28 games , and was never involved with guns , drugs , or shifty agents . Amaechi claims he never once had the urge to record a sub par rap album .
