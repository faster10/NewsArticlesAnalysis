" Up here , everyone is equal , " John Paul II said . " No one has to go through an elaborate bowing ritual when they greet me . And do you know how many times my ring has been kissed since I arrived ? None . Up here , I ' m mingling with tax collectors , fishermen , and whores . It ' s just going to take a little getting used to , is all . "
