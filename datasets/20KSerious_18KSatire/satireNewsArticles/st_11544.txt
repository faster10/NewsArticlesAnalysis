Park ranger Jeff Macken , who assisted in the rescue effort , said they attracted the girls with bright lights similar to those of camera crews . " We had planned to catch them with a net , then sedate them , " Macken said . " But we found that shooting them with tranquilizer darts was not as effective as taking a page from nature and putting Rohypnol in their exotic drinks . "
