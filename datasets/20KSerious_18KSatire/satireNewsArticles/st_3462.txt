Affleck , who won a Teen Choice Award for his work in 2001 ' s Pearl Harbor , said he plans to pitch the idea to Damon the next time the two see each other , hopefully at an Emmy Awards after party next month . If Affleck loses his invitation for the event Damon is attending , as he reportedly did last year , he and Damon will discuss the project during one of the rare weekends in which Damon is not working on a film and both actors happen to be at home in their native Massachusetts at the same time .
