While security reportedly kicks out an average of 20 unauthorized characters each day from the theme park and Disney Family Breakfasts at onsite hotel properties , sources stated that nearly all return to the premises . Disney workers claimed that some reenter park property within just hours of their expulsion , citing in particular a muskrat named King Stumpy as well as a boisterous prospector character calling himself Grandpappy Gizzards , who has been forcibly removed from Frontierland every day since mid February .
