" Saddam ' s palace is heavily fortified . In the front , it ' s protected by several dozen towers manned with armed guards , and in the back , there ' s a 50 foot high hump so high you can ' t get over it and so wide you can ' t get around it , " Collins said . " Having our men attempt to attack from the front would be suicide : If we are to have any chance of entering the palace and funkatizing Saddam , we ' ve got to get over the hump . After all , if you want to capture a boogie , you ' ve got to attack from the back . "
