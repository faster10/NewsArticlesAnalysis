" Scott ' s favorite band is U2 , and has been ever since we roomed together in the dorms , " Petrakis said . " Hey , I liked them back in college , too : Boy , October , The Joshua Tree all great albums . But the weird thing is , even with his favorite band , his familiarity drops off after 1988 . I ' ve browsed through his CD collection , and the most recent U2 album he owns is 1988 ' s Rattle And Hum . You ' d think he ' d at least have Achtung Baby , but I ' ve never heard him even mention it . "
