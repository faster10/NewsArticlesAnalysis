" These days , unless there ' s something going on that ' s monumentally important , my staff knows not to come to me , " said the man in charge of the 50 nation International Security Assistance Force . " I do check with my advisers every month or so to see if there ' s anything new going on here in Afghanistan , but honestly , there never is . It ' s usually the same old , same old market bombings , militants infiltrating the Afghan security forces , helicopter crashes . By now the guys here can handle all that without my help . "
