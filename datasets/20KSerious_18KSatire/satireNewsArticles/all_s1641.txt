Eye contact now considered a threat
THE popularity of smartphones and tablet devices means that looking at someone during a conversation is asking for a fight. Researchers found that 89 per cent of Britons believe is it confrontational to look directly at a person, even if you are in a meeting or having sex. Office worker Stephen Malley said: “Eyes are for screens. If I want to see faces there are websites for that. “Everyone’s features are the same anyway. Hair and eyes and shit. “Sometimes my kids look at me when the batteries run out on their iPads. It’s like they’re trying to see into my brain or something.”
