" His first snaps weren ' t what anyone would call ' long ' at all , but he ' s growing so fast . It seems like it was just this summer when his stance didn ' t even come up to my knee , " said Hardigree , who insists that , despite serving as a third string center for two seasons , he will always be a long snapper in his heart . " I don ' t even know when it happened , but the ball doesn ' t even hit him in the legs anymore . My God , next thing you know he ' ll be trying out as a long snapper in high school . "
