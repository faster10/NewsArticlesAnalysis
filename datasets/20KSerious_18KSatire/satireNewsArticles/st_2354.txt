" The watch ' s heart rate monitor can tell you how long you ' ve spent in your target heart rate zone , " Denny said . " I remember once , after shooting some hoops with Len , I checked my pulse on my neck . Len tried to do it , too , but he had his fingers on his jawbone . How do you go through life not knowing how to take your pulse ? "
