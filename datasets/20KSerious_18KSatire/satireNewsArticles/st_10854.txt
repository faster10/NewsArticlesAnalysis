" We ' re just going to have to go to the mattresses it ' s an expression from The Godfather , " said Fox , going into a slight Marlon Brando impression . " It means you have to go to war . And that ' s what we have to do to get this company back in the black . Go to the mattresses . See , The Godfather is the I Ching . The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom . The Godfather is the answer to any question . What should I pack for my summer vacation ? Leave the gun , take the cannoli . What day of the week is it ? Monday , Tuesday , Thursday , Wednesday . So what we have to do here is go to the mattresses . "
