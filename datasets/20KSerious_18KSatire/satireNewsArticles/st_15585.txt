" Part of the reason for our success is that the neighborhood itself has been in drastic flux over the past 15 years , " Garcia said . " As a result of Bucktown ' s gentrification , the Puerto Rican population has been displaced , followed by the artists and musicians , then the people on the first steps to their career . Everyone who has come and gone has needed a place to store painful reminders of the past . We are not just a storage facility , we are a repository for every imaginable setback a person can experience . "
