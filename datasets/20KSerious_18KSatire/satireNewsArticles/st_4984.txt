" When we kept coming up short by 15 , we thought the solution might lie in a damped simple harmonic oscillator , so we mapped complex modes of vibration in diatomic molecules , found the zero point vibration of the n 0 ground state , studied the motion of atoms in a solid lattice , and formulated the theory of heat capacity , " Patel said . " Turns out we were on the wrong track , but it was helpful to know what definitely didn ' t work . "
