" Larry e mailed me , supposedly just to say hi , and toward the end of his message , he asked if I had a dog , " Reuss said . " I said no . So he writes back and says that ' s too bad , because he was wondering if I knew of any good ways to keep a dog from howling . I ' m thinking to myself : Why is he asking me for help with this ? And why is his dog howling ? "
