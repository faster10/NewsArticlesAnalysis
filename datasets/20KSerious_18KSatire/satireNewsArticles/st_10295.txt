" The wiretaps reveal the extremely sub rosa nature of this crush ring , " said FBI field operative Ron Pitti , who coordinated the wiretap effort . " Each girl was separately sworn to secrecy regarding any shared knowledge of the crush . In addition , each member was explicitly informed that the other members of the circle would , and I quote , ' totally kill you ' if word of the crush ring ever were to get back to Dylan Wagner . "
