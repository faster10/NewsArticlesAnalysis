" The new Tupperware catalogs were supposed to be out on the 25th , and Shirley knew that I want to order some new CrystalWave microwave bowls , since my daughter Lindsay took my original ones , " Fowles said . " I must have told Shirley on at least on three separate occasions that when the new catalogs come out , please stick one in my mailbox . Well , she promised me she would on Tuesday afternoon , but when I got home , no catalog . That really steamed me . "
