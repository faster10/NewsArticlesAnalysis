" Nothing pleases old Barbaro more than seeing a man help an elderly woman cross the street , or a family get together to laugh and be merry and eat a big bale of hay , or a child who is told repeatedly that he cannot win the Kentucky Derby but who works hard and believes in himself and does it anyway , " Barbaro said . " That is the true spirit of Barbaro Day . "
