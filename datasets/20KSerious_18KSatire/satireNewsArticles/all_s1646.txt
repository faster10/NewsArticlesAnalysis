Northern Lights 'caused by gay marriage'
THE Northern Lights are a sign that God approves of gay marriage, according to pro-European Christians. A Europhile Christian councillor from Oxfordshire has claimed that Britain is basking in God’s love and the aurora borealis is a ‘massive heavenly thumbs up’ to same sex unions. Councillor Stephen Malley said: “I predicted this would happen if parliament passed the gay marriage bill and I am delighted to have been proved right. “God is love and every once in a while he hammers home the point by filling the sky with a multitude of beautiful colours. “I wish he would do it more often but, let’s be honest, people are shits.”
