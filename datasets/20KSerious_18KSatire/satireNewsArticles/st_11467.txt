" This team has already tasted victory against the Patriots , " head coach Tom Coughlin said Monday . " By which I mean we were so close to victory that we could taste it . True , we did not actually experience that victory , but we came as close to beating them as anyone else has this season . That ' s the kind of team we believe we are , and I think the Super Bowl will prove that . "
