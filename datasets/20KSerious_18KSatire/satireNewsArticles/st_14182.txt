" We ' re still hammering out the treatment , but I ' m really excited about where it ' s headed , " Christ said . " It really beefs up My relationship with John the Baptist , something all of the other movies missed . They always put in the beheading , but they leave out the quiet moments when John and I would hang out , eat locusts and honey , and talk about the redemption of Man . I think our friendship will really resonate with a lot of viewers . "
