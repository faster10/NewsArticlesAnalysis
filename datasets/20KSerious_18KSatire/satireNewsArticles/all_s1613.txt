Neanderthals had unbeatable noughts-and-crosses system
NEANDERTHAL man knew a way of playing noughts-and-crosses that delivered a win every time, archaeologists have discovered. The primitive hominids, who died out 40,000 years ago, left evidence of their mastery carved into the walls of a Gibraltar cave. Archaeologist Dr Denys Finch Hatton said: “There are hundreds of game boards, done over the course of a single rainy season, and not one is a draw. “It’s incredibly sophisticated in comparison to the Cro-Magnons, who played a primitive and unwinnable version of Rock Paper Scissors where the paper and the scissors were replaced by rocks. “This is what drove the Cro-Magnons to wipe out the Neanderthals. Nobody likes a smart arse.”
