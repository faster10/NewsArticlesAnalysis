" The gay lifestyle is for me , " said James Miller , an Oklahoma City father of four who recently moved to Provincetown , MA , to pursue a career in bath house management . " When I was a family man , I constantly had to worry about things like taking the kids to Little League practice , paying for their braces , and remembering my wife ' s birthday . But now that I ' m gay , I ' m finally free to focus all my energy on having non stop , mind blowing anal sex . "
