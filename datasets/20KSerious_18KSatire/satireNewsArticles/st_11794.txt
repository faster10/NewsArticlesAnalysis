" The first time I noticed Gary was in the church , " best man Joseph Farrel said . " The flower girl kept giggling during the vows . It took me a while to realize Gary was making faces at her . It was pretty funny , I guess . Then after the ceremony , I ran into Gary in the bathroom . He came up to the urinal next to mine and said , ' This must be where all the dicks hang out . ' Normally , I ' d punch out any guy who tried to talk to me in the john , but the joke was a relief after listening to those awful self written vows . "
