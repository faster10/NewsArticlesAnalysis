It ' s the same old BS from these blue state liberals . A fetus isn ' t a human being , they say . A fetus is just a group of congregated cells . A fetus doesn ' t have consciousness , identity , or intent . Well , you out of touch elitists , how ' s this for intent : the moment I get my placenta covered ass out of here , you ' re going to wish you had me terminated , because I want my country back , and I ' ll do whatever I can to reclaim those values that made it great .
