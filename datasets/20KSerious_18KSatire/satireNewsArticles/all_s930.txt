‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ sequel to feature surprising amount of vampires and bondage
Harper Lee’s recently announced sequel to ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ will feature space battles, vampires, and some light spanking. “I’m delighted to announce Harper Lee’s second great American Novel, ‘Shades of a grey in the Twilight of space’,” said Ms Lee’s Editor. “It will feature Scout Finch as she travels into the future to battle the evil Lord of the Space-Devils, but ends up having a sexual awakening after doing bondage with a posh vampire,” he continued. “It’s probably a metaphor or something.” To Kill a Mockingbird is a modern American classic, and is said to have inspired some the world’s greatest leaders. “Ms Lee is a great American hero of mine,” said President Obama. “Like many American children, ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ shaped my views of tolerance and justice.” “But what I have always wondered if Scout Finch would have an erotic awakening with a space-vampire.” There is early talk of a film adaptation, with Michael Bay particularly interested. “Goddamn, now that’s my kind of film,” he said. “That first one was pussy-ass, but Scout Finch’s ass getting spanked? Hubba Hubba! Put Jen Lawrence in it and we’re talking dynamite.” Harper Lee herself is said to be concerned that already people are putting too much emphasis on the erotic aspects of the novel. “It’s got lots of really cool space battles as well,” she said.
