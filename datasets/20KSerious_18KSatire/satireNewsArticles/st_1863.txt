" While Jeff was away , I went into his room to look for a videotape that had that week ' s Space Ghost on it , and that ' s when I first noticed it , " said Mayhew , a dishwasher at The Timbers Supper Club . " I can ' t really describe what it ' s like . It ' s not a terrible smell , actually , but it ' s definitely there . You can sort of smell it on Jeff himself , but if you go into his room it hits you the second you open the door . "
