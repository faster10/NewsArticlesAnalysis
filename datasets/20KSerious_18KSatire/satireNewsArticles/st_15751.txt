" Dave and Beth Premus come in here every morning , sit , and drink their coffee , and before they left today I had to tell them that I ' d probably see them in February or March when I come back for a visit , " said Fulton , adding that he starts making the married couple ' s regular order before they even get to the counter . " That ' s when Dave was like , ' Oh , yeah ! Last day , right ? Where are you going again ? ' I knew we weren ' t best friends , but I thought I was a little more than just the guy who gave him his croissant and his coffee , which I always put in a mug because I know he likes that better .
