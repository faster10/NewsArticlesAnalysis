" You get to a point where there are no more mountains to climb , no more milestones to reach , " James explained . " I ' ll obviously miss the competition , the playoff runs , the practices I ' ll miss all of it . I just feel as though I have nothing else to prove , and I always told myself that as soon as I lose that drive , I ' d call it a day . "
