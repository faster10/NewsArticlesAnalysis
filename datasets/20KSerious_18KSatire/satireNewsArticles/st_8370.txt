Leske does admit to harboring some doubts about his upcoming nuptials . " What if Luann , never having seen a naked man before , is so frightened that she refuses to allow me to ejaculate ? " he said . " Divorce would be out of the question , and I ' d be trapped forever in a non ejaculatory marriage . It will probably work out okay , though : Once she becomes my wife , I should be able to command her to do whatever I say , and , even if it ' s against her wishes , it will be her Christian duty to obey me .
