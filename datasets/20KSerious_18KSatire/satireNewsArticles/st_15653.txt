The scrapbook , a neatly organized digest of Hemmer ' s 35 years as a wife and mother , contains photos and keepsakes that project an image of a functional family bound by unconditional love and total fulfillment . By layering carefully chosen photos with brightly colored paper , elaborately patterned borders , and whimsical stickers , Hemmer has successfully concealed a lifetime of anguish , scorn , and contempt .
