Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president . He had gained an enormous following by speaking out against corruption and cronyism , labeling Putin ' s United Russia " a party of swindlers and thieves " and using social media to help mobilize the president ' s critics . He had just announced he would run for mayor of Moscow . But , like other Putin opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president ' s complete hold on power , he will likely go to prison instead . Now that he ' s released , Navalny is considering whether to stay or withdraw from the race for mayor .
