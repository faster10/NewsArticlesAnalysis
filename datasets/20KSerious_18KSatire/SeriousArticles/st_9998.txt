Celtic 2 1 Inter Milan , Lisbon , May 25 , 1967 we were still to enter the age of colour television , let alone widescreen and HD , but the grainy images of Jock Stein ' s heroic Lisbon Lions defying the odds against Helenio Herrera ' s seemingly impregnable Serie A champions are as vivid as ever . Inter had won the European Cup , as it was known then , in ' 64 and ' 65 and looked on for a third in four years after Sandro Mazzola converted a seventh minute penalty , following a Jim Craig foul on Renato Cappellini . The script was made for Inter to sit back and soak up any amount of pressure with their renowned defensive resilience . But Celtic had other ideas , and , after equalising through left back Tommy Gemmell in the 63rd minute , they became Britain ' s first European champions with a close range finish by Stevie Chalmers six minutes from time .
