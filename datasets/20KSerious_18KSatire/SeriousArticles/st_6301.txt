Donald Trump , the leading presidential candidate for the Republican Party , has been focused on projecting Muslims in an extremely negative manner , with each of his statements more extreme than the last . When a man at one of Trump ' s speeches said , " We have a problem in this country . It ' s called Muslims . . . When can we get rid of them ? " Trump merely replied , " We ' re going to be looking at that and many other things . " Last month , Trump said he was open to keeping a database of American Muslims or making them carry special ID cards that listed their religion . He talked of shutting down American mosques because " bad things are happening . " He vowed , " We ' re going to have to do things we never did before , " things " that we never thought would happen in this country in terms of information and learning about the enemy . " A few days ago , he suddenly said that he would ban all Muslims from entering the United States a statement that caused a furor both in the United States and abroad , with even the British prime minister , who would normally not comment on an American election , objecting to Trump .
