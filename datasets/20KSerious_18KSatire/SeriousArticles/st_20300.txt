The state senators who courageously voted for marriage risked primary opposition from anti marriage forces but are now garnering wide support . They are well positioned to fight single issue attacks while running campaigns and building records of public service that respond to the core priorities of their constituents : less government , lower taxes , individual autonomy and personal responsibility . ( In the interest of full disclosure , as a New York resident , I personally advocated for the passage of freedom to marry in Albany last summer . )
