Kuriyama : Frankly I was burnt out . I ' d been constantly working nights until midnight , until 2 in the morning , weekends and I wasn ' t getting my creative juices off so I needed to take some time off and after having seen Stefan Sagmeister ' s talk on " The power of time off , " I decided to save up enough money over the course of about two years and took a year off so that I could travel , spend more time with my family and pursue my own creative ideas such as the one second everyday project .
