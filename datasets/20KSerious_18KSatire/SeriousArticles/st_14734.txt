Parnell , the governor , is trying to get the state talking about domestic violence and sexual assault by encouraging people all over Alaska to hold " Choose Respect " rallies in their communities on March 27 . The idea is for men to choose respect for women rather than using violence against them . I think the statement can also be read as a demand from any person that the rest of society chooses respect for them and everyone else . Hold your own mini " Choose Respect " rally taking a photo of yourself and uploading it to Twitter , Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag chooserespect . Bonus points : Write " Choose Respect " on your hand .
