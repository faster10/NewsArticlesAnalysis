And even that , to put it nicely , is not going to happen unless something changes ? and fast . While Rubio is on pace to best his Republican rivals not named Donald or Ted in Iowa , he s locked in ? and currently losing ? a five man race for runner up in New Hampshire with Cruz and his three establishment rivals : Bush , John Kasich , and Chris Christie . Even if Rubio gets silver in the Granite State , he ll face a steep uphill climb in South Carolina , where he s currently polling in distant third place behind Trump and Cruz and where he ll almost certainly have to compete with Jeb ? who is unlikely to drop out before then given his cash , his name , and his recent endorsement from South Carolinian Lindsey Graham ? and possibly Kasich or Christie as well , if either keeps things close in New Hampshire . Central to Rubio s 3 2 1 plan , meanwhile , is the belief that a third place finish in Iowa and a second place finish in New Hampshire will somehow steal the spotlight from Trump and Cruz , the former of whom could have just swept the two most discussed nominating contests in the country by then . Godspeed , Marco !
