For any of this to change , voters in both parties need to insist on absolute fairness when it comes to their primaries . Even if a candidate has low name recognition and abysmal polling results , we should expect that they be afforded as much air time and media attention as the candidates whose names are household words and whose polling numbers are off the charts . Not only will this open up our political system to all comers , but it will empower voters in the process . After all , if quality leadership is essential to the success of any world power , then voters only stand to benefit when they are presented with as wide a variety of potential leaders as possible .
