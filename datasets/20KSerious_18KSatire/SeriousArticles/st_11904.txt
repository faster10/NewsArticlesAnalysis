This wasn ' t an acid flashback , although to my ears it sounded like one . Several months ago , I was with 27 , 000 people screaming for a disheveled 73 year old Senator from Vermont . He didn ' t look like Mick Jagger . We were in the Los Angeles Sports Arena , where The Doors played in the 60 ' s . I remember the mass adulation , but that was for our leading singer in leather pants . Well , hopefully it was for the music , too . Even though the white haired politician has no colorful wardrobe , after he speaks . . . you want to hug him . Why ? Because what Bernie Sanders says feels like the truth . The unbridled truth . And he says it LOUD . No mincing of words here . . .
