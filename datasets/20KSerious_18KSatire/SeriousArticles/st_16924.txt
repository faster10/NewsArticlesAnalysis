John : We ' re very small , and I ' ve kept it small because I ' ve always wanted to keep an eye on what was going on . We have two people basically running the organization in America and about seven or eight in Britain plus volunteers . In America for the last four years , I ' ve measured the success by the fact that we have a four star rating from the Charity Navigator for the last four years , which means that we are doing a fantastic job . We don ' t waste any money , we don ' t gamble with our money .
