In July of 2012 , a heavily armed gunman opened fire on theatergoers attending a midnight premiere of the final film of the latest Batman trilogy , killing 12 and wounding scores more . The suspect , James Eagan Holmes , allegedly carried out the act with a number of handguns , as well as an AR 15 assault rifle with a 100 round drum magazine . Some lawmakers used the incident , which took place in a state with some of the laxest gun control laws , to bring forth legislation designed to place increased regulations on access to such weapons , but many observers , citing previous experience , were hesitant to say that they would be able to overcome the power of the National Rifle Association and Washington gun lobby .
