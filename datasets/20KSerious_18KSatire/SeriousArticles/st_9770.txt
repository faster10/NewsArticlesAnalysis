For 2010 , the Romneys enjoyed a federal tax rate of only 13 . 9 on their adjusted gross income of roughly 22 million , which gave them a lower federal tax burden ( including payroll , income and excise taxes ) than the average American wage earning family in the 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 range . The principal reason for this munificently low tax rate is that much of Romney ' s income , even today , comes from " carried interest , " which is just the jargon used by the private equity industry for compensation received for managing other people ' s money .
