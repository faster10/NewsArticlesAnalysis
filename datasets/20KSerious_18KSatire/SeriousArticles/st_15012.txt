ISOLATED : POLITICO s Shane Goldmacher reports on a group of Republicans who are particularly isolated by DONALD TRUMP s latest rhetoric : Muslim Republicans . Muslims remain only a tiny fraction ? 1 to 2 percent ? of America s overall population , but many happen to be clustered in some of the most sought after presidential battlegrounds , including Ohio , Florida and Virginia . Those pivotal swing states accounted for three of the four closest contests in the 2012 presidential campaign and each is home to more than 50 , 000 Muslim American voters , according to estimates . http : politi . co 1mdxcDL
