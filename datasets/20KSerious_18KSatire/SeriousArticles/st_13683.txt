In the time the Oval Office has been in my trust , I have kept near my desk reminders of America ' s character including a painting of a West Texas mountain lit by the morning sun . It reminds me that Americans have always lived on the sunrise side of the mountain . We are a nation that looks to the new day with confidence and optimism . I am optimistic about our future , because I believe in the goodness and wisdom of the American people . I am optimistic because I have faith in freedom ' s power to lift up all of God ' s children and lead this world to a future of peace .
