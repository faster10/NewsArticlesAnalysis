The Bush family is very interesting . We see a family that was kind of riding the currents of the Republican Party , wherever the center was . George H . W . Bush lost to the moderate in 66 for Congress and then tried to run as a conservative in 1970 . He was running against Lloyd Bentsen , and said something like , The only way Lloyd Bentsen is going to get to my right is if he runs with Attila the Hun . So , we had this very ideologically plastic family that , you know , managed to latch onto the main chance , until now . But let s not also forget that politics is about individuals and their own skills , and Jeb just doesn t seem to have what it takes .
