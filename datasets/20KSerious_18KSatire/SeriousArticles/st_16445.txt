Dry Tortugas , Florida . Hot and remote , the Dry Tortugas are one of the Park Service ' s most inaccessible destinations . One thing they aren ' t is dry the seven islands lying seventy miles west of Key West received their name from their lack of terrestrial fresh water ( and an abundance of turtles ) , but tropical storms inundate the little archipelago with some regularity . Visitors must take a ferry or seaplane to the park , but the reward is worth it : renowned for its marine life and snorkeling , the Dry Tortugas offer clean beaches and clear water , as well as an historic American fortress to explore . Best of all , you probably won ' t have to share it with many other people .
