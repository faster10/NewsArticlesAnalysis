The Panthers possess a formidable defense even without Hardy , who blossomed into one of the NFL ' s top pass rushers while spending his first five seasons in Carolina . He was placed on the Commissioner ' s exempt list for his arrest on domestic violence charges and played only one game last season for the Panthers , who opted not to re sign him . Hardy inked a one year deal with Dallas in March , and has recorded a team leading 4 1 5 sacks in six contests after serving a four game suspension for violating the NFL ' s personal conduct policy .
