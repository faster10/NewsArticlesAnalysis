As Gary Lineker mentioned yesterday , the hardest thing is that both the BBC and BT have to make our selections before the outcome of replays . That ' s the only reason why Phil Parkinson ' s side didn ' t get a live match this time round . We had to weigh up the options and given Sunderland ' s recent form , thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being League One against a Championship side . In this case it wouldn ' t have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live Quarter Final , as Reading have done by progressing at Derby .
