Come on , really ? : This is a rich , meaty conspiracy theory , because it gives New England fans the sense that there are indeed dark forces working against the Patriot Way by assigning them biased officials . Problem is , it s all a matter of perspective . Unlike in the NBA or baseball , sample sizes of significant stats in the NFL are so small as to be irrelevant . For instance , one of the Brady Hochuli games was 2015 s Week 17 , when the Patriots basically gave up against the Dolphins . Plus , guess who was the ref when the Patriots beat the Panthers in the Super Bowl ? Finally : the lateral fumble that turned into a touchdown for New England , as noted above ? ESPN s Kevin Seifert points out that the only reason the Patriots got that ball at all was because of a blown Ed Hochuli call in 2008 . NFL rules at the time didn t permit the change of possession after the whistle , but the rule was changed and became known as , yep , the Hochuli Rule . You re welcome , New England .
