I posted a cry for help to my faux friends on Facebook , which elicited only sympathy . The super called again . " Would you like me to take her ? " he asked , he of the four kids who ' ve scampered our halls chatting in Albanian since they were toddlers . Great ! He even has the keys ! I expressed my glee on Facebook and the replies poured in . In short order , my super was accused of being a pedophile , a child trafficker , a canonize able saint , and a shyster looking to rob me . I got home to find Luna with his daughter , Ana , all grown up , making paper bag puppets . Pouty face no more ! Ding Ding Ding sitter Lotto ! I had found an unemployed college graduate who lives down the hall and is great with kids . I was all set until I got altruistic and recommended her to a friend . Less than a year later she had a fulltime job .
