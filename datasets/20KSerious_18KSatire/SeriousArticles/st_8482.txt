It may take a few minutes for kids 5 and older who didn t grow up with Peanuts to settle into this movie s cozy little world ? a world that stays quite true to creator Charles M . Schulz s vision . Still , The Peanuts Movie is a relatively low key affair , despite being in 3 D . It has more in common with the gentle Winnie the Pooh film from 2011 than it does with other modern animated features . Charlie Brown is smitten as soon as the Little Red Haired Girl moves into his neighborhood ? so smitten , he can t speak to her . He unwittingly impresses the Little Red Haired Girl by saving his sister Sally s act in the school talent show , and by being honest and kind . Snoopy finds a typewriter , and with his bird pal , Woodstock , at his side , writes a fantasy about flying his doghouse against the cursed Red Baron . ( 88 minutes )
