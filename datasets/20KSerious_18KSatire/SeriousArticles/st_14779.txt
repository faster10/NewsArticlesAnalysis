I learned this first hand while researching , with students at the University of Michigan , the life of Arabella Chapman , a free African American woman who chronicled post Civil War life in a unique photo collection . Chapman ' s beautifully preserved , leather bound photo albums from the 1890s are in our library . To bring her story to a broader public , we set our sights on Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia . We got stuck , and through the Global Women of Color Write In we learned that African American subjects like ours are under represented in Wikipedia . We did get Chapman a page , but there was more work to do .
