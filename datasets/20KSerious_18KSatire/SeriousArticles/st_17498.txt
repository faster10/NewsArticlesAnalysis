But Bacon writes that Obamacare advocates believe that even an Indiana like program will result in Kentucky residents losing their health care coverage . " A plan like Indiana ' s is going to limit coverage for Kentuckians . That ' s the bottom line . Fewer Kentuckians would get coverage , " Emily Beauregard of Kentucky Voices for Health told Bacon . And so we ' re likely to see a political fight play out in Kentucky that might even be bigger than yesterday ' s gubernatorial contest : Bevin and Republicans will be trying to choose your term reform rollback dismantle the state ' s health care system under the federal law , while Democrats will argue that the effort will result in taking away people ' s health insurance that they liked or didn ' t have before . Bottom line : The aftermath of last night could answer these questions for national Republicans : If you want to repeal the health care law , how do you do it ? How big will the blowback be to changing people ' s health insurance ? And can repeal even be done ?
