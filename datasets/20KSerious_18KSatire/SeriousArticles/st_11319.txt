The GOP of 2015 is a fundamentally different party than the party that nominated Bush ' s father in 1988 . In the 1980s the GOP was a national party with support across all regions and strong appeal to the young , the suburban and the college educated . In 1984 Ronald Reagan won 49 of 50 states and captured almost 60 of the popular vote . Four years later , in the 1988 presidential election , George H . W . Bush won 40 states , including California , Vermont , Connecticut , Maryland , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey .
