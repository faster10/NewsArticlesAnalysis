That ' s key and the other thing is to emphasize the importance of those dreams we all have because life is short , and there ' s no time like the present to set them in motion . My hope is that people can see through the extreme endurance event aspect of the book and realize that ' s purely intended as metaphor . Not everyone who reads my book will want to do Ultraman or become 100 vegan , but I hope it serves as inspiration for whatever that thing is you ' ve had in the back of your mind that you always wanted to do . There is a way and a means to breathe life into those things if you ' re willing to prioritize it in a way you haven ' t done before .
