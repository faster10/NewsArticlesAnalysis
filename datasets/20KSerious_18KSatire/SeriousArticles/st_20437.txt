There was no fire involved in this crash however there was air bag deployment , which to the untrained eye can appear as if the vehicle is enveloped in smoke . The officers on scene did indicate one of the vehicles did have a broken window . The operator of that vehicle did make statements to one officer that a male party kicked in my window , I think he was a patriot . This was not entered into the report as this was a standard motor vehicle crash report with no injury . On arrival the individual in question was not on scene and due to the nature of the accident there was no follow up to this information as the identity to an unknown good Samaritan had no bearing on this report . We are attempting to obtain more information at this time and will follow up with another release should we learn more .
