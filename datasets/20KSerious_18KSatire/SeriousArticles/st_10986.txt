Williams : ' This is not pandering . I swear . But I ' ve been all over the country and the world . . . and I always wanted a place at the Jersey Shore , where I grew up . Now that we have one . . . and it ' s so easy to get to . . . there is no destination that brings down my pulse and blood pressure quite as quickly as the Jersey Shore . We can ' t change where we ' re from or where we feel the most at home . I know the roads , the customs , the language , the food and I ' d like to think I know the people there best . '
