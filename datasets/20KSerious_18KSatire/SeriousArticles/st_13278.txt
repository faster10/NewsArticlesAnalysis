Only 1 of all British undergraduates attend those universities , and only about 1 of that 1 are black : in the circumstances , it seems a bit preposterous to think that this is where you re going to make the greatest impact . Instead of perpetuating the idea that only these institutions count , you might pause momentarily to consider the impact of the removal of the educational maintenance allowance , and then think that perhaps it would make more sense to laud the achievements of the 60 of black students who attend a group of 30 rather less feted or well funded institutions , none of which have found themselves at the centre of a row about Cecil Rhodes .
