Problem number two is the moral implosion of the Turkish government . Recep Tayyip Erdo ? an s army has already turned the Kurdish regions of southern Turkey into a war zone . Now he is pushing for life imprisonment for two prominent journalists from the secularist newspaper Cumhuriyet , for an investigation that claimed to show proof that his government was sending arms to IS . This is not some maverick judge at work ? the demand for a 30 year sentence was brought by Erdo ? an himself : head of state of a country that still thinks it could join Europe and that retains its Nato membership , with no discouragement so far from Brussels .
