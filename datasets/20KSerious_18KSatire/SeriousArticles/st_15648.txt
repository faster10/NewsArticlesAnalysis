Litvinenko , it is fair to say , didn t like Putin . Last summer he claimed in a letter posted on the Internet that the President was a habitual pedophile . Litvinenko also contended that Putin had been on the take from Mafia groups for years and that to advance his presidential ambitions , he had directed FSB officers to blow up apartment buildings in Moscow in 1999 , killing more than 300 people ? then pinning the outrage on Chechen rebels . ( Putin has vehemently denied any involvement Russian courts found a group of Chechens guilty of the crimes . )
