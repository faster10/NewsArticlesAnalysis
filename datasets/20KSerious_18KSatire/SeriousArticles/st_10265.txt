Some reached back to the 1967 album that started it all , " The Velvet Underground and Nico , " by posting such songs as " I ' m Waiting for the Man , " " Venus in Furs " and " Heroin " songs that took their listeners to dark , forbidding places many of them weren ' t ready to go , whether it was the dark corridors of a Harlem brownstone to buy hard drugs or even harder core rituals of sadomasochistic sex . Over time , the album would become the hallowed cornerstone of such iconoclastic offshoots of the rock pop universe as new wave , punk and indie rock . It also created a space where a new kind of romantic vision of outlaw street life would seize the imaginations not only of musicians , but of artists , writers and filmmakers .
