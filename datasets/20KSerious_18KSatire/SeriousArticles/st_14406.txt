A child psychiatrist who supported the study said it " very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine . " But advocacy groups say it ' s too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines . The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn ' t include children under the age of 3 , which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines . It says thimerosal wasn ' t completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003 . Their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin , so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines ?
