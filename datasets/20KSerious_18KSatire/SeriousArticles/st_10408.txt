( Update : A former Marine lawyer , who was actively recruiting for the JAG at the time , says it is ludicrous to suggest someone with Clinton s skills would have been rejected . Since the draft had ended , we were frantic for lawyers , he said , declining to be identified . Neither age nor eyesight would have been issue , he added . Many of the newly recruited lawyers were at least 26 years old and eyesight was only an issue for pilots , he said . Some lawyers he worked with had glasses the size of the bottle of Coke bottles . Another Marine lawyer , who served between 1973 and 1978 , confirmed this account , saying that one of the Marine lawyers he served with was a woman who weighed 200 pounds . They desperately needed lawyers , he said . )
