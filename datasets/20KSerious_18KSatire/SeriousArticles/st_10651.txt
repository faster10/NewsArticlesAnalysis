Over the past few weeks , Syrian medical groups and human rights workers have documented several Russian air strikes that appeared to target hospitals and other medical facilities . And in a report released on Sunday , Human Rights Watch said that at least two Russian air strikes on October 15th in Ter Ma aleh , and in another village in northern Homs , had killed at least 59 civilians , including 46 people from one family who were apparently related to a rebel commander . The Kremlin rejected the report on Monday .
