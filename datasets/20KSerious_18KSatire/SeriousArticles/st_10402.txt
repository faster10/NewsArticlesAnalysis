Marlowe : The reason I thought he would be good here is this would be a character that would allow him to play everything he ' s good at . This would allow him to be dramatic this would allow him to be funny this would allow him to be charming . The role is written to show the different aspects of what it means to be a man : to be a lover , a long suffering son , a tremendous father , a man ' s man , to hang out with the boys . The role is written to see all those facets . If we only saw him annoying Beckett , or the narcissism he has , he would come across as very unattractive . The nice thing about the show is we get to see all the facets of the diamond .
