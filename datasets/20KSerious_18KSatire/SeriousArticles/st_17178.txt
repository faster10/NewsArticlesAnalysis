Again , in terms of decision making , England got it wrong with their use of the bench . Tom Croft and Nick Easter made a decent impact but I would certainly have brought Danny Cipriani on after an hour in place of Luther Burrell . If you are chasing a game , Cipriani is your trump card . If you need two tries in the last 15 minutes the priority is to get your creative players on and also leave the ' gas ' players like Jonathan Joseph on . You have about only a 20 per cent chance of pulling the game out of the fire anyway , so defence is not your priority .
