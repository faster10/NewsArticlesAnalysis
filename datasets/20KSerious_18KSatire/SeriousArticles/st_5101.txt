A number of the suicide bombers have been identified , including 29 year old French citizen Ismail Mostefai , who was described as a petty criminal and who French authorities identified as a potential radical years ago , though he was never charged with a serious crime . Another of the bombers appears to have used a Syrian passport and a fake name to slip into Europe disguised as a refugee . Greek authorities released a report over the weekend saying the man came on a boat with nearly 200 other people from Turkey to the Greek island of Leros in early October . European authorities say he eventually made his way through the Balkans and into Austria before disappearing .
