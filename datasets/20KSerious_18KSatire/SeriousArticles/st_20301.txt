As for UNC , I agree that playing two FCS foes is not that different from playing two Sun Belt teams I think the committee is mostly concerned about the message it sends . If the Tar Heels make it , why not everyone go out and do the same thing ? But I also don ' t think it ' d be nearly as big a deal if South Carolina had gone 9 3 instead of 3 9 and Illinois had gone 7 5 instead of 5 7 . Instead you might be hearing more lauding of the Tar Heels for being the rare Power 5 team that takes on two non conference counterparts . Of the current top six , only Clemson and Iowa can say the same .
