Which is why , even though Manning said , If I m not mistaken , I think we re still in the lead in the division , so if anything we ve still got a great opportunity to finish the season strong , the Giants still look like they re teetering on the brink . Instead of returning from their bye week with a little breathing room ? something they would ve had with just one more victory ? they ve turned the final six games into a tightrope that might just end up as a referendum on whether the whole Coughlin Era should end .
