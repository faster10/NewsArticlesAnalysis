Rwanda and Congo can grow together if Rwanda becomes a gateway for international businesses to invest in Congo ' s natural resource sector , while attracting investors on the basis of good roads , electricity , transparent business regulations and banking institutions . Singapore grew similarly by attracting investors interested in neighboring Indonesia ' s and Malaysia ' s natural resources . All three countries benefited tremendously from this arrangement : Malaysia , Indonesia , and Singapore are now all in the top 20 of world economies . Congo and Rwanda may not be top 20 candidates soon , but a peaceful sub region would be a good start .
