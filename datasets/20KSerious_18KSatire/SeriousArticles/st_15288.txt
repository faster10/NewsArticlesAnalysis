I don ' t think it ' s basketball . I think it ' s kind of like a circus sort of thing . Why don ' t we have a 5 point shot ? A 7 point shot ? You know , where does it stop , that sort of thing . But that ' s just me , that ' s just old school . To a certain degree , you better embrace it or you ' re going to lose . And every time we ' ve won a championship , the 3 point shot was a big part of it . Because it is so powerful and you ' ve gotta be able to do it . And nobody does it better than Golden State , and you know where they ' re at . So it ' s important . You can ' t ignore it .
