While I ' m walking to the gym , a podcast news story captures my interest . I stop on the sidewalk for a minute , pull out my Android phone and do a Google search to find the version of that story on the podcast ' s website . I scan the first few paragraphs and realize I ' ll want to read the story later in depth . So from my phone , I share that story to my Instapaper account ( a free service that saves and delivers long format text content in a format easy to read on a variety of mobile devices ) .
