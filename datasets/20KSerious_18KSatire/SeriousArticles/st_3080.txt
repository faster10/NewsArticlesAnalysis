On Monday , a Banksy artwork popped up on a building site in Knightsbridge . The picture was of Cosette from Les Miserables , and she was weeping in a cloud of tear gas . Next to her was a QR code which , when scanned into phone , links to video of police using teargas and bullets in the " jungle " in Calais . The site is opposite the French embassy and the message was clear . You are bastards . You should show these people some compassion . We should all show these people some compassion . Unfortunately , Banksy doesn ' t say exactly what form that compassion should take .
