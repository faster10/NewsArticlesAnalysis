SF : Very few come down to factors like this , and if so , it wouldn ' t be hard so difficult to track because it would center around one betting account rather than a network of accounts which have a history in betting suspicious matches . Crooks rarely work alone as individual accounts can often be closed , restricted etc . It ' s usually about getting as much cash as ? they can on a selection , spread across many different accounts . One ? famous case ? Caroline Wozniacki withdrew from a match ( Luxembourg , ? Oct . 2009 ) when clearly in control 7 ? ? 5 , 5 ? 0 , but also ailing with an injury . Her coach father told her in an on court coaching exchange that she should retire as the injury would only be worse the next day and thus she wouldn ' t be able to play , so why not be a sport and let the other girl continue ( the opponent was Anne Kremer in her home , and possibly her last event ) . This conversation was not obvious to 99 of us because it was in Polish , but some Polish speaking viewers seized this information and pummeled the betting until she officially withdrew . Good intentions , but badly executed . . . .
