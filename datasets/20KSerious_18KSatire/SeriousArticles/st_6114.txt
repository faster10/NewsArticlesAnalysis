But while this is the public image of a mass shooting , it may not be an entirely accurate one . As Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post wrote yesterday , mass shootings happen on a more than daily basis in our gun soaked country . They have to be pretty spectacular anymore to get national news coverage , something that some of the more famous shooters clearly understood and planned for . ? But if you dig into the more day to day mass shootings ( I can t believe I had to write that ) , compiled by the ironically named Guns Are Cool board at Reddit , what becomes clear is that the typical mass shooter is not a terrorist or even a lone wolf motivated by the promise of fame through infamy , a la Seung Hui Cho ? or Elliot Rodger .
