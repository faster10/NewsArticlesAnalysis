" Kim Kyong Hui will be his ' caretaker ' to nominate him if Kim Jong Il dies , " said Ha Taekeung , president of Open Radio for North Korea , a Seoul based non governmental organization . He noted that for Kim Jong Un to formally assume power , he would need to be nominated chairman of the National Defense Committee and general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea . " The principle of the bloodline means that only a direct descendant of Kim Il Sung can be part of the succession , and Jang is not a descendant of Kim Il Sung . "
