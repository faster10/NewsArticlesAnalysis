Combine the political worries about a Cruz nomination with the personal distaste for him , and you get a party establishment that is feeling like it may have no choice but to support Trump . So major GOP donors who used to turn their noses up at Trump are now writing him checks . As one Republican fundraiser told The Washington Post , " A lot of donors are trying to figure their way into Trump ' s orbit . There is a growing feeling among many that he may be the guy , so people are certainly seeing if they can find a home over there . " Iowa governor Terry Branstad , who ordinarily stays neutral during the caucuses , isn ' t supporting any particular candidate but is telling everyone not to vote for Cruz . As one reporter described the establishment ' s thinking , " Should we back the guy who wants to be liked and doesn ' t really care that much about policy specifics , or should we back the guy who doesn ' t care what we think and is adamant about getting his way to the point of encouraging a politically futile government shutdown in 2013 ? Not a tough call . "
