In 2013 , The Simpsons aired an episode called Love is a Many Splintered Thing . Bart watches a film that parodies the classic Love Actually . In the clip , the Prime Minister professes his love for a blue collar woman named Eliza Commonbottom . In memory of Rickman , the producers posted a clip from this episode . This clip included the intended target , Rickman , in his Severus Snape persona . However , a pleasant surprise lay within the same brief time span . In the background as Snape , the best known character Rickman played , dances with members of Parliament , we hear a familiar tune . The song is All the Young Dudes , by none other than David Bowie .
