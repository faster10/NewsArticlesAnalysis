However , while that is a big issue and maybe even the biggest to some , it is still only one issue . Mr Trump s messaging to the GOP base on pretty much every other issue seems to vary pretty much every other day . One day we should shut the government down to stop funding the baby butchers at Planned Parenthood , but the next day they do some great things . One day the Iran deal is the worst deal Trump s ever seen negotiated , but the next day he refuses to kill it once he s president . One day Mr Trump is calling out feckless GOP leadership , but the next day he s got the back of Mr Amnesty Paul Ryan for House speaker .
