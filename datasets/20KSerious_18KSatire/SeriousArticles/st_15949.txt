Of course , you could argue that both parties suffer from this kind of myopia . Voters are busy and don t exactly spend a lot of time diving into the policy weeds before they pick a candidate . Progressives have thrilled to Bernie Sanders promises like free public college tuition , a national 15 minimum wage , and drastically higher taxes on the wealthy ? all of which are fairly sweeping and ( in some people s views ) not necessarily good ideas . But you can at least imagine a path to achieving such things , for better or worse . There is no conceivable way , on the other hand , to cut 10 trillion in taxes over 10 years and without capsizing the budget or devastating the entitlement programs upon which millions of Americans rely . But that s exactly what Trump is offering ? and , at least for now , what Republican voters are happy to buy . ?
