Yet politicians have also participated in this narrow minded ahistorical campaign to discredit the Russians . Senator Cotton ' s ridiculous comments blamed Obama for Russia ' s role in Syria ( while I actually criticize Obama ' s policies in my article here to agree with Cotton would be to ignore the last 70 years of history between Moscow and Damascus ) . Senator Cotton argued that Russia ' s actions were the result of inaction in US foreign policy . Similarly , Senator Cruz has said that " America . . . retreated from the world " therefore prompting Russia ' s actions inside Syria . Rubio has gone one step forward when he said that " Putin he ' s trying to destroy NATO . . . He is exploiting a vacuum that this administration has left in the Middle East . " Carly Fiorina has said like a typical ignoramus that General Soleimani traveled to Russia to talk to Vladimir Putin into aligning with Iran and Syria . And of course Hillary Clinton needs to be mentioned in this foreign policy hiatus , as she has previously challenged Obama to be more hawkish in confronting Russia ' s involvement in the Syrian war . She stated : " We have to stand up to his bullying , and specifically in Syria , it is important " . In essence most of the Republicans and Hillary Clinton seem to be on the same erroneous page .
