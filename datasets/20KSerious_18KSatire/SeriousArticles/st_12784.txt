" I was always a very hard working student and wanted to go to a good school and worked really hard to go to a good school , " said O ' Brien , who attended Harvard University . " And then when I got there , I immediately had the fear that a lot of people have , which is , I don ' t belong here . These other people know a lot more than I do . They ' re smarter . I ' m the fake . I ' m the phony . And I think that is the common denominator that you see with a lot of people , whether they ' re artists or performers . They don ' t think that they belong . "
