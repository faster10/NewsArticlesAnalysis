Stuart Leasor , of Woodstock Leasor Ltd , acting on behalf of GFH , countered : ' It is clear from David Haigh ' s statement issued today that this is just another desperate attempt to showboat . Whilst GFH Capital maintains its claims of fraud against Mr Haigh in the DIFC Court , Mr Haigh files claims of no substance and negligible value purely to attract media attention . He claims to have no funds and little access to the outside world and yet he seems to be able to bombard the media at will . '
