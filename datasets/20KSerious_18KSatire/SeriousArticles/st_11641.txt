Yeffet : It ' s mandatory that every passenger I don ' t care his religion or whatever he is every passenger has to be interviewed by security people who are qualified and well trained , and are being tested all year long . I trained my guys and educated them , that every flight , for them , is the first flight . That every passenger is the first passenger . The fact that you had safe flights yesterday and last month means nothing . We are looking for the one who is coming to blow up our aircraft . If you do not look at each passenger , something is wrong with your system .
