New players are stepping into the vacuum . Google announced the Lunar X Prize in 2007 , riffing off the successful Ansari XPRIZE , where private teams were challenged to build a reusable spacecraft to reach the boundary of outer space . A 20 million prize will go to the first team to land a robot on the moon that can travel 500 meters and transmit images and video . Twenty teams are still in the running . The competition expires when all the prizes have been claimed or at the end of 2015 , whichever comes first .
