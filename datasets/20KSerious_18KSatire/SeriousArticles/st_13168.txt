? Jason La Confora , meanwhile , reported that the Seahawks are working to try to add an offensive linemen by the end of Tuesday s trade deadline and are willing to move a receiver ? he named Chris Matthews ? to try to get that done . That obviously makes every sense in the world for Seattle to dangle a receiver as trade bait with Paul Richardson coming back and the team possibly needing to remove a receiver to make room for Richardson when he comes back , anyway ( and also having B . J . Daniels back on the practice squad as a depth receiver if needed ) . But it s hard to know what the Seahawks would realistically get for Matthews , who has four receptions on five targets this season .
