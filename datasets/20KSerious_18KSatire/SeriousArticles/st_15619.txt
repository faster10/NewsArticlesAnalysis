Every church group in Tuscaloosa , it seemed , clawed rubble out of my yard , or out of the playground across the street , meaning I can never again say anything mean about the Episcopalians . I came to enjoy the company . That first afternoon , I straightened up from tugging on an unmoving limb to see Allen McClendon , the husband of my son ' s music teacher , saw through a tree that blocked my drive . He brought his father , Rick , and an old , brown dog named B . J . , and we told duck hunting stories and I don ' t think any lies , but it was hard to tell over the roar of the saws . And then they , too , were gone , to help someone else , somewhere down the road .
