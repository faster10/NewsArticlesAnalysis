This sort of rhetoric has won over the heavily evangelical Republican Iowa caucuses in the past . In 2008 , Mike Huckabee , with Vander Plaats endorsement , triumphed in Iowa . Four years later , Rick Santorum , also endorsed by Vander Plaats , prevailed . The outcome of this year s Iowa caucus may tell us if the American religious right has retained its outsize influence in American politics or if a new populist force has supplanted it . Trump is demonstrating that many grassroots conservatives are far more comfortable with what Ted Cruz called New York values than anyone imagined . If the leaders of the Christian right can t stop Trump , it could mark the end of the movement as we know it . ?
