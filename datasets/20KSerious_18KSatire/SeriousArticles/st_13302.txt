In spite of DACA , which granted Bobby and other young people like him a temporary work permit and driver ' s license , the benefits of this program did not extend to his undocumented mother battling breast cancer , nor his father who was unable to find employment that would afford him health benefits . Bobby recently shared with us that at the end of last month , ineligible for health insurance and unable to afford the medical attention she needed and deserved , his mother passed away .
