Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently . When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago , the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I ' ve ever heard in the theatre that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto surgery . There also was a very vociferous walk out : a gentleman who fairly barked " You get what you pay for , folks " as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end .
