And of course , they say Trump is not conservative enough . Maybe he is , maybe he isn t . But this criticism comes from folks like Rove who gave us the budget busting George W . Bush . Rove helped orchestrate a presidency that left in its wake a ? 1 trillion dollar unfunded prescription drug plan even Ted Kennedy gleefully supported . His idea of a conservative president s first reaction to Sept . 11 , 2001 ( after racing to the nearest mosque ) was to expand the already jovian federal government with yet another full scale department of Homeland Security . And he is the one Fox turns to for conservative analysis ?
