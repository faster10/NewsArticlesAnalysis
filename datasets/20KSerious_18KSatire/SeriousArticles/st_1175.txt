Already , Chungyalpa said , the area has been affected by an increase in tropical storms off the coast , which brings in more seawater and changes the flooding patterns in the delta . Some researchers , however , have questioned the link between climate change and more intense tropical storms . Apart from climate change , construction of dams and hydropower plants along the delta could further disrupt its waters , potentially displacing millions , destroying sources of drinkable water and disrupting the production of rice , Chungyalpa said .
