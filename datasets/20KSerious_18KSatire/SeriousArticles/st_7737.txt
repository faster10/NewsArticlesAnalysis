These poor poor fanboys who have not won jack in a decade and 1 2 . They are like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings , deep in their man caves , whispering deflategate , belicheat , spygate , over and over to themselves . join the real world trolls read the papers schefter recants ( throws Mort under the bus ) , read Wetzel from Monday . not to mention the judge throwing this out . if the Wells Report were a sr . thesis , they would have gotten an F , from the gathering of the evidence to the presentation , a joke . If you are really holding on to the cheat card all you Gollums you need therapy ps , don t expect anyone else to win the AFC for the next three years . especially you Jets , Ravens , Browns , Bengals , Bills , Dolphins , Jags , Titans , Broncos . maybe just maybe Chiefs , Steelers or Raiders
