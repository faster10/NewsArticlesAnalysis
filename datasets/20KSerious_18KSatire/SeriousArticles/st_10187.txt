This summer , when we openly publish our software detection code , you can take what you find useful for your own work , and then help us make it better for our SETI search . As I wished , I ' d like to get all Earthlings spending a bit of their day looking at data from the Allen Telescope Array to see if they can find patterns that all of the signal detection algorithms may still be missing , and while they are doing that , get them thinking about their place in the cosmos . That ' s the way we can change the world !
