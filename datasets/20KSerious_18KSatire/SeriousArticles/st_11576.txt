Stop Fitzgerald : If you assume the Panthers will stop the run , as they have most of the season , that makes Arizona wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald the prime target . Fitzgerald had 175 yards receiving , including his 75 yarder in overtime , against Green Bay last week . Shut Fitzgerald and the run down and odds are you shut down the Cardinals . Fitzgerald lines up in the slot about half of the time , so he ll likely get paired against nickelback Cortland Finnegan a lot . That s not an ideal matchup for Carolina . Finnegan is 5 foot 10 and Fitzgerald is 6 3 . Don t be surprised if middle linebacker Luke Kuechly gives Finnegan some help . Josh Norman likely will draw Fitzgerald when he lines up outside . That is a good matchup for the Panthers because Norman has done a solid job all season of shutting down the opposing team s No . 1 receiver . The Panthers simply can t let Fitzgerald have a big day and leave saying they are the better team .
