The Atlantic defines its readers as " America ' s most influential individuals who wish to be challenged , informed , and entertained . " By that very definition , it is selling " advertorials " to people who are the least likely to take them seriously , especially when heavy handed . There is a fine line between advertorial and outright advertising copywriting , and this piece crossed it . The Church of Scientology is just as much at fault for thinking this piece would survive The Atlantic readers ' intellectual scrutiny . But this isn ' t even the real issue .
