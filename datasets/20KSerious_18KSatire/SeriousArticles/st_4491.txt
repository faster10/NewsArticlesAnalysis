Dude who sings about anal glands : This song came surprisingly easy . As per my assignment , the song had to be humorous , which was a little intimidating at first , for two reasons : 1 . Being told to be funny SUCKS , and 2 . The survival of a species is a serious subject , and I didn ' t want the real issue to be overshadowed by male anatomy references and poop jokes . The turning point was when I thought to write the song as a love letter to the pangolin . Once I embraced that idea , I was able to balance the the dirty jokes with genuine love and concern for this animal , and the punch lines felt somehow more poignant and less offensive .
