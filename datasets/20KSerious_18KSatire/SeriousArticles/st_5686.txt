Ms Bhutto ' s injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch . Detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence . Ms Bhutto ' s head did not completely disappear from view until 0 . 6 seconds before the blast . She can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle . Whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained , the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred .
