McCarthy recommended in July 2014 that Detective Dante Servin , an off duty officer who shot 22 year old Rekia Boyd in 2012 , should be fired for lying about the incident . McCarthy ' s decision came two months after the Independent Police Review Authority recommended that Servin be fired . Though McCarthy disagreed publicly with the criminal charges for Servin , he said in a statement , " After considerable deliberation , I have come to the conclusion that Officer Dante Servin showed incredibly poor judgment in his efforts to intervene in a low level dispute while off duty . " Servin was acquitted in Cook County criminal court on involuntary manslaughter charges . Servin shot five bullets into a crowd of four people after he alleged that one of them pulled something from his waistband and pointed it at him .
