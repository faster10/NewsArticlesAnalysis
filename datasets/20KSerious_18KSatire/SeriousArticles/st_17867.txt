India France contacts have intensified these past months . In a visit last April PM Modi announced the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft in an attempt to break stalled negotiations over the 126 MMRCA fighters India was to buy from Dassault Aviation . Although sources say the contract is close to finalisation with the 50 offset clause being met in the nearly 9 billion deal , officials at the Elys es Palace were tight lipped about inking the contract during the visit . Not a word has been uttered about the remaining 90 aircraft in the original Rafale proposal .
