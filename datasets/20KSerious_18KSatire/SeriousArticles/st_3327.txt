Why they ll lose : One concern is facing Denver ' s defense with very little balance on offense . The Patriots didn ' t even try to run the ball last week against the Chiefs , and while that was a design of the game plan , it doesn ' t seem like they will get very much from the running game from here on out . Steven Jackson is averaging 2 . 4 yards per carry since joining the Patriots . That ' s not ideal against a Broncos defense that was first in the NFL in passing yards allowed and first in sacks in the regular season .
