Zakaria : He now knows how to parry that kind of question pretty well . He didn ' t back down from a few things he had said that have gotten him into trouble in Iran . One of them was that he had praised Cyrus the Great , the pre Islamic Iranian monarch , and he had been criticized by some of the conservative clergy who said you should not be highlighting Iran ' s pre Islamic past , you should be highlighting Iran ' s Islamic heritage . And he in effect doubled down on his praise . He said he was a great king , he abolished serfdom , he abolished slavery , I don ' t see what ' s wrong with praising him .
