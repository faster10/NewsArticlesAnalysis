Tampa Bay hosts New Orleans in Week 14 , and , as you might have heard , the Saints defense is like a giant , steaming all you can eat smorgasbord of yards and points . New Orleans allows the most points per game ( 31 . 7 ) , the most total yards ( 425 . 2 ) and the most rushing yards ( 137 . 8 ) . Sims is averaging 9 . 75 touches per game and 4 . 7 yards per carry so far this season he just gained 56 yards on seven attempts against Atlanta ' s D , a group that allows just 3 . 8 YPC . Assuming he sees his usual workload against the Saints , he ' s a good bet for 65 80 yards and a score . All your Bucs get the green light this week .
