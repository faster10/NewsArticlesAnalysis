It might even be worse in North Carolina , where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40 , 000 patients from 2005 to 2010 . This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax exempt status . A recent review found that three hospitals in Illinois were providing a very small amount of care for free or at discounted rates . This has led to a number of facilities losing their nonprofit status and legislators to try to pass new laws requiring specify charity care minimums for nonprofit status .
