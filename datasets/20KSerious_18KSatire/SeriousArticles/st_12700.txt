If we consider it an official visit then there certainly arise many questions . Firstly , is there really anything as surprise visit by a head of state or government to another sovereign state in the international relations ? A receiving or host country definitely requires a reasonable time to make extensive security and other necessary arrangements for a high profile state visit . Do two head of governments personally decide to meet each other bypassing their respective foreign offices , and disclose this fact through social media later ? Has the EU like visa free regime also been introduced in the South Asia that Pakistan didn t bother at all about the valid visas and other international travel documents of PM Modi s 120 member delegation before inviting them in the country ? Why did PM Nawaz Sharif choose to take PM Modi right to his personal residence in Lahore instead of proceeding to the Governor House or State Guest House in the city ?
