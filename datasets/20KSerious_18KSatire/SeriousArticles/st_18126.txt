That , I suppose , marks out Rubio s path to the Republican nomination . He began as a so called mainstream conservative , slightly soft when it came to manly American hatred ( and manly American footwear ) . That didn t sell and now he has fully embraced the paranoid , apocalyptic worldview that drove up the poll numbers of Trump and Ted Cruz , coating it in a genial blandness that resembles expensive hair gel and prevents all thought from entering or getting out . Instead of Trump s horror fables about murderous invading hordes or the Cruz mythology of the Last Christian Hero standing against chaos , Rubio is positively chirpy about the terrible state of everything : It s really too bad that our president cares more about Muslims than about actual Americans !
