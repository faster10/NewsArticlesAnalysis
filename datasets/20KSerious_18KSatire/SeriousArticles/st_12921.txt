' THST made clear its response to the scheduling of the tie . Since then , we have been in conversation with THFC and the football authorities to find out why the tie was scheduled at the most inconvenient time for Spurs supporters , and what could be done to mitigate that inconvenience . There has been lots of rumour and speculation since the announcement was made and , as always , we ' ve tried to establish the facts before making comment . Questions are still outstanding but we feel supporters deserve to be updated , so this is the situation as we currently understand it . We appreciate the patience of the many fans who have contacted us on this matter .
