" Well , you know , we love it that we can have some extra guys around that are young guys that aspire to be coaches , and I think one of the most difficult things about our profession is how do you get experience so that you can grow and develop as a coach ? " Saban said . " The fact that we can have a few extra guys now to be analysts , to break down film , to do quality control type work , I think as an entry level that is beneficial to some guys that can move on maybe to be graduate assistants , get on the field and get some coaching experience . Regardless of where they need to start professionally , I think this is a great thing for our profession , to be able to help develop coaches , and I think those guys now have created a role and a niche for themselves that ' s very important to every program because we all depend on them .
