When I asked Occupy Wall Street organizer Jesse Myerson about the possible endgame of the movement , he replied , " That ' s a dumb question . The movement isn ' t yet 3 weeks old . " Fair point . As a culture , we have a short attention span we ' re too inclined to see everything as a sitcom and want to fast forward to the end . Myerson was being a bit evasive . And this makes sense . Critics of Occupy Wall Street may demand to know the agenda the ending of the movement , but perhaps its ongoing victory is that its story is even being told .
