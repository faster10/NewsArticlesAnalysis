Weiland died on Thursday of cardiac arrest . He was on tour , promoting his 2015 album Blaster with his new band , the Wildabouts . It was his first solo effort to function as a traditional kind of glam rock record his earlier records , 1998 s 12 Bar Blues and 2008 s Happy in Galoshes , were more alien and estranged . 12 Bar Blues in particular is a record of profound dislocation and distraction . The songs drift recklessly through ideas and sounds , and often feel as if they ll collapse into unreadable wreckage .
