It means there needs to be a change in how movies are nominated . We need to drill down and look at who is making those decisions . Only directors can vote for directors . Only actors can vote for actors . Talking about the academy overall , it ' s still predominantly male , white and older and there is no requirement to see all of the contenders before you vote , which doesn ' t seem smart to me . In fact , when they ' re talking about the nominees , what does it mean if you can be an academy member for life , but you don ' t necessarily have to show active involvement in the movie community anymore ? So , who do you vote for ? You vote for those people whose names you recognize and for your friends . So , for example , someone like Clint Eastwood may get nominated over someone like Ava DuVernay just because of who the members are in that particular category .
