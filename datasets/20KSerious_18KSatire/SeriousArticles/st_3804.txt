Derek Carr at Broncos : Carr has been a tremendous early season find for fantasy owners , but he gets his toughest matchup of the year for the first round of the fantasy playoffs and is coming off a three interception game at home against the Chiefs . The Broncos have allowed the fewest yards , touchdowns , and fantasy points to quarterbacks this season . They ve allowed just as many touchdowns as they have interceptions ( 11 : 11 ) . Quarterbacks are averaging under a touchdown per game against the Broncos and 216 . 75 passing yards . In his Week 5 home game against this defense , Carr went 26 of 39 for 249 yards , one touchdown , and one interception . Now on the road , this isn t a spot to use Carr . Both Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree should struggle to get open .
