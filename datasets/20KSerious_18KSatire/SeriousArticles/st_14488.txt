And in the evening I sat down with a couple of young women from the local tourist office and had a conversation in Mandarin through an interpreter about relationships and everyday life in North Korea .

They said most of their friends and local teenagers are studying Mandarin to do business and network with the growing number of Chinese visiting the region .
