Life in Aleppo does not resemble life anywhere else in the world . My city has been ripped apart by war and has ? seen things that defy the imagination . Words can t do them justice . It ' s a city full of love and war , childhood and death , pain and suffering . It ' s considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world as it gets bombed every day with barrels of explosives and slaughtered with a knife by Islamic State in the eastern countryside . I ' ve seen the lives of innocent people destroyed by death and disability . Houses are no longer safe in Aleppo . There is nowhere left to hide . And no one knows how long it ' s going to last as the international community turns a blind eye to these forgotten tragedies .
