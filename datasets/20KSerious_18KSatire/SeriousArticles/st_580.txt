I don ' t think there ' s been a time where I ' ve regretted speaking up , but I have really tried to stay away from talking about specific YouTubers with big fanbases because in the past I ' ve had people with massive audiences and the result was just a constant stream of harassment . While it ' s something that I ' ve gotten better at dealing with , there ' s nothing worse than literally having a 100 , 000 twitter messages from children calling you a nigger or harassing my husband or contacting my job .
