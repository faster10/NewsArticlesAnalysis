Looking at the censored photos , I was surprised about the selection . Some were of angry looking security guards with scruffy barracks in the background , others of government officials going through our passports . I could just about understand that . But others were in my eyes harmless , even scenic . There was an old couple walking alongside the cornfields , a family out in the countryside waving from their house , and a mother cycling with her sleeping baby on a seat on the back of her bike . One photo showed a volleyball pitch next to the customs building by the border crossing .
