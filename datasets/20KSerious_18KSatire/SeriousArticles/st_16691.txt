When I first heard that LCD Soundsystem was getting back together to headline this year s Coachella music festival , I was among the many fans who felt conflicted , even a little disappointed . To begin with , there was the issue that multiple reps from the band s label , DFA , had vehemently denied reports of the reunion , damaging the credibility of journalists from Consequence of Sound and Billboard who had broken and confirmed the story . ( Hey idiots , LCD Soundsystem isn t reuniting , label manager Kris Petersen wrote on Twitter , telling Vulture , Can we all just move on with our fucking lives ? ) After the reunion show was announced , proving the reports had been right all along , the charade seemed like a sad instance of lying in order to try to keep a poorly kept secret ? like James Murphy had been pulling a JJ Abrams .
