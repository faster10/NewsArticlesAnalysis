It s not always the easy thing to do , to stand up for something like that . We as players , we listen to what we re supposed to do , we play the games , we go to class , we do everything . Sometimes you lose sight of the influence that we have . You lose sight that there s a whole bunch of No . 5 jerseys , UNC jerseys and there s a whole bunch of North Carolina basketball this and that , and posters everywhere and you re signing autographs . You realize that you can really impact people and you re really a voice for the university . "
