Maybe the " workaround " lies in the acknowledgment portion of the process . According to reports , users found in violation of " six strikes " will have to somehow acknowledge they ' ve received and read the alert explaining their account was engaged in illicit activity . Some ISPs are said to be rolling this out as pop ups ( don ' t ask me how ) . I ' m not sure what that entails for shared Internet access . Does everyone get the pop up ? What happens if you ignore it ? What happens if , for whatever reason , the pop up doesn ' t appear in the first place ?
