The Patriots ' low Gini coefficient is partly due to quarterback Tom Brady ' s ( comparatively ) modest contract . His 9 million annual average salary is far less than many star quarterbacks , like the Green Bay Packers ' Aaron Rodgers ( 22 million ) , the Seattle Seahawks ' Russell Wilson ( 21 . 9 million ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ' Ben Roethlisberger ( 21 . 85 million ) and the Carolina Panthers ' Cam Newton ( 20 . 8 million ) . The only Patriot that makes more than 10 million , on average , is offensive tackle Nate Solder ? who hasn ' t actually played since tearing his bicep in a game against Dallas in October .
