Christie arrived wearing a dark jacket with matching tie over his white dress shirt , but he shed the jacket during the Q A session which took up most of the nearly hour and a half long event . Before answering questions , however , he opened with a brief but heartfelt vignette about a former drug addict who went through rehab , rather than being jailed for drug possession , and who as a result recovered to reclaim his life .

" Christie s point is that more resources should be expended targeting treatment and recovery of addicts rather than putting them in jail .
