For all of our talk about law and order in this country , there is a lot that is wrong with our legal system . We all should feel ashamed when someone is freed from death row or life in prison after DNA testing revealed him or her not to be the real killer or rapist . It should pain our heart when the prosecution withholds evidence in a case that could exonerate someone . And all of us , regardless of race or economic status , should scream to high heaven when the police don ' t do their job equally for all citizens .
