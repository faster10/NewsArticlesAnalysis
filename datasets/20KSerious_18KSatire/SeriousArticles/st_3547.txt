Martin O Malley had a strong night . It s not surprising that O Malley is fluent in policy across several dimensions . But this debate was the first time he showed real knowledge and skill . He kept himself in the game , responding to both Clinton and Sanders , while touting his record as governor of Maryland ( while , later in the night , downplaying his challenges as mayor of Baltimore ) . It was the first time , for my part , that I saw any fire in O Malley . If there was a winner in the debate , he takes the prize . Unfortunately for O Malley , it s hard to imagine a world in which this does him much good . There just aren t many people watching a presidential debate on a Saturday night , and while the former governor had a great performance , it s unlikely that many beyond reporters and political junkies actually watched .
