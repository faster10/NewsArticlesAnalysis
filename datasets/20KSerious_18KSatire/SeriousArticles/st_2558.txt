It ' s not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies . Why such a shambles ? Early indications point in two directions : diffuse authority ( no one was really in charge of the whole initiative ) and poor execution ( the contractors simply dropped the ball ) . As we learn more about how the website was designed and tested , we will be in a better position to figure out what went wrong and where . But for the time being , we don ' t know so why drop the guillotine blade and run the risk of beheading the wrong person ?
