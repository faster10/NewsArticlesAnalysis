Jeffrey is the one to watch on the Bears offense , as his presence really opens up the game plan for Chicago . His size gives him big physical advantages on almost every corner that tries to cover him , and Jeffrey had seven catches for 90 yards against the Packers last time out . The extra days off probably will enable him to play against the 49ers , and that means trouble for the S . F . secondary . Jeffrey s presence means Bennett can run underneath routes , and Forte and or Langford can both find room to run out of the backfield .
