Conservative Solutions PAC is also emphasizing Rubio s experience on national security and foreign policy as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees , but in a roundabout way . Multiple direct mail pieces that the group has sent to New Hampshire voters show images of politicians who are criticized for their approaches to foreign policy ? President Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , among others ? but make no real mention of Rubio .
