Every time we see a grand jury return no indictment , it ' s not only a blow to the victims and their families , it ' s a blow to the entire justice system . It ' s a blow to the vast majority of amazing police officers that suit up and put their lives on the line every day and follow the rules . It ' s a blow to the police departments that have worked so hard to foster a trusting partnership with the communities that they police . It ' s a blow to the communities that rely on police to keep them safe . It ' s a blow to the justice system , because with every one of these announcements , we lose tremendous faith and confidence in the system that was designed to protect us .
