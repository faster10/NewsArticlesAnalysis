For instance , Bill Clinton does not have a regular campaign conference call on his schedule . And he does not speak daily with anyone on the campaign , as he did in 2008 , when he would confer constantly with Penn to dissect polls and rehash strategy . This time around , Bill Clinton is invited to be more involved , but at the same time he doesn t spend every day on the phone , going through polls , said someone close to Clinton . There are full days , insiders said , when Clinton makes no calls at all , and spends hours at a time on his own correspondence and reading .
