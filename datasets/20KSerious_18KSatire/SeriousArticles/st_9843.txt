What a formidable group of performers we have here . Poehler took " Parks and Rec ' s " political campaign storyline and invested it with strong emotion as well as assiduous hilarity . You might call Lena Dunham ' s portrayal of Hannah in " Girls " minimalist or mumble core y I ' d call it marvelously sly . And Laura Dern : Holy cow , she turned " Enlightened " into a showcase for comic acting that carried the weight of the most riveting drama . Plus , Julia Louis Dreyfus is giving a great performance in a show , " Veep , " that hasn ' t quite lived up to its initial promise . A fascinating category by any measure .
