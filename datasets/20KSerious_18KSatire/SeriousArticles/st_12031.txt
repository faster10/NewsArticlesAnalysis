That s what we re learning from the new Reply All : A Governor s Story 1999 2007 , which is even less interesting than it sounds . Instead of a real portrait of Jeb s years leading the state of Florida ? which surely had its share of conflict and drama and assertion of principle ? this is a collection of email exchanges . And not exchanges with , say , Bret Easton Ellis or a teenage Lena Dunham or political rivals , but with random citizens who write in to give him advice or to seek help on tiny matters . Jeb says he spent as much as 30 hours a week reading and sending emails to constituents . If the exchanges collected in Reply All are typical of what that was like , it s amazing he was able to keep his eyes open .
