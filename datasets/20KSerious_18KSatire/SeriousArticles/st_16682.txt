What to watch : This will be a rematch of last year ' s wild card meeting in Charlotte , which the Panthers won 27 16 against a depleted Cardinals squad that didn ' t have Palmer . . . . Though this game features the NFL ' s most explosive offenses , a shootout seems unlikely given the quality of the respective defenses . . . . Expect Cardinals coach Bruce Arians to deploy his deep fleet of wideouts Larry Fitzgerald , John Brown and Michael Floyd against a Carolina secondary that ' s thin at corner behind all pro Josh Norman . Panthers Pro Bowlers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis form arguably the game ' s best linebacking tandem , and they may have to cover a lot of ground if Arizona keeps Carolina in nickel packages . . . . Fitzgerald ' s 176 receiving yards Saturday were a playoff career high . In eight postseason games , he has 10 TD catches and averages 114 receiving yards . . . . Arizona ' s David Johnson and Patrick Peterson and Carolina ' s Ted Ginn provide both teams with big play potential in the return game . . . . Keep an eye on Panthers DT Kawann Short , who had a team high 11 sacks and could be problem for Palmer , who operates best in a clean pocket . . . . Panthers Pro Bowl RB Jonathan Stewart rushed for 106 yards and two TDs against the Seahawks ' top ranked run defense ? in his first game since Dec . 13 . The Cardinals have allowed 381 rushing yards in their last three outings .
