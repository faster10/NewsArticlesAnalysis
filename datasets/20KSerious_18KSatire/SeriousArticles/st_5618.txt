The notion that guns make us safer is a fallacy . People with guns in their homes are much more likely to be killed with their own gun by accident , domestic violence or suicide than to use it ever against an intruder , according to Arthur Kellermann , writing in the New England Journal of Medicine . Similarly , people who carry guns are more likely to be shot and killed than those who are unarmed . A University of Pennsylvania study found that people carrying guns were 4 . 5 times more likely to be shot and 4 . 2 times more likely to be killed .
