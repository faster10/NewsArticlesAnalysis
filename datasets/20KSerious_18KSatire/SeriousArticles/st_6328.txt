I watched the video of Cam Newton responding to media questions about my letter to him earlier this week . I really appreciate his comments and his respect for my thoughts , and I was impressed with the sensitivity and graciousness with which he spoke . I am sorry I didn t understand him better until this week . It is clear from his remarks that he recognizes his leadership role , both on and off the field , and that he truly cares about the kids watching him . I respect his comments just as much as he did mine , and I wish him nothing but continued success on the field and in life .
