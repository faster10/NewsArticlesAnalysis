The outgoing Democratic governor , Steve Beshear , thinks that the numbers are moving but a majority of Kentuckians still oppose gay marriage . In 2004 , 75 percent of Kentucky voters supported the amendment to the state constitution that banned the recognition of same sex marriages . Today the polling indicates it s still maybe a 60 40 split against gay marriage , he told me . Obviously you re going to have a segment of the population that , for religious reasons or whatever reasons , just are wound up on that one issue . But most Kentuckians , I think , are moving on and focusing on : how do we make life better ? A poll conducted last week shows voters are deeply divided about how to deal with the Davis problem .
