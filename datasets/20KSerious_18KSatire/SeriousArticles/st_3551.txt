What ' s the difference between a surrogate and a prostitute ? Cheryl doesn ' t want the money upfront , and she doesn ' t want repeat business either ( six sessions and that ' s it , she warns him ) . But what passes between them is too intimate , too personal to be strictly business , at least from where Mark is lying . Does Cheryl see it differently ? Lewin suggests she too is touched by the experience not by the sex itself , but rather the effect it has on Mark , and his ability to put it into words .
