Biskupic : She was very direct , she wanted to clarify things for me , she wanted to tell me what she was thinking and why she would refer to " wise Latinas " and why that was important to her to speak to that audience . She is the one who is always speaking to broader audiences and easily breaks the mold . She said to me : It ' s very hard for people who haven ' t lived my life to know what it ' s like to have your experience looked down upon , to be viewed as inferior , to be viewed as not smart enough . You need to affirm that you have value . And here ' s a woman who has made it to the pinnacle of the federal judiciary , who has beat out so many people to get there , but she feels the need to still , as she says , affirm that she has value . I found that interesting . I found her very candid . I do not underestimate her in any way . She ' s very shrewd , I considered myself very lucky to get audiences with her . But I know that she really did it only to clarify things and elucidate her life and that what mattered most was that she was able to tell her own story in her own book .
