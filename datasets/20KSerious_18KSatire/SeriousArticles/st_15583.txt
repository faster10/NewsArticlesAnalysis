Teresa Barger : When you have a situation where the much touted invincibility of the Chinese policymakers have been called into question as it was the case in last August people start to get nervous all over again . A total of 20 different interventions were made by the Chinese policymakers last year . I think this absolutely will lead to a period of risk off . But what my great hope is that we will get it over with the inevitable devaluation in the Chinese yuan . If they could lead the stock market find a price and get that over with , we could then get some calm returning into the market later in 2016 .
