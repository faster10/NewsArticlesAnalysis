The two states are two of the whitest states in the country . Democratic voters in both states have a contrarian , quasi populist streak . They have a history of thumbing their noses at traditional Democratic contenders . That was the case in 1968 when New Hampshire Democrats backed Democratic anti Vietnam war Senator Eugene McCarthy . This was a major reason that then President Lyndon Johnson dropped his bid for re election . Iowa Democrats did the same forty years later when they backed insurgent then Democratic presidential candidate Obama over Hillary Clinton .
