When the question of who created SPECTRE ( whether Bond author Ian Fleming or his one time collaborator Kevin McClory ) presented a legal roadblock , the organization quietly disappeared from the films . The last time they had a substantial effect on the action was in 1971 ' s Diamonds Are Forever . Mind you , that was seventeen movies and forty four years ago , so clearly the series managed just fine without them . If anything , the concept of SPECTRE was well and truly ruined when Austin Powers used it as the basis for Mike Myers ' comical Dr Evil .
