Vikings ( 2 . 5 ) at Falcons ? The Falcons last six games ? A six point overtime win at home against the Redskins , a 10 point road loss to the Saints , a 3 point road win over the Titans , a 3 point overtime loss at home against the Buccaneers , a 1 point road loss to the Blaine Gabbert led 49ers , and a 3 point gag of a loss to the Colts . They ' re barely beating or not beating bad teams and the Vikings can give them problems on defense and in the run game . I ' m taking the points all day .
