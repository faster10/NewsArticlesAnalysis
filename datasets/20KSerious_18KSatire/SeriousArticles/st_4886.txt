On Tuesday , the American people will have their first opportunity to hear from the Obama administration about its dealings with the Castro regime when I chair a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ' s Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs . I look forward to hearing the perspectives of State Department officials , even though I am already concerned by the administration ' s reluctance to allow the American people to hear directly from the two White House officials who negotiated the deal with the Castro regime over the course of 18 months of secret negotiations , and without the input of our government ' s top diplomats and negotiators .
