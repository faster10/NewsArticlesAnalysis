But Murray did not do that . Instead , he began the fourth set with his usual determination to fight for every point , and within another 10 minutes he had caught a lucky break . Raonic called the trainer to attend to a problem high up in his right thigh ? an adductor muscle , to be precise . And although Raonic resumed after a five minute break in apparently solid physical condition , the pain worsened , to the point where he could no longer drive through his groundstrokes or push up properly on his serve . Murray won the last two sets 6 4 , 6 2 .
