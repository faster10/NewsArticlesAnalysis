The circuit breaker and other market interventions were announced by Chinese authorities in December after a continuous string of stock market slides . The circuit breaker , which was put into use for the first time on Monday and then again on Thursday , automatically stopped trading in stock markets if indices dropped or appreciated too sharply . While they had been presumably introduced to curb panic buying and selling , analysts were of the view that these measures only added to selling pressure the next day . Late on Thursday , Chinese securities regulator announced a suspension of this newly installed circuit breaker .
