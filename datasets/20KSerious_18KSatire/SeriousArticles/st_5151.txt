I m incredibly grateful to the Academy for this nomination ? particularly in a year with so many brilliant films and ? performances . This nomination is a testament to the vision of our fearless director Tom Hooper , and the support of my fellow cast members , especially the incandescent Alicia Vikander . ? Being recognised for THE DANISH GIRL is particularly special to me if sharing Lili and Gerda s journey and their love story can in any small way be a part of positive social change ? then I will be even more grateful .
