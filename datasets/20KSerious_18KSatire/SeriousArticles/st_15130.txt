" The more play makers you ' ve got out there on the field , and Tom knows what to do with them , he can find those matchups , that ' s what we need to do and have that in sync with our line , our communication and making sure we ' re in the right play when they give us a different look or being able to handle the pressure like we did on the first drive , " Belichick said . " I thought that was obviously a big drive for us for a lot of reasons . Number one , it gave us a lead , we had points , but number two , we handled those pressure situations and that certainly toned that down for quite a while after that . "
