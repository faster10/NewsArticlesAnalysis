One big question throughout the campaign has been whether Clinton , who as secretary of state was generally more hawkish and interventionist than Obama , would take the opportunity to distinguish herself from her old boss on foreign policy . She did , a bit , but you had to read between the lines to pick up on it . Clinton said that ISIS cannot be contained it must be defeated , likely aware that Obama is currently being widely criticized for saying a day before the Paris attacks that the group had been contained . She also noted that she did early ? on say that we needed to try to find ? a way to train and equip moderates so that we ? would have a better idea of how ? to deal with Assad . Clinton had formulated a plan for arming Syrian rebels as early as 2012 but was overruled by Obama . But these distinctions were likely lost on most viewers , who haven t been paying close attention to the administration s debates over Syria policy . ?
