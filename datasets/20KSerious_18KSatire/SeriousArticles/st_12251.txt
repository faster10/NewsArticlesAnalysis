It has been rumored that FilmOne , the Nigerian distributors of " Half of a Yellow Sun , " might have been late in submitting the film for certification . Not true . Most films that are screened in Nigerian cinemas are shown to the censor only a day or two before the films open to the paying public . In documentations that have been shown to me , there are instances even of movies being shown to the censor days after the movies had officially opened to the public . " Half of a Yellow Sun " was scheduled to open on April 25 . It was submitted to the censorship board at least two weeks earlier .
