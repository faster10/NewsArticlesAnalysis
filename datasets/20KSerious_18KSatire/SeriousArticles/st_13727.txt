If we are talking straight matchups , I would put Chris Harris Jr . on Edelman in man coverage and allow the cornerback to shadow with Edelman . Regardless of alignment or pre snap motion , Harris plays cat coverage there and gets up on Edelman at the snap . The Chiefs did a very poor job of disrupting the release at the line of scrimmage against the Patriots and it showed in the results . ( The one wild card here is Harris ' shoulder injury , which clearly affected him last week against the Steelers . )
