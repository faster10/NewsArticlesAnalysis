I like the notion of a tender social conscience . It fits my own Stealth Dad , who married the pretty girl at a Wake Forest College picnic , became a math teacher and then the principal who peacefully integrated the high school in the town of Garner , North Carolina . He served for years as an associate superintendent in Wake County , indispensable in the technocrat role . Once retired , he worked as the business manager for a church . Now , at 76 , Wayne Bare keeps marshmallows in his pocket , for his granddaughter Leah .
