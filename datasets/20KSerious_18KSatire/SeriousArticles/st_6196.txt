WILLIAMS VS . RADWANSKA : William has a serious winning record against Radwanska , eight wins and zero losses . The last time they met in a Grand Slam was the Wimbledon final in 2012 , when Williams won in three sets . Radwanska was ranked in the 30s back then , and she s now No . 4 in the world . Williams , meanwhile , has continued to be a dominant No . 1 . It will be a good match . She s been playing really well towards the end of the year , and already this year she s been very consistent , Williams said of Radwanska , who won a warmup event in Shenzhen . She presents a completely different game , an extremely exciting game . So I think it will be a long match and it will be a good match to see where I am .
