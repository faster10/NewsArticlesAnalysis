Last Monday , members of the House of Commons spent hours debating whether to ban the bombastic billionaire from ever entering Britain , a debate prompted by a petition by as many as 570 , 000 British citizens revolted by the Republican front runner s views on Muslims . Truth be told , it was not in the legislators power to bar Trump from entering the country , since , presumably , only the home secretary is authorised to do that . But the debate , one suspects , was an excuse for legislators to both ridicule the man and to engage in a high minded discussion about free speech . Perhaps an excuse also to debate an issue no less significant to those in the United States : How America has gone so astray as to choose a demagogue like Trump to be a potential candidate for president .
