I suppose it was inevitable that Rihanna would start to want to take the reins herself . She s still only 27 and has been in the limelight since she was 17 . She has had song writing credits before , using her real name Robyn Fenty , but this time she is credited on every track but one . There are lots of other backroom talents cited but none of the established hit teams that have powered her career . There is no Stargate , Dr Luke , Max Martin , Calvin Harris or Sia Furler , all of whom submitted songs over the three years of the album s gestation only to have them rejected .
