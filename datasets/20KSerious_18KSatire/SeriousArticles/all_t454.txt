Men held for trying to rob Aaron Schock's home
Two men are being held on $70,000 bond each after they allegedly tried to rob Rep. Aaron Schock’s home. Illinois’ Peoria Journal Star reported on Monday that Derek H. Martin, 24, and Adam F. Bennett, 27, were charged with attempted residential burglary. Martin was also charged with felony possession of a firearm. Story Continued Below The home involved is rented by Schock; he is not the owner of the property. The two were allegedly caught red-handed when a realty company called police after men were reported to be seen in the vacant home. Prosecutor David Kenny said the suspects were found holding a handgun and a Journal Star article that detailed the property as usually being vacant. Schock, a Republican who represents Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, was not home at the time. “The article got printed that a home on the north end of town was vacant. That, to me, is a want ad for anybody, regardless of who lives there, to break in,” Schock said, according to the Star. “I don’t have an issue with people trashing on me. I think the question it begs is, ‘What was the news?’ And was it really warranted to advertise that a home was vacant?” The court appearance comes at a time when Schock has been in the media spotlight after reports surfaced revealing his lavish spending and “Downton Abbey”-inspired congressional office.
