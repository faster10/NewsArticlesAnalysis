Facebook s service isn t the only one out there , of course . Other check in features like Google Person Finder offer alternatives for non Facebook users . But you can see how things could start to get complicated . What if a person registers that they are OK on one service but not another ? What if someone marks someone else as safe ( a useful option that Facebook provides ) based on inaccurate information ? ? And how will tech companies decide when a crisis is big enough to merit activating these features ?
