" So the themes ( of the album are ) escapism , love , romance to be on a journey though I don ' t like that word , people say that on reality shows don ' t they you know when a fat person becomes skinny they ' ve been on a amazing journey .

Basically , the album includes brilliant and very well crafted songs , deceptively fantastic lyrics , all brilliantly played with the minimum of fuss and which are criminally underrated particularly in America , " Gallagher surmises in unabashed appraisal .
