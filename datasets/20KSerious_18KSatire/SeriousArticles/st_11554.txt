Speaking of the Eagles , they ' ll be talking today with Coughlin himself . Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie called Coughlin last week and asked if they could talk . Coughlin , who still wants to coach , agreed , and the Giants ( who still hold Coughlin ' s rights because he resigned ) granted the Eagles permission to talk to him . You can ' t rule out the possibility of Coughlin moving down the Turnpike to Philly , but the people to whom I ' ve spoken about this believe the Eagles will go younger and more progressive at head coach and are talking to Coughlin mainly to pick his brain and ask him about McAdoo , whom they ' re seriously considering .
