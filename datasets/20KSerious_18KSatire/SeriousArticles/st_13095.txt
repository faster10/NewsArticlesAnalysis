The Breakthrough Energy Coalition was announced at the same time as Mission Innovation , a commitment made by 20 countries including the US , Canada , Brazil , Australia , and Germany to double their investment in clean energy research by 2020 . The two initiatives aren t formally affiliated with one another , but they play complementary roles . The Mission Innovation countries will provide extra public funding for basic energy research , while the Breakthrough Energy Coalition will help to shepherd promising but potentially risky new concepts across the " Valley of Death " to become successful companies .
