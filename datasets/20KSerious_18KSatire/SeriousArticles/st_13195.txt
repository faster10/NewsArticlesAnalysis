On the military front , we are continuing to accelerate what we do , he added . But he firmly rejected the idea of sending large numbers of U . S . ground troops to fight ISIS . It is not just my view , but the view of my closest military and civilian advisers that that would be a mistake , Obama said . Not because our military could not march into Mosul or Raqqa or Ramadi and temporarily clear out ISIL , but because we would see a repetition of what we ve seen before , which is if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance , and who are pushing back against ideological extremes , that they resurface unless we re prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries .
