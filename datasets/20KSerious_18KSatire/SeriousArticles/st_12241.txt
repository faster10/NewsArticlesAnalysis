3 . It ' s not just about responding to disasters , but recovering from them . Warning people of a pending disaster and getting vulnerable populations out of harm ' s way is vitally important . So too is emergency response both during and immediately after a storm . But there is a need for far more robust planning for restoring critical systems quickly and getting communities back on their feet again . Harnessing the capabilities of willing and able citizens and the private sector is key . For instance , electric power could be restored more quickly if local independent licensed electricians could be deputized to support utility crews in conducting damage assessments and making repairs . Additionally , the counterpart to having detailed plans to guide evacuations ahead of a storm is having plans that support quickly bringing displaced people back into their homes , schools , and businesses . As extreme weather events become more frequent , it is important to try to make them less disruptive . This places a premium on bolstering community resilience . People and systems need to be able to better withstand , respond , adapt , and rapidly recover from disasters .
