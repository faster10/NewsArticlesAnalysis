We had two or three fights that we had to choreograph and work on between the two of us , one of which was an elaborate stick fight , and then there was a whole second half of the day after lunch where I spent close to seven hours just killing walkers ? ? just running up on walkers and hitting them in different ways in different places and in different locations and then dragging them to the pyre . And there was quite a lot of running . Physically it was much more challenging than it seemed like it was going to be when you read the script .
