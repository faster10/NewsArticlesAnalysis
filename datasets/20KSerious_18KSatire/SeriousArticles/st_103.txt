In retrospect , the Levin amendment looks pretty good . Delay , even gratuitous delay , would have been the wise course . Not invading at all ? some believed at the time , and nearly everyone sees now ? would have been the best course of all . ( For the record , I briefly supported the use of force in one column , after Secretary of State Colin Powell made the case before the U . N . Security Council , a column I regret writing ? but I changed my mind two weeks before the invasion and remained opposed to the war throughout its duration . )
