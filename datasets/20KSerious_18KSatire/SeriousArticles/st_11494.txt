B to C : This is self explanatory . Films are consumed by masses . As also the products that SRK endorses . He has sold cola , clothes , bikes , vests . But not lungis . Disruption : ' Muchcho ko thoda round ghumake , Anna ke jaisa chashma lagake . . . ' SRK , a Delhi man , planted himself in a South Indian milieu and performed an ode to Rajinikanth , the South Indian icon in whose hands a cigarette could turn into Nadia Comaneci . Exactly whose brainwave Lungi Dance is , is not known but it works . Even in the hallowed halls of the University of Edinburgh . Full marks for disruption .
