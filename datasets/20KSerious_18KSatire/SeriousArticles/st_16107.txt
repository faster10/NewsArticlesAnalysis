In fact , it has always puzzled me when white critics depict Lee as an anti white bigot . Have they noticed any of the foolish , arrogant and avaricious black characters in his films ? Lee has consistently depicted the African American community as consumed by hypocrisy , corruption , shallow materialism and self hatred . His offense against the dicta of white folks morality , I suppose , lies in seeing those things as profoundly tragic and as stemming from complicated historical roots , and in suggesting that they reflect the underlying values of a racist society .
