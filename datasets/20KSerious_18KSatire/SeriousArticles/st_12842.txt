The G20 initiative here comes in response to plans drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) designed specifically to help tackle the practice of so called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ( BEPS ) through which firms pull money out of countries where profits are earned into jurisdictions like Bermuda that do not tax them . The OECD , which calls the plan the first substantial ? and overdue ? renovation of the international tax standards in almost a century , estimates the amount of revenue losses from BEPS are probably at least around 100 240 billion annually , or between 4 10 per cent of global corporate income tax revenues .
