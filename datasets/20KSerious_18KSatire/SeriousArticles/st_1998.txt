There s something about the sheer volume of a serialized show that makes the viewer feel as though he or she is becoming an expert . Serial was a particularly troubling example of this . In the gaps between episodes , fans had increasing amounts of fun trading theories about the Best Buy phone booth . That the show was occasioned by the death of a teenage girl seemed almost incidental to the fans for whom it was a parlor game that compounded weekly the quest for truth grew more important than the case s most salient fact . Similarly , Making a Murderer s structure , with reversals ( Avery is exonerated for an earlier crime in the series early going ) and a torrent of grisly information lends itself to a certain public performance on the part of the viewer . The show s capaciousness makes the viewer feel both accomplished simply for having watched and like the lucky recipient of all the information there possibly could be to know about Steven Avery .
