There is a lot here to be outraged by , from Trump s dismissal of a protester as disgusting to his embrace of thuggery to his demonization of Muslims and Mexicans . As Vox points out , Trump also recently retweeted some bogus stats about racial breakdown of homicides ? a tweet that seems to have originated with someone espousing neo Nazi beliefs , and that Trump chose not to disavow once the fake stats were pointed out . This isn t to say Trump is a throwback fascist . My guess is the guy listens only to himself , and that s a pretty inept echo chamber .
