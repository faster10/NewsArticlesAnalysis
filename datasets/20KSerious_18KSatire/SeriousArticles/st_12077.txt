Ma got a job , too , as a waitress at a hamburger joint up at " The Point " where the two major highways intersected coming up from Detroit and the factory workers from the Tank Plant came in daily to order open faced sandwiches and leave her dime tips . Ma ' s hair looked really dark and shiny against her white uniform and when she came home after her twelve hour days she smelled of French fry grease and fish . She rarely made over 60 dollars a week and even when her wages were combined with Daddy ' s the 62 dollar a month mortgage was often late to the bank .
