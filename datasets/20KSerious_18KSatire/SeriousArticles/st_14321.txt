As Mark Halperin and John Heilemann point out on their show The Circus ( great show highly recommend ) , the four establishment Republican candidates ( Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Chris Christie , John Kasich ) are all taking away votes from each other , creating a " prisoner ' s dilemma " type situation if all of them stay in the race , they run the risk of splitting the votes , and thereby ensuring a loss for all four of them and win for either Donald Trump or Cruz . However , if three of them were to drop out of the race , they would significantly increase the chances of one of them beating Trump or Cruz to win the nomination .
