Soon after recovering from the shock of the deadly Ebola virus , the world is threatened with the onslaught of another virus , called Zika , which has a potential to quickly blow up into a pandemic . Within six months of its outbreak in Brazil , this vector borne virus has already spread to 23 countries . The forthcoming Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , may further heighten the risk of its dispersal across the globe given about 500 , 000 people are expected to throng the venue of the games . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which was criticised for its slow response to Ebola , has lost little time in taking note of the explosive spread of Zika and proclaiming it an " extraordinary event " to be treated as an " international emergency " .
