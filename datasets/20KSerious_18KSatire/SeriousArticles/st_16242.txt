SIGNER : Yes , I can . There is a burden of responsibility that comes with being a citizen of a constitutional democracy . And if you decide to go with your gut as opposed to caring about those values , then you are hurting this country . Demagogues have been talked about for millennia as flatters , so they flatter the people . They play to our need for gratitude . And we ' re supposed to better than that . So one of the reasons that demagogues are hemmed in is because people say , I hear you , that feels good , but I ' m not going to fall in love with you . This is too indulgent . And politicians , usually , are too ashamed to do what demagogues do . And then , Trump , who ' s a creature , comes from the entertainment world , comes from a culture of narcissism , he doesn ' t care about any of those rules . So I don ' t think it ' s OK to say , well , you know , I know about the principle of separation of church and state , and I know about not having violence in our politics , but I ' m going to go with Trump anyway because I ' m so angry at the system . That ' s not OK . It ' s definitively not OK in the United States of America , and it needs to be condemned .
