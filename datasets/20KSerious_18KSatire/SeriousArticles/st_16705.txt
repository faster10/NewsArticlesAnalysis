In the past , a traditionally spent Thanksgiving Day started with morning high school football games , road races usually with the title Gobble or Turkey as in Turkey Trot , much cooking , much traveling , and then much eating . Then , by late afternoon , the inevitable nap followed while attempting to watch more football , and finally a second meal of turkey sandwiches and leftover stuffing and pie was served . And no one needs to be told that the combination of eating and sitting in the car , in the bleachers , at the dining room table and on the sofa , adds up to consuming many more calories than the body needs for energy .
