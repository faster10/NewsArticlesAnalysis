4 . The federal government matters . Under our federal form of government , disaster response and relief have always been decentralized mayors and governors are in charge of incidents that happen in their jurisdictions . Historically , the federal government ' s role has been to provide assistance when local and state capabilities are overwhelmed . Washington has played this role in every major disaster dating back to the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , when over 4 , 000 troops from the U . S . Army ' s Pacific Division were mobilized to provide emergency relief , including constructing temporary housing for 20 , 000 survivors . But as the scale of disasters has grown , so too has the role of the federal government . Extreme weather events like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy invariably involve multiple states . To coordinate rapid and effective response and recovery on a regional scale requires preplanning . And part of any thoughtful preplanning should be identifying incentives that encourage states and localities to put in place measures that mitigate the risk of needless loss of life and property . This will require a federal government that is increasingly engaged before disasters happen as well as afterward . Assigning a passive " call us if you need us " role to the federal government , practically guarantees future replays of the kind of ineptitude that marked the federal response to Hurricane Katrina .
