But Clinton is not always in Benghazi mode . Her attempts to deliver hortatory political speeches , as at the Iowa Democratic Party meeting a couple of days after the hearing , still come across as harsh and unconvincing . ( For those who believe this is a sexist observation , I would note that both Carly Fiorina and Elizabeth Warren really know how to give a fighting speech . ) Another problem for Clinton is her failure to stand up to the Democrats base on any issue . Her husband gained credibility , and ultimately the presidency , by defying the left on welfare reform , trade and crime . The current Democratic base isn t nearly as barbaric as the extreme right but remains trapped within the corroded industrial age structures of government and manufacturing . Clinton s recent defense of the Department of Veterans Affairs , a disaster in need of reform , is a sad demonstration of a standard liberal default position : that everything in government is just hunky dory . All we need is more money .
