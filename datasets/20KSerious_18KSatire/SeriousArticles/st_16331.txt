One persistent critique of the Bernie Bro phenomenon is that it s unfair to single out Sanders supporters when Clintonistas are just as obnoxious . Sanders supporters have fought back against the Bro attack by producing evidence of anti Semitic image macros and racist tweets fired off by Clinton supporters . Unfortunately , the nation s pollsters have been busy asking Americans who they plan to vote for in the real election , not which faction is the most intolerant on the Internet . But the Hillary people are just as bad critique falls flat when you hop between Sanders and Clinton posts on Instagram or Facebook . You ll see a lot more Sanders supporters dropping into Hillary s feed to drop a hashtag or a burn than the other way around . When the Clinton campaign posted a photo celebrating the candidate s close call win in Iowa on Monday , Sanders stans scrolled over to her feed to lodge substantive complaints like Hillary is a liar and she doesn t care about you vote for Bernie , It was a tie . Probably rigged in your favor , and Ew . No .
