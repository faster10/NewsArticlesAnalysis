A similar surprise was supposed to occur last week when ESPN sent a crew to the home of Babers Green in Saginaw , Michigan , to film her giving the news to her son by phone that he would be a Western Conference starter . But when he wasn ' t voted into the starting lineup , the network had to scrap the plan and eat the expense . CSNBA picked up the ball at Ridder ' s suggestion , however , and did a remote hookup with Green ' s mother for the All Star reserves announcement . Having not told Draymond about the ESPN snafu , she had to stay quiet for the whole week .
