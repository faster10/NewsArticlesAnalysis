Not only is it OK for each side of the party to want different things , it s also OK to not have a precise or even coherent vision of how to get there . We don t fully know how change happens . Sometimes a wedge issue about the right to marry in 2004 becomes the accepted and even popular law of the land eleven years later . But in my view , the best theory of change , the one that s most tangible to people , is to express your beliefs and preferences consistently until you find enough allies to make it happen . It may never happen ? politics is a tough business ? but there aren t many alternatives .
