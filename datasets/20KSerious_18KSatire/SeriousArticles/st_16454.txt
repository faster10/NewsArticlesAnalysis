early in 2015 , i realized i had more of those than i d ever had in my life . more of them than when i went in to make any LCD record , or when i recorded tapes upon tapes of terrible things in high school . just loads of them , and i found myself a little perplexed . if i record them , what do i do with them ? maybe I shouldn t record them at all ? i considered that , which was in a way the easiest option , but it also seemed like a weird and arbitrary ( and sort of cowardly ) cop out . but to record them ? well then , suddenly i have , what ? a record ?
