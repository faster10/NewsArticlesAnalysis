The health insurance you have now probably limits what doctors you can go to , what hospitals you can use , what prescription drugs you can take . There would be none of that under a single payer healthcare system , " explained Professor Friedman . " People would have much more freedom to choose the type of doctors and medicine they want . The system we have now is essentially a private body which taxes you . You have to buy health insurance as required by law , That means you have to pay a private body . Right now , Americans pay on average 6 , 000 a year per person , that includes everybody , for health insurance . If you weed out the elderly and people on public programs it would be more like 10 , 000 , for private health insurance . That ' s a tax imposed on us , If we had a single payer system we would be paying a lot less . Instead of paying a private health insurer , we would be paying public taxes to the state or federal government , and we would be paying a lot less because the system would be more efficient while providing better quality healthcare .
