None of this is to imply that Obama is an enemy of the environment or even a cynical opportunist . On the contrary , all signs indicate that he does care deeply about the climate he ll leave us when he leaves office , and always has . He did what he felt he could , when he could , without sacrificing too much political capital or damaging his re election chances . Which is why Obama is not an environmental leader but a political one . And he s never needed a climatologist to tell him which way the wind is blowing . ?
