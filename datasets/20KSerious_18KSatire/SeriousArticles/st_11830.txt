This leads us back to the important question that I mentioned earlier : Should Flint residents have to pay for water that is poisonous ? You may be able to argue that just because the water had toxic levels of lead in it , doesn ' t mean that it had no value at all . It is also true that the State Medical Director Dr Eden Wells has said the water is still safe enough to bathe in . But let ' s be realistic , would you let your children bathe in water that was so corrosive that General Motors had to stop using it because it was damaging car parts ? I hope your answer is no , but if you still think that the water has some value , you find yourself in company with Gov . Snyder . The governor has evaded this question at press conferences lately and maybe for what he deems good reason . Recently , Michigan ' s Auditor General , along with a bipartisan commission created by the Snyder administration , both placed the blame for Flint ' s toxic water firmly on his administration . The governor has already apologized for the state ' s role in poisoning Flint residents , but he has barely begun to pay for a solution for the problem .
