In the past , Donald Trump has lambasted Republicans for being " mean spirited " in how they talk about immigrants . Speaking in 2012 after Mitt Romney lost the Presidential election , he criticised the failed Republican candidate ' s " crazy " policy of " self deportation " for illegal immigrants , saying : It sounded as bad as it was , and he lost all of the Latino vote . " But now he is running for the presidency , Mr Trump wants to build a wall to stop Mexico sending " rapists " , and is pushing a " deportation force " that would remove 11 million illegal immigrants from the United States .
