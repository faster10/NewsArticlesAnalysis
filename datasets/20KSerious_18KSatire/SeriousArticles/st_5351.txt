I hope this application meets with your approval . I believe the format outlined above will , after the CNBC debate debacle , truly Make Republicans Look Great Again and return journalists to their proper role as palace courtiers . I am hopeful that I can convince my colleagues at washingtonpost . com to live stream the debate . Though I cannot promise you that any network will broadcast the debate , I believe this should not be a major impediment . Under the requirements you proposed , very few people will be watching anyway .
