Clinton had just finished detailing the dangers of terrorism , recalling tough calls in the White House situation room as secretary of state and lashing out at her Republican rivals for threatening the safety of Americans .

" We ? ve got to do everything we can to weed out hate and plant love and kindness , " she told a crowd of several hundred . ( AP Photo Charlie Neibergall )
