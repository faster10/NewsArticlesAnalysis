That ' s 39 years of Star Wars , a fantasy where abundant intelligent life exists in another galaxy . It ' s not quite what we expect happens in our Milky Way , given what we know now of the properties of exoplanets and the evolutionary history of life on Earth : If life exists elsewhere ? and there is no obvious reason for it not to ? it is likely quite simple , probably made of unicellular organisms . ( As it was here for about 3 billion years . ) Complex life and , in particular , intelligent life , is most probably quite rare .
