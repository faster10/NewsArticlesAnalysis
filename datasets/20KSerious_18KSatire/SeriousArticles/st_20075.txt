Kartheiser : The times are a changing and in the first few episodes we ' ve seen it make its way into Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce . Times have been changing for the last few years . There ' s been riots and integration and things have been changing but it hasn ' t affected the lives of these people as profoundly as we maybe the history books would want you to believe . Let ' s take something huge , like the war in Iraq . It ' s huge and in 30 years we ' ll look back and think that everybody ' s life was inundated with this war but for most of the people I know , including myself , it had very little effect on us . It has an effect , but we can ' t quite see it yet . It ' s the same with the 1960s , and we look back and say : " Oh , there were these great changes , everyone must ' ve felt it . " It takes a while for these things to take effect in the exclusive , upper and middle class office buildings . We ' re just starting to see it now . It ' s ' 66 and it ' s starting to hit home .
