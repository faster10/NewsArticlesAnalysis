Let me tell you something : When I ' m on the golf course and I slip my wedding ring into my golf bag , the Rev . Jacquie Hood Martin is still my wife . When we shoot hoops and I remove my Texas A M University ring from my right hand , I still love my school . The fact that I can no longer wear my 1987 class ring from Houston ' s Jack Yates High School doesn ' t mean I don ' t cherish the crimson and gold . And I may not be able to fit into the shirt I pledged in , but I will be a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc . until the day I die .
