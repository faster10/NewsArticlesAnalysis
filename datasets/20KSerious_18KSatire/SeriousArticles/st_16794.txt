The captain of the cruise ship Concordia tried to orchestrate a cover up in which the company would blame the tragic shipwreck on a power cut , a court in Italy has heard . Captain Francesco Schettino was in command of the giant cruise liner when it hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012 , killing 32 people . The 52 year old , who allegedly caused the crash by ordering an ill fated ' salute ' to the island of Giglio , is currently on trial for mass manslaughter and abandoning ship . Giving evidence at the court in Grosseto , Tuscany , head of the crisis unit Roberto Ferrarini said that the former captain asked him to help cover his tracks , by telling the authorities that a power outage had caused the collision . Emergency manager Ferrarini said : ' Schettino asked me to tell the maritime authorities that the collision was down to a blackout on the ship . But I strongly objected . ' That was a different false account compared to what he had said before , namely , that he had hit a rock which caused the ship to flood . ' I remember I got quite angry and I shared that reaction with my colleagues . '
