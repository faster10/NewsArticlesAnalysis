The news makes it more likely that the Steelers will have Fitzgerald Toussaint do more in practice leading up to Saturday s game . Tomlin called Toussaint a guy who is diligent in his preparation . He s one of those guys everybody is excited about seeing play , excited about seeing given an opportunity , said Tomlin . He brings a no nonsense , blue collar approach that I m sure Steelers Naton appreciate and I m sure they re going to grow to like him in the manner we do . Toussaint is capable of leaving the offensive backfield as a receiving target as well .
