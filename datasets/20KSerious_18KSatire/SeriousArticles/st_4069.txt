Not every debate skipper has followed the pattern , however : In January of 1996 , Bob Dole skipped the first nationally televised debate of that year , in South Carolina , instead returning to Washington for budget talks . I regret I can t be there to get beat up on , Dole said at the time , becoming a target for opponents and Republican leaders who accused him of losing his nerve and lacking commitment . Dole won the South Carolina primary anyway , and the nomination ? though he lost to Bill Clinton in the general election .
