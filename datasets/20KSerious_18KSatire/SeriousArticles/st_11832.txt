This situation is complicated further due to the fact that both chambers of the Michigan Legislature are controlled by fiscal conservatives that fought for several years over a plan to fix Michigan roads , even though every last member agreed that the roads were in dire need of repair . So you can easily see why the governor is shying away from the question of whether Flint residents should have to pay for poisonous water . If the answer is no they shouldn ' t , it could easily add millions to the cost of making things right in Flint . I think we can all agree that if Flint ' s water did have value , that it was pennies on the dollar compared to what the water customers in Flint were being charged . However , no matter what value he assigns to the water it is imperative that the governor act quickly .
