I want to clear this up first and foremost , OK ? I want to get this out of the way : I ' ve been seeing a lot of stuff that ' s been going on and saying that I would bow to Peyton if I had an interception . I think we took that a little bit out of character of what I meant , " Norman said . " Let me clear that up real quick , fast and in a hurry for you guys : I mean if I were to be so fortunate enough and blessed to get an interception , I would do a Namaste bow . I would not do a whole like bowing motion . No , I would not do that . No . No ma ' am , would not ever do that to him .
