"Game of Thrones" debuts action-packed season 5 trailer
Dragons are taking flight in the new trailer for season 5 of "Game of Thrones." HBO unveiled an action-packed sneak peek at the new episodes on Monday (the same day it announced it's teaming with Apple to launch its standalone streaming service, HBO Now). "Lannister, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell, they're all just spokes on a wheel," Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) muses in the clip of her rivals for the Iron Throne. "This one's on top but then that one's on top and on and on it spins, crushing those on the ground.""We're not going to stop the wheel," she declares. "I'm going to break the wheel." The new episodes premiere April 12 on HBO.
