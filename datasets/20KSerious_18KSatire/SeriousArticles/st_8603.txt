But Syria needed to guarantee its sovereignty and this is where Moscow ' s military cooperation would start to play a role . The USSR sent military instructors , armament , and other equipment . It is calculated that around 16 , 000 Soviet military personnel served in Syria . The USSR continued to help Syria at every diplomatic and military levels . During the Six Day War in 1967 the USSR gave unfaltering aid to the Arab nations . Combat started on the 5th of June 1967 with the invasion of Israel to the United Arab Republic , and after to Jordan and Syria . The same day the USSR reacted with a declaration that denounced the aggression from Israel . This declaration had two requests for the government of Israel : to immediately cease the armed actions and to withdraw its troops to the other side of the line of fire . The war did not end until the 10th of June when the Soviet Union broke its diplomatic relations with Israel , declaring that if they did not suspend their military actions then they would take measures , including military ones , to force them to do so . The Soviet Union also controlled Syrian airspace and then it was given a port in the city of Tartus , which would permit the Soviet Navy to have a presence in the Mediterranean . Even today it is easy to find Soviet armament from the 1960s in Syria .
