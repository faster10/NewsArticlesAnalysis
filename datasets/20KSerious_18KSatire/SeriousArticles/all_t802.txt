Carrie Underwood welcomes a baby boy
Carrie Underwood is officially a mom. The country singer announced Tuesday that she and husband Mike Fisher are now parents to a baby boy. Their first child, son Isaiah Michael Fisher, arrived Feb. 27. "Tiny hands and tiny feet...God has blessed us with an amazing gift!" Underwood wrote on her Facebook page, captioning a photo of the baby's hand. Underwood, 31, confirmed her pregnancy in September, getting the couple's two dogs to participate in sharing the happy news. "In honor of 'Labor' Day...Ace & Penny would like to make an announcement. Their parents couldn't be happier!" she wrote.  It was revealed she was expecting a boy in November, when Brad Paisley spilled the beans while the two co-hosted the CMA Awards.
