Our program is having an impact . In two independent research reports , the School of Social Work at Washington University in St . Louis has found that nearly 80 of the participants in our program felt that serving in the community had a positive effect on their future employability , performance , and promotion , or that it instigated them to make a career change . In fact , 86 of participants reported transferring their military skills to civilian employment and 100 of Fellows reported that they will probably or definitely stay involved in volunteer activities and public service in the future .
