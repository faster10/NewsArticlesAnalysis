I think Michonne would consider herself a realist . . . by way of tangent , my father in law ' s an engineer , he ' s a scientist , so it ' s like , the optimist says the glass is half full , the pessimist says the glass is half empty , and my father in law says you have a poorly designed glass , and I think to some degree you have that situation here with Michonne . She ' s like , " no , there ' s an amount of liquid in this glass , " and that ' s a useful thing for her , so it ' s not that that things are getting better or worse . There ' s a place where there ' s currently protection from zombies and people , and that ' s useful for her , but I don ' t think she looks at it and says , " yeah , this is the solution forever , " and I also don ' t think she looks at it and says " oh this is a beacon for bad behavior . " She ' s like , " this is a great place for me to rest my head right now . "
