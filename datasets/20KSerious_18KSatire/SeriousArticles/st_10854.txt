At the time , two runs looked like enough for Matt Harvey . The Mets right hander , one of the team ' s four standout starting pitchers , had cruised after a bumpy start . On the first pitch the Royals saw , Escobar blasted a dead red 95 mph fastball from Harvey to left center field . As Conforto and center fielder Yoenis Cespedes converged , Conforto peeled away and Cespedes didn ' t reach for the ball . It ricocheted off his left foot , kicked away from both and rolled far enough that Escobar scored without a throw home . It was the first World Series inside the park home run since Philadelphia A ' s center fielder Mule Haas hit one Oct . 12 , 1929 .
