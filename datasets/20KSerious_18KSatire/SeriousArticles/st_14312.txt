This was a revealing moment . A rare moment where President Obama was vulnerable . Throughout much of his presidency Barack Obama has appeared aloof and disengaged . It is somewhat ironic that he is viewed as such a strong communicator . Apart from stump speeches ( where he is indeed charismatic , emotive and hyperbolic ) Barack Obama often sounds more like a constitutional law scholar ( and a boring one at that ) . He works to get his points across in a very specific , analytical , and loquacious fashion . This appears to be part of his personality calculating and self aware .
