Davis ended up filing with both the 11th Circuit and the Supreme Court . The 11th Circuit deflected the appeal in November , saying it agreed with the district court that the Supreme Court was the correct place for the filing . Davis then took his case to the U . S . Supreme Court in January , filing two pleas . One sought review of the Georgia federal judge ' s rejection of the innocence claim , and the other asked for a test of the 11th Circuit ' s refusal to review the case . The justices on Monday turned down both pleas without comment .
