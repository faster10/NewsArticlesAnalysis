An ice cream counter that tops sundaes with worms . At the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium , an art gallery , novelty shop and caf in Portland ' s Alphabet District , you can pick up everything from zombie slippers and fake dog poop to plastic eyeballs to float in your gin and tonics . Lots of people show up just to pet Bigfoot ( he ' s 10 feet tall , so you need a ladder ) , leave a message in the neon graffiti room or perform an autopsy on a life size space alien . Daring sorts belly up to the ice cream counter for sundaes , hot dogs and other treats sprinkled with real bug larvae . Tempting as it is to think " Sparky , " the on display ventriloquist murdering dummy , is the mastermind behind this house of terror , it was actually started by filmmaker Mike Wellins and two friends .
