As a child , I grew up in a neighborhood back in West Virginia where blacks and whites helped each other in times of need and despair . Now that I am in Dallas , Texas , I have seen our city struggle to its feet in times of dire desperation . I was there when the buses came in to the Reunion Arena in Dallas loaded with mostly people of color who were hungry , weak and tired , and needing human dignity . They were unloaded covered with the stench of the atrocities of the superdome in New Orleans . I saw blacks , whites and Hispanics driving up with bags of clothes and food and crying together , trying to accommodate whomever they could , wherever they could . This is the America I want my grandson to grow up in .
