Our history includes wonderful role models . In writing " Yankee Doodle Dandy " ( published this week , in which Ellis the Elephant discovers the American Revolution ) , I was reminded that the brave men and women who fought to win our freedom were surprisingly young . Thomas Jefferson was 33 . James Madison was 25 . James Monroe was just 18 , barely older than a high school graduate . And yet these patriotic heroes were engaged in profound , often dangerous work . They were models of sacrifice , civic mindedness and determination .
