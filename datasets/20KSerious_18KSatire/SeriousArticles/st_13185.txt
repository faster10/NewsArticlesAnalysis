People should not expect Clinton to do anything drastic in the near future . Her first move , via Twitter , was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the State Department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible . While some Democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party ( Elizabeth Warren ! ) into the political fray , Clinton is not going to give them any space to do this . She will wait until reporters and Congress move in a different direction .
