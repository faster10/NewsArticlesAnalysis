' Now , there is the No 9 and the No 10 . The 10 plays behind the nine so they are never really playing as a genuine partnership . That might have hindered the number of forwards coming through . You can only play the one so youngsters may be thinking of playing somewhere else because there is just the one striking position up for grabs . That may have something to do with it . I have played in the lone striker role and my game was not really suited to that . If I were playing now , I would try to play in the No 10 position . '
