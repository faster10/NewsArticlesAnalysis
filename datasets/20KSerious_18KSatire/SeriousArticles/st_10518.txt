They see threats from below and they see it across the region . I mean , let ' s remember , five years ago at the start of the Arab uprisings , the Saudis were alarmed by the rapid fall of Mubarak , rapid change in Tunisia , shocks in Syria and Yemen . And then when the Bahraini protestors took to the streets , it seemed as though it was coming home . The Saudis responded in much the same way the Bahrainis did , and that ' s that they chose Shiites as the scapegoat because most of the protestors came from within the Shia community , which was really just the reflection Bahrain ' s demography . They characterized it as a sectarian event .
