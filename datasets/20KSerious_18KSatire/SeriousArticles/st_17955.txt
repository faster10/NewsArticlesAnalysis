The last quarterly numbers from Sturm , Ruger were stunning ? the kind of leap in revenue and earnings that most tech unicorns would kill for : an 82 per cent increase in profits thanks to a 23 per cent rise in revenue to 121m . That was just the third quarter , and thanks to the President a bumper first quarter in 2016 is a given . Not all gun related stocks have performed quite so well , but the value of Sturm , Ruger and Smith Wesson doubled in 2015 alone , and in a flat year for markets there aren t many stocks that were better to own .
