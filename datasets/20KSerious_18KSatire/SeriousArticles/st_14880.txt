1 . John Scott rocks the house : Did you wonder what it would be like for Pacific Division captain John Scott ? He sure did . But what a nice moment for the oft discussed former Arizona Coyotes tough guy , who was controversially voted into the All Star event by fans . He took part in the hardest shot competition and the packed house at Bridgestone Arena rose to its feet to give him a great ovation . Scott was defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning ' s Steven Stamkos in the head to head hardest shot competition but still delivered a respectable 95 . 9 mph shot . Stamkos immediately went to Scott to congratulate him . Later , Scott was denied on two shootout attempts , including on a very nice spin o rama move that was stopped by the New Jersey Devils ' Cory Schneider . " I could barely even hold my stick , I was shaking so much during the whole thing , " Scott told reporters after . " My heart was just pounding and I couldn ' t really calm down . . . . I ' m happy with what happened but I ' m still nervous right now , it was such a kind of a cool experience . " He admitted he wasn ' t sure how the fans would respond to his being on the ice but their warm response will stay with him for a long time .
