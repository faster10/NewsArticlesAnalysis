As an album , Blak and Blu makes for a bumpy ride . The roaring , distortion soaked blues of " Numb " which sounds something like Stevie Ray Vaughan tackling " Come Together " upstages the falsetto croon and string arrangement of " Please Come Home . " The souped up Chuck Berry boogie of " Travis County " collides with " The Life , " which has Clark ruminating over woozy , echoey keyboards : " Can ' t go on like this Knowing that I ' m just getting high . " Clark and Warner Bros . clearly expect listeners to carve their own playlists from the album ' s 13 tracks .
