Hillary Clinton moved toward the position Bernie Sanders had already staked out on marijuana legal reform this week , but it was a half measure at best . Clinton is now in favor of moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the controlled substances list , which is indeed long overdue . Bernie , of course , wants it off the schedules altogether , and under the control of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms , which is where it logically should be . Still , because Hillary ' s move virtually guarantees the most substantive discussion on changing federal marijuana laws ever to be included in a presidential debate ( tomorrow night ) , she at least deserves an Honorable Mention . Her half measure will be contrasted with Bernie ' s full support for descheduling , which is a discussion we ' ve been waiting to hear for a long time .
