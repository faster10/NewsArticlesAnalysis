Kelly used the credibility he had earned as a coach to justify making a series of big bets on his personnel decisions . It looks , months later , like those bets haven ' t panned out . It seems like a classic case of the Peter Principle , in which a person is promoted to the level at which they fail after succeeding previously . That ' s not uncommon in football , and it shouldn ' t invalidate what success Kelly achieved as a coach . Think about Dick LeBeau , who was a great defensive coordinator before failing miserably as Cincinnati ' s head coach . He was fired and eventually made his way back to Pittsburgh , where he was again a wonderful defensive coordinator . Wade Phillips , Rod Marinelli and Norv Turner are similar examples . Struggling as a general manager shouldn ' t prevent Kelly from serving as an above average coach .
