Spiders make good use of their many silks . When you look at an orb web , there ' s one type of ultra strong and fairly stiff silk that makes up the scaffold . This silk , which is also used as the safety drag line , is tougher than almost all biological and man made materials . The sticky spiral of the orb web is composed of two different silks , one a glue and the other a highly stretchable fiber . The glue and the fiber are produced in separate glands and the spider dots the glue onto the fiber while building the web .
