We shouldn ' t romanticize this : ESPN knows that Lin is the biggest story in sports right now , and it can ' t afford to alienate or offend those hungry for their daily dose of Lin . But perhaps that ' s precisely the point . Lin has become so big that simply by being himself an Asian American , comfortable in his own skin , playing basketball brilliantly on the world ' s biggest stage and enjoying himself as he does it he may be revolutionizing our culture . The Jeremy Lin Effect won ' t end racism , but it does mean that Asian Americans will never be seen the same way again .
