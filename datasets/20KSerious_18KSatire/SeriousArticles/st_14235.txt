This is a story of unrequited love , because though Jews don ' t much care for Republicans , Republicans love Jews , and Israel . In fact , in American politics today there is no more fervent supporter of Israel than a highly conservative , evangelical Republican along the lines of Sarah Palin or Michele Bachmann . While there are still some fringe pockets of anti Semitism among American Christians , as a whole they ' ve swung toward an enthusiastic philo Semitism . It ' s no accident that this trend accelerated once conservatives became focused on a clash of civilizations between the West and Islam .
