Wade : I think the main thing you think of is to know you can change the whole world , but you can touch many people on the way . And my main thing is like , when I go out and talk to kids or I do different events through my foundation , I just want to change one person ' s thought in that room . They had a negative thought or belief coming in , I want to make them believe . And if I can change one kid ' s mind , he can change someone else ' s mind , and it can be a chain effect that can continue to keep going .
