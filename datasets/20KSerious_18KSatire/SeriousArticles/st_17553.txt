Bender : Our hope is simply to help people in wheelchairs to live a fuller life . They already live a pretty full life . They can do pretty much anything except they can ' t walk , and that is such a basic need if you think about it . We all learn to walk even before we learn to talk , and suddenly in the prime of your life you are deprived of that basic need . We are determined to provide at least a tool that people can have , whether it is about walking for part of the day or it is in the recovery phase or rehabilitation or simply in daily living where people want to go about and do things during the day just like an amputee would use a prosthetic leg during the whole day .
