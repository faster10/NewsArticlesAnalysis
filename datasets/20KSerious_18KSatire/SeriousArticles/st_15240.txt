Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Justice Department investigation , which is separate from an existing federal probe of McDonald s death , will look into whether the Chicago Police Department engaged in a pattern or practice of violations of the Constitution or federal law , specifically with regard to deadly use of force and any racial disparity in officers use of force . Such probes , used to identify systemic deficiencies within a troubled agency , have also recently been undertaken with the Baltimore and Ferguson police departments .
