Indeed the European Central Bank is still e printing ? 60bn a month under its QE programme and is committed to doing so until September 2016 . Our report Climate QE for Paree proposed that if it were to allocate say ? 10bn a month either from this QE programme or from an additional QE commitment , it could use it to buy climate change bonds from the European Investment Bank . The EIB could then direct these funds to climate change programmes in both Europe and developing countries . This could have a galvanising effect on other rich countries , putting pressure on them to introduce their own climate QE initiatives and thus further bolster global funds towards thousands of billions eventually needed to keep temperature rises at 2C . We found the money to save the banks , we now need to do the same to save the planet .
