The women ' s vote did not turn out to be historic in the way pundits predicted before the election . Yes , more women voted for President Obama , but not in record numbers . The gender gap was in fact a little smaller in this election than in 2008 . Yes , women were important in certain states , but so were young people , African Americans and Latinos , who , together , make up Obama ' s new winning coalition . What ' s more , women did not even constitute a unified vote . Married women tended to vote for Romney , while single women went for Obama .
