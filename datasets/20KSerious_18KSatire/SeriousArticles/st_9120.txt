Wednesday marked the one year anniversary of the Golden State Warriors ' last regular season loss at Oracle Arena , a 113 111 overtime result for the Chicago Bulls . A win against the Dallas Mavericks would make it not only a full year without a regular season home loss , but also 40 straight wins to tie the second longest home streak in NBA history . ( Golden State did lose two games in last spring ' s postseason , but those don ' t count toward its run . ) That ' s four off the all time record set by the Chicago Bulls during a streak that ran from March 30 , 1995 until April 4 , 1996 .
