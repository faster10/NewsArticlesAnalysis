In times of war , exhausted combat units were removed from the battlefield to " stand down " in a place of relative security to rest . The Department of Veterans Affairs ' Stand Down program is designed to help homeless veterans " combat " life on the streets . Stand Downs are usually one to three day events to provide food , shelter , clothing and health screenings to homeless and unemployed veterans . To find a Stand Down program in your community , contact your local VA hospital in the VA Medical Center Directory .
