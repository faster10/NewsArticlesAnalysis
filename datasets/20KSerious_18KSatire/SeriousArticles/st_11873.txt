Sanders didn t say much about Clinton , but that wouldn t hold . At the dinner itself ? cheered on by a large section of extraordinarily enthusiastic supporters ( Feel the Bern was a regular refrain , at times drowning out everything in the vicinity ) ? Sanders went on the attack for the first time of his campaign . L et me be clear about the current trade deal that we are debating in Congress , he said , referencing the Trans Pacific Partnership . It is not now , nor has it ever been , the gold standard of trade agreements . I did not support it yesterday . I do not support it today . And I will not support it tomorrow .
