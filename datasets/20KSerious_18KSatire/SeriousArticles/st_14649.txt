From FDR ' s Civilian Conservation Corps , JFK ' s Peace Corps , Johnson ' s VISTA program , to Nixon ' s Senior Companion Program , the service movement has grown steadily over the years , championed by presidents of both parties . In fact , all four of our most recent presidents have laid an important foundation for the idea of national service such that the next president can finally take this idea to scale . President George H . W . Bush created the Points of Light Foundation , signed the National Community Service Act of 1990 and established the first Office of National Service in the White House . President Clinton created the Corporation for National and Community Service and established the AmeriCorps program . After the 9 11 attacks , President George W . Bush launched the USA Freedom Corps and grew AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps by 50 each . President Obama created the White House Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation and championed and signed the Serve America Act within the first 100 days of his Administration , authorizing the largest expansion of national service since the Great Depression , which unfortunately has not been funded .
