Centralized , nonvoluntary control of refugee placement would itself make the EU much more like a single , sovereign country . But right now it ' s a nonstarter politically . Even some U .

Further European integration is hard to achieve under the best of circumstances , and it would doubtless be impossible to get members states to vote voluntarily to give up the sovereign right to decide on the refugees they will take .
