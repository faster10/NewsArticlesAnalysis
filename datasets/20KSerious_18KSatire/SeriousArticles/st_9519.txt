You are not allowed to own a bomb , or carry a bomb on your back while visiting your neighborhood Chipotle . Not even if you claim you need a bomb for self protection , or because you re afraid there are other people out there with other bombs who might try to bomb you first . We re not stupid , after all . You cannot buy ready made bombs at Walmart , because Walmart is not allowed to sell ready made mass murder devices . Even those Americans that are permitted to own and operate bombs ( for example , for excavation purposes ) face very , very tight state and federal regulations and restrictions as for the rest of us , outside of military service we are allowed to be in personal possession of a mass murder sized bomb approximately never .
