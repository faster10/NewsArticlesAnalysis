Boulahcen s brother Youssouf described receiving a call from his sister at about 7 p . m . on Sunday and becoming very concerned about her , because it sounded like she had given up on life . Youssouf rushed over to her house to make sure she was okay , but reportedly got no answer at the door and waited for 15 minutes . He then got tired of waiting and went home , only to have Boulahcen call him again . Frustrated with his sister for not answering the door when he came over to help her earlier , he hung up on her . He would never talk to her again .
