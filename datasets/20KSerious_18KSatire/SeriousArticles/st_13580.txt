Two years later the attorney general ' s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women .

The government has also established a special 24 hour court to attend to femicide cases . On the global front , the International Violence Against Women Act was introduced in the U . S . Congress in 2007 it has been pending ever since . But last week the act was reintroduced in both the House and Senate . If approved , it would make reducing levels of gender based violence a U .
