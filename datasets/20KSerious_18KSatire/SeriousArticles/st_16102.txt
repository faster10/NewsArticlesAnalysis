LC : Yeah , I think that s already occurring , so we don t take in this campaign any money from billionaires or corporations , and after the Iowa caucus , the virtual tie there , 3 million was contributed by small donors in one 24 hour period that s just one indication of the energy level around this country . The average donation was 25 . So , the energy level is incredible , and just myself , people I ve known for years are calling up : How do I get involved ? , I want to endorse Bernie , and they are from all over the country .
