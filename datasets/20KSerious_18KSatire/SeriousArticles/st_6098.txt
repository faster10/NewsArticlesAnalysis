That s already a difficult task , given how close the current polling is , and also the fact that Kasich is putting together a late and well timed surge in New Hampshire . And what happens if Cruz , whom Rubio s people expect to win Iowa , comes into New Hampshire with a head of steam and snatches the second place spot ? Trump and Cruz taking the top two spots in the first two states wouldn t seem to leave much room for Rubio to mount a comeback . And , of course , there s zero guarantee that any or all of Rubio s establishment rivals would bow out post New Hampshire . Jeb Bush has three reasons to stick around through at least South Carolina : money , fear of disappointing his father , and the endorsement of the state s senior senator . If Jeb wants to drag things out , he s capable of doing so .
