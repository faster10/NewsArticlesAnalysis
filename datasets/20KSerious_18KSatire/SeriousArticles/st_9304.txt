Also on Monday , Turkish officials said they had twice warned France about Omar Ismail Mostefai , 29 , another of the Bataclan suicide bombers , but that French authorities had never responded . Mostefai , an Algerian French resident of a town south of Paris , blew himself in the concert hall . And French police failed to arrest Salah Abdelslam , 26 , who rented the Belgium registered VW Polo that transported the Bataclan attackers to the concert hall , when they stopped his car on the highway linking Paris to Belgium in the hours following Friday s attack . Belgian and French police have mounted a massive manhunt for him ever since .
