The fact that the attack was home grown , with no direction or communication from abroad , allowed it to fly underneath the FBI and National Security Agency radar . In this particular case there is no evidence Farook and Malik were part of a militant cell . But this does not mean that such autonomous , self starting networks do not exist ? even in a country where Muslim communities are more affluent , and better integrated into local society , than their counterparts in France or Britain . Uncovering such self radicalised militants is the toughest challenge of all , as every counter terrorism expert will tell you .
