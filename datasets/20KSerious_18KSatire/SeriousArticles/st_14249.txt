Philippe Sands QC , professor of international law at University College , London , said : Mr Cameron s memorandum skirts around the legal issues , in the absence of any explicit UN security council authorisation , and it avoids dealing with key issues of policy on which legality turns : the relationship with Russia , how to prioritise action against Isis , surely the principle objective , how to get boots on the ground ( and whose ) , how to avoid diluting our efforts in Iraq , what to do if air strikes alone are insufficient . The document reflects aspiration rather than strategy in any meaningful sense .
