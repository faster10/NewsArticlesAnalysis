Some evidence points toward possible concerns about the plane itself . The jet was damaged in 2001 when the plane struck the runway , according to safety data now made public to the media . The plane was owned by Irish firm Willmington Trust SP Services ( Dublin ) Ltd and leased to Metrojet and the Irish Aviation Authority said it carried out a satisfactory annual inspection of the aircraft in April May 2015 . The authority added that under international aviation rules Russia was responsible for the plane s operation , maintenance and safety .
