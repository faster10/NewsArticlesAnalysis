Dallas Cowboys : Somehow the Cowboys have to figure out a way to get in the end zone . For the second time in three games they failed to score a touchdown . Matt Cassel threw for 97 yards and the receivers caught four passes for 32 yards . The Cowboys ran the ball well enough ( 30 carries , 129 yards ) but the only explosive plays they got were on Cassel scrambles . They did not have a pass go for more than 15 yards . After performing decently in the loss to the Giants , even with three interceptions , Cassel was unable to repeat his downfield success against Seattle . If there is good news it ' s this : Tony Romo can practice this week for the first time since breaking his collarbone . Todd Archer
