Bryant has now appeared in five games with Matt Cassel as the Dallas Cowboys ' quarterback . He has two double digit Fantasy scoring games in standard leagues in those five , and has been targeted 41 times for 17 receptions for 249 yards in those five games , with a pair of touchdowns . In two games with Tony Romo healthy , Bryant has just nine receptions for 93 yards . So , he ' s been a better player with Cassel throwing him the ball , but hardly someone you want to be playing in the Fantasy playoffs . We know Bryant ' s upside is enormous , and we ' ve even seen it one one occasion this season , when he hauled in five passes for 104 yards and a touchdown in Week 9 . However , the upside comes with plenty of risk , with Cassel struggling to complete even half of his passes thrown Bryant ' s way and providing little down the field threat . You ' ll kick yourself if Bryant goes off on your bench and costs you a championship , but Cassel seems to be holding him back enough that it ' s hard to trust Bryant as anything more than a No . 3 WR .
