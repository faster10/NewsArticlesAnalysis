Clinton s response sounded like a mix of Edith Piaf and Sir Elton John : Je Ne Regrette Rien blended with I m Still Standing stern resolve with a touch of telegraphed theatricality . Look , I ve been around a long time , she told him . They throw all this stuff at me and I m still standing . But if you re new to politics , if it s the first time you really paid attention , you go oh my gosh , look at all of this . And you have to say to yourself , why are they throwing all of that ? Well , I ll tell you why . Because I ve been on the frontlines of change and progress since I was your age .
