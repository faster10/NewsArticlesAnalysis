The kids will give a thumbs up to Montjuic , one of Barcelona ' s largest recreation areas , which rises nearly 700 feet above the south side of the city . We ' re holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona , a Ritz Carlton , a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites . There ' s nothing like a luxury hotel when you are jet lagged . The place is packed with families , even on the concierge level where parents and kids indulge in free breakfasts , snacks and drinks . Another highlight is the secluded pool area next to the distinctive shadow of the Frank Gehry fish sculpture .
