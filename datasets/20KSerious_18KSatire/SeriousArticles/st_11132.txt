Michael Strahan on Tom Coughlin actually being underrated as a coach : In my opinion , Coach Coughlin still doesn ' t get enough credit for what he ' s accomplished as a coach .

But when you take a moment to look through the depth charts of those Giants teams , you don ' t stumble across many superstars . That ' s because we didn ' t have the best players . We had the right players . We were a team .
