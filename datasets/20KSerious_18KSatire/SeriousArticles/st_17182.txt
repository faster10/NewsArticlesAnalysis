What it means : The Redskins are 4 6 after their fifth straight road loss . But they re still alive in the playoff chase thanks to the NFC East . The Redskins are tied with Philadelphia for second place , a game behind the New York Giants . And , because the Redskins host the Giants Sunday , they have a chance to move into a tie for the division lead . So , when talking about the standings , the loss does not kill them . But from a psyche standpoint , it should . The Redskins felt they could compete with Carolina , and yet they looked like what they are : a mediocre at best team that can t beat anyone on the road .
