It might sound strange to suggest that policy doesn t normally play a major role in party debates . But the 2008 Democratic primary was largely about affect and identity the two leading candidates didn t differ much on policy . Prior to that , Democratic elections were often characterized by a split between beer track and wine track voters , between candidates who appealed to wealthy white liberals ( Hart , Bradley , Dean ) and those who sought and received support from the poor and working classes ( Mondale , Gore , Kerry ) . Incidentally , it s notable that polls show Bernie Sanders capturing those white working class voters , if not a similar share of African Americans and Latinos .
