The clich is that the UK and America are two nations divided by a common language . A third party might assume we re very similar ? English speaking , Christian , united by history . But we re so very different . During Parliament s pointless , attention seeking debate about Donald Trump , the point was often made that our politics are as chalk and cheese . Americans do religion . They have a constitutional right , as Tina Fey once joked , to shoot wolves from a helicopter . And they seem to adore populists .
