Matt Ryan at Panthers : Ryan hasn t shown up in plus spots all year , so it s a pretty easy choice avoid him on the road against Carolina s defense that has allowed the seventh fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks . Even in his good years , Ryan has struggled at Carolina . He s tossed one or zero touchdowns in 5 of 7 games in Charlotte . In 2015 , Ryan has looked overwhelmed at times and tossed some mind numbing interceptions . The offensive line was the scapegoat last season , but the blocking hasn t been the problem , as Atlanta fields a top 10 unit at Football Outsiders . Ryan has just been flat out bad . With Julio Jones expected to be locked up in shutdown CB Josh Norman s coverage , Ryan should struggle to find open targets when the rest of his weaponry on the outside consists of Jacob Tamme , a washed up Roddy White , and Nick Williams .
