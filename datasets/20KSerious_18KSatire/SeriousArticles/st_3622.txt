The military benefits system needs to change . If the benefits currently unavailable to gay military families were similarly unavailable to Jewish , black or female service members , I have no doubt the situation would be rectified immediately . There needs to be a public outcry , and it needs to come from active duty gay personnel , their partners , families , friends , colleagues and the public at large . For this to happen , the public has to see and understand that a significant proportion of the men and women in uniform protecting them are gay .
