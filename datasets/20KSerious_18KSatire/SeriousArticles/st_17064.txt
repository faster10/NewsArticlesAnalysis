Another scenario points to the existing militant networks that were used as force multipliers by the Pakistani state in the past . A part of such organisations , which are termed anti state , has been chased and targeted by the security forces of Pakistan . Those that are considered pro Pakistan , ideologically speaking , might have certain aggrieved elements with the potential to disagree with the top brass of their organisations for working with Pakistan state and not working on their ideological agenda . It seems natural on the part of such aggrieved elements , which are already trained , to disrupt India Pakistan peace process . If this is the case , then Pakistan state , logically , should not have any hand in it . Similarly , India based militant and extremist organisations ( of which Shiv Sena is a part ) may also carry a similar tendency to fracture the peace initiatives . This then absolves the Indian state of being accomplice to the crime . In a different scenario , certain Kashmir base guerrillaorganisations that are overloaded with Kashmiriultra nationalism may abhor any India Pakistan talk on Kashmir that excludes the option of independence for the Kashmiris . Such organisations , given opportunity , can use militant means for their national objectives . It should not surprise any that a Kashmir based United Jihad Council had claimed credit for the Pathankot attack whereas the Hurriat leadership had condemned the attack . In addition , regional and extra regional cartels that primarily deal in drugs and smuggled weapons may approach such local organisations for their own corporate interests .
