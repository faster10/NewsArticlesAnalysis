That ' s kind of the interesting piece from a business perspective . This money would have never gone into charity . This is marketing money this is not philanthropy money . The reason the big brands provided the money was because they reach consumers in a really passionate moment . If you were the chief marketing officer of a big corporation , would you rather put your money into billboards or into feeding a family in America or helping an earthquake victim and at the same time reaching consumers in really positive special moment when they make that contribution ?
