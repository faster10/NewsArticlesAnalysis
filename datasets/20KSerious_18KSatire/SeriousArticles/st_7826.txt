It ' s easy to ask questions of the Clippers in the aftermath of this game . Why does the offense get fairly one dimensional in crunch time ? Why is the defense so liable to blow leads late ? Why does Griffin take on less of a role in the final few minutes ? Perhaps the answers to these questions are fairly easy as they apply to Thursday ' s loss , because the Warriors played at a level that few teams could possibly match . After all , the Clippers built the lead back up to double digits when the defending champions appeared to have seized control . It ' s not as if they capitulated at the first opportunity .
