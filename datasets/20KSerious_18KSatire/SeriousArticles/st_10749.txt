What To Watch For : Oakland ' s secondary was absolutely scorched by Antonio Brown last week . The Vikings don ' t have a receiver of that caliber , and they don ' t chuck the ball around like the Steelers do , but you have to wonder about confidence . Particularly if star safety and emotional leader Charles Woodson is limited or out with the shoulder injury he is dealing with If Latavius Murray is out with a concussion of his own , the Raiders still must stick with the run . You can ' t allow Mike Zimmer to attack Carr relentlessly Stefon Diggs is still the Vikes ' top receiving option and this matchup could be great for him Oakland is so limited at tight end . No tight end has even 15 catches on the season . The lack of multiplicity in the passing attack could catch up to them Adrian Peterson tied a season high with 29 carries last week , and could top that against a very physical front seven , especially if Bridgewater is out . Peterson has 68 carries for 326 yards over the last three weeks . With the weather turning , you get the sense coordinator Norv Turner is about to really start riding him The Vikes did a helluva job on stopping Todd Gurley last week Somebody paid to catch the football in Minnesota not named Diggs has to make a play here eventually . Right ? If somebody hits a Vikings QB in a manner Zimmer takes umbrage with , better bring your boxing gloves . Dude is fired up .
