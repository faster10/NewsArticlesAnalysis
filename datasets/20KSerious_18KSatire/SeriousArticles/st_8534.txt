In 2010 , I was part of a group of researchers at Northwestern University of Medicine who surveyed a demographically representative sample of 40 , 000 U . S . families . In a peer reviewed study published in Pediatrics in June 2011 , we revealed our findings : One in 13 children in the U . S . has a food allergy , and 40 of those have had a potentially life threatening reaction such as difficulty breathing and throat constriction . To put that in perspective , that means two children in every school classroom , or almost 6 million American kids , have a food allergy that could potentially endanger their lives .
