Fury deserves the praise and the three versions of the world heavyweight title he won in the vast , glowing , white ring . However , mere hours before the fight the ring had been taken apart when it was discovered that just under two inches of extra foam had been added to reduce his movement . Klitschko knew that Fury would dance and perhaps he also knew that his fists would not be enough . The extra foam would have drained Fury , that is a fact . He would have lost had he fought on the foam and his people ? a lively cabal of promoter Mick Hennessy , adviser Asif Vali , father John and uncle and trainer Peter ? should be applauded for their refusal to acquiesce as so many have in the past . ?
