Florida Rep . Richard Corcoran , a one time Rubio consultant and chief of staff who has endorsed Bush , smiled awkwardly and fell uncharacteristically silent when asked about the new Right to Rise ads . " I support Jeb Bush . I can ' t speak to Right to Rise . But we ' ve all said that , if people got to know the real Jeb Bush who governed the state of Florida , he ' s going to win the presidency . I would say go out there and let the world know the conservative , principled , courageous Jeb Bush . "
