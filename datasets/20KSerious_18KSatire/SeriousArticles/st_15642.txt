Just two years earlier , Sisi had seized power in a military coup , toppling Mohamed Morsi , the democratically elected successor to Hosni Mubarak , himself a strongman of 30 years pushed out in early 2011 by mass protests in Cairo s Tahrir Square .

His security forces arrested thousands of people , including much of his political opposition , and in one bloody day that summer , they gunned down some 1 , 000 pro Morsi protesters ( or more ) who were staging peaceful sit ins . The massacre was shocking even by the standards of Egypt s long dismal human rights record .
