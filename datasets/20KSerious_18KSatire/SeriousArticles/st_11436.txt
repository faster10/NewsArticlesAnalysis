The same thing is true of this 2015 Patriots team , and the absence of the Kansas City rush was a big reason why the Patriots had so much success on offense on Saturday afternoon . With Justin Houston ( 29 . 5 sacks in 27 regular season games over the past two years ) playing just eight defensive snaps , the Chiefs were forced to blitz to try to generate pressure . That was no trouble for the Patriots , who picked up first downs on consecutive third and longs to start the game against Kansas City blitzes , subsequently scored a touchdown , and never looked back . The Chiefs eventually finished the game with no sacks , pressured Brady on just four of 43 dropbacks , and registered just one legal quarterback hit , from Houston replacement Dee Ford . They didn ' t even get a sniff of Brady .
