When gay kids read comments like Murphy s ? and then see that the MLB deemed them acceptable ? they re liable to conclude that they really are twisted and aberrant , that society really won t accept them for who they are . These toxic feelings could only be exacerbated by a cult of Murphy , a growing fan base that lauds him as the Mets savior . To see an anti gay player be not just tolerated , but celebrated ? even by those who would otherwise rebuke his prejudice ? would be profoundly dispiriting . Even I , a fairly thick skinned gay adult , was stunned by the celerity with which otherwise tolerant baseball fans forgave his anti gay disparagements once he started hammering homers .
