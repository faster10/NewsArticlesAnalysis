Christopher : There are similarities and differences , certainly . New Zealand seems to be somewhere in the middle , culturally , between the UK and the U . S . , which is possibly a useful foundation for me . I think you can tell the difference between British and American science fiction and fantasy , although it ' s sometimes not something you can definitively put your finger on . It seems more obvious in other genres like crime . British crime novels are very different to American crime novels , which is a natural divergence , obviously , as crime and mystery are usually set in the here and now , and the UK and U . S . are different places , shared language and experience aside .
