African Burial Ground , New York . From frontier Alaska to the glittering streets of New York , the National Park Service spans all environs . On the opposite end of the spectrum from Aniakchak is the African Burial Ground , located in Lower Manhattan . The monument preserves the remains of several hundred free and enslaved Africans buried in the 17th and 18th centuries . The burial ground was forgotten and built over in subsequent centuries , only to resurface in 1991 as a result of construction excavations . A monument and visitor center now honor the memories of the interred . ( The African Burial Ground does not charge admission , but will be closed on Veterans Day . )
