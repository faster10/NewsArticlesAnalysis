Atomic bombs work on the principle of nuclear fission , where energy is released by splitting atoms of enriched uranium or plutonium encased in the warhead . The first test of an A bomb took place in July 1945 in New Mexico , United States , and immediately demonstrated the new weapon ' s awesome power . Hiroshima was destroyed by one A bomb with a uranium fuel warhead that had the power of 15 kilotons ( 0 . 015 megaton ) . Nagasaki was destroyed three days later by a plutonium A bomb of similar power , 17 kilotons , or the equivalent of 17 , 000 tons of TNT . The Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in August 1949 in the desert of Kazakhstan .
