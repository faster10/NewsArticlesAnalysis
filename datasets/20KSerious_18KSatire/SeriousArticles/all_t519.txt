Loretta Lynch splits with Barack Obama on pot’s dangers
Loretta Lynch made her first significant break from President Barack Obama on Wednesday on the issue of marijuana as the attorney general nominee disputed Obama’s view that the drug is no more dangerous than alcohol. Those answers came during questioning from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who read aloud Obama’s comments from an interview with The New Yorker during Lynch’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

I don’t think it is more dangerous than alcohol,” Obama told magazine editor David Remnick in the interview, published in January 2014. Lynch testified that she does not agree. “I certainly don’t hold that view and don’t agree with that view of marijuana,” she said. “I certainly think the president was speaking from his personal experience, personal opinion, neither of which I am able to share.” She added that she does not support legalizing the substance. “I can tell you that not only do I not support the legalization of marijuana, it is not the position of the Department of Justice currently to support the legalization,” Lynch said. “Nor will it be the position should I be confirmed as attorney general.”
