The 850 square foot structure cost 10 , 500 , had three tiny bedrooms , and a sapling punched into the ground of the front yard . The porch was a four by eight foot square slab of concrete but I remember there was a white flowerpot hanging beneath the picture window in the living room and it seemed like an extravagance not really intended for us " hillbillies . " Daddy turned most of the backyard into a small farm and grew corn and radishes and even watermelons .
