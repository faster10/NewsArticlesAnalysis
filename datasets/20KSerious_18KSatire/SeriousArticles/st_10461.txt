Both Bonds and Clemens have been accused numerous times of using PEDs in their major league careers , though neither failed an MLB administered drug test . Clemens was named in the 2007 Mitchell Report , which documented illegal steroid use in baseball , with former trainer Brian McNamee saying that he had repeatedly injected Clemens with Winstrol , an anabolic steroid . Clemens denied the charges , suing McNamee for defamation and testifying before a Congressional committee that he never used PEDs . Although he was indicted by a federal grand jury and put on trial for perjury regarding his statements to Congress , Clemens was ultimately acquitted of all the charges against him .
