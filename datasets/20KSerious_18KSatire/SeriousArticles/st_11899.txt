It s this brashness combined with pop omnipresence that makes Rihanna such an exciting pop star . While Taylor Swift is assembling her squad , turning friendship into a competitive exercise dressed up as feminist wholesomeness , Rihanna is partying at carnival , metaphorically knocking the schoolbooks out of Swift s arms in the high school hallway en route to rolling a spliff at the back of biology class . While Beyonc is exerting her Queen B power , RiRi is running around Coachella or having a laugh with her pals on a yacht as the rumours about her and Beyonc s husband won t go away . While Katy Perry is acting out her chameleon like post cartoon stage image , Rihanna s murdering people in her music videos . While Miley Cyrus is getting blitzed with Flaming Lips and graffiting SEX IS COOL on the dressing room wall , Rihanna is adjusting her septum piercing and Instagramming her latest tattoo by Bang Bang . She s just cooler . Her impact on fashion exerts both street and popular power , with the trickle down effect seen in every line outside every school and student disco .
