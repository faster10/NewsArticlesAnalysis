Coughlin is a great coach . He may not have had much success the last couple years , but the giants are horrible , no run game , not much defence , so have Eli throw 100 times a game then talk about how terrible he is because he throws a ton of picks . But they were right in every game , had a chance to win almost every game they lost . What did Coughlin do that made him successful ? Ran the ball played defence . Coughlins def get pressure on QBs , one area 49ets def struggles , so he would improve that . 49ers can run the football . Hire Coughlin please
