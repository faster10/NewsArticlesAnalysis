It started slowly ? and the moderators first thought , Brett Baier admitted later , was : uh oh . Maybe these guys need Trump to put on their best show . It was clear that Ted Cruz could not hold center stage . He simply wasn t very compelling . And it was clear that the Marco Rubio windup toy , spouting perfectly honed couplets from his stump speech , was compelling , but in a perfectly predictable , not very spontaneous way . He certainly wowed Frank Luntz s focus group , which doesn t mean nothing : in fact , it may mean a lot . None of the other candidates ignited the rocket they need to become relevant in Iowa .
