At the Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 16 ) meeting in Cancun , Mexico , a financial mechanism was set up whose aim was to support developing countries on projects related to climate change , primarily for mitigation and adaptation . The Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) , which is supposed to amount to 100 billion annually by 2020 , is widely understood as an obligation of rich countries and part of the process through which they would pay for and support developing countries to reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change . The GCF secretariat s functions and activities are guided by and remain accountable to the UNFCCC . The GCF , if it works well , could become the largest fund dedicated to climate change , but there are also others that are part of the overall climate finance architecture such as the Global Investment Fund and the Global Environment Facility for specific climate related projects . The GCF s exact role , source of funds , and the windows through which it would operate post 2020 are still getting clarified and should ideally be sharper after COP 21 . Some countries , including India , have made funding a requirement for actions within their nationally determined contributions . India has asked for a funding window for technology transfer in the GCF for loans and financing . Finance is needed for making new upfront capital investments in expensive renewable technologies that are necessary to make a transition to a low carbon path . Such a development strategy has not been attempted before and is a different model from that of the U . S . , Europe or even China . The world would likely benefit from lessons that India would have to share from this experiment .
