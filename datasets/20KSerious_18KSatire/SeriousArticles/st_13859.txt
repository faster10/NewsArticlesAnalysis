Yu : I ' ve been fascinated by the idea of a multiverse ever since I first learned of it , from my alternate self . OK , no , not from my alternate self . From a book by David Deutsch , who I have raved about elsewhere . And now , I ' m fascinated to be reading about all of these other speculative hypotheses about different kinds of multiverses . It ' s a really mind scrambling idea , the kind of idea that , once it ' s in your head , it ' s hard to remember what it was like before you ' d ever been exposed to it . I personally hope there are no alternate universes ( except in the sense that Deutsch uses the term ) , though . This one is strange enough , and if it turns out to be the only one , that would make it even more mysterious .
