Come on , really ? : With the luxury of time , let s step back and look at the bigger picture . This challenge could have gone three different ways , and only one of them would have been bad for the Patriots . Worst case scenario , it s termed a fumble and New England loses the ball . Best case , it s a completed pass and a fresh set of downs . The refs split the difference New England kept the ball but lost the down . Seems reasonable . If you re looking to screw over New England , wouldn t you deem the play a fumble and take the ball from them right there ?
