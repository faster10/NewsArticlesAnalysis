This is quite simply an issue of harassment . If we believe people should have the right to access medical care with privacy and without intimidation , we should follow in Australia s footsteps and implement buffer zones too . ? We wouldn t accept it if people took exception to any other medical procedure , and by failing to properly curtail intimidation outside family planning establishments , we implicitly say that abortion is still everybody s business ? rather than the singular business of the woman choosing to have one .
