MJ : It ' s pretty much like anything else , dealing with your kids or your office and you re the boss , they gotta trust you . They have to trust you have their best interests . I ' m not going to put in you in a position that will make you look bad . I ' m not going to put you in a position where I don ' t think you ll flourish . At the same time , that doesn t always mean I m going to be right . But you got to trust me . Ultimately , Paul questioned the decision , but give him credit because he ' s a pro . He went out and did his job and is flourishing . You have to give the entire organization a lot of credit for the way they handled it .
