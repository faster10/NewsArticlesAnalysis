Several devices can already be controlled with gestures , but UltraHaptics add an extra layer of feedback , by generating the sensation of a force field : " Haptics is more than just the sense of touch . It ' s really all of the information that you get from the sense of touch . What you ' re feeling , what sort of pressure , the tactile sensation given by an object or surface . You also know where your limbs are and how they ' re moving , all from the sense of touch . It ' s all this information that cues how you ' re interacting with the world , " Carter said .
