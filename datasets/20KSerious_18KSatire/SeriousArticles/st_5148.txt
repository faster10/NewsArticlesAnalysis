What is missing from this picture ? An effective effort to dismantle ISIS and to break apart its territorial lock on the corridor linking its Syrian capital of Raqqa and its Iraqi capital of Mosul . That is where U . S . failure is on maximum display . If only Mr Kerry had been spending half as much time cobbling together an ARAB TURKISH EUROPEAN expeditionary force to split ISIS territory in two as he is worrying about Putin ' s latest Syrian adventures we would be better off . NOTE : Turkey ' s national elections are next week and there is good chance that a new , more pro U . S . government will emerge . hear the critics now " not realistic ! " Well , show me the proof that the effort has even been attempted . ISIS is Job 1 for the U . S . Yes , as long as Assad as in power , he is a walking magnet for more Sunni extremist recruits , but let ' s get our priorities right once . It does not mean placing American boots on the ground in Syria . It means placing other boots on the ground while the U . S . provides the logistical and air support .
