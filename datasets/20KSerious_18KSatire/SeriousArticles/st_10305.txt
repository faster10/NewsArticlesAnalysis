Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote " I believe that we are being summoned by God to see in the human ' other ' a face of the divine ' other . ' The test so lamentably failed by the great powers of the 20th century is to see the Divine presence in the face of the stranger . To heed the cry of those who are disempowered in the age of unprecedented powers who are hungry and poor and ignorant and uneducated , whose human potential is being denied the chance to be expressed . That is the faith of Abraham and Sarah who , with the great faiths Judaism , Christianity and Islam , trace their spiritual or actual ancestry . "
