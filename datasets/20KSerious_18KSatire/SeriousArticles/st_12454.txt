Modine : I think I could teach John F . Kennedy a thing or two about the art of negotiation ! ( laughter ) Love and marriage are complicated things . Fortunately , I was very good friends with my wife before I fell in love with her . Love is something that is forever changing and metamorphosing . And what you hope , and occasionally get lucky , is you have a partner who you can grow with and not grow apart from . I ' ve been very fortunate that the journey I ' ve been on with Cari Modine has been beautiful .
