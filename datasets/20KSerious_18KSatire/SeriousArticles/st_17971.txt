First , Afghanistan has been a platform for international cooperation , we continue in this regard , and very much welcome the engagement of China and our other neighbors near and far , from India to Azerbaijan in the common quest for containing terrorism . States of the region must face the common threat that is the second issue . Without rules of the game where states respect the rights and obligations of mutual sovereignty and cooperate in the state to state sets of relationships , we will have enormous difficulty containing terrorism . In the past , there have been occasions , where there has been a temptation to use non state actors as instruments of policy , whatever the justification of those behaviors in the past , in the current threat environment we must distance ourselves from malign non state actors because the word of state is a word of predictability and key to prosperity .
