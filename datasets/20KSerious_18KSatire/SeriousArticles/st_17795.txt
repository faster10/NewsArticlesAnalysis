" I could care less about any of these cameras , in all honesty . All I care about is my family , I care about protecting my girl , protecting my baby , and protecting my ideas and my dreams . That ' s the reason why I went so crazy , " West said . " I ' m totally weird , and I ' m totally honest , and I ' m totally inappropriate sometimes . . . I ' m just going to give y ' all the truth , and y ' all going to learn to love it . You ' re going to love me , you ' re going to hate me , but I ' m going to be me . "
