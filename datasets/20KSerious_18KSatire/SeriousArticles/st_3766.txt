In any case , even if the BJP does agree to an 18 rate ? this is around the rate NIPFP has said is possible if there is one rate applicable for all commodities services ? it may have to go back to each state to get its approval since most states are looking at a two or three part GST structure with a lower rate for goods used by the common man . How high the revenue neutral rate is also depends on what is kept out of the purview of GST ? if large chunks of the economy are kept out of its purview , how are taxes to be collected ? Once again , this makes it difficult to commit to an 18 rate upfront .
