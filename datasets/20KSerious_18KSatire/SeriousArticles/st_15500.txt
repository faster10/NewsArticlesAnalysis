Moving on to Michele Bachmann vs . Howard Baker ( I ' m sorry I couldn ' t help myself . ) Baker served in the U . S . Navy , was elected to the U . S . Senate , was asked to serve on the Supreme Court by Nixon , and served two terms as Senate minority leader . He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and inspired the formation of the Howard H . Baker , Jr . Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee . Could you see Michele Bachmann being nominated for a Presidential Medal in the near future ? ! Of course , some people might say , to be fair to Bachmann , Baker has never claimed to cure anyone of homosexuality .
