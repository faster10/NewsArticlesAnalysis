Minnesota Vikings : Manziel was at the top of the Vikings ' quarterback board with Teddy Bridgewater before the 2014 draft , and coach Mike Zimmer said on Tuesday the Vikings will remain on the lookout for players who can help them at the QB position . But Bridgewater will be the Vikings ' starter , and Zimmer has said on several occasions that he likes that Bridgewater has no interest in being a celebrity quarterback . Knowing what we know about Manziel since he entered the league , and given Bridgewater ' s status as the starter , the Vikings might not have a ton of patience with Manziel and all that comes with him .
