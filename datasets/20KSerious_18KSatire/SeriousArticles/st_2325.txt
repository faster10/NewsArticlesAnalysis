Follow the Rockies up north to Essex , Montana , near the entrance to Glacier National Park , and you ' ll find the quaint Izaak Walton Inn ( from 89 night ) . We bring up this family owned retreat not just for its proximity to a wealth of backcountry runs and trails , but also to appease those of you looking for something a little different in your snow centered stay namely , a host of old rail cars that have been converted into unique sleeping quarters , including two new cabooses recently transplanted to the site .
