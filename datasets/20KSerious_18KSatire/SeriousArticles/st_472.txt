William Daugherty , who was held in solitary confinement for almost the entire time he was a hostage , said , " It was not a warm welcome " when Jimmy Carter flew to the U . S . military base in Germany to meet the hostages right after their release . The hostages were split on their thinking . Many felt they were left unprotected in the embassy after Carter made the decision to allow the Shah into the United States . Daugherty said that during the meeting , Carter went around to hug all the hostages , and many remained still with their arms at their sides and did not return his hug .
