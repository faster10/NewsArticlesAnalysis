Obama did his best to avoid constitutional norms . He deployed American intelligence agents on the ground , not troops , so he could plausibly deny he had put boots on the ground . He did not seek an American national consensus for war because Libya presented no threat whatsoever to the U . S . He did not obtain a congressional declaration of war as the Constitution requires because he couldn t get one . And he did not seek United Nations permission , which is required to attack a fellow U . N . member .
