Though Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara both made the acting categories for performances in " Carol " , the film and its director Todd Haynes were absent from the best picture and directing races , while " Beasts of No Nation " and " Concussion " were complete shut outs across the board . In an age where traffic , likes and ad revenue are king , I am grudgingly coming to the conclusion that the only effective response to yet another whitewashed Oscars may be to stage a " blackout " and stop supporting it all together .
