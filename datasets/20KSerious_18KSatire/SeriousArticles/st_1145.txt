It is a connection that binds generations . It was to the Jersey Shore that my brother and our high school friends went the day after senior proms , just like our dad did . And we both agree our best family vacation ever was in Lavallette in 1977 , when he was 12 and I was 10 . So many of our friends were there at the same time , and we could finally hang out on the boardwalk on our own . I loved it so much I vowed I would keep forever a T shirt I got at a boat race we attended that week . And I have . It is now my 9 year old son ' s favorite T shirt and his special connection to the Jersey Shore .
