" I haven ' t been arrested for anything else even remotely political , " he said . " The first arrest was for fishing out of season two days . I messed up , I wasn ' t looking at the rules right , I apologized . I ' m a dedicated catch and release fisherman . I love fishing and fish is one of my passions . My other arrest was for a DWI , which I really regret . But I took responsibility for my actions . As a matter of fact , I was two weeks away from finishing my drug and alcohol courses in order to get my license back . "
