Ben Roethlisberger ( knee ) and Mike Vick ( hamstring ) are banged up , putting Jones in line to make his first start against a Chiefs defense that ranks 25th against the pass . The Chiefs will be relieved if they don t have to face Roethlisberger , who is 4 1 with a 106 . 8 rating versus Kansas City , but Jones flashed potential in relief of Vick in last week s 25 13 win over Arizona , passing for 168 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions in his NFL debut . Kansas City coach Andy Reid is looking for his 162nd career victory , which would move him past former Steeler Bill Cowher for 18th place on the all time list . The Steelers have won three straight meetings , including a 20 12 triumph in Pittsburgh last season .
