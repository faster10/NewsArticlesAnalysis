Lee says the app is not meant to be the counterpart to the " He Man Woman Hater ' s Club " but instead a place for women to control their images whether because they are in a high profile position or to simply ward off objectification . Lee likens the visibility functionality to a real world interaction in which a woman makes eye contact or smiles as a signal of interest to a potential suitor . If the suitor ends up untoward , she can toggle her visibility in the same way she could decline conversation in a social setting .
