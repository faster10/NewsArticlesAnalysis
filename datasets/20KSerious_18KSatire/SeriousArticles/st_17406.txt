Besides reserve O lineman Sam Brenner , the only other offensive player to miss Friday s practice was quarterback Brock Osweiler , whose knee injury came as a surprise when it was announced earlier in the week . Osweiler suffered a sprained right knee Sunday when he was hit by Chargers linebacker Melvin Ingram . Although he ll be sitting out tomorrow s practice session as well , head coach Gary Kubiak said that he expects Osweiler to participate in next week s practices and be ready to backup Peyton Manning in Denver s playoff opener .
