The last memory I have of him was a benefit that comedian Bob Saget was organizing at the comedy club Carolines on Broadway to raise consciousness about scleroderma . It was a fun night . Jimmy Fallon was there performing , as was Robin and myself . After the show , Billy Crystal stopped by . He had been doing a show and was unable to make the benefit . He and Robin greeted each other . Then Robin came over and spoke to me . We chatted for a little bit , and Robin said to me , " Would you like to join us ? We ' re going out for dessert . "
