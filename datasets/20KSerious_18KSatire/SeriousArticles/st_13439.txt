In all fairness , it must be acknowledged that the starting point of the escalating dispute was a statement by Mohan Bhagwat , the chief of the Sangh Parivar , at the beginning of the election campaign . He blandly suggested that the time had come for the appointment of a committee to review the entire system of reservations . He added that economic plight , rather than caste , should be the deciding factor in this regard . From the RSS point of view , this makes sound sense . There can be no Hindu Rashtra if Hindu society is not solidly united . Caste will surely be an instrument to fragment it .
