The final score wasn t really indicative of the outcome . The Patriots seemed to be in control most of the way . Specifically , the Patriots seemed to be a step ahead of defensive coordinator Bob Sutton , with Brady completing 66 percent of his passes . The Chiefs offense was fairly effective , despite a hobbled Maclin , and though the play calling occasionally got bit too cute , that s worth something . But people will specifically pick nits with Andy Reid s clock management , and with good reason . In the first half , the Chiefs wasted two timeouts on the first drive of the game , which ended up costing them on the final drive of the half when they had to spike the ball deep in Patriots territory to stop the clock . That cost them a down they could have used to get an additional crack at the end zone . Reid made a good call in the third quarter when he went for it on fourth down deep in Patriots territory instead of kicking a field goal , which led to a touchdown . Still , his clock management down the stretch ? when he didn t call one of three timeouts on their final scoring drive , allowing precious seconds to tick off the clock ? deserves criticism .
