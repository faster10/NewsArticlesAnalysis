" Overnight , the BoJ surprised markets by introducing a negative interest rate of 0 . 1 ? percent , implemented by a move to a three tiered interest rate system for reserve accounts at the BoJ . In our view this reaffirms the BoJ s commitment to achieving its inflation target , and should help contribute to a more positive backdrop for risk . JPY is over 1 . 5 ? percent ? higher following the announcement , at 120 . 75 . We continue to recommend JPY higher as part of our FX Top Trade recommendation for 2016 , and forecast 130 in 12 months . "
