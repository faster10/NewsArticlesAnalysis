I spent a week in the care of Pakistan ' s affluent elite , and my time with them taught me that Pakistan is an acutely divided country of extremes . There is a great deal of resentment towards this outmoded elite from the rest of the country . There is no middle class as we know it . This privileged community lives in compounds with armed guards at their gates . They employ a live in staff and a chauffeur . They inhabit a bubble of ersatz Western life . One woman told me she thought that fashion , not drones , was the answer to Pakistan ' s problems . Whether this is the case , or not , remains to be seen .
