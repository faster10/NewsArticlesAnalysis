That ' s right , I ' m calling a rematch of the 2004 Super Bowl with the Panthers and Patriots playing in Super Bowl 50 in the Bay area . " These are guys that the game will always speak about . . . " Two weeks later , Indianapolis would have its first Super Bowl win , a 29 17 victory over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI . I am sure that this will be a sold out game and there will be quite a hostile environment up in Denver once the Pats take the field at around 3 : 05 tomorrow . They were ranked third a season ago , but the long time coach took them to new heights this year .
