The banged up New England offensive line struggled mightily against Buffalo s talented pass rushers . Brady was sacked only once , but a variety of well disguised blitz packages led to quarterback Tom Brady getting hit numerous times . Tackle Marcus Cannon seemed to struggle the most , picking up two penalties and having a third offset by a Buffalo penalty . As a result , Brady completed only 20 of 39 of his passes ( 51 . 2 percent ) , and he also threw an interception when he tried to force a pass to wide receiver Chris Harper , who was double covered . Tight end Rob Gronkowski was well contained , as he caught only two passes for 37 yards .
