On February 1 , 2016 voters in Iowa will vote in the 2016 Democratic Caucuses . Iowa is one of ten states that still use the Caucuses to elect delegates and decide the state ' s preference for Democratic Presidential nominee . Since 1996 , the Democratic candidate that won the Iowa Caucuses has gone on to win the presidential nomination . The importance of winning Iowa this year cannot be overstated . Most recent polls have shown a marginal lead for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders with the margin of error making the polls a veritable tie . Sanders , long portrayed by mainstream media as being on the sidelines of the presidential race has indubitably become a front runner both by the measure of his presence on the internet as well as his showings in hypothetical general election mashups in which he is the front runner in Iowa among all voters . With such a small margin of difference in the polls , a victory in Iowa is likely to provide the momentum needed to sway voters in other states and win a presidential nomination .
