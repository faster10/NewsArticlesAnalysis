Caveats notwithstanding , the problem for Clinton is that she will have to spend the next 11 days as a loser , and probably a significant loser , until the Nevada caucuses . There are people out there ? perhaps you know them ? ? who have not been paying much attention to the election thus far and are only beginning to tune in now . People who might vaguely be aware of Sanders but also don t expect him to win anything against Clinton . For 11 days , the story , just as people are tuning in , could be that Clinton barely squeaked by Sanders in the first state and then was blown out in the second state .
