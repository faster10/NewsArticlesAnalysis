" I thought I was going to die , we were so high up , " the card said . " I thought to myself : I hope we don ' t crash and burn or worse yet landing in the ocean , living through it , only to be eaten by sharks , or worse yet , end up on some place like Gilligan ' s Island , stranded , or worse yet , be eaten by a tribe of headhunters , speaking of headhunters , why do they just eat outsiders , and not the family members ? Strange . . . and what if the plane ripped apart in mid flight and we plumited ( sic ) to earth , landed on Gilligan ' s Island and then lived through it , and the only woman there was Mrs Thurston Howell III ? No Mary Anne ( my favorite ) no Ginger , just Lovey ! If it were just her , I think I ' d opt for the sharks , maybe the headhunters . "
