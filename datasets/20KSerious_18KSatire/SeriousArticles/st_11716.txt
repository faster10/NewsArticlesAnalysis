Fawcett ' s research has found that , far from leading the way , the UK ' s capital city lags behind much of the country when it comes to gender equality . Women in London are more likely to live in poverty , experience a wider pay gap , and are less likely to work once they have children than women living elsewhere . In fact , London has the lowest level of maternal employment in the country : Just over half of the city ' s mothers with dependent children work , compared to almost two thirds across the UK .
