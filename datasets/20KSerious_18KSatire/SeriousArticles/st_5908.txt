Larry Fitzgerald ( 7 . 1 ) : As Brown and Floyd have come on strong , Fitzgerald ' s numbers have declined but it doesn ' t make him a bad Fantasy option . He has at least 11 targets in each of his last five games , but he hasn ' t scored in four straight . Playing out of the slot , like Brown , could be good for him against the Vikings as they ' ve struggled with slot receivers , but he ' s the easiest receiver for Minnesota Golden Gophers to prepare for . Think of him as a No . 2 option with less upside than his teammates .
