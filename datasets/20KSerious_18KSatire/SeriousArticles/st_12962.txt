The Internship was written by Vaughn and Jared Stern , and it ' s got little jabs of wit , like the scene in which Nick and Bill are duped into addressing a bald instructor in a wheelchair as ' ' Professor Charles Xavier ' ' ( he is not pleased ) . A lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element don ' t need to be opposed they can , and should , work hand in hand . That ' s a nice message ( and it ' s certainly a swell advertisement for Google ) , but it ' s not a funny message . " The Internship " gets so caught up in healing the generational divide that it ' s ostensibly about the analog dudes vs . the digital kids that the movie ends up being just a pleasant collection of mild laughs . It needed more spin , more Googliness . Grade : B
