The most important thing is , Morgan is if nothing else incredibly smart . He ' s capable , he ' s confident , he ' s thoughtful , but he ' s very , very smart , so I think he understands the lay of the land as good , if not better , than anyone else , and I think he understands the implications of what ' s just happened . There ' s gonna be a fundamental shift in his worldview that comes out of this , but how that works is not a linear thing . This guy has been to nihilism and back , he ' s explored the known universe of possibilities , but I think he ' s about to encounter another one .
