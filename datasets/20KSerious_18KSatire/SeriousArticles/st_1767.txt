I studied philosophy and religion at VCU and NYU , and like to write about moral and political issues . I ' m also dedicated to civil debate , and to teaching people how to discuss issues passionately without resorting to invective . Civil debate doesn ' t mean refusing to criticize ideas you disagree with or compromising on what you believe . It means arguing for your beliefs without name calling , without demonizing or distorting your opponents . It ' s like fair play in sports : work hard to defeat the other team , but don ' t cheat .
