They ran it like a university might be run . They had one floor of producers , one floor of directors , one floor of writers . And another building were all the editors . And everybody had students under them , learning the business . So there were always the top writers , and then there were the younger writers , and they were being taught by the older writers , and everybody kind of shared ideas . You had your drama teacher , then you had your voice teacher you learned how to interpret classical and regular lyrics , then you had your music department Johnny Green , Andre Previn , Connie Salinger , all these great musicians and writers and lyricists and arrangers .
