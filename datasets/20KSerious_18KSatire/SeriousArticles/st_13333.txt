The Giants already missed out on a target they seemed to hold in high regard in Jackson , who had been widely viewed as one of the top head coaching options of the offseason . He was courted heavily by the Browns and San Francisco 49ers on Sunday , just one day after Cincy fell in the AFC wildcard round . Both clubs seemed far more aggressive in their overtures to Jackson than the Giants , who did not request permission to speak with him until Monday and didn t lay out plans for an interview until Tuesday .
