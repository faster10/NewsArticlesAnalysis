In short , both textualism and originalism cut strongly against Cruz being a natural born citizen . ? Some argue that living theories of constitutional interpretation cut in favor of Cruz , but even living theories start with text and history , and it is not clear why the principle animating the clause would merit a different conclusion in current times . ? Presumably modern equal protection norms would bar a sexist rule that said children born abroad with one U . S . parent were natural born only if that parent were a man . ? But that is no argument against the interpretation that persons are natural born citizens only if born in a U . S . territory or to a parent serving the U . S . abroad .
