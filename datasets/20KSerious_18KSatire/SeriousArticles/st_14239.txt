Gordon , for his part , will not be going out quietly . " Obviously with our effort today in qualifying , I think we showed how bad we all want it , to be better than just being here battling for the championship and it being my final race , " he said . " When I ' m in the car , when I ' m in the garage , I ' m very focused and I can ' t say it ' s about fun at that time , but when it goes the way it went in qualifying , man , that ' s a lot of fun , and then just all the other interactions with the media , a few presentations , seeing those crew guys today , past crew members , I mean , that was awesome . ? How could I not be having the time of my life ? "
