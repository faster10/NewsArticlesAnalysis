The booster than landed successfully in December has been examined , including fueling it up and test firing it while strapped down . It performed well , though one engine had fluctuating thrust ( the cause of which is still being investigated ) . It s hard to say how much work will go into reusing these first stage boosters , but given they cost 60 million to build from scratch , reusing them will save a big chunk of launch cost . That s why I m so excited for this work . Reducing launch cost means making access to space easier , and that s incredibly important .
