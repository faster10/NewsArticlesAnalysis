Modi s surprise visit to Pakistan significantly eclipsed another important event of the day in the region the inauguration of newly built Afghan parliament building by the Indian PM Narendra Modi in Kabul . This is an impressive grand building in the heart of Kabul constructed by India with an estimated cost of 90 million US dollars . This building is somehow an iconic symbol of recently conceived and rapidly grown Afghanistan India ties in the region . So eventually India has reached an important milestone in this regard . Primarily to marginalise Pakistan s role in Afghanistan , India has heavily invested in Afghanistan in terms of construction of infrastructure , and training of the personnel of Afghan National Army , Afghan National Police and National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) . Ironically , India has never been so generous towards its other less developed immediate neighbouring countries . Many anti Pakistan echoes were heard during the inaugural session of the so called Afghan parliament in Kabul last week .
