These are people like Tenesha Hueston , a single mother of four in Zebulon , North Carolina , who , according to a New York Times article in November , was making 7 . 75 an hour as a shift manager at a fast food restaurant . Or Nick Mason , a father of two in Hixson , Tennessee , who made 9 an hour as an assistant manager at a pizza chain . They work these jobs year after year , while trying to care for their own children and parents , struggling to pay their bills . For them and people like them , the American Dream is a distant mirage .
