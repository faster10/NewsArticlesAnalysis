Here ' s where it starts to get interesting . The Holiday Bowl ( if Stanford wins ) is expected to choose either USC or Washington State . They could also pick Utah or UCLA , but neither is expected to get much consideration . USC improved its chances at being selected by the Holiday Bowl when it removed coach Clay Helton ' s interim tag on Monday , but the fact the Trojans were there last year is less than ideal . It ' s not a deal breaker there is not a firm rule against repeat appearances but bowls typically try to avoid it . Washington State ' s style of play is attractive to the Holiday Bowl , and the Cougars are expected to travel very well this year , having not been to a marquee bowl since the Holiday Bowl in 2003 .
