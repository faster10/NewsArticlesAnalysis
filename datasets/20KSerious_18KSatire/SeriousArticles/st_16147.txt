ABC reported that bomb sniffing dogs checked reporters equipment and once inside , reporters crowded around Peyton Manning s podium an hour before he got there . Miss Universe was there ( the one was initially named a runner up by Steve Harvey ) taking photos and doing interviews . One reporter , dressed as a mock superhero , mask and all , asked Peyton exactly how his family ate together . Manning , hamming it up , described some of his family standing around the table and some sitting at the table eating as if it was one of his Omaha line of scrimmage audibles .
