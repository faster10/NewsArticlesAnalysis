I m just as much a fan of the actor s Hogwarts incarnation as the rest of my generation clearly is ( Snape related tributes have dominated the social media response to Rickman s death ) . But it isn t a Rickman sneering behind lank black locks and lingering in that deliciously lethal way over the word Potter that s been hovering in my mind s eye for the past few days . For it s his role as Colonel Brandon in Emma Thompson s 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility that s most memorable for me .
