For progressives and the large swaths of the public who are sick of the very wealthiest concentrating their power , he is a plutocrat the ultimate creature of Wall Street , who relentlessly defended and befriended the largest and wildly unpopular major banks , after they tore down the economy and resisted any effort to tax the wealthiest 1 per cent . To Republicans ? from whom he would have to steal large chunks of votes to win ? his stances on gun control and social issues are far too liberal to garner any support among the conservative rank and file beyond those who work at Goldman Sachs . He is radioactive to supporters of both parties .
