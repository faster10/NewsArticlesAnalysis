Another difference : even Giffords ' political opponents publicly and forcefully condemned the man who shot her . The Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner went on TV to say , " An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve . " But in Pakistan , even Taseer ' s supporters have been mostly silent : perhaps calling his loss a tragedy , but stopping short of criticizing the man who killed him . " It ' s because they fear for their lives , " says Taseer ' s son Shehryar . " There ' s also been a warning issued by clerics against anyone who has any further vigils , and anyone who takes up the case of the governor and his family , their offices will be burned and their person killed . " Shehryar says that was the real tragedy of his father ' s shooting : it ' s forcing liberals to stay quiet and hide . " I think they ' ll be hunted . Without a doubt in my mind I believe that . "
