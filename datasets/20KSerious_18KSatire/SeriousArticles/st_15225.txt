Saberi : ( The interrogators ) were mostly harsh and threatening , but then they would say , " Oh , are you hungry ? Do you want us to make comfortable ? Do you want some tea or some water ? " I think it was partly to mess with the person ' s mind . My cellmates , the women who were prisoners , they are the strong ones . There were times when I was angry and told myself that I hate the sin and not the sinner . I had to learn from my cellmates , who were in prison much longer . I asked them , " How do you not hate these people for doing this to you ? "
