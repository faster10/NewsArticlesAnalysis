" I was writing a book about issues that make most people uncomfortable , including me . That alone , I knew , could make it controversial . But these are issues people do experience . To emotionally reach people , I had to write my story honestly . But I also wanted the book to be available to as many people as possible , so I did write a slightly less graphic alternate versioan of one scene . I let my publisher decide which to publish , and they correctly chose the more intense scene because readers needed to feel uncomfortable there to understand what the character was going through .
