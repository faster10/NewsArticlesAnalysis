Kerr : I think this whole thing has to have hardened him and given him a different perspective on people . I think if you combine " The Decision " TV show with the fact that he hasn ' t won a title , he ' s starting to feel pressure and people maybe don ' t look at him as the " boy wonder " anymore . It ' s more " When are you gonna win ? " That brings a lot of pressure , an edge and that comes with the territory and I think he understands that . He has to go out and win a title at some point to validate his legacy .
