It s a disappointing loss because this team fought pretty hard , just to come up short on a two point play , Brady said after the game . It would have been a fun overtime , had we had the opportunity . We just came up one play short . ? I wish the two point play would have been different . I m sure everyone can look at different plays throughout the game when it s that close and say , Man , I wish I would have made that play . But I m proud of the way we fought , and we certainly fought until the end .
