The sharpest movements among voters always happen at the last minute , making them impossible for polls to accurately chart . If Cruz can ' t recover this week and regain some momentum , the last minute surge will likely head towards Trump . The real question , though , is who will actually turn out . If the turnout is higher than expected , Trump likely has a big advantage . Many of Trump ' s supporters will be first time caucusgoers if they turn up , that is . Because turnout might be such a crucial factor , the weather will play a big role . If it ' s sleeting and miserable next Monday night , Trump may lose his advantage as more Iowans decide caucusing just isn ' t worth the effort . Clear skies and mild temperatures ( relatively mild , that is it ' s still going to be pretty cold ) might result in a bigger than expected turnout for Trump .
