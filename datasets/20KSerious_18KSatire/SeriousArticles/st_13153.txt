Opinions on quarterbacks are a dime a dozen , and there certainly are plenty of opinions on the Dolphins ? signal caller , Ryan Tannehill . Tannehill is in his fourth year after being drafted by the Dolphins in the 2012 draft ( 8th overall ) . The less that Tannehill throws , the better the Dolphins seem to do . In Sunday s win against the Ravens , the former Aggie threw the ball only 19 times . In the previous week s blowout loss to the New York Jets , Tannehill threw 58 passes and 33 ( 57 percent ) . You be the judge .
