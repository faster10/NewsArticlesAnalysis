Atwater ' s point ? that you could get whites to vote on the basis of racial resentments without using explicitly racist language ? formed the basis of the GOP ' s " Southern Strategy , " first adopted by Richard Nixon . Though you can hear blatant race baiting just by turning on your favorite conservative radio host ( particularly during the Obama presidency ) , what comes from the man at the top of the ticket has for some time been more subtle . Ronald Reagan may have complained in 1976 about the " strapping young buck " buying steak with his food stamps , and four years later thundered about " welfare queens , " but a Republican candidate today wouldn ' t talk in those terms . In 1988 , Atwater masterminded the campaign of George Bush , which made " Willie Horton " a household name , convincing voters that Michael Dukakis was going to send murderous , hypersexualized black men to rape their women and kill their men ( though not in so many words , of course ) . But today no GOP nominee would use that story the way the Bush campaign did , because they know they ' d be immediately called out for the clear racism of their appeals .
