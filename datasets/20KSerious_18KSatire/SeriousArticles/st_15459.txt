As Matt Yglesias argues , Trumpism is the natural result of conservative political strategy . Republicans refuse to accept immigration reform ? even though it could potentially help them make inroads among Latinos . They have also long refused to promulgate any economic policy that isn ' t preposterously slanted towards the rich . Their only political road left is turning out lower class whites ? a not insignificant number of whom are outright racists ? with rank race and Muslim baiting . As Ta Nehisi Coates once wrote , race hustling ? " profiting from their most backward impulses . . . stoking and then leeching off of their hate " ? has a long history in American politics . As Greg Sargent points out , the rest of the GOP field , and particularly Ted Cruz , is only slightly behind Trump in anti Islam fear mongering .
