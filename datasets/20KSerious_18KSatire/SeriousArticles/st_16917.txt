Key clubs : Once again , all eyes will be on Manchester City to see if they can maintain an assault on the top spots . Last season , many of their new signings failed to gel and a lack of consistency saw Tottenham seize that crucial Champions League slot . City ' s squad looks considerably stronger this season with a number of big name signings . Their bid for European football may be made easier if Spurs struggle to cope with the increased demands of playing in Europe . Outside of Manchester United and Chelsea , the only club who could conceivably make a bid for the title are Arsenal . However , unless Arsene Wenger can fix his side ' s defensive frailties , a lack of steel could prove to be their undoing again . At the other end of the table , the Premier League welcomes back Newcastle United who spent last season in the Championship but returned as worthy champions . The Magpies are joined by perennial yo yo club West Bromwich Albion and Blackpool who are led by the ever entertaining Ian Holloway . The team known as " The Tangerines " due to their bright orange kits may not be expected to gain many points this coming season but should be entertaining .
