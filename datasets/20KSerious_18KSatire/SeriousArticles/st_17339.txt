The truth , however , is we don t actually know how Rubio performs against strong attacks and intense scrutiny . He wasn t ignored in the last two debates , but he wasn t the focus either ? then , the title round was Trump vs . Bush and Trump vs . Fiorina . Tonight , he could stumble as much as he could break out of the pack . And if it s the latter , he ll face the full ? and likely hostile ? attention of everyone . Rubio is a talented , savvy politician . But that kind of scrutiny is a test , and it s not clear Rubio will pass , especially if it goes beyond theater criticism of his style and into uncomfortable questions about his background in Florida state politics .
