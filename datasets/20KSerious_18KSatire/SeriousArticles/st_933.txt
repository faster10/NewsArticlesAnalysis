Like Sandiford , Chaubey was interrogated by the police without a lawyer or an interpreter . His lawyers were only informed of his execution after he had already been shot in the jungle and he never got the chance to say goodbye to his family . That October , a Thai man and woman were executed . Both came from a poor neighborhood of Bangkok . The executions of these impoverished people have tarnished my memories of that holiday forever I will never think of the jungle without remembering that shots rang out there and people moaned in pain as they died .
