There are a couple of reasons for that disturbing to be sure , but reasons nonetheless . One is that presidents and presidential candidates do routinely bend the truth , doctor numbers , double talk , deceive , and , yes , blatantly lie . Their lies and distortions have become not only routine , but expected . The lying , deceiving politician has been virtually encoded into the stock image the public has of politicians . They have been mocked by comedians , reviled by pundits , and fact checked to death by news sources . Yet , this hasn ' t made one politician cease from fudging a fact , distorting a statement , or making a promise that will never be kept whenever they think they can get away with it .
