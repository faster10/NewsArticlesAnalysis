Is the Bush Super PAC telegraphing its attack on Rubio ? Or is it internal sabotage ? Why would the Right to Rise folks leak this story out , especially before tonight ' s debate ? It was our understanding that after the last debate Jeb World acknowledged that they couldn ' t take Rubio on again until Bush had improved his poll position . Given that this New York Times story feels more damaging to Jeb than to Rubio , we wonder if there ' s some internal sabotage going on . Did someone with knowledge of Right to Rise ' s abortion video on Rubio give the story to the Times ? Or did it come from pro Rubio folks who knew about the video ? Regardless of the source , that Times article only puts more pressure on Bush tonight .
