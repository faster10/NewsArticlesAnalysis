The Labour leader wasn t about to take this on trust . Finding himself on the right side of public opinion hasn t always come easy for him and Google was a clear win . Could the prime minister confirm the Google settlement was the result of 25 meetings with 17 ministers ? he asked . Dave shrugged . He was just sorry there hadn t been time for more meetings with more ministers . If there had been then they might have been able to knock the tax bill down still further . His own accountants would never have let him pay so much .
