There is a pattern here , which Britain may be about to repeat by extending its air strikes to Syria and stepping up its war against Isis . It will be the fourth campaign Britain has launched in the wider Middle East over the past 12 years and all have ended badly . The biggest failure has been political rather than military . Yet , in the days since Isis attacked Paris on 13 November , all the talk in Britain has been about more money for the Army and security personnel , and not for the Foreign Office . ?
