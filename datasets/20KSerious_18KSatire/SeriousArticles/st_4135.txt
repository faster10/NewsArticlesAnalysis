We ve focussed on delivering a network that is at par with the high speed public Wi Fi network that is available to users in developed countries . The network is built for wide coverage and high capacity usage unlike a typical Wi Fi hotspot which offers connectivity in limited area and poor experience . This network will extend to cover both long distance train station and the local train station in Mumbai Central . The next four stations we ll bring online will be Allahabad , Patna , Jaipur and Ranchi and others will follow very shortly , said , Gulzar Azad , Head of Access Project , Google India
