I have personal experience with bias in the entertainment industry : When I made my first documentary , Miss Representation , I wanted to hire a female director , since the film explores how mainstream media and culture contribute to the under representation of women in positions of power and influence . While there was interest from several prominent female filmmakers , I was eventually turned down by every single one , due to their fear of being blacklisted in Hollywood if they spoke out against the sexism and one dimensional operation so prevalent in the entertainment industry . So I directed it myself , which ultimately was a gift , because I branched out from acting and producing and found my voice as a director .
