OVD : I quit my job a year ago it was a quite bold decision that scared many people around me because being an artist was not considered as a valid option . I come from a family where my mum is a lawyer and my dad is a chartered accountant both of them having very senior jobs throughout their careers and I attended top schools that were very advanced and quite expensive . With the money my family invested in me , of course you can imagine my mum being quite devastated , but I now have their full support .
