Mr and Mrs Edward Julius Berwind , who made their money in coal mining , built the Elms as their summer residence in Newport . Now one of the famous Newport Mansions and a National Historic Landmark , the Elms was finished in 1901 . Unlike some residents of fictional Downton , who grudgingly adapted to modern conveniences like telephones and electricity , the Berwinds had the Elms outfitted with the latest modern conveniences . The house was among the first in Newport to be fully electrified with no gas backup . There was even an early ice maker .
