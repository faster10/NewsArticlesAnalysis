We featured six nonvoters from Hawaii as a way to highlight the diverse reasons people in the Aloha State don ' t vote . Because of your efforts , three of them decided to vote , two of those for the first time . A fourth plans to vote in the future , but did not register in time for tomorrow ' s election ( that ' s yet another reason Hawaii should pass a same day voter registration law ) . Two say they won ' t vote in this election , but even they said that they were moved by the pro voting arguments you sent , and that they may reconsider eventually . " I ' ve been reading them all . It ' s amazing , " said Nani Teruya , who does not plan to vote on Tuesday but seems to revel in the fact that she ' s become a local celebrity of sorts in Maui because of this online campaign . " I love it , you know . I really take into consideration what people are saying . But , you know , I still have my reasons . "
