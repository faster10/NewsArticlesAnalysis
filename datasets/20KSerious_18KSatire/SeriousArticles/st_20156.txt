We know what such a step will require : spending cuts and some revenue increases , best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform . The far right opposes any tax increases while the far left opposes any entitlement reform . But there should still be room to reason together . For example , one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes , allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates . Unfortunately , some folks on the far right have decided that raising revenue at all will be considered a tax hike and a violation of the anti tax pledge . That all or nothing logic threatens to doom the deliberations that democratic republics depend on .
