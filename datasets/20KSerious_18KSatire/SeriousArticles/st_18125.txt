How Rubio gets from Obama s anodyne comments in favor of religious tolerance and against discrimination ? if we walk back to the library shelf and grab our Edmund Burke , I think we will find those are conservative principles ? to a president who is constantly pitting people against each other involves more magic than logic . I have to admit that while Rubio comes across as earnest and not too bright , like a Home Depot salesman way too eager to debate competing brands of drywall , the level of dog whistle at work here , of almost but not quite saying what you mean , is sophisticated . I think Maloy has it right : The division Rubio perceives is not between Muslims and other Americans , but between people who agree that Muslims face vicious bigotry and discrimination in the United States and people who resent any such assertion and who are sick of all this p . c . ? groveling over the precious so called rights of wacky , made up minority groups who want to make us all pee in the ladies room , drive a hempen Prius and turn our backs on Jesus . And bacon .
