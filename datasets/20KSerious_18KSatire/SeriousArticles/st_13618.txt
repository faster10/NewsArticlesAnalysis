Director Spike Lee prominently spoke out ? against the lack of diversity present in the acting categories at this year s ceremony on Monday . ? We cannot support it and I mean no disrespect to my friends , host Chris Rock and producer Reggie Hudlin , president Cheryl Boone Isaacs and the Academy , Lee wrote . But , how is it possible for the second consecutive year all 20 contenders under the acting category are white ? And let s not even get into the other branches . Forty white actors in two years and no flava at all . We can t act ? ! WTF ! !
