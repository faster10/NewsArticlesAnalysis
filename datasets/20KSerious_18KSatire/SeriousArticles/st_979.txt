CARIG : Assuming that neither Murphy nor Cespedes return , the Mets must find a way to make up for some of that lost production . But they already have much of their core in place . Michael Conforto will play every day in leftfield , and he has the potential to anchor himself in the middle of the lineup . Lucas Duda , despite his streakiness , will likely stick at first base . Perhaps , Michael Cuddyer is used in a platoon . The Mets are encouraged by what could come from a full season ( or at least closer to it ) from catcher Travis d ' Arnaud . The Mets don ' t seem enamored by the current pool of free agent shortstops led by Ian Desmond , with Flores and Ruben Tejada seemingly in line to man shortstop . So , where can the Mets add ? A player such as Ben Zobrist brings valuable versatility and he has been on the Mets ' radar . So could Gerardo Parra , who the Mets pursued on the trade market last July . Parra plays centerfield , a key since Juan Lagares took a step backward at the plate this season .
