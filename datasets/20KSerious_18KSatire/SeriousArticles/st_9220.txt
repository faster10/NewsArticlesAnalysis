Lauder : The idea is it would enable cars to not have to stop if there ' s no one to stop for , and so not stopping saves gas , which means saving pollution and it saves time , and . . . there are lots of law abiding citizens who consistently break the letter of the law by not coming to a full and complete stop . It ' s really unfortunate to have laws that compel one to violate common sense and violate what ' s best for our atmosphere and respect for our wallets . . . . This would help bring the law back into sync with common sense .
