Unless the Clippers can pull off a trade for a power forward upgrade , there really is no internal replacement for an All NBA player like Griffin . If you ' re on the waiver wire looking for someone who might be able to help ease the burden of losing Griffin , someone like Willie Cauley Stein ( 66 percent owned ) or Myles Turner ( 82 percent ) would be your best bets , though they may not be available . Streaming Frank Kaminsky ( 47 percent ) with Cody Zeller is an option , or you might want to hope for a Josh Smith ( 43 percent ) revival in Houston .
