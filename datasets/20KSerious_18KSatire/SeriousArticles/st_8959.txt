Whether the pleasure is a guilty one or not depends on where you stand ( I find it fairly apocalyptic , yet cannot look away ) . But you d have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the spectacle of serial bully Fox News being out bullied by Trump this week . How else to explain a statement issued by Roger Ailes in the small hours of Friday morning , in which the Fox News chairman was forced to claim that something he d previously said about Trump was satire ? that least Foxy of genres ? while hotly denying that he had placed multiple calls to Trump imploring him to attend the debate . There were not multiple calls there were three calls . Oof . That , Roger , is what we call self satire .
