Without acceptance of the whole spectrum of human development , people with disabilities are inevitably excluded from society . Given that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the autism prevalence in the United States to be 1 in 88 ( and more recent studies suggest that figure may be as high as 1 in 50 ) , business owners are going to have to become better educated about how to serve individuals with special needs . Not only are they their customers , as in the case of the young Grayson , but people with autism are entitled to the same access to public spaces afforded all other Americans .
