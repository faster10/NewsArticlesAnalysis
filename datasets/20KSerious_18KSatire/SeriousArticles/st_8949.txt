Seth Green : I don ' t know that I ' ve had too much of a personal connection . I ' ve met autistic people and I ' ve seen the different ways Hollywood has portrayed them over the years . " The Story of Luke " is based on an amalgam of characters that ( writer director ) Alonso Mayo met . He wanted to tell a story from the inside of a character who was unaware of something that ' s different about them . Luke knows he ' s special because he ' s told he ' s special but he doesn ' t understand that there ' s limitations to what he can aspire towards . My character is the opposite of that . He ' s someone on the autistic spectrum who ' s consistently been told that he ' s only there to serve as guilt and empathy for anyone that ' s neurologically typical . So he ' s become bitter and isolated .
