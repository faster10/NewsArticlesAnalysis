The hotel is still in its soft opening period , but the levels of service and attention to detail are already impressive , which they will need to be . The Nile Hilton had a loyal following of Cairenes , ex pats and regular foreign visitors , many of whom will regret the loss of room balconies and the increase in room rates . But they will be cheered that some of the best features of the original building have been retained , including a hieroglyph mosaic across the front and back of the fa ? ade , a central staircase on which many newly weds had their portraits taken and a magnificent 50m outdoor pool . Many of the old staff are there too , retrained into Ritz Carlton s sharper service levels , but with the same old Egyptian warmth in their greeting : one of them told me how proud he was to see the old place looking so good .
