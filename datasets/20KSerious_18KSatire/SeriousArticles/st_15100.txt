Anderson : I kinda think probably the adult and the children at least in this new story are on parallel tracks . They ' re not going the same direction , but they ' re all having these romantic relationships that they ' re trying to find a way to make work and rescue themselves through them . The kids are the ones that have a clarity about what they want . They don ' t have any wisdom , but they do have a clear understanding about what they want to have happen . And the adults don ' t . It ends up making them more confused than the kids .
