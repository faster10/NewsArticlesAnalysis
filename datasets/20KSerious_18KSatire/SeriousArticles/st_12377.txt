Donald Cupps , chair of University of Missouri Board of Curators : I was surprised and saddened when I received the news of Gary Pinkel s resignation , especially as he battles for his health . I learned of Gary s health condition and his decision to resign Tuesday evening . Due to the nature of the conversation , the Board wished to respect Gary s wishes and did not divulge this information , in order to allow him to tell his team and staff of the news before the announcement was made . MU s football team has earned tremendous accolades and victories under Gary s leadership . The Board asks that you keep Gary and his family in your thoughts and prayers . ?
