John : Every year at the beginning of the year , we start the year on safari , we go and visit our AIDS projects , and as soon as you go there and see and you have to visit your projects from time to time , wherever they are , whether it ' s in America , South America , West Indies , whatever we go and visit these projects on a regular basis to see the results that we ' re doing , to see if it ' s working , to see if our money ' s being spent the right way , and to come back and feel " yes , we ' re working , its working , so let ' s do more . " When you see something that ' s working , you want to do more . You say , " This is fantastic . "
