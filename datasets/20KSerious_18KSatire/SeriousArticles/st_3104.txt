Way too long for 140 characters , but here ' s the Kobe story Dwyane Wade told me : This was last month , the night before the Heat hosted the Lakers here in Miami . Wade decided to stop by the arena and get in a soak in the cold tub . He goes through the Heat ' s locker room area , back over to the training room , and who is already just sitting there in the tub Kobe Bryant . Wade told me in the 13 years he ' s played for the Heat , he ' s never ever seen Pat Riley let an opposing player into the inner sanctum like that , using the team ' s facilities , and that frankly , he was shocked . Of course , that ' s the respect that Kobe has earned , and the two old friends had a great , long talk . At the end of it , Kobe asked Dwyane if his sons were coming to the game the next night . Dwyane said no , as it was a school night , and Kobe said , ' you know what , bring them , I think it ' s going to be my last time here . ' Dwyane brought the boys , they got a lifetime memory after the game taking pictures with Kobe , and the Wade family got a little sneak preview of Kobe ' s retirement announcement before anyone else .
