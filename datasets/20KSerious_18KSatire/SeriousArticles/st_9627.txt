' I haven ' t worn this thing since 2007 , before I had the children , before my udders tumbled towards my lower ribs and before the abs were nicely coated in cellulite and sagging skin . It ' s over . I tried Pilates at 50 a session with a bully instructor . I ' ve tried the roll on ' instant results ' stomach spreads you have to import from Spain . Jogging gives you ' jogger ' s face ' , that sunken hollow look that may mean you ' ve got a fit body , but hell your face looks like the thing Jack Nicholson groped in room 237 .
