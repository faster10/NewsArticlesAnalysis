Golden State took the third quarter 31 23 in an impressive showing , but that just proved to be prelude to an incredible fourth quarter . Harrison Barnes scored eight of the Warriors ' first 10 points of the period to cut the lead to 96 95 with all of 9 : 48 remaining , at which point a Warriors win seemed a foregone conclusion . Yet the Clippers took advantage of several turnovers ? the Warriors had 19 on the night , with many turning into easy buckets in transition ? and got big shots from Paul and others to make the score 112 102 with just 5 : 02 remaining . The Clippers absorbed a major comeback attempt from the Warriors and seemed to come out on the other side in good shape . That ' s something that teams have not been able to say much over the past 13 months .
