" I have been walking on cloud nine all day , " Gordon said , still giddy more than an hour after his final race , pausing to look over a dirt track race program that a fan had brought to show him . . . and then another hug . " I was so focused on winning the championship that the real meaning of this day probably won ' t hit me for another few days . Or weeks . The competitor in me is still rewinding the race and trying to figure out what we could have done differently . But that won ' t last long . The experience of this day will . I ' ll be rewinding that in my mind for the rest of my life . "
