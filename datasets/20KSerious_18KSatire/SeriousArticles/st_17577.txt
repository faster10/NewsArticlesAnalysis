Finally , of course , Activision isn ' t going to stop actually selling " Guitar Hero " titles any time soon . If you ' re interested in becoming a maestro of the pretend Gibson , you can still pick up the " Guitar Hero " back catalog and buy extra songs online . " Guitar Hero " and " Rock Band " may one day be seen as a classic party game , pulled out of the closet at holidays and special gatherings , the way we play Monopoly or Scrabble today . Maybe it ' s time you introduced Grandma to the plastic guitar .
