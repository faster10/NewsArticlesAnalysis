" You know , you ' ve got to be able to look in the mirror and feel good about the preparation every single day , " Rodgers said Sunday . " You need to think about if you accomplished everything you want to accomplish . If you didn ' t , you take your stuff home , and you look at it . You probably should take your stuff home and look at it anyway . This time of year , I always feel , helps with the preparation because it ' s so cold outside . There ' s not much going on , so you ' ve got no excuses not to get in the iPad , get in your book and get ready to play . "
