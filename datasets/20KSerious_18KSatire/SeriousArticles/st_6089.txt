Chris Stapleton took the stage three times to swoop up trophies for Male Vocalist of the Year , New Artist of the Year and Album of the Year . " I don ' t know what to say . I don ' t know what to think , " he said , appearing surprised by the album win for " Traveller . " Though it was his acceptance speech for Male Vocalist of the Year that really resonated . Sounding on the verge of tears , he opened up about the death of his father and gave a shout out to his wife for pushing him to be the best he could be . " This is an unbelievable thing to me , and I ' m not going to take it lightly , " Stapleton said . Sounds like his fellow country stars won ' t either . Bryan spoke about how much he appreciated all of Stapleton ' s wins Wednesday night . If you didn ' t know Stapleton before Wednesday , you likely will now .
