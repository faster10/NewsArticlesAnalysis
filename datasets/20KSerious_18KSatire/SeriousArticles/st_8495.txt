Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya ' s removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup . The United Nations has condemned Zelaya ' s ouster and does not recognize Micheletti ' s government . While the United States has called Zelaya ' s ouster a coup , it has not formally designated it a " military coup , " which , under U . S . law , would have triggered a cutoff of all non humanitarian aid . Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution .
