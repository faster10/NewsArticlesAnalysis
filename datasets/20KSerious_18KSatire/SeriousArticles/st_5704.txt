Paton Walsh : " ISIS grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar , and then when they ran into Iraq , taking Mosul . Since then , their victories have been incremental . They haven ' t had the huge storming win they need for recruitment the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits . They are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps , but not geographical reach if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying , but not game changers .
