He criticised the Academy for not moving quicker . " The Academy is an institution in which they all say radical and timely change cannot happen quickly . It better happen quickly . The law of this country can change in a matter of months . It better come on . The Oscars is on February 28 . Cheryl needs us to pray that by that date , change is going to come . We need to pray for Cheryl , we need to support Cheryl , we need to love Cheryl . We cannot afford to get bitter , we cannot afford to get negative . But we must make our voice heard . "
