Van Zandt : Usually we start rehearsals two weeks before the first show and kick around some ideas for the set , maybe do six rehearsals , period . Each tour has its own energy , and the writing is the script for the show . It ' s like a Broadway show or a movie . You have to start with the script , and that ' s always a new album for us . We ' ve never been a nostalgia band . Every single time we go out , we ' re saying something new , something that ' s been on Bruce ' s mind in that period . In this case , instead of our usual five or six days , we did 10 or 12 . We probably had 40 horn charts . That ' s a lot of work just to outline the charts , never mind tweak them and really get into the details of arranging , which , of course , I love to do , and Bruce is also really good at .
