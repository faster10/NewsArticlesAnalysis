The movie covers just three years of Robinson ' s life , beginning in 1945 , when he ' s a World War II veteran playing in the Negro Leagues and gets recruited by the forward thinking Dodgers general manager , Branch Rickey , to join his minor league club , the Montreal Royals . As Rickey , a stogie chomping grump with a heart of gold , Harrison Ford seems to have reinvented himself as an actor . He gives an ingeniously stylized cartoon performance , his eyes atwinkle , his mouth a rubbery grin , his voice all wily Southern music , though with that growl of Fordian anger just beneath it . Calling Robinson into his office , he tells him that he needs a player who doesn ' t so much have the guts to fight back as the guts not to fight back . 42 is a rousing tribute to how impossible , and therefore heroic , a stance that was . Grade : B
