" Bihar accounts for 16 out of 244 seats in the upper house . Of these , five seats ( currently held by the JDU ) will be coming up for re election in 2016 , none in 2017 and six in 2018 ( 4 JDU and 2 BJP ) . Therefore , a marginal win or loss for the BJP is unlikely to change its bargaining power in the upper house in a meaningful way . In fact , even if the BJP wins Bihar , it will still have to continue to build consensus on legislative reforms , " say Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf of Nomura in a report .
