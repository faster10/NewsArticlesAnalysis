The Warriors committed 15 of their 23 turnovers in the second half against the Sixers , and Green had five of his seven turnovers during that stretch . Those five turnovers all came on errant passes to teammates , and he attempted just one field goal after the break . He never did end up with that triple double as he finished with 10 points , 13 rebounds and nine assists . However , that final assist of his led to the Barnes 3 pointer that won the game . We often hear players take the blame for a loss , but hearing someone be so specific as to admit he was hunting out a triple double is pretty refreshing .
