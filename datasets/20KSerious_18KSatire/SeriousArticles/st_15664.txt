Durkin ( who produced the chilly " Afterschool " ) does a very clever thing here . He cuts between Martha ' s painfully incremental rehabilitation and recovery at the home rented by her older half sister and her architect husband ( Sarah Paulson and Hugh Dancy ) , and flashbacks to Martha ' s induction to the commune from which we ' ve already seen her escape . But the transitions are hard cuts , and often intentionally disorienting , so we ' re not always immediately sure what ' s past and present .
