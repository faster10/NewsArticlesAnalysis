" This type of back and forth can be very confusing , especially when directed towards someone who has romantic feelings for you , " Henry said . " When in love , we want so desperately for things to work out , for love to prevail over all .

What I think is clear is that Sneiderman led Neuman , consciously or unconsciously , to believe that there was potential for a relationship in the future . "
