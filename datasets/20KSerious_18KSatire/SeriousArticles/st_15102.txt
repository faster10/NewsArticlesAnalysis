Anderson : I feel like I want the movie to happen in a place where the audience has never been before . That ' s sort of a slightly magical world . I started feeling like the movie ought to feel like the girl is carrying around a suitcase full of fantasy books somewhere along the way , I started to feel like the movie should feel like it could be in that suitcase . That it could be one of those books . So everything that goes into the movie where we shot it , the locations , the houses , the sets are all my way of make this world that ' s not a familiar reality .
