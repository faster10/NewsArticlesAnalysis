The man best positioned to do that would be Marco Rubio , who turned in strong , if somewhat overshadowed , performances at the first two primary debates . The problem for the Florida senator , though , is that to date he hasn t really translated that buzz into anything tangible . Despite everything that has broken his way so far , he s still neck and neck with Jeb in the polls and trailing him in the fundraising race . Still , he might be content to ride the Rubio by default narrative for as long as he can ? meaning he could look to play it safe Wednesday night .
