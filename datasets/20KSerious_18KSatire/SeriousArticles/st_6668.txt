The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans , rather than robots . The reasons such efforts drive up the costs include : A human needs a return ticket , while a robot can go one way . Space vehicles for humans must be made safe , while we can risk a bunch of robots without losing sleep . Robots are much easier to feed , experience little trouble when subject to prolonged weightlessness , and are much easier to shield from radiation . And they can do most tasks humans can .
