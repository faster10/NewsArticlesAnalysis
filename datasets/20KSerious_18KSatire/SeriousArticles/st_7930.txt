As you should by now have gathered , nobody has any idea what s going on with the Oscars this year . Brie Larson looks a strong favourite in the best actress race for Room , but Saoirse Ronan is gaining ground fast . Leonardo DiCaprio will probably win best actor for The Revenant . The rest is flux in a gyre ( or whatever it was Yeats said ) . Spotlight is holding a place as favourite in best picture , but few people really think it knockout enough to deserve the award . Might The Revenant take it ? The Martian looks like a rising force ?
