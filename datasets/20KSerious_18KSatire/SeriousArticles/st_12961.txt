The actors cast as Google interns are likable and mildly amusing in a " Revenge of the Nerds " 2013 way . But I wish that at least one of them had been given a major voice , a way of making the tech banter seem hilariously cool . The likeliest candidate would have been Stuart ( Dylan O ' Brien ) , with his sullen stare and open contempt for our heroes , but the character loses his superior edge over time , which is the movie ' s mistake . It ' s up to Nick and Bill to teach these brilliant losers how to live , and what that comes down to is showing them that it ' s fun to let go and do Tequila shots and dance like crazy and hit on people . How rebellious !
