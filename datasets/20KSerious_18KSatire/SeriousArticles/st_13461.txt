Last year , for example , McCullough a spry , gray haired woman who wears tinted glasses that nearly cover her face and an orange jacket bright enough to make onlookers wish they had tinted lenses of their own did a casual Flickr search and noticed that a particular humpback whale , No . 1363 in the official whale catalog , had been spotted by a man who was on vacation in Madagascar . Two years before that photo was taken , the same whale was seen off the coast of Brazil , some 6 , 000 miles away .
