Showrunner Scott Gimple has said we will see Glenn again . " Dear fans of The Walking Dead , " Gimple said in a statement last week . " This is a hard story to tell , and when we were planning to tell it , we know our friends at The Walking Dead would be talking to you about it , and we knew we should say something about it , lest our silence say something we didn ' t mean to say or not say . So I ' ll say this : In some way , we will see Glenn , some version of Glenn , or parts of Glenn again , either in flashback , or in the current story , to help complete the story . " The character wasn ' t included in Talking Dead ' s in memoriam tribute either .
