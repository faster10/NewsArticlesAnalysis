Benedict Albensi of Winnipeg , Manitoba I am an American who lives and works in Winnipeg as a medical professor . I have been flying the American flag in my neighborhood all week as a tribute to those heroes and other victims who lost their lives on 9 11 . Last July here in Winnipeg , someone put a Nazi swastika on my car ' s American flag sticker . So now I fly the U . S . flag a lot more than I used to . It is not trendy to be an American in many foreign countries right now . Living in a foreign country I find myself having to advocate why the USA is still the greatest country in the world . It is a tough sell these days . As Americans we have to let the world know that America has problems but we are not " the " problem .
