I m not sure who decided to stage a Republican presidential debate in the liberal bastion of Boulder , Colorado , and whether it s an amusing coincidence or subtle trolling . Many local residents are , as ? the ? New York Times recently noticed , slightly puzzled and none too pleased about the influx of national Republicans . As a former Boulderite , I can report that a big reason for their discontent is the traditional Republican attitude toward marijuana : This is the party , after all , that christened Just Say No and launched the War on Drugs . ?
