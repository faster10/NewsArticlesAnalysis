Off season hours are limited . Tourist information offices normally stay open year round but have shorter hours in the winter . While most sights stay open through the winter , they typically operate on shorter schedules ( such as 10 a . m . to 5 p . m . rather than 9 a . m . to 7 p . m . ) , with darkness often determining the closing time . Winter sightseeing is fine in big cities , which bustle year round , but it ' s more frustrating in small tourist towns , which often close down entirely . In December many beach resorts are shut up as tight as canned hams .
