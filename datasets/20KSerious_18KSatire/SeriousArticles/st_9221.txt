In his first television role since ( he ' s been continuing a successful stage career ) , Knight plays somewhat against type : George O ' Malley was the bumbling , baby faced surgeon with a nervous smile and horrible luck with women his latest character , Gabriel Thomas from last night ' s " Law Order : Special Victims Unit , " is an alleged ( SPOILER ALERT ! ) " power reassurance serial rapist " with a neck tattoo sure , the tat is of a yin yang symbol but still , a neck tattoo pretty much never screams " nice guy . " Gabriel sure looks like George , but that ' s where the similarities end . Like George , Gabriel ' s into blonds , but only of the submissive variety that would certainly exclude Izzie Stevens .
