Liveris pitched the idea of a merger in 2006 to DuPont ' s then CEO Chad Holliday , but the proposal went nowhere . It came up again during the tenure of Holliday ' s successor , Ellen Kullman . According to current DuPont boss Ed Breen , it was being discussed by the company ' s board when he joined as director in February . Breen said he " seriously " studied the deal over the following months . Then , in October , Kullman stepped down . Breen , the first chief drawn from outside the the founding Du Pont family and the DuPont executive suite , got a call from Liveris on his first day in the top job .
