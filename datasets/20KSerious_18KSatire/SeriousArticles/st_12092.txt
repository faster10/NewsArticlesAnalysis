The activists are right . Deciding who gets a driver ' s license , and what the license looks like , are state matters . The administration needs to back off . If it needs something to do , it can ease up on the deportations . The White House has said that it supports the Senate immigration bill that was passed last year . Yet , since that legislation which doubles the size of the Border Patrol to 40 , 000 agents , builds more border fencing and would only legalize an estimated half of the undocumented population doesn ' t make a real dent , activists should demand better .
