Jolie : Well I came to the region about 6 months ago , I first went to Syria because I work with U . N . H . C . R . and there are 1 . 5 million refugees in Syria alone from Iraq and while I was there , I went inside and met with some internally displaced people . And this trip is to get a better picture of the internally displaced people and to discuss with the local government , with our government , with the NGOs and with local people , the situation and try to understand what is happening , because there are over 2 million internally displaced people and there doesn ' t seem to be a real coherent plan to help them and there ' s lots of good will and lot ' s of discussion but there seem to be a lot of uh just a lot of talk at the moment and a lot of pieces need to be put together . So , trying to figure out what they are .
