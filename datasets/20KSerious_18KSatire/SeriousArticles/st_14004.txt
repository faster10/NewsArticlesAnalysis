The Cardinals will come after Newton early and often with the blitz . That s what they do , and they did it more than any team this season . Arizona will send as many as six or seven defenders at Newton and play man coverage in the secondary . If Newton escapes the pressure but doesn t have anyone open , the Cardinals defensive backs could have their backs to him and leave him room to run . Newton wasn t a factor in the running game last week vs . Seattle because he didn t have to be after the Panthers jumped out to a 31 0 lead . He only scrambled twice last year in a 27 16 , wild card win vs . Arizona . But both scrambles converted third and long situations , with one run extending a TD drive .
