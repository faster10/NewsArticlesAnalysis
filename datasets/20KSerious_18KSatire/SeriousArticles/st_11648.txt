Ford had done well in the first debate , but in the second debate he was asked a question about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe . And he answered it incomprehensibly . There was already a perception , a vulnerability , that he wasn ' t intelligent . And then this thing just got parodied , just got talked about , and became a huge event . When ordinary people watched that debate , they didn ' t feel the Ford had screwed up . But when it was pointed out , that he didn ' t understand what was happening in the Cold War in Eastern Europe , then suddenly they had shifted their minds , and he seemed much worse than it had seemed at that moment .
