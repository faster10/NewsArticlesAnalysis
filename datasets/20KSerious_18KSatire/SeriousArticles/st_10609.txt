It s Kasich s and Bush s newfound positions , though , that prove there are no actual moderates in the GOP field on this topic . I wouldn t say to these people , You can t come in , Kasich told Fox News back in September . I mean , we ve got the Statue of Liberty that says Give us your tired , your poor . He changed his tune this week , writing to President Obama asking him to pull the plug on the resettling effort . Conservative apostasy was always going to be a tough sell in a GOP race , but it s all Kasich has at this point . It s too late for the Ohio governor to rebrand .
