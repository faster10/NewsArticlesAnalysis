" We believe the dash cam video , as well as information that has already been in the media , clearly demonstrates that Officer Clark was doing everything in his power , including the use of strong language , to keep Mr Villalpando at a safe distance until backup arrived and an arrest was safely accomplished , " Sgt . Robert Eberling said in a written statement released Thursday . " Members of the media have also been diligent in reporting some of the possible explanations for Mr Villalpando ' s actions on the night of February 20 , including a previous high speed chase and a prior arrest for DWI , and a fear that he would be deported . Officer Clark had no way of knowing Mr Villalpando ' s nationality at the time the traffic stop was initiated and it may not have been evident on a highway in the late evening . "
