The Washington Post reports on the rally , held in Birmingham on Saturday . The thousands who attended Trump s rally were nearly all white in a city with a black majority . When a fight broke out after activist Mercutio Southall Jr . was heard shouting Black lives matter ! the Republican presidential candidate briefly halted his remarks and demanded the man s removal . The Post says Southall fell to the ground at one point and was surrounded by several white men who appeared to be kicking and punching him . Security officers got him to his feet and led him out of the building , and he was pushed and shoved by people in the crowd , the Post writes . Speaking Sunday on Fox News , Trump said : Maybe he should have been roughed up , because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing . He called Southall a very obnoxious guy , who was a troublemaker who was looking to make trouble .
