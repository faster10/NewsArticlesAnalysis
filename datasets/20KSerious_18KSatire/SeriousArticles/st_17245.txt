We have no way of knowing why anything with a lot of support doesn t get in . ? Compton could have received 2 , 500 votes in the fourth or fifth slot , but if it doesn t have at least 350 first place votes , it gets ignored , says the publicist , citing the Academy s preferential ballot system , which puts greater emphasis on first place votes . I don t think the Academy needs to have its motives addressed , ? but the weighted balloting system may need to be reconsidered . There isn t a doubt in my mind that Compton got a lot of votes . The very fact that all the guilds voted for the film ? proves that . There just weren t enough first or second place votes to get it over the hump .
