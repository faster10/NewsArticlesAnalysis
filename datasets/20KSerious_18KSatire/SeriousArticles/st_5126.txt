The death of Robert " LaVoy " Finicum , the 54 year old Arizona rancher who headed north to liberate an Oregon wildlife refuge from the United States government , is sad and pitiful . Some of the self appointed vigilantes who are challenging the right of federal authorities to manage Western rangelands and resources appear to be the type of imbecilic , right wing blowhards that can be found at the end of the bar in saloons from Pensacola to Stockton . Finicum , on the other hand , seemed deeply deluded but decent , an American intent on doing his patriotic duty who had allowed himself to be misled by really bad information and a barrage of lies .
