The U . S . economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession . The unemployment rate , which peaked at 10 in October 2009 , declined to 5 in October of this year . At that level , the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC participants most recent estimates of its longer run normal level . 1 The economy has created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010 , and total nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4 ? million higher than just prior to the recession . Most recently , after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth , employers added an estimated 271 , 000 jobs in October . This increase brought the average monthly gain since June to about 195 , 000 ? close to the monthly pace of around 210 , 000 in the first half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the labor market .
