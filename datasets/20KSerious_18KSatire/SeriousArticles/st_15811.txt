No , Rubio doesn t have any skeletons in his closet of the same variety Ben Carson claims . ? If he ? did , it ? would surely have been a major redemption theme in his oft repeated story of his humble beginnings . ( If Carson s popularity is any guide , it could only have helped him if he admitted to once attempting a drive by shooting . ) Actually , Rubio s youthful errors are far more damning , at least as far as Republican base voters are concerned : He was a member of the Gang of Eight , a group of Senators so villainous that they actually got together and hammered out a Comprehensive Immigration reform bill , which included ? dare I even say it ? a path to citizenship for undocumented workers .
