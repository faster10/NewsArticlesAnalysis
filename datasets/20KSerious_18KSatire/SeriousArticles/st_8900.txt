If Dave was having trouble convincing Siemens of his brilliance , it was only a foretaste of the stick he will face from some of his backbenchers . In the past six months , Jeremy Corbyn has often seemed somewhat behind the Westminster curve today he was well ahead of it . Labour will quite happily sign up for anything the prime minister can get from the EU as a large majority of the party want to remain in it , but there was no harm in stirring up trouble by tabling an urgent question that he knew Cameron would not be in town to answer . Having gone through the necessary contrived outrage of the prime minister making himself unaccountable to performance ? there s been so much of it going on among his cabinet ministers of late , there must be a virus going round ? Corbyn was happy to sit down and let the Tories self destruct .
