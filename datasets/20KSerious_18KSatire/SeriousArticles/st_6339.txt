Don t tell me , It matters because it speaks to his honesty . Honesty does matter , but the way you figure out whether a president will be honest about the things he does as president is to see what he s saying about the things he d do as president . When he was a candidate , we learned that Bill Clinton had affairs and covered them up , and what did that teach us ? That as president , he d have an affair and cover it up ? not that he d lie about other things . George W . Bush presented himself as brimming with personal integrity , all while telling one lie after another about his record in Texas and the the policies he was proposing ( while the press was poring over his opponent s every word with Talmudic care to see if they could catch him in a misstatement ) . Lo and behold , as president he was faithful to his wife , but deceived the country about all kinds of important policy matters .
