Pfizer , like most large corporations , has already proven adept at lowering the taxes it actually pays out . Its effective tax rate during the first nine months of 2015 was 23 . 4 , according to its most recent earnings report . In the merger announcement Pfizer said that its tax rate would fall to 17 18 in the first full year after the transaction closes . If Pfizer can get that rate down to 15 by 2017 , it will save 2 . 1 billion in taxes that year , according to analysts estimates cited by the New York Times .
