The Iowa Republican caucuses are over , and the media and the GOP establishment have announced the winner : Sen . Marco Rubio . That s an odd verdict , since Rubio came in third , trailing Sen . Ted Cruz and Donald Trump . But Rubio gets the plaudits for several reasons . He did better than expected , finishing close to Trump . Rubio also gives the media a three man race , which makes the election more suspenseful and exciting . He gives party leaders an option they find more palatable . And he validates what pundits expected all along : that Trump would fade , that Cruz is too harsh , and that in the end , the GOP would turn to a more electable nominee .
