They ' ve been roughly a top 10 offense and a bottom 10 defense over the last half dozen games ? a more muted version of the all O no D Thunder we saw after 2015 ' s All Star break , during which Durant scarcely saw action due to his foot woes while Westbrook put up insane numbers and carried the club to the brink of a playoff berth . The feeling ' s been tough to shake , as we watch a KD and Russ centered offense ( now , just Russ centered ) with limited complementary contributions , questions about the wing rotation , uninspiring defense and late game calls execution . . . haven ' t we seen this movie before ? What ' s Billy Donovan doing differently from Scott Brooks , again ? Why doesn ' t this collection of talent ? even with Durant sidelined ? look better and more potent ? These are familiar questions , and given ? the astronomical stakes of this season , the answers must come quickly .
