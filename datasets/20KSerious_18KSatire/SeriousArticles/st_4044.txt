Though casting can make or break a movie , the job is often overlooked certainly by moviegoers , who may not be aware of the long process it takes to find the right actors for the right roles , and even by the movie business itself . Indeed , the casting director ' s film credit is " casting by " because the Directors Guild of America long prevented anyone else from being called a " director " on a movie . ( The rule has been relaxed for cinematographers , often called " directors of photography , " and art directors . )
