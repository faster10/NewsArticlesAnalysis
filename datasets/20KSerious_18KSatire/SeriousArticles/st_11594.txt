" A provincial minister in the resolution is demanding for a judicial commission rather he should have announced that a judicial commission has been formed , " he maintained , saying that blaming ' politics ' was a double game , which should end .

" If it was a conspiracy then it is also the Sindh government ' s responsibility to investigate the killings and expose the conspirators , " he said .
