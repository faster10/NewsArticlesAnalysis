For those who somehow missed the recent " Walking Dead " episode and the social media hurricane that followed , Sunday ' s episode , " Thank You , " found Nicholas and Glenn stuck on a dumpster between about the 100th chainlink fence they ' ve encountered and a herd of walkers . Then Nicholas mutters , " Thank you , " before shooting himself and taking Glenn into the zombie herd with him . There , everyone ' s favorite pizza boy appears to get his intestines ripped out . ( Sorry , everyone , your next pizza might be a little delayed . )
