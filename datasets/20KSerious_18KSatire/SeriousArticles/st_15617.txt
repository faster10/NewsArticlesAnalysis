Our little white house , on the edge of a mile wide tornado , was hammered by flying 2 by 4s , stripped of its shingles but , somehow , still standing when we returned from New Orleans . My wife , Dianne , cried when she saw it , and cried more as she looked down our street . A third of the houses were destroyed . Others will be torn down . The trees that gave this place its name were gone or splintered . In our yard , a single , ancient dogwood survived , my wife ' s pride , a reminder of what this used to be .
