The franchise started out as a prehistoric , slapstick spin on the old John Ford western , " Three Godfathers , " with a woolly mammoth , a sloth and a sabre toothed tiger ( Manny , Sid and Diego , voiced by Ray Romano , John Leguizamo and Denis Leary ) delivering an orphaned human baby to safety . It has evolved or maybe " devolved " into a scrappy string of antic adventures interspersed with sitcom style character notes , all pegged to whatever novelty the writing team can contrive in place of a plot .
