Of the three websites , Twitter discussion data came closest to mirroring the actual outcome of the caucuses . Twitter was the only platform where the most discussed candidates from both parties prior to the caucus were the eventual winners ? Clinton and Cruz . ? Facebook and Google data both indicated higher interest in Sanders and Trump . ? But social media chatter can only measure one swath of the population ? those with regular access to the internet and computers or smartphones , often those who are younger digital natives , and those who are passionate enough about candidates to regularly post about them on social media . It s also important to note that the data released doesn t measure or account for sentiment ( negative conversations about a candidate , for example , likely wouldn t translate to an in person vote ) . ?
