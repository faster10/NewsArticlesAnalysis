Allen Hurns vs . Colts : Hurns missed Week 13 after suffering a rather serious concussion at the end of the Week 12 loss to the Chargers . It left him hospitalized and out of practice last week . Hurns was cleared to return on Monday this week and will be active Sunday against the Colts . Indianapolis has been terrible against the pass all season . Only four teams have allowed more yards to opposing receivers , and only five have surrendered more touchdowns . It s unclear if No . 1 CB Vontae Davis will shadow Allen Robinson , but either way , Hurns should run the bulk of his routes at LCB Greg Toler and slot CB Darius Butler . Toler missed the Week 4 matchup between these two teams , but has long been abused by opposing quarterbacks . In that previous matchup with the Colts , Hurns saw a season high 14 targets , catching 11 for 116 yards and one touchdown . He should be reinserted into lineups immediately .
