Darren Fletcher said the midweek go karting trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message to fans . ' We didn ' t want to show the world we doing it and we didn ' t want the fans to see us trying to do stuff like that straight after losing to Villa . We gave ourselves a little lift , it was just for us as the lads . They were down , it was hard to lose two games to Villa , especially the Cup game . I think it worked quite well so maybe we ' ll go karting again next week . '
