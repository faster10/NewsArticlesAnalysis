What we will get today is a document from Donald Tusk , president of the European Council , setting out draft proposals for discussion at the EU summit on Thursday 18 and Friday 19 February . It is expected to be between 15 to 20 pages long , and it should be quite technical . It will be up to EU leaders to negotiate the final package , and some details may change , but Tusk would not be publishing this plan if he did not think it was a basis for consensus and the eventual outcome is likely to be very similar to what gets published today .
