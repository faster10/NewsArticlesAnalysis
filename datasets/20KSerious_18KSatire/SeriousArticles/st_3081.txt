On this particular point , Jeremy Corbyn is right . 3 , 000 people is " not very many " . What he didn ' t say was what happens next . When the next 3 , 000 people go to Calais , and the 3 , 000 after that , and the 3 , 000 after that , do you keep welcoming them into the country because 3 , 000 people is " not very many " ? Angela Merkel thought she might get half a million refugees and migrants . Germany has an aging population and it can probably cope with half a million refugees and migrants . Last year , 1 . 2 million people arrived in her country . They are still pouring in to her country . Some of them , of course , are escaping war . But only a fifth of the people who tried to claim asylum in Europe last year are from Syria . The vast majority are not trying to escape a war , and the vast majority are young men .
