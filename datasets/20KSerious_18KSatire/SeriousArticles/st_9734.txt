This is a civil war that never ends . Interventions from major powers are aimed not at victory ? the contours of which are unimaginable ? but at improving the relative position of their clients at a negotiating table . Indeed , the U . S . and Russia deliberately deceived their own people about their aims in intervening , or who they are even fighting . None of the intervening powers seem to have a clear idea of what kind of end state they can achieve , or what they would be willing to do to achieve it .
