Current state : There s been a bit of a pattern to the teams that have been able to beat the Patriots , at least offensively . It starts with being able to run the football . In the four losses , the Dolphins ( 96 yards ) , Jets ( 143 yards ) , Eagles ( 128 yards ) , and Broncos ( 179 yards ) all had effective running games , which helped set up the pass . As a whole , the Pats haven t been too bad against the run ( 9th overall ) , but those four troublesome games have all come during the past month and a half .
