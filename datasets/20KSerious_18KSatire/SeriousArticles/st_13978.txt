Woodley , through the delicate power of her acting , does something compelling : She shows you what a prickly , fearful , yet daring personality looks like when it ' s nestled deep within the kind of modest , bookish girl who shouldn ' t even like gym class . Tris chooses to become part of Dauntless not because she has any special athletic skill but because it ' s her nature to go for broke . The first half of " Divergent " is a lean , exciting basic training thriller , with Tris willing herself to do things like jump aboard speeding trains and fight with her bare knuckles . Woodley , at every turn , lets us feel as if we ' re in her shoes , not so much Dauntless as thrillingly daunted .
