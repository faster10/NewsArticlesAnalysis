Andrews ran the ball surprisingly well against the Jaguars , picking up 58 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries . This was important because , before last week , he hadn t really impressed against a strong run defense all year . The Jaguars are still ninth in rush defense DVOA , but the Jets are first . As encouraging as Andrews s Week 13 performance was , he s still just a mid range RB3 on Sunday . Green Beckham again flashed what makes him a potential No . 1 receiver in the future , but he s still just a low end WR3 in the present day . His readiness , the overall offensive environment in Tennessee and the up and down nature of the offense help keep his ceiling restricted . He should get plenty of volume , though .
