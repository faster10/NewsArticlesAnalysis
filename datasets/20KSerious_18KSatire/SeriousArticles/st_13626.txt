I just have to be honest . I look at Trump as a genuine outsider , as somebody who doesn t do anything by the book in politics , he said . And yesterday he did two things by the book that , frankly , surprised me . One is accepting an endorsement . I did not see Sarah s speech , but I saw sound bites of it . And I saw Trump standing aside while she was at the podium , and he s not the kind of guy that stands aside . He just isn t . He ' s that dominant . He is that huge to give up the podium even to somebody endorsing him , sponsoring him . I m not criticizing it . Don t anybody misunderstand . I m just telling you what I think here . Do with it what you want .
