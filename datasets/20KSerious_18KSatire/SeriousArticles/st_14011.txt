Doctors have been taught in the past that the cancer usually appeared first in spots on the legs and that the disease took a slow course of up to 10 years . But these recent cases have shown that it appears in one or more violet colored spots anywhere on the body . The spots generally do not itch or cause other symptoms , often can be mistaken for bruises , sometimes appear as lumps and can turn brown after a period of time . The cancer often causes swollen lymph glands , and then kills by spreading throughout the body .
