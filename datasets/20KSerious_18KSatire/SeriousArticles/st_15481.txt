Disney successfully played up the dynamic between Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) and Loki ( Avengers breakout Tom Hiddleston ) in marketing , and as a result , the movie gave the studio its best ever November opening ahead of The Incredibles , which grossed 70 . 5 million on opening weekend . It had the ninth best November start overall behind three Twilight films , four Harry Potter films , and Skyfall , which grossed 88 . 4 million on this weekend last year . It ' s too early to tell where The Dark World will finish domestically , though it should be able to reach 200 million if it plays like Thor , which ultimately earned 181 million .
