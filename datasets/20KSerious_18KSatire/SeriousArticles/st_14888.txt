" A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving " is not the most popular entry in the beloved animated franchise ( both " A Charlie Brown Christmas " and It ' s the " Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown " deliver bigger numbers ) . Yet the program still managed to hold its own against CBS ' " Survivor " and Fox ' s " The X Factor " ( in fact , the special edged out Factor in total viewers , see below ) . Plus , " A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving " delivered its biggest audience in four years " 8 . 1 million viewers and a 2 . 2 rating in the adult demo , up 22 percent from last year . Pretty spry for a 39 year old repeat , huh ?
