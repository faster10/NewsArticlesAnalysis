The Geneva III process will last for six months , until next summer , and a meeting will take place in Vienna on February 11 to assess results by the Friends of Syria Alliance . This is the second round of talks between warring Syrian factions , the first also being in Geneva in January 2014 . Deep divisions still prevail , as the government delegation insisting that it waging a war against terrorist groups like the Jabhat Al Nusra and Daesh . Moscow backs this argument fully , claiming that all sides need to concentrate on combating terror with the Syrian army and Al Assad . The maximum concession it is willing to give is usher members of the opposition into the Syrian government , and for them to take part in parliamentary elections next May . The Russians have used their considerable influence into talking the Americans into accepting Al Assad s survival as a de facto reality , arguing that he can remain in office if he wins in any upcoming , internationally monitored elections . For its part , the Saudi backed Syrian opposition insists that he must leave immediately , despite the fact that his army managed to turn the tide and started regaining lost territory since the Russian Air Force joined the Syrian battle last September . The UN s top diplomat on Syria Yacoub Al Hillou said prior to the talks : The suffering is immense Syrians are losing hope that the world cares . We hope the world does care and we will come to Geneva to talk people , not politics . Enough is enough . Syrians can no longer continue to pay the price for political failure .
