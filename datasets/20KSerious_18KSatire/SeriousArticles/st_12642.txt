That is not to say that Trump has not been useful in breaking taboos that should have been broken long ago . If the voter is alert , some useful information does trickle out of the existent political swamp . Trump has rightly pooh poohed Jeb Bush ' s previously unquestionable claim that his brother , George W . , " kept us safe . " Trump has usefully noted that the most catastrophic terror attacks in world history by a small group happened on W ' s watch . What Trump did not say , but what is probably even more damning , is that the 9 11 commission , which investigated the matter thoroughly , concluded that the attacks were probably preventable , given all of the intelligence warnings the Bush administration had received beforehand .
