Clinton just gave her stump speech . That s all . No mention of her performance before the Benghazi committee no new policies or ideas no mention of her opponents . If you ve heard Clinton at any event in the past six months , you heard her at the Jefferson Jackson Dinner . She was the only candidate to say black lives matter , and she pledged to fight for a country where there are no ceilings for anyone and where a father can tell his daughter , You can be anything you want to be , including the president of the United States of America .
