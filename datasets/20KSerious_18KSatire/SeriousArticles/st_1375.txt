A : Our mission is pretty straightforward . It is to support the president ' s agenda and it is to support Democratic candidates up and down the ticket in 2013 and 2014 . I think we are well positioned to do that . We ' re doing it on a bunch of different levels , with the communications shop providing communications assistance , but also at the organizing level , helping state parties do the same . So we ' re just going to be very aggressive on both those fronts and there ' s a lot of work to do on both those fronts .
