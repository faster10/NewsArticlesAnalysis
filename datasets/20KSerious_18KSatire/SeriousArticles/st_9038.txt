I kept worrying that Jennifer Hudson ' s " before weight " hologram from the Weight Watchers commercials would creep into the frame and try to duet with her on " Think Like a Man , " but luckily Ne Yo did instead . Does anyone not love Ne Yo ? I kept obsessing over this during their performance filled with push and pull flirting and plenty of sass appeal . I think he is universally adored . I even ended up marveling that the " design " on his white t shirt was just a big black rectangle . That ' s genius , I thought , genuinely . Ne Yo ' s gotta have it , Ryan !
