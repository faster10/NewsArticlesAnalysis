Lee and co writer Kevin Willmott ( he made the brilliant mockumentary CSA : Confederate States of America , in which the South wins the Civil War and slavery continues into the media age ) are perhaps declaring war on too many things at once : On an economy rigged against the poor , the mass incarceration of young men of color , a government held in thrall by the National Rifle Association , a failed educational system and the complacency and self delusion of the black community itself . But I say what the hell . Those things are eminently worth attacking , and if Chi Raq is a messy and imperfect work of agitprop cinema , it also reduced me to tears at least twice , made me laugh a bunch of times and had the entire audience ? at a critics screening ? whooping and hollering along with the congregation during a fire breathing sermon delivered by John Cusack .
