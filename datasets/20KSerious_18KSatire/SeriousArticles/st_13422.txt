If you re an Alabama fan , did your heart skip a beat when Jason Smith did his best impersonation of the Prayer at Jordan Hare on Saturday ? Admit it , when he bobbled and tipped the pass to himself and ran into the end zone for a touchdown , you got scared . Auburn was a two touchdown underdog against Alabama , and the Tigers made it a one possession game in the fourth quarter . So why can t that happen again ? If Alabama s offense continues to struggle in the red zone and settle for field goals , that leaves the door open for Florida . After all , is Treon Harris really worse than Jeremy Johnson ? Florida s top running back , Kelvin Taylor , isn t anything to sneeze at . If there s an injury or a fluke play , Florida could make the game interesting . If it s a one possession game in the fourth quarter , the Gators would at least have a puncher s chance .
