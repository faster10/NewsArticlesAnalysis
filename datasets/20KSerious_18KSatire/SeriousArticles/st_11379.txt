Just about every Lebanese restaurant in Beirut serves a different dish of the day at lunchtime , usually something deliciously humble that reminds many patrons of their mother ' s cooking . Recurring hits include kibbeh a national specialty made with lamb , bulgur wheat , onions and pine nuts baked into a savory pie or into meatballs soaked in minty yogurt sauce or any of a variety of slow cooked stews known as yakhnes , served over vermicelli laced rice with garlicky bits of lamb and braised vegetables topped with homemade yogurt .
