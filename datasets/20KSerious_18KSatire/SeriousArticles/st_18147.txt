One ' s view of this matter should not turn on whether one is for big or small government . The question is how to get the incentives right . Take the EPA ' s reckless pollution of the Animas River in Colorado last summer . A private company would face a substantial fine . Not the EPA . In the words of Thomas Sansonetti , who formerly ran the Justice Department ' s environment and natural resources division , " The government doesn ' t fine itself . " Given that the EPA has a smaller incentive than a private company to act with due care , it ' s small wonder that activists are questioning the agency ' s insistence that the river is clean again . If the EPA is wrong , it pays no penalty .
