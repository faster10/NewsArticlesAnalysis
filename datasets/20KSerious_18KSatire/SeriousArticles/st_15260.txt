A man who wants you to find him worthy of being your president a man who thinks you should put your very life in his stubby fingered hands is awake hours before dawn , sloshing around in the sewers of his mind , so utterly incapable of acknowledging the humiliation of his preternaturally gloated over public loss that he finally lands on the only thing he can live with : it didn ' t happen . It didn ' t happen , okay ? He ' s not a loser , he didn ' t lose , it was stolen . Stolen . Ted Cruz , who looks like they weren ' t too careful with the forceps when they pulled him out , he looks like Joe McCarthy mixed with a comedy mask mixed with a tragedy mask Ted Cruz stole the election . Everybody hates Cruz . Everybody loves Trump . How else could this have happened ?
