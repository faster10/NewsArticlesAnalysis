Let me be clear : I , like the vast majority of my countrymen , reject terrorism . All of us were repulsed by footage of the gruesome al Qaeda attack on a Defence Ministry hospital that left dozens dead in December . We agree that our fight against extremist groups cannot be won without a variety of efforts , including robust law enforcement . But U . S . drone strikes are exacerbating our problem by leaving families bereaved and entire villages terrified . Drones destroy the fabric of Yemeni society . Wronged and angry men are just the sort extreme groups like al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula find easiest to recruit .
