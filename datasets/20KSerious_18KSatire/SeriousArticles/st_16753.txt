In both Ball ' s and Peston ' s cases , many of the stories that they had been notified about did not seem to fall into categories covered by the Google Spain ruling : old , irrelevant stories about people who were not public figures . Ball ' s stories included pieces from 2010 and 2011 scarcely old while Peston ' s covered critical events in the banking world in 2007 the ousting of banker Stan O ' Neal from Merrill Lynch something that cannot be described as irrelevant or not in the public interest .
