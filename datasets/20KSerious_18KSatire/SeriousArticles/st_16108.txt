What right wingers on TV whose undies are bundled over Black Lives Matter actually want , of course , is not black political engagement with the causes or consequences of violent crime in the black community . They don t want that at all . They want black unconditional surrender . They would like to hear African Americans or their community leaders not merely excuse whatever police do in the black community as justified , but also agree that the prevalence of drugs and gangs and criminal activity in black neighborhoods results entirely from some mysterious , imagined deficit or dysfunction in black culture that has also produced hip hop music and distressingly baggy pants .
