It is good that an extra ? 2bn a year , approximately , will be on tap for the care of a growing population of the elderly , too many of whom are kept in hospital unnecessarily because there would be no support for them at home . But the manner in which this money is being raised , through an increase of up to 2 per cent in council taxes , is chaotic and does not allow for local variations . The consultants iMPOWER have calculated that in Richmond and Rutland , the sums available for adult social care could rise by almost 5 per cent , but in Liverpool and Newcastle , it will be less than 2 per cent . ?
