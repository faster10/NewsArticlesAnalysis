While that ' s all true , the other thing that drove it was I originally wanted to tell this story back in 2008 . It would have been " Sandman ' s " 20th anniversary . For various reasons , DC ( Comics ) couldn ' t make it happen . So when ( DC Comics president ) Diane Nelson came in , she asked is there anything you want to do ? And I said I ' d really love to do the story for " Sandman ' s " 25th anniversary . It seems huge and a great thing to mark . And she said , ' What a great idea ! " And we set out to do it .
