It ' s tempting to ignore North Korea ' s antics as bluster , as empty threats . But Pyongyang has launched deadly attacks . For example , in 2010 , it bombed a South Korean island about 70 miles from Seoul , killing four people . It may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a South Korean navy ship , killing 46 . In 2013 , the North detonated a nuclear device and brazenly threatened to launch a " pre emptive nuclear attack " against the U . S . A fourth nuclear test could be imminent .
