Clinton and her allies have long noted that Sanders voted for a loophole that would have allowed individuals to purchase guns within one day of starting the buying process , regardless of the status of a background check ? a measure that s been tied to Charleston since Dylann Roof took advantage of the final version to buy the gun used in the June shooting .
