Ultimately , a candidate has to be himself . Bush has said that he does not want to win a primary at the expense of the general election , meaning he is not willing to jettison his views just to be the GOP nominee . At some level , the same must be true of his personal appeal . He ? did ? say he wanted to run with joy in his heart . That does not mean suddenly becoming an attack dog , willing to go for the jugular . No , if Bush recovers , it will be because he is a sharper , looser , tougher version of himself . Allies and friends say he hates to lose he needs then to show some competitive spirit .
