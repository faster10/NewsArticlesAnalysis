Also , the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination . Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder , but given the nearly 30 , 000 police departments spread across the country , this is woefully inadequate .

But the 12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance .
