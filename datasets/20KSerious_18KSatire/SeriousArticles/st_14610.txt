Kuriyama : The two seconds that I forgot that were black that just said , " Whoops I forgot . " I learned from those mistakes , those two mistakes are painful to see on screen but those two mistakes basically led to me never forgetting to do this ever again because I can remember how I felt in this moment and that ' s what this project is about . This project is about looking back on the days where I made a mistake or I did something wrong or I feel regret and learning from them and I found that without a project like this that I ' ll not learn from mistakes because I ' ll so easily forget them .
