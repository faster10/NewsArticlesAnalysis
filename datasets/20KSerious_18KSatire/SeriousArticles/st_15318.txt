Hamburg : It ' s focused new attention and concern on counterfeit drugs . We feel at the FDA that we ' re doing a very good job working with companies , with law enforcement and the health care community , but there ' s more that still needs to be done . I ' m very eager to work with Congress . They ' re considering some legislation that would give the FDA stronger authority and stiffen the rules around counterfeit drugs , and make it easier for us to really track drugs in the system , and enable us to quickly pull inadequate drugs .
