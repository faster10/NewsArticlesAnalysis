LeSean McCoy is running like himself again now that his hamstring is healthy , and he has 35 carries for 224 yards and one touchdown in the last two games . Karlos Williams has added 16 carries for 134 yards and two scores in the same stretch , and Taylor , of course , is a threat to run . But don t look now , as the Patriots have been on fire with their ground defense , which is ranked second in the NFL ( 88 . 2 yards per game ) and has only surrendered 1 more total yard than the top ranked Jets . The Patriots last four opponents have averaged 55 . 3 yards per game , and they haven t allowed 100 yards since Week 6 against the Colts . The Bills absolutely need to run the ball to have a chance .
