It is hard to imagine either one of these men winning the presidency . Donald Trump is a nativist and xenophobe . He has risen to the top ranks of GOP contenders by making a series of ever more outrageous promises . He will expel eleven million undocumented aliens and build a wall on the Southern border . He will make Mexico pay for that wall . He will at least temporarily halt the travel of Muslims to the United States . Each of these promises is offensive . Taken in their entirety , they are not so much a political platform as a cry for a racially , religiously , and ethnically purer United States . It is a disgusting platform , in other words , that is wholly unbefitting of an American leader .
