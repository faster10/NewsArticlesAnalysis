Kaka , a fellow Brazilian , says : Neymar has improved a lot since he s gone to play in Europe . His game is a lot more mature . Now it s a matter of time until he reaches first place in the world order . It had always been a rotation . Ronaldo and Zidane won it three times . But there was always some other player ? names like Figo , Ronaldinho , myself , Rivaldo , Cannavaro . Then comes this succession of Cristiano and Messi , only the two of them . And it s fair , for what they have been doing year after year .
