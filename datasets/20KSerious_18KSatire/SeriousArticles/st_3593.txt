I ve spent a lot of my life writing about the United States and Iran , and I never imagined ? and never wanted ? to become a part of the story , particularly at such an extraordinary moment . I want to get back to writing the U . S . Iran story at some point in the future . But I won t be saying anything further for awhile . I hope everyone will respect my need for privacy as I take some time for myself and for my family . For now , I want to catch up with what s been going on in the world , watch a Warriors game or two , and see the Star Wars movie .
