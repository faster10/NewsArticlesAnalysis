Through their Conservation Land Trust and Conservacion Patagonica organizations , the Tompkins have purchased approximately 900 , 000 hectares in Argentina and Chile , spending 275 million dollars of their own money in the process . They have already helped establish two national parks in the wind swept Patagonia region : Argentina ' s Monte Leon National Park and Chile ' s Corcovado National Park . They are hard at work on several other ambitious projects , including the Esteros del Ibera , which the Tompkins hope to one day turn into Argentina ' s largest national park .
