King is an influential voice in Iowa politics who was courted by many conservative Republicans including Bobby Jindal , Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee , ABC ' s JOSH HASKELL and JESSICA HOPPER note . He said he made his decision Friday following a foreign trip to Europe where " I saw the erosion of the culture . . . because of the colossal cultural suicide they ' re committing . " King was asked why he decided not to endorse either of the two Republican frontrunners , Ben Carson or Donald Trump , whose beliefs align with his . " It ' s going to be harder for either one of them to see what ' s going on in Washington , D . C . , in K street , in the network , " King said . " What ' s going on in the House and Senate and how does that get leveraged from the executive branch . I don ' t hear either one of them talking about the balance of powers between the executive , the legislative and the judicial branches of government . And I don ' t hear them talking about Supreme Court appointments . " http : abcn . ws 1YdzW1z
