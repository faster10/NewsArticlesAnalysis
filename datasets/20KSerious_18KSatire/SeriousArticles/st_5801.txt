Without it , Brobson says he has to spend every minute managing his diabetes . " I have to be my own pancreas 24 hours a day . Last thing at night , first thing in the morning and often in the middle of the night . When the artificial pancreas took over , that was a real power moment . It kept me perfect from 8 p . m . to 8 a . m .
