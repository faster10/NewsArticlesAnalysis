The more liberals ? focus on savior figures and less on learning to save ourselves , like the BLM movement does , the less effective we ll be . Clinton has shown , repeatedly , that she s open to change and pressure from liberal activists to move to the left . ? We don t want to turn into the Republicans , who are tearing themselves apart right now because the conservative base can t understand why they don t get everything they want just because they screamed loudly for it . Liberals need to refocus ? our efforts on organizing and lobbying and away from hoping that one dramatic gesture like electing Sanders will save us all .
