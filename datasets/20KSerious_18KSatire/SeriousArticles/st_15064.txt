This is a book that ' s highly recommended by Dr James Hansen by the way the world ' s foremost climate scientist among a great many others . For those techno freaks who want to dig even deeper , I suggest reading " Plentiful Energy , " a remarkable book by the scientists who developed the IFR . Both of these books are excellent and chock full of amazing information . Lyman might want to read them too , rather than deriving his information from the Internet , which is all he seems to have done .
