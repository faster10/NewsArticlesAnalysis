This is not the first time a U . S . drone has killed civilians in al Baitha province . On September 2 , 2012 , a U . S . drone hit a minibus near Radda , according to Yemeni officials . This time the vehicle was full of villagers carrying their day ' s shopping . As usual the initial press coverage labelled the dead as " al Qaeda militants , " but when the relatives threatened to deliver the bodies to the President ' s gates , the Yemeni government was forced to concede that all 12 people killed were civilians . Among the victims were a pregnant woman and three children .
