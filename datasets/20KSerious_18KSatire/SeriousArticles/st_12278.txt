But there was no denying that the emotional incidents of the past couple of days still weigh heavily on Murray . When things like that happen , it does put things in perspective .

Speaking for the first time about his bedside vigil at a Melbourne hospital to keep an eye on Sears , he said , It was just making sure that Nigel was OK . It wasn t that straightforward , what happened after the match . You get a bunch of tests and stuff done .
