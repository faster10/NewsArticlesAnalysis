U . S . firepower against ISIS since the American attacks began in August 2014 have been more of a desert drizzle than a Desert Storm , according to retired Air Force lieutenant general David Deptula , who ran the Air Force s targeting campaign during that 1991 conflict with Iraq . Through the end of October , U . S . Central Command figures show , the U . S . and its allies have dropped 28 , 578 weapons ? 67 a day ? on ISIS targets . I ve always been skeptical of the claim that airpower alone can solve such problems , but to be fair , airpower isn t getting a fair trial , says Ralph Peters , a retired Army lieutenant colonel and military expert . This isn t an air campaign ? it s a political campaign that burns a lot of jet fuel .
