PEV : I think they are very positive right now . I am very encouraged by the 6 point plan that I presented to Ambassador Bogdanov Special envoy to the Middle East , Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov in Paris , who I met along with his deputy . Three days after I left Paris , by the way , Putin called Assad to Moscow . Now that s the first time in 5 years . And then three or four days later ? in the first meeting in Vienna and the subsequent meeting being scheduled now ? so I think my 6 point plan presented to the Russians is being taken very well and it seems to be a positive movement . So I hope we can have an impact on solving those two situations , but I made it very clear that nothing s going to happen positively in Syria until Assad is removed and a new interim government is put in .
