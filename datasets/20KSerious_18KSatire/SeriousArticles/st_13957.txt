Quarterback : ? The hope for the Cowboys was that Matt Cassel would look more comfortable his second time around as the starter for the Cowboys . Unfortunately , that dream didn t come true Monday night . For most of the game he looked very uncomfortable in the pocket and missed many makeable throws . Thankfully for the Cowboys , he was able to make a few downfield throws , including a 42 yard deep ball to Dez Bryant in the fourth quarter to set up the game tying field goal . Cassel finished 16 29 for 222 yards . ?
