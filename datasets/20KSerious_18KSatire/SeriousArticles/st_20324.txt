HB : In the West , every team is great , from top to bottom . You see that not only in the regular season , but in the playoffs . Last season we played the eighth seed in the first round , but New Orleans is a great team . Yes , we beat them 4 ? 0 . But they pushed us , they challenged us every night . Memphis , Houston , yes , we won those series . But even Cleveland , yes , we won , but it s tough . It s not fair to say just San Antonio is a rival , or just ? OKC is a rival . No , every team in the West is a rival . On any given night , anything can happen .
