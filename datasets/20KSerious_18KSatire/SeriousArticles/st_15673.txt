Then there is the inconvenient fact that we ' re not supposed to even need this kind of policy change because , according to Obama , his administration isn ' t deporting DREAM ' ers at all instead , it ' s concentrating its enforcement efforts on criminals . That ' s exactly what Obama told Univision anchor Jorge Ramos during a March 2011 trip to El Salvador . A couple of weeks later , Obama had to swallow those words when during an education town hall meeting in Washington , sponsored by Univision he was confronted by a DREAM ' er holding deportation papers . So now we ' re supposed to applaud the administration for not deporting people the president had claimed weren ' t being deported in the first place .
