Cameron s party also wants language specifying that the EU s stated goal of an ever closer union does not apply to Britain . Tusk met him halfway , agreeing to affirm that Britain is not committed to further political integration into the European Union . Cameron wants national parliaments to have more power to block EU legislation . The EU offer would allow them to veto particular EU laws if more than half of the union s parliaments are opposed . Actually putting that into practice would require Britain to forge alliances with other EU member states , something it was having some trouble doing even before this latest demand for special treatment .
