African Catholic faithful should be given the freedom and equipped to search for paths to inter cultural , inter faith , inter ethnic , and inter denominational dialogue , to weave a workable web of understanding and partnership for poverty eradication , promotion of human rights especially for minorities , good governance and the common good . A renewed and transformed Catholicism could become a strong cultural and spiritual influence in Africa ' s continuing search for answers to the challenges of poverty , diseases , ethnic and religious conflicts , wars , political and economic problems , radical Islamic fundamentalism , and how to mitigate the effects of climate change , and natural disasters . This means that churches in Africa can become strong social capitals whose values lie not simply in providing spiritual support , but also in strengthening the civil society , creating healthy networks among people and valorizing the agency of Africans to safe guard basic human security and cosmic flourishing . But above all , Africa ' s emerging voice in World Catholicism will act as a counter weight to the secularizing and dechristianizing currents from the West , while proving to be once again the new homeland for Christ , where the fullness of the Gospel message in all its complexities and beauty can continue to resound as a force for good .
