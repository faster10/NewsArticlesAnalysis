It is worth thinking about what the decision to cancel marches and protests ? means in real , as well as symbolic , terms . Climate change is a moral crisis because every time governments of wealthy nations fail to ? act , it sends a message that we in the global north are putting our immediate comfort and economic security ahead of the suffering and survival of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on Earth . The decision to ban the most important spaces where the voices of climate impacted people would have been heard is a dramatic expression of this profoundly unethical abuse of power : once again , a wealthy western country is putting security for elites ahead of the interests of those fighting for survival . Once again , the message is : ? our security is non negotiable , yours is up for grabs .
