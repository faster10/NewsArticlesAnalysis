When the terrorist is a crank or is unsuccessful , we care less . When the terror happens to Iraqis or Syrians or others far from us , we care less . When the terror is not perpetrated by an individual but is perhaps the result of the actions or inactions of a company , a government body , a special interest group or nature , our concern does not approach the level it does when there is a bad guy , a foreign connection , an experience that recalls earlier terror experiences ( no matter how tenuous ) .
