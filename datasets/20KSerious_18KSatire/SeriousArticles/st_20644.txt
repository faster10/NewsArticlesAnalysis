Alright , if previous songs on ANTI conjure up images of Chris Brown , this one straight up screams it . With imagery like fist fighting with fire and It beats me black and blue , but it me so good , Love On The Brain is the darkest spot on the album despite its shimmering 50 s school dance backing beat . It s really a wild juxtaposition . You love when I fall apart , so you can put me back together and throw me against the wall she sings . Maybe it s brave and vocalization for those that have been in similar situations , but at first glance it certainly feels like an excuse for returning to the worst of spots . Love is never an excuse to justify violence from any side .
