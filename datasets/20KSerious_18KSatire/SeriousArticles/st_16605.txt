Many of the country s more than 1 million ethnic Rohingya who are effectively stateless are denied the right to vote . The Rohingya and other Muslims have been marginalized by the government and targeted by militant Buddhists . The country has faced armed ethnic insurgencies for decades . While the government has sponsored peace talks , only eight militant groups signed a cease fire agreement this month . Seven others that were part of the talks , including the two largest groups , refused to sign a final accord . Sporadic violence , particularly near porous border areas , has sparked tensions with China and India . The next government will face the task of trying to bring other armed ethnic groups into the mainstream fold .
