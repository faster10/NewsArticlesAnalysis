But I am also fully aware that there are a ? lot of substandard public schools . But part of the reason for that is that policymakers and local politicians will not fund schools in poor areas that take care of poor children to the level that they need to be . And you can get me going on this . I mean , the corridor of shame right here in South Carolina , you get on there and you can see schools that are literally falling apart . I ve been in some of those schools . I have seen the terrible physical conditions . That is an outrage . It is a rebuke to who we are as Americans to send any child to a school that you wouldn t send your own child to .
