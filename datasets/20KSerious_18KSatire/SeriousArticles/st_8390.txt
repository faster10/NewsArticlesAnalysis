JumpJet , a private jet service that launched last October , is hoping to bring the price of bookings down even further , so they ' re on par with first and business class commercial flights . The company is still in the process of gathering members and plans to launch its first flights in May . Like JetSuite , JumpJet is a membership program , with plans starting at 2 , 350 per month ( these include 10 U . S . domestic round trip flights of up to 3 . 5 hours ) . Unlike JetSuites , JumpJet doesn ' t own any planes . Rather , they purchase charters and allow members to divide the cost .
