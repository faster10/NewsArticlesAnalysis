Our program is successful because diverse groups support our work . We are proud to have thousands of individuals donate their time and energy to spread awareness of our mission . They have volunteered at service projects and invested in our program . We are equally proud of the companies like Goldman Sachs , Boeing , and Target that make financial investments to fund our fellowships , and bring their employees out to service events across the country . Together , these groups make us stronger . We need their strength , because there is still much work to be done .
