A New York judge has upheld the state attorney general ' s injunction barring the operation of daily sports fantasy sites , including DraftKings and FanDuel . The decision is a major setback for the websites , which garner over 12 percent of their players from New York state . Much of the case involved the debate over if gambling on fantasy sites is a competition of chance or skill . " I place my bet , pick my team , and watch television . Chance pervades daily fantasy sports , " lawyer Kathleen McGee argued on the behalf of the state . The judge ' s decision does not constitute a final ruling on the legality of daily fantasy sports lawyers for DraftKings and FanDuel said they plan to appeal .
