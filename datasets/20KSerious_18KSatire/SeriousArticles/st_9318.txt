He invented an electrode that detects the neural signals in the speech motor area of Ramsey ' s brain . In December 2004 , the electrode was implanted , and Kennedy , along with four independent labs , began decoding the signals in Ramsey ' s brain . The researchers asked him to think of specific vowel sounds , then mapped his brain activity . By knowing what his brain looked like when he thought each specific sound , scientists could translate the activity into a language that a voice synthesizer could read .
