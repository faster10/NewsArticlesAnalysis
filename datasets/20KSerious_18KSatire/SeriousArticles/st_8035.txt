Anyone who thinks any of the above constitutes a spoiler is not the audience for the phenomenon of the " Taken " oeuvre , a pair of icy eyed movies laid over a gooey core of aspirational family bonding . In these films , by sheer dint of will , strategic career planning , and physical training sessions suited to his now 60 year old chassis , Neeson sets himself the goal of becoming a Harrison Ford like action hero . And this he does : He ' s sturdy , solid , efficient , opaque , and wears a black leather jacket well . Ta da . He ' s an action hero . ( Seems like a waste of a career arc to me , but guess who ' s the millionaire ? )
