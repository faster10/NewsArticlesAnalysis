Prosecutors on Monday charged a University of Missouri professor , Melissa Click , with a misdemeanor assault charge stemming from her actions at a campus protest in November . Click , an assistant professor in the communications department , was videotaped telling a student journalist to leave , and calling for " some muscle " to kick him out of a section of campus where students were protesting the treatment of African Americans by the school ' s administration . Click is accused of making physical contact with the student she was berating . Editor ' s note : An earlier version of the story misidentified Click as a journalism professor . She is a professor at the University of Missouri department of communication . We regret the error .
