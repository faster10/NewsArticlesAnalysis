We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good paying job . The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start , and together , we ve increased early childhood education , lifted high school graduation rates to new highs , and boosted graduates in fields like engineering . In the coming years , we should build on that progress , by providing Pre K for all , offering every student the hands on computer science and math classes that make them job ready on day one , and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids .
