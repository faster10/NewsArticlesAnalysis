Olivia Pope ' s character in the TV series " Scandal " spoke quite unapologetically for today ' s woman when she said : " I could probably give all this up , and live in a country house and have babies and be normal . I could . But I don ' t want to . I ' m not built for it . I don ' t want normal and easy . . . and simple . I want . . . painful , difficult . . . devastating . . . life changing . . . extraordinary love . "
