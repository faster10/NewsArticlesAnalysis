The kickers are fairly even . The Texans Nick Novak was signed in September to replace Randy Bullock , who missed an extra point in the first half in the Texans first game against the Chiefs . Novak has converted 86 percent of his field goals since , which is slightly higher than the percentage of Chiefs kicker Cairo Santos . Both kickers have failed to convert two extra points , but Santos has a superior touchback percentage ( 44 . 4 to 37 . 1 ) . The Chiefs had the edge at punter , where Dustin Colquitt has dropped 37 punts inside the 20 while Shane Lechler has only dropped 24 in 20 more attempts . The return units are about equal , as the kick and punt return averages are similar . The Chiefs De Anthony Thomas had a big day against the Texans as a punt returner in the season opener , averaging 16 yards on five attempts , but it remains to be seen if his replacement , Frankie Hammond can do the same against Houston . Houston has a slight edge in kick return average allowed ( 24 . 4 to 24 . 7 ) , but the Chiefs have a bigger in punt return average allowed ( 6 . 5 to 10 . 2 ) . The Chiefs , in the end , have the slightest of edges overall .
