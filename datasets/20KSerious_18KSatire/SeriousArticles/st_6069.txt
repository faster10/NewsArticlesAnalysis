Netaji s grandnephew and Trinamool Congress MP Sugata Bose , meanwhile , claimed these files were not very important . It is a complete misnomer . Of course any files pertaining to Netaji should be in the public forum but these are not very important . The actual material relating to Netaji have been compiled painstakingly for 50 years and have been kept at the museum at Netaji Bhavan in Kolkata where there is a steady flow of interested youth . These comprise letters , pictures , voice records and film footages among others , he said .
