There is already strong political and social opposition in PNG to resettling refugees in what is still a vastly undeveloped country . Given PNG ' s hitherto absent role in accepting refugees , many in the country express concern about an imminent " culture clash " in the event of a refugee influx , while many have openly hostile attitudes towards Muslim immigrants who would comprise the majority of Australia bound asylum seekers . This will only restrict the numbers of refugees that PNG would in reality accept , increasing the chances that they will be resettled in Australia .
