The argument goes like this : A basic feature of global warming is that we expect the poles to warm more than the lower latitudes . Indeed , the North Pole is observed to be warming faster than anywhere else , melting sea ice . ( This much is indisputable . ) Since our cold snaps are just deliveries of polar air , we might expect them to get less cold . Most of the time they do , hence long term warming . But because the overall midlatitude temperature contrast has weakened , the jet stream weakens with it . The weakened jet , the argument goes , starts to wobble and meander even more than before . The deliveries of cold air can come faster , or from farther north , than they used to on these bigger meanders . This can overcompensate , at times , for the overall warming .
