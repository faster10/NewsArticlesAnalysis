Driven by nearly all Republican legislatures ( Rhode Island , which has a Democratic controlled legislature , is the lone exception ) , last year 34 states introduced voter ID laws with similar requirements , creating barriers for the 11 of voting age Americans who lack state issued photo IDs . These laws disproportionately affect minorities , the poor , senior citizens and the young . Of the more than 21 million Americans without the newly required photo identification , 25 are African American , 15 earn less than 35 , 000 a year , 18 are 65 or older , and 20 are 18 to 29 . Not so coincidentally , these groups turned out in huge numbers , largely voting Democratic , in 2008 .
