The Bible said that while good men slept , evil ones came and planted tare , a noxious weed , among the wheat ! The tare of a hate filled church image is a tactical distraction planted to divert our attention from choosing our next president . Let ' s get back to listening for leadership strategies from our best and brightest before there is no country left to lead . My hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process , sounding the alarm that warns : America , please wake up out of our sleep ! E mail to a friend
