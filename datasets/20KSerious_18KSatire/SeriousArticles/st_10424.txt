Unsurprisingly , Americans can get offended by statues depicting naked people , too . In 2004 , a garden center in Tennessee covered up a number of classical style nude statues with what the Associated Press described as " two piece crimson velvet sarongs " after complaints from the public ( the center later said that the newly clad statues were helping sales ) . In 2002 , the U . S . Justice Department was reported to have spent 8 , 000 on curtains to hide a number of nude statues from photo ops , only to have them removed in 2005 . There were calls , ultimately unheeded , to clothe two nude statues outside the entrance of the LA Coliseum ahead of the 1996 Olympic games .
