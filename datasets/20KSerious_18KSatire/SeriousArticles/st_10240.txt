Will Trump go after Carson ? So Bush vs . Rubio ( again ! ) is one of tonight ' s storylines . Another is that Donald Trump is likely to come after Ben Carson . In fact , Trump previewed his line of attack on " Meet the Press " last Sunday . " Well , I feel badly for Ben . I ' ve gotten to like Ben . And it ' s a tough thing . I mean , he writes a book where he went after his mother , hit her on the head , or wanted to hit her on the head with a hammer . Hitting a friend in the face with a lock , with a padlock , hard in the face , stabbing somebody , only to be broken up by a belt buckle , " Trump said . " And when he writes that he has pathological disease in a book , now he obviously wrote this book prior to thinking about running for office , I assume . But he said he has pathological disease . " Our prediction : Trump senses weakness , and he ' s going for it .
