One final point to make : A lot of people OVERREACTED to yesterday ' s news that 10 Americans were captured by the Iranians . As NBC ' s Jim Miklaszewski reported this morning , those Americans are back at the U . S . Navy base in Bahrain , and the Iranians said they saw no evidence of espionage . The Obama administration and its allies are arguing that five years ago before the Iran deal this would have been a much more complicated showdown between the U . S . and Iran . And it ' s hard to disagree with that assessment . Yesterday was a reminder of how campaign season can take a minor diplomatic flare up and escalate it rhetorically to , well , ridiculous heights . Perhaps folks should take a deep breath and wait for facts to support their rhetoric .
