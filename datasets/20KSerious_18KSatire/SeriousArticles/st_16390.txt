A : I think John Lennon was surprised because it had been said in a casual way to a journalist who was a personal friend of his and he had no idea it would cause that sort of controversy . When it did happen he was actually quite frightened because they were about to go off on tour and there were these threats to their lives and a clairvoyant made some predictions that their plane would crash . It was really quite frightening and they wanted to cancel the tour but they knew they couldn ' t . They were under obligation to the tour promoters . And when he made his apology in Chicago , ( the band ' s ) press officer told me that John was actually in tears before he went in to make the apology .
