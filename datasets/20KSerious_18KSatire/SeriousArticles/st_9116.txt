5 . Luke Falk , Washington State : Right now , our thoughts are with Falk after the scary injury he suffered he had to be carted off during the Cougars ' 27 3 win over Colorado . We hope that he ' s healthy and can make a quick and safe recovery to the field . The Pac 12 ' s most prolific passer was good again before he went down on Saturday , finishing 27 of 35 for 199 yards and a touchdown . He essentially secured another Washington State victory by the time of his exit . The Cougars have eight of those now in this resurgent season .
