Doesn t Jerry the Owner realize that Jerry the GM signed a washout quarterback ( from Cleveland no less ) to be the backup quarterback , then proclaimed him to throw the prettiest ball ever , then cut him for losing a bunch of games , and now thinks he should have traded earlier for the same guy who has lost the last handful of games , under the premise that somehow he wouldn t have lost those games if he had been with the team just a little bit earlier ? How is this not insane ? This almost makes me feel bad for Cowboy fans . Almost .
