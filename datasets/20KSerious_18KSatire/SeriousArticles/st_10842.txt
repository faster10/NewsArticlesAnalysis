She continued her answer reminding the audience why Sanders would be a poor choice compared to her . She said , " You can ' t say , oh , OK , don ' t bother me now , I ' ll deal with that later . You have got to immediately be able to switch gears . You ' ve got to do all aspects of the job . " Sanders supporters imagine a presidency where he can work on the issues of equality and fairness while all other issues wait on the sidelines , but that isn ' t the world we live in . Clinton made it clear that nobody has the experience to switch gears and manage a crisis , while also simultaneously managing scandals , negotiations , and policy matters on a range of domestic and foreign policy issues like she can . If Hillary were you abuela , you should be pretty confident right about now .
