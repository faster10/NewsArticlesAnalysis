Review of Clinton emails to take 'several months': U.S. official
A review of Hillary Clinton's personal emails while she was secretary of state will take several months, a senior State Department official said on Thursday, a day after Clinton tweeted that she wanted the emails released to the public."The review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set," the official told Reuters.
