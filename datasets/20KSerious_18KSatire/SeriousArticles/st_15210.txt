For star Colin Farrell , whose career held such promise in the early 2000s , Total Recall is the latest in a long line of box office misfires . With the exception of Horrible Bosses ( in which Farrell appeared in a supporting role ) , every wide release he has led since 2004 s Alexander has sputtered financially .
