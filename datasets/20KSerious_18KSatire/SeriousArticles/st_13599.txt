Of course , Hispanics themselves have the greatest power to determine their destiny . We have to make better choices and stop being a cheap date for the political parties . We have to put the United States , and our community , before our allegiance to any political party . Most Hispanics are registered Democrats , but this goes for Hispanic Republicans , too . We have to elect better leaders and hold them accountable . We have to be as hard on our friends as we are on our enemies . We have to reflect now and then on what road we ' re on , and change course if necessary . And we have to stop squabbling with one another , and make our community safe for diverse opinions that stray from the established narrative .
