New England at Denver : Well , this is it . I took New England to win the Super Bowl before the season , haven ' t picked against them all year , and think a healthy Gronkowski and Edelman make them an awfully tough team to beat . Remember , for as much success as Denver had against the Patriots the first time the two teams played , neither Julian Edelman nor Danny Amendola suited up for the game . All that understood , and yet I find myself leaning toward Denver on Sunday . Manning isn ' t what he once was . But this version the one we saw last week may be good enough to win this weekend . With the turnovers kept to a minimum , Manning found a way to take a back seat to the defense and let Wade Phillips ' unit control the game . This isn ' t a Gary Kubiak over Bill Belichick pick , and it ' s not a Manning over Brady . It ' s a Wade Phillips pick . I ' m taking the Broncos , the home field and a No . 1 ranked defense that has had all the answers all season long .
