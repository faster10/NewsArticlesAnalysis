The White House said it would " reassess " the relationship between the United States and Israel . The broad relationship includes security cooperation , financial assistance , and strong diplomatic ties . Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections . But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U . N . Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel . Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations .
