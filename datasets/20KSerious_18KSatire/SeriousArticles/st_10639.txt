Furthermore , Ben Roethlisberger has not played as well as it may seem down the stretch . He has thrown six interceptions to just six touchdowns in his last four games . The Steelers beat the Bengals in Cincy in Week 14 , but Roethlisberger could not find the end zone and their three touchdowns came on two runs by DeAngelo Williams ( who is currently hampered by an ankle injury ) and an interception returned by William Gay . This adds up to a much tougher challenge for the Steelers than you may think , and ultimately , a monkey off the back moment for Marvin Lewis and the Bengals .
