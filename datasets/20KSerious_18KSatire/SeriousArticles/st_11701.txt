Donald Trump is hosting Saturday Night Live this week , and love him or hate him , you have to admit he s the only candidate who will actually do it well . SNL s present cast is excellent , and Trump has hosted before . Watching any of those other painfully banal candidates attempt to deliver punch lines would be excruciating at best . That s not to say he has a limitless sense of humor about himself . When Seth Meyers was beautifully mocking him at the White House Correspondents Dinner , Trump looked like he was watching ISIS videos in an IMAX 3 D Theater .
