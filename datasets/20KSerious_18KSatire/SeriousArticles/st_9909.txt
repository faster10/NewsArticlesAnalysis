5 . ' Cleopatra ' ( Joseph Mankiewicz , 1963 ) The historical epic starring Elizabeth Taylor , Rex Harrison and Richard Burton nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox . Shooting dragged on for years , with production being halted several times due to Taylor ' s illnesses . At one point , she nearly died after catching pneumonia and had to undergo an emergency tracheotomy . The movie had its fair share of scandal too , thanks to the affair Taylor and Burton started during filming . By the time the movie was finally finished , it had a new director ( Joseph Mankiewicz signed on after Rouben Mamoulian resigned ) , was over schedule and way over budget . Some estimates put the final cost at 60 million , making it one of the most expensive movies ever made if translated into today ' s dollars .
