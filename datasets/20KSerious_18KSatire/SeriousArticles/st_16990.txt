Individual biblical texts should not be appealed to selectively : Such cherry picking is all too easy because of the nature of the Bible as a multi authored book . Rather , as with another formative text , the Constitution , one needs first to understand it historically what did its words mean when they were written and then attempt to determine what its underlying values are , not just what it says in a specific passage . Only in this sense can the Bible be considered to have timeless relevance that transcends the historical particularities of its authors .
