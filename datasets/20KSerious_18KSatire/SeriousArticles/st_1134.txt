Peter Ford : His case was very unconvincing . He put forward , I would call , a deceitful sort of strategy ? a strategy trompe l ' oeil designed to deceive the eye . This is what that strategy is . For example , he claimed that the Syrian opposition forces could put 70 , 000 men in the field against IS and he gave the impression the most of these were under the command of the so called Free Syrian Army . This is straight forward deceit . I choose my words carefully ? the FSA is a laughable front organization for jihadists . It can only itself put about 5 , 000 men in the field . The idea that this would be the cornerstone of a boots on the ground force to drive out IS and accompanying airstrikes is laughable . ?
