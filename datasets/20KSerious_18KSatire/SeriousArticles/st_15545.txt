On a neutral field , Kansas City would be favored by a touchdown , as the Chiefs played a tougher schedule this year and won two more games than the Texans did . Overall , Kansas City also has a better offense defense balance than Houston does . Finally , the Chiefs remember 2013 : They had that game almost in the bag , and they let it get away from them . That motivation alone is enough to carry Smith and his K . C . teammates to the win on Saturday , and then maybe Smith will start getting the recognition he deserves for his postseason prowess .
