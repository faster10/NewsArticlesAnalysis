It just gets nuttier , and more delightful , from there . Fans will recognize in jokes , such as Mulder leaning against a graveyard tombstone for Kim Manners ( who directed scads of " X Files " episodes ) Tyler Labine and Nicole Parker reprising their " War of the Coprophages " roles as stoners a reference to the " Clyde Bruckman ' s Final Repose " moment where Bruckman reassures Scully that she doesn ' t die ( as she tells Mulder , knowingly , in tonight ' s episode , " I ' m immortal " ) Scully saying a dog in an animal shelter " kinda reminds me of Queequeg " ( Scully ' s late , lamented pet ) and a fleeting shot of Mulder lying in a motel bed wearing his famed Red Speedo .
