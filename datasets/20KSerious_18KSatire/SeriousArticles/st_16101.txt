LC : I think we have a good margin . We re not really confident , but we re going to do very well in New Hampshire . First of all , it s much more straightforward : you show up , you line briefly , you go in , you vote . It s minutes , as opposed to average commitment of two hours in Iowa , and in many cases it was 4 or 5 hours in Iowa , or you wouldn t get counted . So , it s much more straightforward , and much higher percentage of people will vote . We believe we have a good lead that cuts across all demographics , working people , men , women , people of color , particularly the young we have enormous advantage . . .
