Washington Redskins : The Redskins have more than injuries to worry about when it comes to the run game . Running back Alfred Morris left Sunday ' s game in the first quarter after aggravating a rib injury he said after the game that he was " good " and it ' s uncertain if he ' ll miss any time . Still , the nagging aspect is a concern . So , too , is the fact that backup Matt Jones has now fumbled four times this season . If Morris remains banged up , it ' s hard to trust Jones at this point but the Redskins don ' t have much of a choice . John Keim
