The stakes are high . In Paris , the very terms of the global climate agreement will change . Instead of requiring countries to cut emission based on their contribution to creating the problem , each country can decide how much it will cut . Furthermore , all countries are required to take action , not just the countries , which are responsible for the bulk of emissions in the atmosphere . In this way , the firewall , which differentiated between the developed world responsible for climate change and the countries , which needed right to development , will be removed . In this way , equity and differentiation will be erased .
