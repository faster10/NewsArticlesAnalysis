Very soon , it will come to a fork in the road . Numbers are very important in a democratic society , and OWS is beginning to have numbers that have caused some establishment members they are railing against to take notice , either positively or negatively . Right now , the Zuccotti Park protesters are being used by those establishment folks , one way or the other , to shore up their own bases and spruce up their own images . Those numbers will only translate into power , and then change , if they can be harnessed to raise the heat on the decision makers to get them to do something they would otherwise not do . That translates , alas , into joining the system they are protesting against , by taking a page out of the tea party ' s book and working in campaigns , raising money , and running for office .
