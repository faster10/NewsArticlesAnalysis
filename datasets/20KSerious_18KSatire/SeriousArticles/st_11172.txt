Seniors have experienced higher inflation because they spend a greater share of their incomes on out of pocket medical expenses , and health costs have risen faster than overall inflation in recent decades . An index that specifically tracks the cost of living of seniors has risen roughly 0 . 2 percentage points faster per year than the CPI W . Though this may not sound like much , the difference would amount to roughly 1000 more in annual benefits after 20 years if the COLA was tied to the price index for the elderly , as proposed by Democratic Rep . Ted Deutch of Florida .
