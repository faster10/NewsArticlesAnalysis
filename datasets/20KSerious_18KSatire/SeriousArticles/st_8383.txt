Mandery : " There is something different about the death penalty . It ' s not surprising during this four year interim period that each of these justices with the exception of ( conservative William ) Rehnquist , who doesn ' t seem troubled at all by this each has their antenna up . It ' s not like a tax case . But I don ' t think it ' s categorically different than Roe ( abortion rights ) or the civil rights cases . I just think we don ' t know all the behind the scenes stories because these are very hard to write . But I got incredibly lucky . I had a moment in history when the archives were available to me , as were many of the key players that I interviewed . All agreed there was definitely at the time tremendous frustration with how Chief Justice Burger was managing the cases . His colleagues had little respect for him .
