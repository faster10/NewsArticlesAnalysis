According to multiple Rubio allies recently briefed on campaign strategy , the senator s team has settled on an unconventional path to winning the GOP primary contest . The strategy , dubbed 3 2 1 by some who have been briefed on it , forecasts a sequence in which Rubio takes third place in Iowa on February 1 , finishes second in New Hampshire on February 9 , and wins South Carolina on February 20 . From there , Rubio would be well positioned in the long haul to win a plurality of voters , and ultimately a majority of delegates , in a three way contest against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .
