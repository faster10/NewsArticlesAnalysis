Bernie Sanders is more than just a presidential candidate he is the face of a wave of indignation from within every race , religion and ethnicity . He represents Americans who are tired of an establishment that is perpetually willing to sacrifice their futures at the altar of vested interests . Who reject a dispensation that cannot put aside party loyalty to legislate for the common good . Who are shocked and horrified by the war machine that one administration after another has kept feeding . Who believe that true liberalism does not merely raise slogans of liberty and equality but ensures that these rights are truly made inalienable .
