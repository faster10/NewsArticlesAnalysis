Dougie Hamilton has not lit it up since he started donning a Calgary Flames uniform in the summer . Hamilton got off to a slow start and did not look comfortable in the Calgary system , but he appears to be turning things around and has been joining the Calgary attack regularly . Hamilton has only scored three goals and six assists to this point in the season , but his opportunities are coming much more frequently . The Flames are streaking at home , and we expect Hamilton to be a difference maker against the New York Rangers on Saturday night .
