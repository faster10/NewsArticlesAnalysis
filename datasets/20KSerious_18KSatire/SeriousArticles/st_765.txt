U . S . President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have been warning Russia about costs and punishments , if it does not withdraw its troops back to the Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol . The White House has been saying that economic sanctions against Russia are in the making and that all military programs between the two countries are on hold . Other suggested punishments being looked at include boycotting the G8 summits in Sochi in June and even banning Russia altogether from this gathering , which , incidentally , has been losing its relevance in the past decade or so . I mean , who is going to treat seriously the supposed group of the biggest industrial nations if it doesn ' t include China and India but has Canada and Italy in it , no offence to these two great nations .
