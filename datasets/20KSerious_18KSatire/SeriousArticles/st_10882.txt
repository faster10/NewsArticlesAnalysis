I am on a State Visit to India for the second time and I am very proud to be the Chief Guest of the Republic Day . The Indo French relationship is based on shared values : freedom , democracy , progress . A French contingent will march along Indian forces on Rajpath . This is historic . The 35th Infantry was created in 1604 . These last weeks , it took part in a counter terrorism exercise with the Indian Army in Rajasthan . I would like to add that it also fought in India against the troops of the East India Company in the 1780s along with the troops of the ruler of Mysore . I received Prime Minister Modi in Paris , less than a year ago . We have established a relationship of trust .
