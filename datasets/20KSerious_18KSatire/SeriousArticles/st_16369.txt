" Indians usually cook their red meat with water in a pressure cooker . So the meat does not come in direct contact with fire and therefore there is much less chance of charring as is the case with the more western technique of braising or barbequing meat , " Chennai based dietician Dharnini Krishnan said . " Proteins as a rule of thumb should not be charred , " she said . " In India , red meat consumption is more of a cardiovascular issue than a carcinogenic problem because of the high levels of cholesterol and fats in red meat . "
