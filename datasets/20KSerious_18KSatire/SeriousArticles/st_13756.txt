Let s start here : Ken Griffey is the best player I have ever seen , in person , particularly as it pertains to the 15 or 16 years I spent covering Major League Baseball , officially from 1994 2009 ( or so ) . In my estimation , Griffey was ? and is ? the perfect player , a brilliant combination of speed , power , defense , smarts , instinct , arm strength and natural , uncorrupted ability . Other guys have put up better numbers in various aspects of the game , but there has never , ever been anybody who excelled in so many facets of the game and who looked so perfectly natural doing it .
