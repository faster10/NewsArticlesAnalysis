I became a " born again " Christian when I attended a Young Life camp in high school . My home life wasn ' t exactly going swimmingly , and this group really embraced me . I loved the Christian notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex . I opened my arms to Jesus and fully embraced Christian morals and principles . I decided that I was going to be " that good girl " and go on to do great things .
