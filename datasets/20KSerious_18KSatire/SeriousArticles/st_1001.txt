Carson gets a pass for his truth stretching for yet another reason : He ' s practically coined an industry out of spouting outrageous and outlandish quips , cracks , and inane statements about anything and everything that comes in his head .

It ' s entertaining and makes crackling good copy in a political season when Carson , Trump , Carly Fiorina , and to some extent Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders liven up what typically stacks up as drab political contests .
