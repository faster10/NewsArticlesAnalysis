It was while he was bunkered in America that Bowie began getting into trouble for predicting the emergence of a Hitleresque figure who would scythe through the mess and impose tyranny . I believe very strongly in fascism , he blathered , to his lasting regret . Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars . He couldn t have known that in a feverish corner of the British elite , powerful men such as the SAS founder David Stirling , were talking about giving Britain a dose of what Pinochet had brought to Chile . Historians tend to identify 1975 as the nadir of 70s paranoia and gloom ( writing at the time , Martin Amis thought that everything seemed ready for the terminal lurch ) and that was when Bowie recorded Station to Station ( released in 1976 ) , in which he scrabbled for a way out of the psychological pit he had dug for himself while fretting , It s too late . This is the Bowie ( and the America ) we find so bleakly riveting in The Man Who Fell to Earth . A man who was all too convincing as a bewildered alien .
