French magazine Charlie Hebdo will mark the anniversary of an Islamist attack on its Paris offices with an edition in that includes an armed guy representing God on the duvet . The gunmen , Said and Cherif Kouachi , were self declared Islamic terrorists who sought retribution for cartoons that the magazine had published featuring the prophet Muhammad . The character depicted on the run is wearing blood stained clothing and a triangular hat with an eye in the middle . As many as one million copies will go on sale in France .
