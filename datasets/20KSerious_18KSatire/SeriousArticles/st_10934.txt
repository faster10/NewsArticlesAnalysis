Remember , this was supposed to be the game in which Brady returned from his suspension . Every athlete wants to be out there playing all the time . And , despite 500 yards passing and eight touchdowns being a bit outside the realm of reality , it would not be a surprise to see Brady put up career numbers against a Colts team that has struggled at teams this season . You re aware , perhaps ? That was the 45 7 Pats win that kicked off the Deflategate debacle that took years off the lives of even neutral parties . I m not saying 100 percent for sure , but I think there s a strong likelihood he s a go .
