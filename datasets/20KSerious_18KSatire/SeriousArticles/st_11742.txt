There was something else about Palin : She looked like Tina Fey , once the " Weekend Update " anchor and head writer for " Saturday Night Live , " now the star of the smart " 30 Rock . " Fey went back on her old show and had great success parodying Palin , driving " SNL " to some of its highest ratings in years . ( Palin also looked like " King of the Hill ' s " Peggy Hill , but unlike Fey , the animated character wasn ' t a Second City trained comedy performer who could strike in real time . )
