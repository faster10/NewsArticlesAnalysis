" When I look at the people I ' ve admired over the years , the ultimate stars , like Frank Sinatra , Cary Grant and Astaire , the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency , whose naturalness is part of their excitement . And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there , the ones you believe in and the ones you remember , like Chanel and Armani , are the ones that stand for something . Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality . And it ' s an image that can change , that can evolve . It doesn ' t reinvent itself every two years . "
