Maria , my partner of 12 years , was losing her health benefits . We needed to add her to my family plan by June 1 and it was already May 31 . We have a 7 year old daughter . You don ' t mess with this stuff . So we left our child at elementary school , grabbed two Mamas at drop off to serve as witnesses , and hopped a cab to City Hall . The Mama crew produced white frosted cupcakes to mark the occasion . I worried about making it to work . Maria looked like she was there to get a tooth extracted . It ' s hard to get jazzed about this stuff when you are rushing to only getting half married .
