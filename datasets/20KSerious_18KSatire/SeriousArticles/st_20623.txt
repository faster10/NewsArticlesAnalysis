To begin with , I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as out of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market . To be classified as unemployed , working age people must report that they have actively sought work within the past four weeks . Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not counted as unemployed . These include most retirees , teenagers and young adults in school , and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members . Even in a stronger job market , it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not to work .
