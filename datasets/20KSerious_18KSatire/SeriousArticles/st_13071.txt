Well lookie here , another willing patsy for the Seahawks . They could be the hottest team in the league by time the playoffs roll around , a scary thought for teams like the Panthers and Cardinals . ( though for the record , I d still take either of them over Seattle to win the NFC ) . The Seahawks have been getting it done on offense , averaging 34 . 5 points over their last four games . The Wilson to Baldwin connection has been especially potent over that stretch , hooking up 24 times for 433 yards and six touchdowns . Rawls , meanwhile , is now up to 18 points per game in standard scoring leagues in his six games leading the Seattle backfield . In three games without Justin Forsett , Allen has 72 touches , 185 rushing yards , 184 receiving yards and two touchdowns . He s locked in as a fantasy starter the rest of the way , regardless of matchup .
