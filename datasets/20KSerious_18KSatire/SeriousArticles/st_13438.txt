Now , I m guessing we won t agree on health care anytime soon . But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security . Say a hardworking American loses his job ? we shouldn t just make sure he can get unemployment insurance we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that s ready to hire him . If that new job doesn t pay as much , there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills . And even if he s going from job to job , he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him . That s the way we make the new economy work better for everyone .
