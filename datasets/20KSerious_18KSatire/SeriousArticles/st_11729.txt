Good sign : Led by DE Jason Pierre Paul , who seemed to have as quick a first step as he ' s had since his return , the Giants actually got decent pressure on Jets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick . He took a lot of hits , especially early . WR KR Dwayne Harris continues to be one of GM Jerry Reese ' s finest free agent signings , perhaps ever . With the Giants ' offense struggling , he provided a spark with an 80 yard punt return for a touchdown ( making him the first Giant with a punt return and kickoff return for a touchdown in the same season since Jimmy Patton in 1955 ) . The best part about it was the way special teams coach Tom Quinn set it up , using Odell Beckham as a decoy . Beckham and Harris both lined up as return men and when Harris caught the punt , Beckham darted towards the other sideline drawing at least three Jets defenders . Brilliant . The Giants ' offensive line , which entered the game in a shambles , was actually pretty good . They were playing without RG Geoff Schwartz ( IR ) and RT Marshall Newhouse , but they kept Eli Manning upright and provided some push in the run game . They even did well after they lost LT Ereck Flowers in the third quarter and had to re shuffle their line again . Not a bad effort against a pretty good Jets defensive front . Stony Brook ' s Will Tye is proving to be a helpful addition at tight end and a solid replacement for the injured Larry Donnell .
