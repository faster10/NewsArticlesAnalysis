The IMF added the yuan to the basket of currencies used to calculate the value of Special Drawing Rights , a notional currency used as the standard for dealing with its member governments . That came after IMF staff concluded in a Nov . 13 report that the yuan was " freely usable , " meaning widely used for international transactions and widely traded in foreign exchange markets . The IMF created SDRs in the 1960s as a possible international currency , but they failed to gain wider acceptance . Until 1980 , the basket was 16 currencies including Iran and South Africa but that was reduced . Following the global financial crisis , Beijing called in March 2009 for creation of a new currency , possibly based on the SDR , to reduce reliance on dollars but failed to attract support .
