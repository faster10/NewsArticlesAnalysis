4 ) Dreams fuel the fierce drive to bring our passion into the world . Dreams come from our innermost desires . They tell us not necessarily how we ' ll get there , but why we need to get there . Once we have the " why " , the " how " will work itself out . All we need is that fierce conviction that can only come from dreams to act as our compass . Keep dreaming Remember : Martin Luther King Jr . once gave a riveting " I have a dream " speech . It was NOT the " I have a plan " speech ! How can it create the world of your dreams ?
