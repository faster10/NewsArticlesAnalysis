And Gaga is a particularly disappointing choice for such a visible tribute to the beloved pop icon , despite her stated adulation of his work and persona . " When I fell in love with David Bowie , when I was living on the Lower East Side , I always felt that his glamour was something he was using to express a message to people that was very healing for ? their souls , Gaga told the Hollywood Reporter just before Bowie s death . ? He is a true , true artist and I don ' t know if I ever went , ' Oh , I ' m going to be that way like this , ' or if I arrived upon it slowly , realizing it was my calling and that ' s what drew me to him . She continued : " I thought it was interesting to dress like a fashionista ? and kind of envelope myself in this plastic image and sing things that are very heartfelt and wrap them up in something kind of not heartfelt . Gaga is a savvy businessperson and a talented singer she has successfully navigated the global music economy and given us a few genuinely inventive pieces of art . But she is not , however she might like to style herself , this generation s answer to David Bowie .
