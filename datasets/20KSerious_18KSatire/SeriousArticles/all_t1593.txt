StoreDot rapid-charging battery heads to smartphones this year
While mobile makers like Samsung and Apple have focused on trying to make batteries last longer, StoreDot's approach is different. Instead, it wants to build batteries that charge up very quickly, making topping up your phone's charge a trivial matter. There's a trade-off involved however -- StoreDot's current battery will only last you around 4-5 hours. But if charging is the work of a moment, having to charge a few times through the day might not be such a terrible compromise. StoreDot, which first gave its fast-charging battery a public airing in April last year, is using Mobile World Congress to reveal plans to put its rapid-charging batteries into electric cars. Details are scant, but the company told me it wants to be able to charge a Tesla in five minutes. StoreDot's tech may not be completely practical yet, but it's exciting to see this twist on smartphone batteries progressing to the point where we could soon see it as a publicly-available product. Stay tuned.
