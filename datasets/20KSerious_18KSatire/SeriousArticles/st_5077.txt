And maybe I ' m being unfair by raising this line of questioning . Google is a private company , even though its services , including maps , have started to feel so important that they ' re almost like public goods . It would make sense in a profit minded way that they would provide Street View in places where it ' s most needed or most likely to be used . That ' s probably the reason only select parts of Africa are mapped with Street View , while much of North America and Europe are . ( I asked Google what percentage of the United States is mapped with Street View and have not received a response the company would say Street View is available in more than 3 , 000 cities and 54 countries , plus the Arctic and Antarctica . Google Street View cars have driven more than 6 million " unique miles " since the project kicked off in 2007 , the company said ) . Technology costs money , and people with money tend to drive the development and deployment of tech .
