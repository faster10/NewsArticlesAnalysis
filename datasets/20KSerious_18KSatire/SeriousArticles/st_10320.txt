Bashdar Ismaeel : I think these accusations have had a similar tone to previous raids . And it is important to mention that this isn t a one off there have been a number of raids over the last couple of years . I am not sure of how much basis these accusations really have , but it s been a way for the AKP to justify such raids by linking it to terrorism . In Recep Tayyip Erdogan s own words , he s cleansing of traitors . He clearly feels these actions are justified even though it is obviously condemned by Europe and the US .
