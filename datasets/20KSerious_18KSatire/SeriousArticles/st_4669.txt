Brooklyn , New York ( VBS . TV ) Based on the sheer volume of bodies , Hajj should not work . As the world ' s largest pilgrimage and one of the Five Pillars of Islam , each year about 3 million people cram themselves into the relatively small holy city of Mecca , Saudi Arabia , to offer up this , the holiest of Islamic rites . In late 2008 , I accompanied my parents on Hajj and managed to sneak a VBS video camera past state security and capture the trip as we saw it . The scene was insane , beyond what I could have ever imagined .
