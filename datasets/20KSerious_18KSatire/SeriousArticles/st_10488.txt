This is not about supporting anyone or fighting cancer . It is about being seen doing it . This is why there should be no exceptions to the policy . Fine every single player who chooses noncompliance with the uniform policy . That way there is no argument about whose cause is more worthy based solely on the NFL s negligence , apathy or incompetence . Their statement is much better served in a different capacity but these clowns would rather look like a hero to the unwashed masses because they are standing up to the man . Do your job guys and stay within the rules . This is a team game but many of these players want to express their individuality at work . Grow up . ( That said , the NFL does need to fix some aspects of the uniform policy like allowing team color , black or white shoes . )
