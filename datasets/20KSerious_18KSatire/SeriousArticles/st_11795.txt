President Obama wants to bring in 10 , 000 Syrian refugees into America . Who is going to pay for them to get here ? Who is going to house them , feed them , educate them , and give them medical treatment , not to mention if they break our laws and go to our already overcrowded prisons before they can be deported ? The American taxpayers , that ' s who . We already have Americans who need housing , food , education , medical treatment , break our laws and go to prison . Why are they not our first humanitarian priority ? We are already paying for millions of illegals , and the seniors who contributed for so many years to their retirement are not even entitled to a cost of living increase in 2016 . Perhaps Michelle Obama should have planted money tree seeds instead of vegetables in her White House garden .
