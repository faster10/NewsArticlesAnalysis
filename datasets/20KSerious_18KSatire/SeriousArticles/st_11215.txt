Suddenly Game 5 of this Series was like Game 4 of another series gone wrong out of the Mets past , the 1988 National League Championship Series . It was Doc Gooden pitching that night the way Harvey pitched against the Royals , pitching a game out of his own youth , all the way into the 9th . Then he walked John Shelby . And Mike Scioscia hit a home run at old Shea . The Mets weren t ahead 3 1 in that series . They finally lost in 12 innings , same as the Mets did against the Royals in Game 5 .
