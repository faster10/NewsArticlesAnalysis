At a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court , I heard story after story from loving , committed same sex couples who had been together 10 , 20 , 30 , even 55 years . There were speakers such as Cleve Jones , who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt , and Robert Kabel , a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan who helped form the Log Cabin Republicans . There was one woman suffering from multiple sclerosis who had to be helped up the stairs to the podium by three men so she could stand next to her wife and share her story .
