LC : I think right now that s mostly resolved in the last month it got resolved . Going to caucuses is a big commitment , that s why on the Democratic side there s been 150 , 000 people , maybe a little more , that caucused . It takes about 3 hours , it would be hard for people who aren t from Iowa to visualise it , but you go , you have to sign in , then you re in a big sort of gymnasium , and you get in the corner of the gymnasium and if your candidate doesn t have 50 , you ? either go home , they don t count it , or you go to the candidate that does and then they have to hand count , literally by hand , like in a schoolroom every person on each side and then they write that number down and they decide , in the room , how to divide up the votes . They might get one delegate , they might get five , they might get ten how do they divide those up . So , it s a very strange process even for Iowans .
