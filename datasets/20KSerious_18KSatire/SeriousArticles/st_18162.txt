These laws took many forms . The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 barred Chinese immigration to the United States . This law also made it illegal for them to become citizens . In 1922 , the United States Congress passed a bill that would take away citizenship from any ( white ) woman who married a person who was not eligible for that status , i . e . , non white . Two years later , in 1924 , the United States Congress would ban people from less than desirable races from the country except under a very narrow set of circumstances . And of course , the United States condemned thousands of its own citizens who happened to be of Japanese descent to internment camps in 1942 .
