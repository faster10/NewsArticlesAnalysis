Teicher : Peters , as you know , was my choice as Chiefs MVP . He tied for the league lead with eight interceptions and brought two of them back for touchdowns . You ll remember he had an interception on his first NFL play in the season opener against the Texans , and that set the tone for his season . He had his first pick six the following week against Peyton Manning . He has not only been the playmaker the Chiefs have lacked in the secondary but his attitude has rubbed off on his teammates as well . The Chiefs had six interceptions last year , 22 this year .
