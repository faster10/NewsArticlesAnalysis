Does the streak stop at 17 ? It s been that many in a row for Williams , the 21 time major champion , against Sharapova , who last beat her in 2004 at the WTA Finals . Williams won a back and forth battle between the two at the 2005 Australian Open in the semifinals , 2 6 , 7 5 , 8 6 , and hasn t looked back since , including the 2015 final here , won in straight sets by the American . In a way , says Australian commentator Rennae Stubbs , they play too similar of a game ? only Williams ' ? is the better version : Serena moves better and she s more dogged . There are very few players that you can say are more dogged than Maria , and Serena is that .
