According to the official NATO policy , terrorism poses a direct threat to the security of the citizens of NATO countries and to international stability and prosperity . It is a persistent global threat that knows no border , nationality or religion and is a challenge that the international community must tackle together . NATO s work on counter terrorism focuses on improving awareness of the threat , developing capabilities to prepare and respond , and enhancing engagement with partner countries and other international actors . What the NATO policy fails to do is to effectively deal with the root causes of terrorism emanating from the Middle East , particularly the continuing Palestinian issue and the Arab Israeli conflict .
