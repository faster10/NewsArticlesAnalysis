The real question to ask of those opinion journalists in the neocon orbit is which of them would be willing to publicly endorse a Hillary Clinton candidacy against Trump . It ' s hard to imagine Commentary ' s John Podhoretz supporting any Democrat for president , but I can certainly imagine him using the pages of his magazine to denounce Trump all the way through the fall . Max Boot has made clear at numerous points in the past that he advises and supports Republicans primarily because of foreign policy if the Clinton camp asked him post convention to climb on board to help her defeat Trump , I wouldn ' t be at all surprised if he took her up on the offer . As for Robert Kagan , I suspect he ' ll end up on Clinton ' s foreign policy team regardless of what happens with Trump . ( Kagan has already served as an informal advisor to the former secretary of state , while his wife was her spokesperson at the State Department . )
