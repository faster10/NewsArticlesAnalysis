In November 2002 , the first killings occurred under this " global war " assertion . Six people , including a 23 year old American , were killed by Hellfire missiles in Yemen fired from CIA operated drones based in Djibouti . The UN special rapporteur for extra judicial killing condemned the attack as an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life , but it would take over six years and a change of party in the White House before human rights advocates , international law scholars , moral philosophers , theologians , and others would begin to focus on targeted killing as they had focused on the use of torture .
