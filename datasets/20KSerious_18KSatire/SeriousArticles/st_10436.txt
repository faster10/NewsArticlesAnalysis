Mark Walton , president of ViaGen , which uses cloning technologies , said his company will comply with the request , but he played down the scope of the matter . " The number of cloned animals in the barn yard today is minuscule compared to the size of the total livestock population , " said Walton . " In addition , clones are to be used as breeding animals , not for consumption . Because of a supply chain management system that allows tracking of cloned livestock , consumers are unlikely to ever eat these animals . "
