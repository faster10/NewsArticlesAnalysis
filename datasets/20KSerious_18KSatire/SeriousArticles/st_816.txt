I think every school has got their guy and they re doing the best they can to manage what those coaches ask them to do , he said . But probably from top to bottom if you look at the stats and the way all of them have played over the course of the season , there s probably some merit to that ( criticism ) . But there s also been some pretty special performances . Arkansas guy ( Brandon Allen ) has played at an extremely high level . So has Dak ( Prescott of Mississippi State ) . I think ours has played pretty solid also . I m sure others can say the same .
