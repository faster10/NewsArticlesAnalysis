The meta nature of the movie isn t just limited to its self aware editing style . There s a number of hilarious ? bits of pointed self awareness , where Miller is subverting and satirizing the cliches of action films , while still celebrating the form itself . The guitarist strapped to front of the car leading the charge to kidnap the fleeing women ? The scene where Max watches the escaped wives wearing barely any clothes while dousing each other in water , in slow motion ? Every ridiculous stunt they do with cars and motorcycles ? These moments are over the top , but they are meant to be ? we re supposed to be laughing at the way that movies use music , sexuality , and heart stopping action ? to manipulate our emotions , and laughing at ourselves for loving it every step of the way .
