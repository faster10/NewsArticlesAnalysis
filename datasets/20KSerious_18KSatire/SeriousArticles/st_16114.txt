Of her character , Brody ' s wife Jessica , Baccarin said that she loves that " she ' s a no frills kind of woman . She held her family together . She must have a sense of humor and strength somewhere deep inside that we don ' t get to see very often . The strength you get to see , absolutely , but she ' s vulnerable and going through a lot all the time , so you don ' t get to see her laughing very much . But this is a woman who held it together for eight years alone , so I think she ' s not a victim and she ' s not afraid and when she is afraid she holds it together for her kids . "
