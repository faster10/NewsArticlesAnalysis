Drummer Mick Woody Woodmansey , the last surviving member of Bowie s backing band the Spiders from Mars , emerged afterwards to sign autographs and pose for photos . We d done about two or three gigs before the news came and that knocked us sideways , he said , recalling the announcement of Bowie s death on Monday . It was just a bit surreal . We were on the road playing those songs and then five o clock in the morning got a phone call in the hotel . I went to wake Tony up and the others and it was just like shock . It s the last thing you thought was going to happen .
