Indecisive songwriter : I feel like I HAVE to give two answers to this question : 1 . " This little girl ' s got a heart of gold , and she ' ll love you just as long as she ' s alive . " This line is the song . And 2 . " Please don ' t eat my pangolin friend , it ' s cheaper to sit hookers on your face . " I love this joke because it ' s true ! The amount of money people pay to kill and eat this harmless and beautiful animal is absurd ! And for what ? False promises . You stand as much of a chance of getting an erection by chewing on your fingernails ( as getting one from eating a pangolin , which is seen by relatively few people as an aphrodisiac . )
