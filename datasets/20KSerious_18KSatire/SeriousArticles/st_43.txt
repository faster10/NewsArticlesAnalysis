The film is not the story of every Egyptian , or even every revolutionary . It ' s a mediation of the revolutionary experience through these specific characters . The film is a story of the relationships of these individual characters with the revolution , and with each other . Even though this is a deeply political film , political parties are rarely shown . Central , nevertheless , to the film ' s development , is the persona of Magdy , a loyal Brotherhood member . He humanizes ordinary Brotherhood members , and of all the central characters , we know Magdy as the most tortured , who suffered the most under Mubarak ' s regime .
