War in Afghanistan continued in different forms and phases even after the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan and entered into the 21st century . Billions of dollars and petrodollars went into igniting and continuing the bloodiest war of the Cold War era . Extremist ideologies like Wahhabism and Salfism were mainstreamed at an international level , misusing the name of Islam . A distorted view of Jihad was propagated ( a genie that later refused to go back in the bottle ) . Innocent people around the world have faced blood baths at the hands of terrorists but Asia , Afghanistan in particular have been victims of an undeclared war since that time . In Pakistan military dictators used these calamities as opportunities to legitimize and perpetuate their unconstitutional despotism . That is why no serious or effective effort was made to defeat this menace . Right or wrong , this war , along with numerous other factors , led to theterrorist attacks of 9 11 in the US . The rest is history .
