The turning point in Denver s 30 24 overtime win over New England in Week 12 came when New England muffed a punt early in the fourth quarter while holding a 14 point lead . That led to a Broncos touchdown and got the guilty party ( Patriots returner Chris Harper ) waived the following week . Overall , the Patriots have made more mistakes on special teams than in previous seasons . New England still fields the NFL s best kicker , but Denver s Brandon McManus can give Stephen Gostkowski a run for his money at Sports Authority Field . The strong legged McManus played a huge role in last Sunday s win over Pittsburgh by making all five of his field goal attempts including a 51 yarder and sending his six kickoffs for touchbacks in windy conditions . The Broncos must replace returner Omar Bolden , who suffered a season ending knee injury against the Steelers . Wide receivers Emmanuel Sanders ( punts ) , Andre Caldwell ( kickoffs ) and Jordan Norwood ( punts and kickoffs ) are expected to assume Bolden s return duties .
