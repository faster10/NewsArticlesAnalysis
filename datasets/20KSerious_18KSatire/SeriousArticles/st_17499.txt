Responding to Democrat Jack Conway ' s loss in Kentucky last night , the Democratic Governors Association issued this statement : " Unfortunately , Conway ran into the unexpected headwinds of Trump mania , losing to an outsider candidate in the Year of the Outsider . " While blaming Trump for the Dems ' loss in Kentucky seems ludicrous ( and while it discounts the fact that Conway has now lost competitive races for the House , Senate , and governor ) , there is something to Bevin being an outsider . After all , he ran against Mitch McConnell in 2014 , and the establishment GOP really never warmed up to him . But Bevin won and that victory should empower conservatives who believe that they don ' t have to settle on the squishy middle to win tough races . One other note on Kentucky ' s result last night : It was good news for Rand Paul . Sure , his presidential campaign is on life support , but it doesn ' t seem as if he needs to run back to Kentucky to save his Senate seat in 2016 . Whether it was in Kentucky or in Virginia ( where the GOP held onto the state Senate ) or in Houston ( where the anti discrimination measure was defeated ) , last night was a good night for the GOP and conservatives .
