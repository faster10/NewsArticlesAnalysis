During the three years that I was serving as a member of Tunisia ' s Constituent Assembly , I would frequently walk to work through the gate of the Bardo Museum so I could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden . The museum , in downtown Tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of Tunisia ' s Roman , Jewish , Christian and Islamic heritage , but is also connected to the Tunisian parliament . I used to love these peaceful moments on the way to work . Sadly , they will likely never feel quite the same again .
