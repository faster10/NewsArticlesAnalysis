Jolie : Well I think the global community always has a . . . has a responsibility to any humanitarian crisis . And I think it ' s in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can can lead to a lot of instability and aggression and you know pop . We don ' t . . . we certainly we just don ' t want that we have . . A lot of people feel it ' s a little calmer now . . . this is the time to really discuss and and try to get these communities back together . But if these communities don ' t start coming back together properly , if we don ' t start really counting the people . . . understanding where they are . . . what they need . . . making sure the schools are being built . . . making sure the electricity the water and all these needs are being met and also understanding that a lot of the people that will return are going to come back to houses that are occupied or destroyed and bombed out and we have to we have to have . . . It ' s going to be a big operation to understand the needs . . . to address it to help people put the pieces of their life back together and return to their communities . So it ' s really just putting kind of . . . getting the plan together . . . getting the group together and everybody actively focused on helping the IDPS and the refugees .
