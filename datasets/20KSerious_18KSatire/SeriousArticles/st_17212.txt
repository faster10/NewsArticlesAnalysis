Refuse to be the bad guy . Every breakup has one and , as the dumper , you need to suck it up and admit you ' re it . Even if you ' re not particularly evil , you ' re the one who used his heart as a hankie , so don ' t call him , wondering if he ' s " OK . " Not only does it not absolve you from anything ( and that ' s really all you ' re looking for ) , it ' s presumptuous . And while we ' re at it , don ' t even think about acknowledging milestones . Nothing says Unhappy Birthday like a store bought greeting card from the person who ruined your life ( at least for a while ) .
