Expect more upheaval in Iowa GOP polls over the next week . Philip Bump : " Earlier this month , Fox News released a poll showing Ted Cruz leading Donald Trump by four points . The two had a sizable lead over everyone else in the state , and the poll was confirming what others were showing : Cruz had an advantage . On Sunday , Fox released another Iowa poll , with substantially different results . Now , Trump is up by 11 points , a 15 point swing in the two weeks between surveys . This poll , too , mirrors the recent trend : Trump has regained the advantage . It ' s still a surprising development . Trump ' s gained a lot , across the board , while most of his competitors have slipped . So what ' s going on ? This is the same polling firm and the same methodology . The story of this new poll is that Iowa has changed . And over the next eight days , it will change more . " ? WashPost
