Hart : I need a segue into the documentary aspect of the movie and the best way to do that , I felt , was to jokingly address what ' s been happening to me for the past two years . Everybody coming up to me asking questions , and when I go to answer it they tell me what their answer is . You don ' t allow me to tell them what ' s going on you tell me what you think you know because you ' ve heard things about me . It was a different way to open a standup film and I ' m all about being different and trying to break ground with original ideas .
