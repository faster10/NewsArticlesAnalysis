7 . White Sands National Monument isn ' t your typical sand . We may be getting hung up on a technicality , but the " sand " in these 275 square miles of shifting dunes 15 miles west of Alamogordo is actually gypsum crystals . ( Most inland sand is made from silica in the form of quartz crystals or coral . ) That ' s not the only reason White Sands is surreal : 93 African oryx were imported from the Kalahari Desert and set free between 1969 and 1977 . Today more than 3 , 000 animals , each weighing up to 450 pounds with horns that average 34 inches , roam the dunes . http : www . nps . gov whsa index . htm
