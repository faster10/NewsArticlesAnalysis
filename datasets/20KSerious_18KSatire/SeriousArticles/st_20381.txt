At the Cruz rally , I asked the Family Research Council s Perkins about the surprisingly strong support for Trump among self described evangelicals . A recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute shows that 53 percent of Iowa evangelicals view Trump favorably , up from 37 percent in November . Evangelicals are very much reflective of the rest of the culture , Perkins said . I asked if that meant they re becoming more disconnected from institutional authority . Yeah , I think that s true , he said . ?
