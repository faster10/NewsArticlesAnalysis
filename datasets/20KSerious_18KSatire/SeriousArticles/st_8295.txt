Fulfilling the hallowed role of the " monster of the week " ? or so we think ? is Rhys Darby , an actor from New Zealand who you might ' ve seen in " Flight of the Conchords . " Stepping on the scene in spirited form , he brings us something like Old Gregg from " The Mighty Boosh " ? mixed with the swamp monster Creature from the Black Lagoon that Gillian Anderson tangled with ? in 1997 on the cover of Rolling Stone . His character , the hilariously named Guy Mann , is simultaneously critical and appreciative of Mulder , the ultimate believer , one who is now somehow , after all these chases in the dark , more a skeptic than ever before ( apart from the whole government alien conspiracy thing ) . ?
