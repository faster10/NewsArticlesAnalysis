The simulcast was ? particularly absurd because , ultimately , all this rigmarole was pointless . Trump put together the most boring event of his entire campaign , an event so dull that MSNBC and CNN ? who would have loved nothing more than to stick it to Fox News with a more entertaining , better rated event than their big night , who were craving for it ? cut away 15 minutes into it , with anchors muttering about just how boring an event it was , only dipping back in occasionally . Prime casualties were ? Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee , who hopped over to Trump s event hoping for some free air time , showed up right after CNN moved onto something else . CNN host Don Lemon said , We ' ll dip in as soon as Trump starts to talk about policy or other issues , which was unquestionably the funniest thing anyone said all night .
