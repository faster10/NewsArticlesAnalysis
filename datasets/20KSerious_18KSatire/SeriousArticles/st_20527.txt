The real crime here is that there is a potentially great movie in the premise . The concept of a brutally fascist world were time is literally money and where the poor are haunted and driven by the specter of impending death is an intriguing one . Alas , Niccol ' s screenplay doesn ' t quite nail it , giving us a flat , uncomplicated story , some rather herky jerky character development and an endless stream of absurd plot points . Yes , there are some legitimately suspenseful moments , but not enough to make up for the rest .
