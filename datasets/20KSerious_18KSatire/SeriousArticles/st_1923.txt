( 1 ) Project strength . Walk purposefully , and show no fear even if you have to fake it . Pickpockets prey on travelers who look like confused , easy victims . ( 2 ) Always remain alert . " It ' s those few seconds of inattentiveness when your bag or purse could get snatched , " Whitman says . " Thieves are generally looking for a quick steal , so bring a cable lock to secure your belongings to your seat on trains , and lock the zippers of your bags together so no one can easily open them . " ( 3 ) Readjust your schedule . If you feel uncomfortable going out at night , don ' t force it . Instead , sightsee during the day , make lunch your biggest meal , and turn in early . " Everyone should avoid walking alone at night , " Schlichter says . " I ' ve heard plenty of stories of male travelers who put themselves in bad situations they made the mistake of assuming they ' d always be fine because they ' re guys . " ( 4 ) Avoid the flirts . Steves has long advised single female travelers to wear fake wedding rings , especially in Mediterranean and Latin countries , where the men tend to pay more attention to women than Americans are typically used to . Getting hit on doesn ' t always turn into a safety concern , of course , but a simple gold band could save you some headaches . ( 5 ) Follow your gut . If your radar goes off , listen to it no matter who sets it off . " Women and young children are just as likely to be pickpockets in some European countries not men with knives , " Whitman points out . " They often get away with it , I think , because people don ' t want to be rude to a nice looking , middle aged lady holding a baby , even if she ' s being pushy . "
