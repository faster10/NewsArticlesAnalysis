One of the safest ways to predict a playoff winner is to go with the team that has the best coach and quarterback combination . With Andy Reid and Alex Smith , the Chiefs have the edge in both categories , so they get the edge on paper . But be wary of the 9 7 Texans , who have won seven of their last nine games . The defense is formidable ? it s hard to envision the Chiefs consistently blocking Watt and Mercilus ? and while quarterback Brian Hoyer doesn t scare anyone , it s not absurd to envision him gaining some confidence and getting on a hot streak during a home playoff game . The Chiefs are the better team on paper , hence the reason they re road favorites , but if they turn the ball over a few times and or let Hoyer get some confidence , all bets are off .
