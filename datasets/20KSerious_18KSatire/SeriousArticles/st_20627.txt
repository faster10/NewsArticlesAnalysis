Let me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several years . To summarize , I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment , further reductions in the remaining margins of labor market slack , and a rise in inflation to our 2 objective . I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have enumerated today will continue to do so , while the drag from some of the factors that have been weighing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year . Although the economic outlook , as always , is uncertain , I currently see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced .
