" I know that as a middle infielder , there ' s a lot of stress especially when you play a team that ' s young and athletic and always runs hard . But here ' s another way to look at it . You have 27 outs , and you have 14 or 15 strikeouts on average per night , said Rodriguez . That ' s 12 balls that are put in play . Of those 12 , five or six of them are going to be lazy fly balls or easy outs . As an infielder , if you make a handful of plays , you will be shaking hands and win the game . The Mets will be pushed and challenged in a way they haven ' t been pushed before .
