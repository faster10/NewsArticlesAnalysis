No , it didn ' t . Instead , the Packers went on a 35 7 run the rest of the way . They did it by pressuring Cousins consistently down the stretch . And by running the football to accentuate a short to intermediate passing game . Rodgers completed 21 of 36 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns . He was sacked only once ( for a safety ) , largely because he was either using his mobility or getting rid of the ball quickly . And he adjusted on the fly at times with his wideouts , just like he has done in the past when the offense was humming along at its best . For the first time , the entire team looked like the Packers franchise that opened the season 6 0 and appeared primed for another playoff run .
