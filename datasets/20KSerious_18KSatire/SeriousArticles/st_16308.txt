The flaw with this thinking is , quite simply , that presidential elections have serious consequences . A Republican victory would not simply mean that our side lost and the other side won . It would have a profound impact on the lives of millions if not billions of people : For the countless working class individuals and families who need presidential policies that will stimulate job growth and improve our collective standard of living , such as they received under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and would be much less likely to experience under a Republican administration for the children who need our country s leadership to recognize and seriously confront man made climate change before our planet is rendered uninhabitable for the Americans who have benefited from President Obama s health care reform plan since it was implemented and could lose their insurance or worse for the generation of senior citizens who have paid into Social Security throughout their lives and would have that safety net delayed or ripped away completely and for historically marginalized groups , from Mexican immigrants and women to members of the LGBT community , who deserve to be led by a party that doesn t actively reward presidential candidates for spewing hatred against them .
