How did the Patriots lose , when they outgained the Broncos , 420 286 ? Try four turnovers , a missed field goal , and a failed fourth down conversion inside Denver s 40 yard line . Jake Plummer ( remember him ? ) threw for 197 yards and a touchdown , and Mike Anderson scored on a pair of 1 yard runs . The second score followed the play that Patriots fans won t forget . Looking to take a 13 10 lead in the third quarter , with third and goal from the Denver 5 , Brady threw an end zone interception to Champ Bailey , who took the ball back 100 yards .
