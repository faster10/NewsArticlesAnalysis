The attack at Charlie Hebdo happened right off the avenue Richard Lenoir , where ? on Tuesday President Hollande kicked off anniversary events by laying the first of three plaques to honor the dead journalists , police and security officers , and customers of a Jewish grocery . While the sidewalks here have drawn flowers and candles throughout the year , now the avenue hosts a much larger commemoration : just four blocks up sits the Bataclan concert hall , the main site of Nov . 13 attacks . Candles , flowers , and letters to those lost abound in the area .
