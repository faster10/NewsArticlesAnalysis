In a film crowded with colorful cameos ? Wesley Snipes as a one eyed gangster , Angela Bassett as a community leader and Samuel L . Jackson as a combination of stand up comedian , street prophet and Greek chorus , just for starters ? and loaded up with film school winks and nods to Doctor Strangelove and Patton and whatever else I didn t notice on first viewing , it s tough for one actor to stand out . But Nick Cannon s complicated and masterful performance as Chi Raq , a young man who embodies the contradictions of his community , who is both a perpetrator and a victim of the heartless violence that has surrounded him all his life , accomplishes that . We don t see enough of Chi Raq s inner life for me to fairly compare him to someone like Dostoevsky s Raskolnikov , but in all honestly Cannon made me feel that mixture of pain and recklessness and uncertainty that produces cruelty to self and to others . Does this story end , as Dostoevsky s did , with the suggestion that even a man guilty of such terrible things can be redeemed ? It does ? and that , too , is a rejection of what smug suburban morality demands of black artists , black activists , black people .
