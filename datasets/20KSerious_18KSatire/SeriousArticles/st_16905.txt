Jim Parsons ( Sheldon ) revealed that while the spanking was always in the script for that December 2012 episode , it was originally planned to be off camera . The original gag had Amy ' s spanking , along with two other points of the episode , paired with the image of Amy ' s monkey mimicking the image of " see no evil , " " hear no evil " and then " speak no evil . " Ultimately , once the writers decided to put the spanking on camera , Parsons found the scene " one of the hardest things I ' ve had to do because it was so amusing . "
