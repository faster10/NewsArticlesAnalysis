Now I know this was the case with lots of my friends we were all searching to fit in . It ' s in part because of the way the American culture has brought us up . There were two classes at my middle school : " Americanized " Hispanics and " beaner " Hispanics . If you were dark skinned and didn ' t speak English well , you were called a " beaner " and a border hopper . You would be seen as " uncool " or an " outsider . " In gym class , some of the better soccer players were called " beaners . " It was Hispanics being racist toward other Hispanics .
