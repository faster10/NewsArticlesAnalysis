From the middle till the end of the second set he played extremely well . Ferrer thought Wawrinka s shot was out ? a suspicion HawkEye proved ? but the Spaniard was out of challenges and had to concede defeat after an hour and 33 minutes . But his returning was below par and he was unable to pressure Nadal , who was looking increasingly more secure in the baseline play . That means I m happy . I will be lying if I am not saying I had a couple very good tournaments on indoors . Nadal , unaware at the time , cocked an eyebrow in the media conference and suggested Murray might have become aware of his follicular issues on the practice court .
