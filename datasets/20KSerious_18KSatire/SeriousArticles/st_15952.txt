The idea that Assad must go to get rid of ISIS is problematic . Getting rid of Assad would not only be a hurdle because of Iran and Russia ' s support of Assad , getting rid of Assad would create a power vacuum , which ISIS would try to fill . In this power vacuum , we could see what we saw in Iraq after Saddam lost power . Assad , for all of his flaws , was able to exercise a form of control over Syria and this somewhat limits ISIS ' s ability to spread . This does not legitimize Assad , but it is a recognition of a role he could play in getting rid of ISIS .
