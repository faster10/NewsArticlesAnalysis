We should learn to accept death more readily we should stop aggressive interventions when there is little hope we should provide dying people with palliative care to make their passing less painful and less traumatic . Such a case may not just be that of an elderly person succumbing to a terminal illness it can be that of a preemie born too early to survive , a youngster following a car wreck , a worker following a tragic accident . We should learn from the Eskimos they long ago stopped abandoning their elderly just because they got " too " old .
