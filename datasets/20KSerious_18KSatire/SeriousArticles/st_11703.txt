I wish he d stop saying he s going to make America great again . It s not that I object to the sentiment I would just like to see him go a little deeper into the issues .

The last thing Trump needs to do is start being evasive and vague because he s worried about giving the wrong answers . Because his willingness to give honest answers , even when they re wrong , is what people loved about him in the first place
