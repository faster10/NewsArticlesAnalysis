Admittedly , few understood my love of the genre . Classmates were only interested in game shows when they were hip to the crowd , such as " Press Your Luck " or MTV ' s " Remote Control . " Family members were confused at times , but did play along . One California vacation included a visit to a taping of " Win , Lose or Draw , " where I got to chat with game show legend Charles Nelson Reilly between tapings . But , for the most part , my love of the genre was something I kept to myself . And when the genre became pass in the early 90s , and talk shows and similar fare took over the landscape , I simply forgot about big bucks and no whammies .
