Ever since the modern day conservative movement came together in support of Ronald Reagan ' s candidacy in 1980 , its leading intellectuals have tended to fall in line behind the Republican Party ' s nominee for president . Sure , they would jostle before and during the primaries , with each pundit throwing his writing and thinking behind whichever candidate came closest to exemplifying the precise mix of personality traits and policy proposals he favored . But by the time the nomination was secured , party loyalty would kick in and the preferences of Republican voters and party bigwigs would get the final say . And that was okay , as far as the pundits were concerned , because no matter which candidate ended up at the top of the ticket , he was bound to be better than whatever Big Government liberal the Democrats had chosen to run against him .
