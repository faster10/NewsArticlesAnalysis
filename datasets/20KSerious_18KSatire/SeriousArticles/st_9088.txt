Stoke paid a nice tribute to Newcastle ' s cancer suffering winger Jonas Gutierrez in their matchday programme . But they also had a little bit of mischievous fun , bizarrely quoting Newcastle ' s odds to win the Premier League an outlandish 5 , 000 1 . They did not , however , mention that they themselves are 2 , 500 1 ! It ' s fair to say that quoting the odds on relegation would have been a little more relevant . Incidentally , Stoke are 9 1 for the drop while Newcastle are as short as 4 1 .
