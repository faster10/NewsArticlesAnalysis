Sitting down to craft my ? explanation of why , going into the primary season , I m endorsing Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders , I made a critical mistake . I read ? the unhinged , downright embarrassing attack on Sanders by the Washington Post s editorial board published Wednesday night . The piece , which is a series of straw man attacks on Sanders platform ( denying that single payer healthcare is workable , even though it works perfectly well in Canada and the U . K . , for instance ) and red baiting that would make Joe McCarthy proud . It made me want to vote Sanders , just to piss them off .
