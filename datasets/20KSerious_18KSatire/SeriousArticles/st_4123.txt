An architecture studio class offered at Harvard s Graduate School of Design last fall was called The MLK Way : Building on Black America s Main Street . The instructor , Daniel D Oca , took his 13 students on field trips to St . Louis and Washington , D . C . , where they met community leaders and puzzled how to promote genuine rebirth in these complex places . Their final proposals include plans for urban farming , incentives for small business , housing aimed at young families , and community land trusts to combat ? paradoxically ? the gentrification and displacement that often comes when conditions improve . The first thing I try to get people to understand is that cities are consciously designed , said D Oca . Why does MLK Street in St . Louis look the way it does ? It was designed to be segregated , to be poor . It was designed to fail . And something that was designed can be redesigned .
