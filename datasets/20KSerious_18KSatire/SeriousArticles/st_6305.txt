Both Hitler and Trump have found that by keeping the focus of animosity on one unpopular minority as the source of all the ills of society , they can unite people and claim leadership when people are desperately looking for " strong leadership . " Both are capable of cynically exploiting the mood against the minority and dialing it up or down based on what they think the audience would like to hear . Both blame the minority for threatening the equilibrium in society Hitler blamed the Jews for betraying Germany after the First World War and often cited the fictitious and anti Semitic " Protocols of the Elders of Zion , " and Trump blames the Muslims for being terrorist sympathizers who want to harm the United States . Both make up lies to promote their bigotry Hitler constantly cooked up facts about the Jews and Trump has been challenged on statements like claiming that he watched thousands of Muslims celebrating 9 11 in New Jersey .
