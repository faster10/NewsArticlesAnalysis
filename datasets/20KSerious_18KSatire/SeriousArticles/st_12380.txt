Missouri Gov . Jay Nixon : ? Coach Pinkel s decision to step down due to his diagnosis of lymphoma is sad news for the Tigers and the entire Mizzou family . My friend Gary Pinkel is an outstanding coach and educator . Through his leadership and commitment , Gary has made a positive and lasting impact on the lives of thousands of students and the university as a whole . Gary inspires respect and admiration for all the right reasons ? not only for being the winningest coach in Mizzou history , but also for his dedication to the well being of his players , both on and off the field . ?
