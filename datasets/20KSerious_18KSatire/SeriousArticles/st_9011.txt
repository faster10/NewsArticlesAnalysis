This upcoming trip will be easier than his August trip in one big way : He won ' t have to worry about contracting Ebola , because he ' s now immune to the strain of the disease responsible for the current epidemic . But it will be more difficult in another way : He knows many of his friends in Liberia lost family members and colleagues to Ebola this fall , and he won ' t be able to comfort them with a hug , because hugging , or even shaking hands , is forbidden in order to cut down on the spread of the disease .
