On the flip side , Denver needs to run the ball . They can ' t win without it . New England allowed less than 100 yards rushing per game during the regular season and gave up just eight runs of 20 yards . Counting last week ' s divisional game , though , the Patriots have given up 120 rushing yards or more seven times and more than 140 yards three times . Kansas City rushed for 135 last week , though 44 came from quarterback Alex Smith . Manning isn ' t duplicating that , so Denver ' s running backs will need to be strong . The Broncos piled up 179 yards against them in November , including 113 from C . J . Anderson , who scored on a 48 yard run . ?
