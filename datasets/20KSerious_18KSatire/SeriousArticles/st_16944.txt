Today , background checks are required at gun stores . If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt , he can walk into a gun store , get a background check , purchase his weapon safely and responsibly . This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment .

Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates , apparently , before this meeting , this is not a plot to take away everybody ' s guns . You pass a background check you purchase a firearm .
