The reporter who viewed Mathis leaving the Eagles as a lose lose doesn t sound all that smart . A lot of high priced veteran players would take a small one year pay cut in order to have a chance at a Super Bowl ring . The Eagles owed Mathis 5 . 5 million this year and wanted him to take a pay cut down from 5 . 5m . He signed with Denver for 4 million instead , meaning he lost less than 1 . 5 million , avoided the Eagles train wreck this year , and is now playing in the Super Bowl . Sounds like one side clearly lost and the other side clearly won .
