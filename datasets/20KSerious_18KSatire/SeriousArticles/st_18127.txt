I m going to try to crash Rubio s Super Bowl party at a New Hampshire country club on Sunday ( shh ? don t tell him ! ) , and I m fully expecting it to be a tiny bit cool , at least by Republican standards . Hip hop hits of the 90s may well be heard . Someone may get jiggy with it . It seems possible that something will be kicked Gangnam Style . I m not worried about encountering any such phenomena at a Trump function . This week s micro moment of mosque mania offered Trump one more chance to play a right wing hit record that still clings to the charts , even thought it s almost nostalgia : Barack Hussein Obama is a Muslim , a Kenyan , a Commie ? certainly a something . Maybe the president went to a mosque because he felt comfortable there , Trump suggested . Oh snap ! Because if you feel comfortable visiting a place you ve never been to before , you must be oh , forget it .
