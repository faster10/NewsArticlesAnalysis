But those turnovers aren t always enough to overcome the bad defense they generally play . They are giving up 428 . 4 yards per game , 316 . 1 passing yards , and it s a good bet those two numbers will rank them dead last when this weekend is over . Sure , they usually save their meltdowns for the ends of games . And that definitely occurred on Sunday , too , when Drew Brees breezed down the field in 14 plays ( and 6 : 35 ) for the game tying touchdown with 36 seconds remaining . This game , though , was one big meltdown from the start .
