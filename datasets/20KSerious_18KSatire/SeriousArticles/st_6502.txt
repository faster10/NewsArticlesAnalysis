Hillary Clinton responded to Trump on CBS yesterday , per NBC ' s Monica Alba . " Well , if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past , that ' s his prerogative . You know , so be it . I ' m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women , raising the minimum wage , which affects two thirds of the women , who are the ones receiving the minimum wage , protecting a woman ' s right to make the most personal health care decisions . " Clinton added , Well , Bill Clinton ' s past has been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years . They can do it again if they want to . That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign . Didn ' t work before . It won ' t work again . "
