Never before in the Open era had a men ' s defending champion lost in the opening round of Wimbledon . And when Hewitt took the first set against Ivo Karlovic for the loss of just one game , it appeared as though that record would continue . But then Karlovic , all 6 feet , 11 inches of him , stopped being nervous and started being dangerous .

On the other side of the net , Hewitt was confounded , unable to offer a response to Karlovic ' s game , built around the power of his serve .
