The win over the Chiefs was New England s first playoff game at Gillette Stadium since last year s AFC title game , when the Patriots were accused of purposely using deflated footballs in the first half of their 45 7 win over the Colts . The NFL suspended Brady for the first four games of the 2015 regular season , but Brady had the suspension lifted by a federal judge less than a week before New England s regular season opener . The NFL has since appealed the ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals . Legal arguments are scheduled for early March .
