The first possibility is that we may have had the data , but didn ' t fully understand what it meant . This is the proverbial connect the dots problem . As we ' ve learned again and again , connecting the dots is hard . Our intelligence services collect billions of individual pieces of data every day . After the fact , it ' s easy to walk backward through the data and notice all the individual pieces that point to what actually happened . Before the fact , though , it ' s much more difficult . The overwhelming majority of those bits of data point in random directions , or nowhere at all . Almost all the dots don ' t connect to anything .
