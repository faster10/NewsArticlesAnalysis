If this is all indeed acting , Sia is quite good at it . Even when she s singing something typically out of character for her ? she promises to hypnotize the whole room with her butt on Sweet Design , which recalls late 90s Destiny s Child ? the songs don t feel any less personal than the ones on her previous album , 2014 s 1000 Forms of Fear . ( That record also contained its fair share of rejects : Sia says its two biggest hits , Chandelier and Elastic Heart , were both originally offered to Katy Perry . ) In a literal sense , Sia is also a talented imitator , incorporating other singers vocal styles into her writing and , inextricably , her own performances . She captures Shakira s distinctive warble on the feverish Move Your Body and adopts Rihanna s patois elsewhere .
