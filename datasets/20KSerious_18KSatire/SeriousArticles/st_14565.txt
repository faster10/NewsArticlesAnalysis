This reflects some of the weaknesses of the Leveson Inquiry , which heard a vast amount of evidence about the extent of corporate lobbying and intimate relations between media executives and ministers but shied away from making any meaningful changes to media ownership rules that might make individual companies less powerful and therefore politicians less likely to kowtow towards them . The same goes for evidence about police corruption many examples were provided to the Inquiry about a " network of corrupted officials " but the idea that there was an institutional problem was dismissed .
