The official macho rock consensus of the past 20 years decreed that 80s Bowie was an aberration to be ignored . But for British Asian girls of the Smash Hits generation raised on catchy singles and pretentious pop videos , Bowie never failed to provide delight : Rupa Huq , now Labour MP for Ealing where she grew up , remembers her British Bangladeshi family sitting together in their front room watching Bowie in top hat and morning dress marry a Muslim bride in the 1985 Loving the Alien video . WTF ? One of us !
