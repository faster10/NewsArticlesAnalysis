Most doctors don ' t have the time to go into detailed discussions about all the options on the table . If I try to explain to my elderly male patients why prostate cancer screening doesn ' t always help , or inform young adults that antibiotics aren ' t necessary for most sinus infections , it would take much more time than the 15 minutes that I can give for a routine office visit . In many cases , it ' s quicker to simply order a test or prescribe a drug , which takes seconds , rather than go into the pros and cons of a treatment path .
