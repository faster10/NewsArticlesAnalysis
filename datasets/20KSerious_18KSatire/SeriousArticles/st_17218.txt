According to the World Health Organization , in developing countries , pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among women in their reproductive years . In the developed world , one out of 4 , 300 women will die as a consequence of pregnancy . That number is one in 31 in sub Saharan Africa , and a staggering one out of eight women dies giving birth in Afghanistan . The real tragedy is the fact that one third of these deaths could be prevented if women had access to voluntary family planning .
