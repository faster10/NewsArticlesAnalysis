Will Leitch , Sports on Earth : " All NFL teams , ultimately , are the same . They have the same resources , the same playing field , the same general strategies and the same ultimate priorities . There are 32 of them , all going after a collective pool of talent , on the field and off . Every once in a while you ' ll stumble across a Bill Belichick Tom Brady combo and your team will be great for a decade , but generally speaking , it ebbs and flows . Sometimes you win , sometime you lose , always you tailgate . The team is a part of one ' s community , but there ' s a cold blooded , capitalist , perfectly reasonable understanding among everyone that this is still a professional sports franchise that resides in one ' s city , not an organic outgrowth of it . No one believes Aaron Rodgers would live in Green Bay if the Packers hadn ' t drafted him to play there , and everyone ' s generally OK with it . College football , on the other hand , is often not just integral to a community , it ' s the center of it . In college towns , the university in large part is the town , the economic , professional and cultural center of everything going on there . There are vibrant communities in college towns independent of the university , but they still all live in the school ' s wake . The university has the money , the power and the prestige in these towns , and football , for better or worse , is the driving force of all of that . It sets the tone . It lays down who you are . Whether we want to or not , we define ourselves in its shadow . "
