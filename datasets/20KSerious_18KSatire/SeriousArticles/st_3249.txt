SkyBender is not Google s first attempt at providing Internet service from the sky . Its Project Loon , officially in development since 2013 , aims to provide 4G LTE internet via balloons traveling through Earth s stratosphere . That project has been tested in New Zealand , California , and Brazil , and Google hopes Loon can eventually provide high speed Internet to those in rural areas or in places with inconsistent coverage , as well as in the wake of disasters that would take people offline .
