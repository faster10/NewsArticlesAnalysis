As a democratic socialist and anti capitalist party , the HDP aspires to fundamentally challenge the existing Turkish Kurdish divide and other existing parameters in Turkish politics . Despite the HDP s claims that it represents the whole of Turkey , critics have accused the party of mainly representing the interests of the Kurdish minority in south eastern Turkey , where the party polls the highest . From 2013 to 2015 , the HDP participated in peace negotiations with the Turkish government on behalf of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , a separatist militant organisation , with which it is accused of having direct links . In the June 2015 general election , the party exceeded expectations by polling 13 . 12 of the vote and won 80 MPs .
