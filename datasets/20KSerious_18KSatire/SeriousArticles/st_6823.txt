The Weeknd , also known as the Canadian singer Abel Tesfaye , is often compared to Ocean for his floating falsetto and mysterious air . When he played the Red Bull Stage earlier in the afternoon , he peppered his set with cuts from his trio of popular mixtapes , beginning with House of Balloons in early 2011 and concluding with last December ' s Echoes of Silence . After a winsome " High for This , " the Balloons opener and first song many heard from Tesfaye , the singer blew an adoring kiss to the crowd .
