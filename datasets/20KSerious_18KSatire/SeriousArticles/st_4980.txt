A brokered convention , of the type that The Post reported Thursday had blinked to life on the radar screen of the Republican brass , is a convention in which the delegate ( that is , voting attendee ) votes of each of the states and territories don t add up to more than 50 percent for any one candidate . So after all of the voting and caucuses and conventions , for example , 1 , 000 of the 2 , 472 voting Republican delegates like Candidate A and 1 , 000 like Candidate B and 472 like Candidate C . There is no clear winner .
