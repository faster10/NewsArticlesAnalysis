Lord Chief Justice John Widgery , who led the 1972 inquiry , also did not consider substantial numbers of eyewitness accounts provided to his inquiry , former Prime Minister Tony Blair said when he launched the current inquiry in 1998 . New material including new eyewitness accounts , new interpretation of ballistic material , and new medical evidence , has also come to light since 1972 , Blair said . Blair ordered the inquiry to boost the struggling Northern Ireland peace process following a clamor by the victims ' relatives , but Protestant political leaders and senior officers in the Parachute Regiment whose soldiers fired the fatal shots condemned the inquiry . It was , however , instrumental in bringing about the landmark Good Friday agreement , signed later that year , that led to relative peace in the process after 30 years of violence in which almost 3 , 000 people died .
