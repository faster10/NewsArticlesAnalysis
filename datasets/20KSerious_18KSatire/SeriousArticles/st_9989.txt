According to the Baltimore Sun , when people first began to recognize Black History Month , it wasn t feasible for African Americans to travel safely and comfortably as it is today . Then , in 1936 , an African American man from Harlem published a book called The Negro Motorist Green Book , which served as the first official black travel guide for hotels , restaurants , and gas stations that were welcoming to African Americans . The guide was used until the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 .
