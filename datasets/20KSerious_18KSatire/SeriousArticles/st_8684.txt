The problem , again , is that all minutes are not created equal . Sure , if you play an older player 40 minutes one night and 10 minutes the next , that ' s 25 minutes a night . Technically . But the 40 minute night completely broke the guy . That ' s getting around the point of managing minutes in the first place . It ' s not about what it looks like on paper . It ' s about what it looks like on the court . Kobe can barely walk . After one game he said he was going to have a hard time getting out to his car . Scott should know this .
