Wiz is a real good friend of John s . He talked to him and a few other guys on a serious level about Go Hard Or Go Home and how it made him think about his family and Amber . He wanted her to see his performance and listen to it so they could be on a level where no hard feelings were being shared . The gesture of having her listen to the song was the only thing he has done to get them to talk more and actually start the reconciliation process . It was his conversation with John and the others that was the start of everything .
