Yeah , that was The Night Stalker . Which was a crazy experience . I don t know if you know the backstory . Frank Spotnitz , who was an old X Files guy , was running it . And we were told , the first day , that even though we were doing a remake of The Night Stalker , we weren t allowed to do stories about monsters . Or even use the word monster . And we just couldn t believe it , cause that didn t make any sense . Why you would do a remake of a show about a man searching for monsters , and then not be able to use any monsters ?
