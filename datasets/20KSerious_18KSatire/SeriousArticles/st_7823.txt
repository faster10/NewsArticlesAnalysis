The comeback did not occur all at once , but several factors allowed the Warriors to gain a foothold in the second quarter .

That process became easier with the reintroduction of Stephen Curry , who was forced to the bench early due to foul trouble . The Clippers still led 68 54 at the half , but the margin seemed manageable for a Warriors group prone to going on big runs .
