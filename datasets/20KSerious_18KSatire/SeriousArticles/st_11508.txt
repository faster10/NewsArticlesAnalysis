It s an image for everyone . It s not my image ? it s not a piece of work that I m proud of or anything ? I didn t create it to get credit or benefit from it . I just wanted to express myself , and from experience I know that through social media people like expressing themselves , or need to express themselves . It is somehow quite organic , the way these things go ? you can t really plan on it . I would just say that if people have used it so much , and if they felt like it was useful for them to share , then the image worked and I m happy , so to speak , even though happiness is not really a thought that springs to my mind in such horrible times .
