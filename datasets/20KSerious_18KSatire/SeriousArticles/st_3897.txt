Skyler and Marie : Skyler just recently went into remission after having battled lung cancer . She blames the stress of being married to Walt for her smoking , much like Marie blames her recent shop lifting adventures on how she still misses Hank . But all in all , the sisters are doing well . They live together in a beautiful California home . Skyler has taken to swimming in the morning to start off her day , and she spends the rest of it writing ( and still drinking a little too much ) . She ' s currently writing her second book , a follow up to the story of a chemistry teacher who started cooking meth to make money for his family . The first one ended with the main characters getting involved with a drug lord , and the second one picks up with a flash forward to a plane crash . She calls the series Breaking Bad . It ' s growing more popular with each book .
