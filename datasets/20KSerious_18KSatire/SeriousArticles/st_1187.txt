Let s start with Album of the Year . The most acclaimed album of this year by almost any metric , Kendrick Lamar s hip hop epic To Pimp a Butterfly , is nominated for Album of the Year , and Lamar leads all nominees with a well earned 11 nominations . My favorite album of last year , Taylor Swift s 1989 is also , of course , nominated , just as surely as the sun did rise this morning . ( The album s best song , Blank Space , is also nominated for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year . ) The Weeknd s Beauty Behind the Madness cemented his bid to being 2015 R B s closest thing to Michael Jackson , and he deserves all seven of his nominations ( especially Record of the Year for Can t Feel My Face ) . A few weeks ago Chris Stapleton shocked the Country Music Association Awards by stealing the night with his album Traveller , my favorite country album of the year , and it s no less a surprise that he managed to find his way into the big leagues here . Rounding out the category , it s a delight to see that the only puzzling pick is still a really good album : Alabama Shakes Sound Color , an LP that s not exactly game changing , but which is hard to see anyone truly disliking . ( In an extraordinarily weak year for rock , Sound Color may have been graded on a curve . )
