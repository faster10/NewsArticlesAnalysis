The world is a dangerous place . We can ' t afford another commander in chief with no foreign policy experience who doesn ' t understand America ' s role in the world . As the governor of Wisconsin as opposed to U . S . senator ( Rand Paul , Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz ) or a former U . N . ambassador ( John Bolton ) Walker ' s diplomatic experience is limited to settling disputes with Minnesota during football season . He would be learning on the job while rogue actors like ISIS , Iran , Russia and North Korea threaten Americans , create unrest and perpetuate acts of terror . There are times to look to the states and elect leaders who can focus the nation ' s attention on domestic priorities like the economy , and there are times to look for leaders with a firm handle on foreign policy because the stakes are too high to gamble on that front . Guess which era we ' re living in .
