I opened the door of the building , he said . There was a man lying on the pavement . With another man I ve not seen since , we pulled him into the hall for shelter . I must have been hit by the bullet at that moment . I remember feeling what felt like a firecracker explode against my left arm , and I saw it was pouring blood . I think the gunman was at the window of the Bataclan . We went to a couple of neighbours who live on the fourth floor . The guy we had taken in had a bullet in his leg . He s an American . He was vomiting , he was cold , we thought he was going to die . We called the fire service , but they couldn t evacuate us . I called a friend who s a doctor , she explained how to make a tourniquet with my shirt . So we remained stuck there until the assault took place and the special forces came to look for us .
