My David Bowie is not dead . Nor ever can be . What he gave to me is forever mine because he formed me . I have absolute clarity about that , I need no lamentations from politicians or TV presenters with their dim memories of his hits . I need no ranking of whether he was up there with Dylan or Lennon because I just know that is a dumb question . I simply know . He was my lodestar : in the years when I was trying to become myself , he showed me the endless possibilities . He extended out into the new spaces , metaphorically and physically . That man could move .
