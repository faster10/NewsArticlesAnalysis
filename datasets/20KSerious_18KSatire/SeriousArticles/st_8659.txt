OK , so he has not signed the lucrative new contract that the club have put in front of him . Not yet , anyway . Given that he has more than two years left on his existing one , that is hardly a heinous act or a trigger for angst . He wants to wait to the end of the season , he says . So let him . He gave an interview to the BBC that he had not cleared with the club . Not particularly clever , admittedly . And , yes , the reference to being ' flattered ' by Arsenal ' s interest , particularly coming a couple of days before the clash between the two teams at the Emirates , was na ve . But the content of what he said was hardly incendiary .
