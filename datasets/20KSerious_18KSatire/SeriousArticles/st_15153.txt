As someone who has spent most of the past 25 years of his professional life in the US government , think tanks and academia trying to stop the North Korean nuclear weapons programme , I found last week s nuclear test and the events that followed depressingly familiar . They reminded me of Captain Renault s famous line from Casablanca just before he shuts down Rick s Cafe : I m shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here ! The reactions to North Korea s 2006 , 2009 and 2013 nuclear tests were the same ? shock . Yet a decade has gone by and the North Korean nuclear threat has only grown .
