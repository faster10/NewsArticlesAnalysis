Steven Soderbergh ' s " Haywire " started its run in fifth place , pulling in 9 million . The film , which features former MMA fighter Gina Carano , earned a dismal " D " CinemaScore grade , despite strong critical reviews overall . ( Another well reviewed action film , " Drive , " earned a similarly unenthusiastic " C " grade a few months back . ) Relativity shelled out 23 million on the film , but " Haywire " will have to work hard to earn that number back at the box office . ( Also , let ' s please ignore the inevitable discussion of whether women can open action movies at the box office and look at this week ' s number one film . Cool ? )
