In the past couple of years , the political influence of Frank Gaffney , who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as one of America s most notorious Islamophobes , appeared to be on the wane . In 2011 , he was banned from the Conservative Political Action Conference after claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated the group organizing the event . The next year , Gaffney , who was advising Michele Bachmann on foreign policy , concocted a theory that the Muslim Brotherhood had penetrated the State Department via Huma Abedin , Hillary Clinton s aide . When five members of Congress , including Bachmann , asked for an investigation of the conspiracy , leaders of the Republican Party , including then ? House Speaker John Boehner , forcefully rebuked them . ( Soon Bachmann would leave Congress , depriving Gaffney of an important political collaborator . ) The most recent Republican nominee for president , Mitt Romney , largely refused to countenance Gaffney style anti Sharia conspiracy theories . Chris Christie smacked them down as well .
