We work very hard on consumer protection to protect over indebted borrowers from any kind of unfair or abusive practice . We work very hard to get schemes right for that . There might be an opportunity , now that we have a little bit ? more bandwidth , to shift to that area , to think more broadly about consumer protection and ask ourselves whether we need to be more proactive about talking about good consumer practice rather than just preventing bad practice . My successor will have to decide what his priorities are on that .
