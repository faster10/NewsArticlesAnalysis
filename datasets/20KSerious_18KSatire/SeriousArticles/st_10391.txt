But even Spotlight is something of an oddity , for a few reasons . It has no strong lead role though Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo have been put forth as lead actors , they are really part of a delicately balanced ensemble . Its taut , tick tocking pace plays more like a heist thriller than a typical , actorly drama . And as the only solidly " serious " film currently in contention , it ' s got no natural competitor , which can both help and hurt it : No one wants to default to the " safe " pick , and despite being a truly great film , Spotlight certainly feels like just that .
