Narrowing factional differences would help depoliticize Iran ' s U . S . policy . I would introduce five other steps toward normal U . S . Iran relations . First , I would use my political assets in both countries to build trust between them . I have lived in the U . S . and Iran , been a peace activist in their relations for 25 years , and I know their languages , cultures , concerns , and key policymakers . Second , I would resolve the nuclear dispute by implementing transparency measures required to convince the U . S . that a diversion toward military use will never happen . In return , I would ask that all nuclear related sanctions be lifted .
