Nights out with my newly single friend Claire are often something to behold . One time we got into a heated , alcohol fueled argument at a SoHo bar with a bunch of lawyers because one of them told me my dress was awful . The argument concluded when Claire threatened to take all the lawyers outside and " hit their faces . " Then there was the time , emboldened by a couple of glasses of white , I told a stranger his girlfriend reminded me of a prostitute I ' d seen in the paper . Claire scolded me and said I needed to work on channeling my inner Kate Middleton .
