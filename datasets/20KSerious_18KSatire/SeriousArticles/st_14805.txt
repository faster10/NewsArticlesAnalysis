Collins is 66 years old . Joe Maddon , manager of the Chicago Cubs , recently described Collins as a " minor league runt , " like himself , a description intended as a compliment . It ' s the more colorful version of " baseball lifer . " This World Series was Collins ' first , and if there was a single person in the dugout Sunday night who wanted to win worse than Harvey , it was Collins , who ' d required the better part of 50 years to arrive in late October , then early November , with a chance at something special . He had a two run lead in the ninth inning . Three outs would get him to Game 6 and a chance at Game 7 and who knows what after that . He ' d had a plan and it did not include Matt Harvey any longer .
