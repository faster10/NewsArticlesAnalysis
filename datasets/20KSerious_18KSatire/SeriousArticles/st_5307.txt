One week from today , the preliminary phase of the presidential campaign will finally be over and " primary season " will officially begin , as Iowans brave the cold weather to caucus for the candidates of their choice . For the remainder of February , the other three early voting states will hold their contests , meaning next month will see the race sharpen for both Republicans and Democrats . As things stand , both parties have two clear frontrunners : Donald Trump and Ted Cruz for the GOP Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side . At this point , both races are so close in Iowa that nobody really knows what will happen next Monday night . Will the polls turn out to be correct ? Nobody knows . Will enthusiasm trump ( pun intended ) longtime voter turnout ? It could happen on either side , and then again it might not .
