Shakeel says due to these killings , Rajan has already been sentenced to death in DCompany ' s court and will be executed soon . " Hamaare court mein maut ki saza ho chuki hai usko . Wo hum denge . Jald mauqa milega . . . inshallah , " said Shakeel . He also cited these killings as the reason why CBI had " refused " to handover Rajan to Mumbai police . " Rishtedaar lagta hai unka Rajan kya . . . jo nahi diya Mumbai police ko ? Jabki saare case wahan hai ? Jin cheh begunaah logon ko usne maara woh case bhi hain Mumbai police ke pass hi . . . Desh bhakti ka naam to isi kaam se toh leta hai woh . . . " said Shakeel sounding clearly troubled with recent developments about Rajan .
