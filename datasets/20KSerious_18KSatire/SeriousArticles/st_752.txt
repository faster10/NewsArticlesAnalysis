It s been an uneven season for Randle , the fourth year pro out of LSU . He has had some big games , but also plenty of duds , and has six games with three receptions or fewer . He s on pace to fall well shy of his numbers a year ago , when he had 71 receptions for 938 yards , though he already has four touchdown catches , two shy of his career high , from ? 2013 . With a combined four catches over the last two weeks , he couldn t think of a better time than Sunday to break out of his mini slide .
