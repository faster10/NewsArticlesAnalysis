Marvin Gaye's Family Awarded More Than $7 Million in 'Blurred Lines' Trial
UPDATE: Robin Thicke, Pharrell and T.I. have issued a joint statement in response to Tuesday's ruling. A verdict has been reached in the  "Blurred Lines " trial.   Marvin Gaye's children, Frankie and Nona Gaye, won their claim that Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams and T.I.'s song  "Blurred Lines " was too similar to their father's 1977 hit song,  "Got to Give it Up. " The jury found that the trio did infringe on Gaye's song and awarded his family nearly $7.4 million in damages. NEWS: The Final Days of the 'Blurred Lines' Trial The family originally sought $25 million in alleged damages, though the song reportedly made $16,675,690 in profits â€“ the biggest hit of 2013. According to court documents, $5,658,214 went to Thicke, $5,153,457 to Williams, and $704,774 to T.I. The remaining amount went to record companies Interscope, UMG Distribution and Star Trak. Pharrell acknowledged in court that  "Blurred Lines " has the  "feel " of  "Got to Give it Up, " but he pointed out that  "feel " does not necessarily equal  "infringement. "    Following the ruling, Thicke, Pharrell and T.I.'s reps issued a joint statement expressing their clients' disappointment in the verdict.   "While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward, " it read.
