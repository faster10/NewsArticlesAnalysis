The Syrian body politic is in the process of slow motion dismemberment , for the head of state has lost quite a few of his extremities . Yet Assad is clinging to power in this shrunken entity , fearful of what might happen to his physical body and those of his family and colleagues if he should leave power , voluntarily or involuntarily . Images of the end days of Saddam Hussein ( hanged ) and Muammar Gadhafi ( beaten , sodomized with a bayonet , and shot to death ) are surely uppermost in his mind . Prison , exile , and answering charges in front of the International Criminal Court are only slightly less palatable scenarios .
