The Broncos must continue to mount a solid ground attack with C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman to help compensate for Manning s physical limitations . Denver was held to a 3 . 3 yard rushing average by the Steelers , but the Broncos enjoyed a second half edge in time of possession and gradually wore down Pittsburgh s defense with 20 carries in the final two quarters . Although the Patriots surrendered a season high 179 rushing yards in the Week 11 meeting , Jamie Collins missed the game with illness and fellow standout linebacker Dont a Hightower was sidelined by a knee injury in the second quarter . The Broncos gained only 43 yards on 15 carries with Hightower in the game . When he was out , Denver posted 136 yards and three touchdowns on 17 attempts . That includes Anderson s game winning 48 yard scoring jaunt in overtime . Collins and Hightower are both back for the Patriots , although New England s linebacker depth took a hit Tuesday when backup Jerod Mayo was placed on injured reserve .
