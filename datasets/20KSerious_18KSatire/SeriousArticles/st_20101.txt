When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned on October 10 , 1973 , as part of a plea bargain involving corruption , Gerald Ford was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the 25th amendment . The following year Richard Nixon resigned , and Ford became president . Just eight years earlier , as an undergraduate at UCLA , I had met the affable Ford , then House Minority Leader , when he spoke on campus . I could not imagine this nice but unimpressive man would ever be president , but such are the accidents of history . As president he would be remembered for the silly " Whip Inflation Now " ( WIN ) campaign .
