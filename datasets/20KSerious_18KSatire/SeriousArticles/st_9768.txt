Another , which on its face is quite plausible , is that Romney stuffed far more into his retirement plans each year than the maximum allowed by law by claiming that the stock of the Bain company deals that the retirement plan acquired had only a nominal value . He presumably would have done so by relying on a special IRS " safe harbor " rule relating to the taxation of a service partner ' s receipt of such interests , but that rule emphatically does not apply to an interest when sold to a retirement plan , which is supposed to be measured by its true fair market value .
