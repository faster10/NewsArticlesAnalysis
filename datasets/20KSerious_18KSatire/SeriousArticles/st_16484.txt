Finally , at 11 : 40 am ET today , President Obama delivers remarks at the White House on his executive actions on gun control . Despite the rhetoric , however , Obama s actions are relatively small ball . Mr Obama will clarify that existing laws require anyone making a living by selling guns to register as a licensed gun dealer and conduct background checks . White House officials said the president would note that criminal penalties already exist for violating those laws , the ? New York Times notes . Also : Mr Obama will hire more personnel to process background checks in a timely manner , direct officials to conduct more gun research , improve the information in the background check system , encourage more domestic violence prosecutions and order better tracking of lost guns . If the gun fight is about substance ( with overwhelming majorities supporting background checks ) , that s a fight the Obama White House ( and Democrats ) can win . If it s about the process ( Obama going around Congress back and doing it his own way ) , that s a fight Republicans and the gun lobby can win .
