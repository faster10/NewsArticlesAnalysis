No . But I think we also need to be realistic about the limits of human memory . You ' ve done narrative journalism . So have I . And one thing you quickly realize when you report these kinds of stories is that personal recollection is almost never perfect . Sometimes people are trying to deceive . Sometimes they simply don t remember that well . Sometimes their version of the truth is , at best , partial . That ' s why , when you report , you try so hard to seek out multiple sources and find confirmation of facts and anecdotes . That doesn t happen with memoirs , particularly in a case like this , where you have a ghostwriter . Maybe in this case Carson exaggerated or boasted when he first told the story , or maybe the ghostwriter embellished or wasn ' t able to fact check . Whatever . This was forty something years ago , right ? After all this time , Carson probably doesn ' t even remember the meeting . Whatever ended up on that page has probably shaped his recollections .
