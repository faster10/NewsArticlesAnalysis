The list goes on : Carly Fiorina briefly soared after describing bloody mayhem in dramatic detail in the last debate , but as much as Republicans love that sort of thing , for some reason her popularity didn t last . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was the designated rude bro until Trump trumped him . Kooky ? Ohio Governor John Kasich ? decided to demonstrate his craziness by ? calling all the other candidates ( and by implication their supporters ) crazy . ? And Iowans obviously figure that previous winners Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum failed to make the most of their opportunities so the two ? are getting no love this time . And Lindsey Graham , Bobby Jindal and George Pataki ? Never mind .
