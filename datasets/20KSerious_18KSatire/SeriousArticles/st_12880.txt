Poll added last night : ' These stats will provide little succour for the millions who have watched games scarred by poor decisions . It ' s typical of Mike Riley , an accountant by profession , to hide behind statistics . People would think more of him if he came out from behind his statistical smokescreen and faced his critics . I believe these stats to be flawed as they don ' t record non decisions . For example , Rob Green ' s handball won ' t be included as the referee played on instead of giving a free kick .
