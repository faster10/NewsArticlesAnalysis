DLPT professor Dr Appa Rao says in the west polyphosphates and nitrates are added to meat to give it a reddish brown colour and increase shelf life . " Nitrates make meat look more appetising but if they are above permissible limits they can release carcinogens during the cooking process , " Dr Rao said . " Also , most processed meat are semi cooked , which means not all the micro organisms are destroyed . Red meat by nature are packed with nutrition and antioxidants , need to be cooked well . "
