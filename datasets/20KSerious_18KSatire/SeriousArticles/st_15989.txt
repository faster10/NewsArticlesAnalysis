And so Trump is negotiating with networks for the terms for his participation in the debates . He knows how bad they want him there , and therefore he is going it alone instead of cooperating with the RNC and other Republican candidates . Throughout most of the twentieth century , television networks did not make ( or expect to make ) profit off of their news broadcasts . News was a kind of public service , and it was more about gaining prestige than making money ? that was for sitcoms and game shows to do . But as the internet has made it harder for networks to profit off of their ( increasingly expensive ) programming , and the news opinion business has been flooded with competition , the need for ratings ( or clicks online ) has become more imperative . In other words , news has become fully embedded into our consumerist society . In real life , a network would have probably taken Howard Beale off the air back in 1976 , but today ? At the very least a cable network would pick him up ( or he d get a reality show ) to exploit his mental imbalances .
