An hour before the first bell there was another small but significant victory when Klitschko was asked by Vali , who was the assigned witness to the act , to remove his bandages and then reapply the metres of protection , a process that is both time consuming and an essential part of the pre fight ritual . That can really get inside a fighter s head , it s not nice , said Lennox Lewis , the former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world , from ringside . The canvas and the bandages were tiny wins , small signs that the contest was not just about Klitschko and the vast industry that he has become in Germany . ?
