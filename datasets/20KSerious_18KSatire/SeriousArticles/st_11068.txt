When the more sympathetic Lupin transforms into a werewolf and threatens the trio of Harry , Hermione , and Ron , Rickman s Snape shields them . The ongoing insults that drip from Snape s mouth in the book are either absent in the film adaptations or somehow more believable . Rickman s Snape is dignified . He is justified . Even when he engages in mild corporal punishment ( Goblet of Fire film ) , it is elegant : witnessing Harry and Ron continuing to discuss their lack of dates for the Yule Ball rather than do their homework in silence , he rolls his eyes , tugs on his sleeves , and presses their heads towards the desk . It is funny , rather than cruel unlike a narrative mediated through Harry s eyes , we are on Snape s side here .
