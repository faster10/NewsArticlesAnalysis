As always , it ' s hard to figure out exactly what Clinton is doing ? he doesn ' t make a habit of reading out his conversations with his wife to anyone . But people close to the Clintons tell POLITICO it ' s not unusual for him to sit in on big meetings or even participate in conference calls with senior staff from time to time . He ' s motivated by his belief that Hillary belongs in the Oval Office , but he ' s also eager to undo any negative impact he had on the campaign last time around . And unlike 2008 ? when the campaign ' s top staff were loyalists to his wife ? his new role is enhanced by strong personal ties with campaign chairman John Podesta , his former chief of staff at the White House , and campaign manager Robby Mook , with whom he developed a personal bond when Mook ran the campaign of his good friend , Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe .
