David Glass took over as Royals chairman in September 1993 , shortly after the death of founding owner Ewing Kauffman . ? Pursuant to ? Kauffman s succession plan , the team was offered for sale to Kansas City interests with the proceeds set to go to charity . There were years of limbo in which Glass attempted to sell the team and he eventually found a buyer in a group headed by Miles Prentice and which included local sports heroes like Tom Watson and Buck O Neil . That group got rejected because Prentice wasn t seen as someone who would toe Bud Selig s line . Glass , the former CEO of Wal Mart , eventually bought the team himself and has been its principle owner since 2000 , always toeing Selig s line , for all of the good and the bad that entailed .
