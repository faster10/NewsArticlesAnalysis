The predominantly African American church may be founded by an African American , it may be led on Sunday by an African American , but as you look through the crowd of these beacons of hope and faith , you will see an increasing audience that is much more reflective of our world than many would have you to believe . White , black , Hispanic , Asian nationalities from all across the world come together some to visit our churches , to enjoy our music and ministers and still others are gradually starting to join our churches . Gradually race fades into the fabric of faith and becomes less central to the overarching core of human needs in general . Is it a perfect union ? Of course not . Is there work to do ? Absolutely ! But the core message is not one that enrages , but one that encourages people to change and grow , and any other depiction is distorted and inaccurate .
