We will produce more of the energy we need to heat our homes , fill our cars , and make our economy grow . We will stop President Obama ' s war on coal , his disdain for oil , and his effort to crimp natural gas by federal regulation of the very technology that produces it . We will support nuclear and renewables , but phase out subsidies once an industry is on its feet . We will invest in energy science and research to make discoveries that can actually change our energy world . By 2020 , we will achieve North American energy independence .
