" It ' s part of your job , " he said . " I knew that coming into this league , that you ' re going to be put in those pressure situations . If you want to succeed at this level , you ' re going to have to take those risks and embrace those situations . Sunday it just didn ' t happen for me , and I ' ve got to be better than that . I ' m the first one to tell you that . But I ' ll get over it , and I ' ll be more confident going into next year . I know it sounds crazy , but I ' ll work even harder . I had that struggle early on in the year , but finished the year on a streak and a high note . For it to end that way in the playoffs , that was tough . But I ' m confident in my abilities , and I know I can continue to be elite at this level . It ' s tough . Yesterday ' s tough , but it ' s part of the job . "
