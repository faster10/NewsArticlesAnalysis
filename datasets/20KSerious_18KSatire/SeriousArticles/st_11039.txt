And so it seems that death , at Bowie ' s instigation , has had to sit up and listen and get with the times . Because without death ' s acknowledgement of life , it is out of a job . Society , it can be argued , has worked on the option of us passing away humanely , being able to slip away painlessly and peacefully . But Bowie demands further opportunity from death . For why should those with the same mental determination they displayed in life be deprived of it in the next one ? Bowie chooses to die , actively and engaged , by matching the strength of his maker . This was no submission on death ' s terms , but deciding on what he wanted to feel , not what death made him feel . I guess I never knew one could die so powerfully , confronting it with force and personal demands , like tearing up a ransom note .
