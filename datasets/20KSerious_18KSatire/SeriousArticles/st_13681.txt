I commend the governors of Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas for their sure handed response and seamless coordination with the federal government . I thank all of the wonderful volunteers who stepped forward to help their brothers and sisters in need . We know that there is still risk even after the storm has passed . So I ask citizens across the region to listen closely to local officials and follow their instructions before returning to their homes . All of us are keeping the people of the Gulf Coast in our thoughts and prayers .
