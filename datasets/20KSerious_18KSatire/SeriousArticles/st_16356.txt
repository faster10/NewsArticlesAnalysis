A second lesson from this case is how the ubiquity of social media affects the way criminal cases are investigated and prosecuted . The Steubenville case was a dramatic example of this phenomenon : The victim only knew that a crime had been committed against her because she was featured in online photos and posts . Much of this online material was inadmissible in court . ( For example , the infamous 12 minute video in which a person at the party jokes about the rape did much to increase public outrage , but would be rejected as hearsay in court . )
