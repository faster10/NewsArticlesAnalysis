That is why lots of us have dogs ( and , for the record , neutering is a good thing ) . But when you have a dog played by a woman and rendered in human terms , this still is an awkward moment . You ' ve got a woman in some pain obliged to be nice to a guy who , on some level , just caused it . You can make the metaphoric leap , kinda . But the moment is still emblematic of some of the tricky aspects of a comedy that now feels , well , problematic ? not in an inter species way but in matters of gender .
