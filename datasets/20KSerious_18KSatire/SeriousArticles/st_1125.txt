Pollsters use the margin of error to describe how much error there might be in a poll estimate due to random sampling . It s almost always calculated at the 95 percent confidence level . This means that for a poll with a margin of error of 4 percentage points , you could conduct the same poll 100 more times with 100 different random samples and the results would still end up within a 4 point range in 95 of the polls . There are many other sources of potential polling error that are not included in a margin of error , but basic sampling error is the most easily calculated and the most often reported . ?
