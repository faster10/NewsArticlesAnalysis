I reassured the couple that if I saw a student in trouble I would help , but explained that notifying parents is a surprisingly complicated matter . Help on the campus is readily available . My university , like most others , has elaborate psychological counseling services , medical clinics , and , of course , a police department . Beyond that , it has a " care network , " whose staff members " connect the dots " of information about students from a variety of sources including concerned fellow students , staff , and faculty and when need be , reach out to troubled students .
