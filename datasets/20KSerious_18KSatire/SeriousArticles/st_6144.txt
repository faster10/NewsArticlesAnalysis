They say the result of Tuesday s change will be a cleaner presentation of earnings , possibly as soon as the fourth quarter reports , which the banks will issue later this month . The problem stems from a 2007 accounting rule that allowed banks to use market prices to value some of their debt . That required the banks to record losses when the debt was considered safer and rose in value and to log gains when the debt was considered riskier and declined in value . The rationale for that odd scenario was that lower market prices make it cheaper for banks to repurchase their own debt , so the banks earnings should reflect the profits or losses they would get if they did so http : on . wsj . com 1S35aI5
