" I think Britain likes to see itself as having a bit of edge . The Sex Pistols were only recording for a couple of years , but people bought into their rebellious nature the world over . It ' s funny how this anti establishment band is now seen as one of the nation ' s great musical acts . There ' s also an element of embracing the outsider in Britain . New Order were the ultimate cult band , coming from Factory Records , a small independent record label , and being from Manchester . I would imagine most Americans aren ' t familiar with bands like New Order , so it ' s great to showcase them .
