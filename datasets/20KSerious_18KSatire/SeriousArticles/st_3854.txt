Adding some supporting cast spice are comedians Kenny and Keith Lucas as a pair of narcoleptically chill identical twins who live across the hall and Jillian Bell as a sarcastic grump who spews acid insults about how old Schmidt and Jenko look . One of the unexpected treats of the first film was the positioning of the Abercrombie sculpted Tatum as the unpopular loser and the brainy sack of mashed potatoes Hill as the BMOC . Here , the roles are reversed : Tatum bros down with some football stud frat boys , while Hill is shunned and forced to hang with an emo crowd that includes a beautiful coed ( Amber Stevens ) he meets when he does a bonkers poetry slam number that earns him the ( untimely ) nickname Maya Angelou ( see sidebar ) . The spoken word bit culminates in one of the film ' s best moments : a walk of shame gag in which Hill exchanges embarrassed glances with female classmates making the morning after walk across the quad . The movie could ' ve used more cracked scenes like that one .
