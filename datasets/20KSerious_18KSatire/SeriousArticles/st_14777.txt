Filmmaker Shukree Hassan Tilghman asked whether it was time to do away with Black History Month in his 2010 documentary , " More Than a Month . " Tilghman captured the controversy that surrounds who tells black history and by what terms . Some critics suggest that a one month ritual is inadequate to the task . The hashtag campaign 28daysarenotenough is being used to express the impossibility of exploring the entirety of the black past in one month ' s time . But others go further , advocating that the month should fall victim to its own success . Black history , in this view , is an established part of American history . Relegating the subject its own month segregates African American history from the " we " in " we the people . "
