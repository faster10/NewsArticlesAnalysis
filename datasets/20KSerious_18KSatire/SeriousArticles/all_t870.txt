But although it's hard to imagine a time when Chrissy and John weren't together, according to the  "All of Me " singer, it actually wasn't  "love at first sight " between the two when they met on the set of his 2007 music video for  "Stereo. "  "I'm more cautious than that, " he told Los Angeles Confidential magazine in November.  "I wasn't like, 'This is the woman Iâ€™m going to marry' from day one. For me I'm the kind of person who needs to grow into that feeling. It was probably a couple of years in when I could already see us being together forever. "  "The worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, 'There's so much more out there,' " Chrissy added.  "I played it cool for a long time. Never once did I ask, 'What are we?' Marriage was never my goal, because I've never been very traditional. I was just happy to be with him. " Clearly, these two were always meant to be in it for the long-term!
