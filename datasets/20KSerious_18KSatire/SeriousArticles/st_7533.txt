A geosynchronous 24 hour orbital period requires a very high altitude orbit . According to Newton ' s 400 year old law of gravity , orbital speed depends only on the mass of the body being orbited ( in this case , the Earth ) and the radius of the orbit ( the radius of the Earth plus the height of the satellite above the Earth ) . That ' s why Hubble , the much larger space station , the much smaller early satellites like Sputnik and Explorer I , and any other low Earth orbit satellite take only 90 minutes to circle the globe .
