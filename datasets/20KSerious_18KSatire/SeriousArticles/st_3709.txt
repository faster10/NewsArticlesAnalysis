Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls , ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non citizen voter fraud . Under the purge procedure , Florida ' s immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status , hearing dates , requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents . The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens , despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project , Latino Justice , other national voting rights groups , and Florida based Latino and Haitian American community groups .
