The U . S . statute in 1790 provided that children of citizens of the United States that are born abroad shall be considered as natural born Citizens . ? This has been thought the strongest evidence for Cruz s position since so many 1790 congressmen had participated in the Constitutional Convention . ? However , this statute did not say these children were ? natural born citizens . ? It instead carefully said they shall be considered as natural born citizens , suggesting that Congress thought they were not natural born citizens but should be treated as such . ? Indeed , there would have been no need to pass the statute if they were already understood to be natural born citizens .
