Feinstein worries about Mideast turmoil
Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she has ongoing concerns about the future of several Middle Eastern countries, including Afghanistan and Syria. The California Democrat, who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this is a very difficult time to have so many ongoing and potential conflicts in the same region, but it may be time for the U.S. to reassess its actions there.

There have been two wars in Iraq, and there has been the Afghanistan war,” she said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I do think we need to look more deeply and broadly into what we’re doing and how we’re doing it.” Afghanistan’s new president, she said, is off to a “good start,” but she has concerns about the ongoing actions of the Taliban and new moves Al Quida of Pakistan might make. “I’m one of the Democrats who doesn’t see a rapid pullout of American troops as being beneficial,” she said about Afghanistan. Feinstein also suggested U.S. military operations were not making a difference in Syria. “Initially, the point was to do this to the extent you got Iran and Russia to bring the Syrians to the table and have a political solution,” she said. “I think post people believe a political solution is necessary, but we aren’t there.”
