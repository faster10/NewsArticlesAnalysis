Left unanswered is where Australian authorities who bear responsibility for the asylum seekers at all stages would send surplus asylum seekers for processing if PNG facilities could no longer cope , as is likely to be the case . Due to a 2011 High Court decision which invalidated the " Malaysia Solution " proposed by previous Labor leader Julia Gillard , Canberra cannot legally send Australia bound asylum seekers to countries that are not signatories to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol . As PNG and the Philippines are the only signatories among Australia ' s neighbors , the suspicion is that Australia bound boat people who cannot be processed by PNG will have to be processed under Australian jurisdiction and resettled in the country if found to be refugees which is precisely why growing numbers of boat people are arriving in the first place .
