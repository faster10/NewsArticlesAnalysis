Why it Wasn ' t Nominated : EW ' s Owen Gleiberman gave the movie an A , so we could pretend this had an actual chance to follow in The Full Monty ' s footsteps and garner a nod as one of the year ' s Top 10 ( or nine ) best pictures . But even with Soderbergh ' s name attached , no one wanted to take this film seriously . ( Especially the people who paid to see it multiple times even though they thought there wasn ' t enough stripping and that Cody Horn , as Tatum ' s love interest , was way too wooden . )
