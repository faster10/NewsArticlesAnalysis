Can the Redskins pressure quarterback Aaron Rodgers ? The Green Bay offensive line is still far from healthy , particularly left tackle David Bakhtiari . With Bakhtiari out the last two games with an ankle injury , Rodgers was sacked 13 times . The Green Bay quarterback has also been dropped 46 times this season , second most behind Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles . The Redskins have sacked opposing quarterbacks 14 times in the last three games ? including five from rookie outside linebacker Preston Smith . While the Redskins have veteran rushers in defensive ends Jason Hatcher and Chris Baker and outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan , Smith s recent outburst has helped bring a balanced rush , which will be key when trying to contain the Green Bay quarterback .
