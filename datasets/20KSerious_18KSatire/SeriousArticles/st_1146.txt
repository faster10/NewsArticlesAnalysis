When you are married to someone who grew up on an island with palm trees , it is hard to convince them the Jersey Shore is a worthy alternative . But I finally convinced my wife to go there for a family reunion when she was newly pregnant with our first child . We arrived when it was dark , and the cool , late summer air was damp with the ocean spray . I insisted that she walk up to the beach with me , and when we got there we turned , looked north and I showed her the boardwalk pier stretching out over the water , with a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster lighting up the night sky over the black ocean .
