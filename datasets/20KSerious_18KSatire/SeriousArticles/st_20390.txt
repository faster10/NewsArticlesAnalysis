Peter Kwok fits almost perfectly in Bayne ' s first description . This businessman from Hong Kong bought the Chateau Haut Brisson in 1997 , in the Bordeaux village of Saint Emilion . He has since then " invested more and more to increase the quality and the size of the vineyard , " says Charles Lemoine , in charge of wine marketing for Kwok . " He comes three to five times a year , " adds Lemoine , who describes Kwok as having a real passion for French wine . Indeed Kwok is not just a distant vineyard owner : his love for wine has become a family matter and his children are now very much involved in the business .
