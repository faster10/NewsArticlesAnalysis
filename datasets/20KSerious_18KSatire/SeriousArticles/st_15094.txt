Perhaps even Benn had been blindsided by Benn . Nothing he had ever done before had come close to this . Maybe Andy Warhol was right , after all everyone really does get their 15 minutes of fame . It was an OK speech , I suppose , he said to colleagues afterwards , nerdishly unaware of the effect he had had . It was a response worthy of Philip Hammond , the foreign secretary , who had been left with the unenviable task of following Benn with his own 15 minutes of total anticlimax . Hammond would have been better off just saying , I agree with Hilary and sitting back down sharpish .
