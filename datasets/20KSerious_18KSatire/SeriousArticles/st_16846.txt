I admit that I was intrigued by Donald Trump as a candidate , at first . In fact , I invited him to give his first speech as a potential candidate in 2011 at the Conservative Political Action Conference at the invitation of GOProud , the organization for gay conservatives I co founded and led . That was before he launched into his cultural division strategy by trying to demonize his potential opponent in that race , President Barack Obama . Trump was the ringleader of the birther movement , the campaign to convince voters that the president was actually born in Kenya , not his native Hawaii . His message was that Obama was not one of us .
