Japan , once called an " unsinkable aircraft carrier , " remains critical to U . S . basing strategy in the Asia Pacific . Some 30 , 000 U . S . forces will remain based in Japan , about the same number as in Korea . The number is higher if you count U . S . forces afloat . But as prosperous Japan and South Korea assume more responsibilities for their defense , the United States has a strategic , fiscal , and operational need to redistribute its assets . The growing importance of islands , from Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands to Hawaii and other islands that will be used for prepositioning and training , helps build flexibility in the American Pacific strategy .
