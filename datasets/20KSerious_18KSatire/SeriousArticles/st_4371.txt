I am an adamant opponent of physicians ever becoming agents of death . The lessons of the Holocaust , which began with a euthanasia program , are that once medical professionals become accustomed to administering death , we have created a frightening corps of people whose very " medical " prestige facilitates mass killing of the vulnerable . Hence I oppose physician involvement in capital punishment ( via lethal injection ) and all forms of euthanasia in which physicians are actively involved .
