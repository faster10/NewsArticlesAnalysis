The other actors aren t exactly spring chickens either ? David Thewlis ( Lupin ) , Gary Oldman ( Black ) and Timothy Spall ( Wormtail ) are all in their fifties now . Except that Lupin is supposed to look older than he is , and shabby as a werewolf he s found it difficult to find work and the monthly transformations take their toll . Black has spent 13 years in the wizard prison , Azkaban , for a crime he didn t commit , while Pettigrew has lived first as a rat and then in hiding as Voldemort s loyal aide . They can be forgiven for looking , as we say in this country , a bit shook .
