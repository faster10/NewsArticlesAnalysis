Practically every major city in the world is home to people sleeping in the streets . An estimate of homelessness in Paris about a decade ago put the number there at 12 , 000 . Up to date figures are bitterly disputed . The consensus among advocates is that numbers have climbed significantly . In the United States , 2010 census figures show some of the highest percentages of " street homeless " in California . According to those figures , New York has one homeless person for every 2 , 506 people , compared with one for every 259 in San Francisco .
