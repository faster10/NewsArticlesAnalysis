But that ' s only half the story . Florida ' s Latino population was once made up almost entirely of conservative Cuban Americans in South Florida , around Miami , who almost always vote Republican . But in a dramatic change , it now also contains a large number of liberal Puerto Ricans in central Florida , around Orlando , who are more likely to vote Democratic . Mix in large numbers of Nicaraguans , Mexicans and Brazilians and you have a spicy Latin stew that won ' t be easy to pander to with one message .
