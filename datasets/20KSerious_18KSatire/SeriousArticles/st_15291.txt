The final model is the one used by Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and George W . Bush . Each of these candidates did send clear signals to the right that they would be an integral part of the coalition . None of these candidates fully distanced themselves from right wing forces , yet their campaigns focused on broader themes that were attractive to a much bigger part of the population .
