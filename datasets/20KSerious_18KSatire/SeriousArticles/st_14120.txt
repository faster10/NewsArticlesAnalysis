Derrick Henry has been the constant , with Saturday marking the fourth time he s rushed for 200 yards in a game this season . But even his role is a departure from years past . Instead of having the usual two back system ( see : Mark Ingram Trent Richardson , Eddie Lacy T . J . Yeldon , etc . ) , Henry s had to do it on his own with sidekick Kenyan Drake sidelined with an injury . With two projected starters at wide receiver done for the year ( Robert Foster , Chris Black ) and a first time starter under center , the offense had to be built around Henry , who has become the leading Heisman Trophy contender .
