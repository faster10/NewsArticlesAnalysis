My general sense of what is happening in the U . S . is that we have a decade long challenge with rising costs and stagnant wages . That is making both parties angrier . My view is that in response to that sort of economic challenges , Democrats are more angry about inequality , Wall Street greed , the wealthy taking a bigger share , but on the right , the anger about declining economic prospects for the middle class is really focused on external groups , whether it is immigrants , which Donald Trump spoke a lot about in the beginning of this election , and then Muslims that he began speaking more and more about after the Paris attacks and San Bernardino . What is clear is the racial and religious intolerance of the Right is not supported by a majority of Americans . It is clearly a majority among Republicans , but for instance if you look at what Mr Trump said about monitoring Muslims etc , most Americans , Democrats and independents think that is utterly wrong . So Mr Trump may be speaking for a majority of the Republicans but it is only a small minority of America .
