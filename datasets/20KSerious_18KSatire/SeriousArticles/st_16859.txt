Sanders supporters don t see it that way . They prefer a health care system without insurance company middlemen . They prefer a structural redesign of the financial system , with banks focused narrowly on core activities and unable to wield as much political power or use the government safety net as a gambling stake . They prefer universal benefits for higher education or retirement security or family leave , rather than means testing . They think differently about how the economy should be structured .
