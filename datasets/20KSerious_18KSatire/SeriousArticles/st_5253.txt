It seems Mr Trump ' s hindsight is a perfect 20 20 . He bloviates with the best of them , but his utter disregard for or ignorance of the facts on many issues makes him dangerous . He blames President George W . Bush , despite the Commission ' s conclusions . But we know it is purely for political gain because he chooses to blame his opponent ' s brother instead of many others the Commission considered and properly exonerated , from the Clinton Administration to the FBI to the CIA to the FAA . Do we want a President who is so cavalier and ignorant about the most serious crisis to face our country since the end of the Cold War ?
