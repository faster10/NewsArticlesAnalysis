Introduced in 1981 , ACE inhibitors work by slowing down the body ' s angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) . When left untreated , the enzyme can produce a peptide that causes muscle constriction around blood vessels . That kind of constriction can set off a chain reaction whereby a person ' s blood vessels narrow and his or her blood pressure shoots through the roof , leading to greater risk of heart attack and other ailments . Because the ACE inhibitors can stop this domino effect , they ' re frequently used to treat millions of men and women with high blood pressure .
