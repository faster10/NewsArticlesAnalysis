Rubio and Bush are fighting for the same slice of the Republican electorate and donor class , but Rubio seems to be less of a problem for Bush ' s campaign than Bush . In a new McClatchy Marist poll , 58 percent of Republican voters said the more they learned about Rubio , the more they liked him , with 27 percent saying they liked him less . For Bush , those numbers are upside down : 58 percent said they like him less the more they learn , versus 32 percent who liked him more . That poll was conducted Oct . 29 to Nov . 4 , right after the last debate . We ' ll find out Tuesday night if Bush will try to strike again . You can read more about the Bush camp ' s planned assault at The New York Times . Peter Weber
