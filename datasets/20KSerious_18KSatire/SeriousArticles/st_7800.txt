One of the hardest parts of writing about global warming ? and there are lots and lots of hard parts ? is simply keeping up with the news . Much of it comes in short newsy bits , worth knowing but difficult to write about as an individual full post . Since the 2015 U . N . Climate Change Conference is being held in Paris this week , I m posting a weeklong series of shorter articles about global warming and its fallout . ? You can also read ? Part 1 . And read all of Slate s coverage of the Paris climate talks here . ?
