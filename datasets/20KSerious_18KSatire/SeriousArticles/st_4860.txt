Further evidence of Garrido ' s mental illness is his repeated contact with the news media , according to his attorneys . " Contacting the media against the advice of counsel when one is facing criminal charges as serious as these shows an inability to cooperate with counsel and an inability to appreciate the function of the criminal justice system , " the attorneys said . " In short , Mr Garrido ' s contacts with the media , when his attorney tells him not to have them , are not manipulations at all , but evidence that he may not be competent to be a defendant . "
