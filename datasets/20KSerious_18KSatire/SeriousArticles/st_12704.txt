Earlier in this month , Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj s visit to Pakistan observably overshadowed the Heart of Asia conference held in Pakistan to seek diplomatic and peaceful solution of current Afghan problems . During her stay in Pakistan , both countries formally agreed to resume the suspended Pak India dialogue process . In fact , India has been proactively determining the time , manner and agenda of the talks between the two countries . It has unilaterally suspended these talks many times without assigning any plausible reason . It generally chooses to resume these talks at whatever time best suits it . On the other hand , always waiting for India to make a move , Pakistan s diplomacy towards India has been quite passive and reactive . Last year s Indian decision to suspend scheduled foreign secretary level talks , the Ufa Declaration , this month s decision to resume bilateral dialogue , PM Modi s recent Lahore visit are the most recent instances of this very fact .
