Mike German , a national security fellow at New York University Law School and a former FBI agent , said the government s model to predict who will become a terrorist is flawed , partly because it focuses too much on those who adhere to a radical or extreme ideology . Certainly some of the people who become terrorists have expressed extreme thoughts before , but it s a not a causal factor , German said . There are many times more people holding radical beliefs who never engage in violent activity . The Obama administration , mindful of the problem , has created an initiative called Countering Violent Extremism that encourages communities to steer vulnerable young adults away from radicalization , though it s unclear how successful that effort is .
