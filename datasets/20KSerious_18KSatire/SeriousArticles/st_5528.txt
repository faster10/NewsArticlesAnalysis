Sure , the overnight figure can ' t compare to the 43 . 5 million that " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 " conjured up at midnight shows last year ( on its way to 169 . 3 million the highest opening weekend of all time ) , or the 30 . 3 million that " The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn Part 1 " found at midnight on its way to 138 . 1 million , but it ' s likely that " The Hunger Games , " which doesn ' t have the same amount of built in sequel anticipation , won ' t face the same weekend frontloadedness as those titles . Saturday and Sunday grosses should prove quite sturdy . Back in 2008 , " The Dark Knight " earned 18 . 5 million at midnight , but still managed a stunning 158 million debut the second highest debut of all time proving that not every blockbuster makes a full 25 percent of its opening weekend gross at midnight .
