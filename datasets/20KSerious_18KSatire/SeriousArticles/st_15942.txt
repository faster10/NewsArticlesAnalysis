Cruz s crowd was much younger and intergenerational ? this in addition to the elementary the class that sat at his feet . I sat next to a family where four generations were present . Mixed throughout the crowd were young couples with multiple children , anxious to hear Cruz s message . While Bush had jogged from the back of the coffee shop to the front of the room to loud applause , Cruz quietly snuck in the back , and slowly made his way into the center of the crowd unnoticed , to finish watching Heidi s introduction with the rest of us .
