Cory Gardner , who had opposed immigration reform , was able to transform himself as a candidate by addressing the issues and focusing on compromise . Perhaps this helps explain why incumbent Mark Udall , who largely ignored the issue of immigration in hopes of not alienating non Latinos , lost despite 71 of Latino voters polled in Colorado having said they would vote for him . Many likely felt disinclined to vote for Udall , reflecting the reality that Latino voters are not monolithic , and their vote is up for grabs if parties and candidates speak to their issues .
