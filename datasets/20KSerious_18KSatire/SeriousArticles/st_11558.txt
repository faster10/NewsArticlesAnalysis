I respect all opponents , said tackle Andrew Whitworth . I always have . I have a ton of respect for the Steelers . ( Coach Mike ) Tomlin and I had a big hug at the end of the game , just apologizing for everything that happened . I ' ve got a ton of respect for those guys . Joey Porter is not one of them . He ' s not one of the guys I respect very much . He ' s a guy that has always run his mouth . He ' s always been disrespectful to people . In the first game here , he was out at midfield M Fing everybody , wanting to fight . And then doing that in this game . He ' s not a football player anymore , he ' s a coach , so he ' s got to be held to a higher standard . I think the unprofessionalism he ' s shown is just ridiculous . It really is . So that ' s unfortunate .
