The trouble started early for the visitors . The offensively limited Bucks led 30 18 after just 10 minutes due to a combination of superior energy and hot shooting , particularly from starting guard O . J . Mayo ( 4 of 5 from deep in the first half ) . The Warriors closed the first quarter on a 10 0 run to ensure that it would not be a blowout , but the earliest portion of the game set the tone . Golden State played from behind for all but a few moments and seemed to lack the capacity for the overwhelming runs and lights out shooting displays that have made them such a handful for two seasons .
