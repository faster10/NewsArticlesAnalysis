Susan Clifton of Chalfont , Pennsylvania This is more a comment on Mr Schulz than the " Peanuts " characters . I was in my early teens and a huge hockey fan . I loved the " Peanuts " programs and coloring books and my parents told me that Charles Schulz was a big hockey fan , too . I wrote him a letter telling him of our shared interest , and before I knew it , I received a personalized letter , along with two cartoons with the " Peanuts " gang playing hockey each signed with a little note . I treasured that letter and personalized cartoons so much and always loved him for the fact that he would take the time to send them to me .
