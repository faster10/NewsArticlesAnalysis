Vanessa : And it ' s never ending , especially in this business . You ' re always going to have people that are naysayers , that don ' t believe in your talent , that don ' t believe that you have any kind of longevity . I am happy to be able to look back because the book is called " You Have No Idea , " and every time there has been a major triumph in my career , nobody ever expected it . On Broadway : " I didn ' t know she could sing and dance . " A No . 1 hit on the radio : " I had no idea that she could be a recording artist . " With " Ugly Betty " and three Emmy nominations : " I had no idea she was funny . " It is always redefining who you are and raging against the machine .
