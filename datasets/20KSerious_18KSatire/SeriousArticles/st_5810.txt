Presidential races are not a national campaign in which ? the candidate with the most votes wins . You must have a plurality of votes in enough individual states to gather at least 270 votes in the Electoral College . ? I would guess it is darn ? near impossible for Bloomberg or any other independent candidate to win a few or even any electoral votes in this election cycle . No independent candidate has won electoral votes since Alabama Gov . ? George Wallace carried five Deep South states and garnered 46 electoral votes in 1968 .
