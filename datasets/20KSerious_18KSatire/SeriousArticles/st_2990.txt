This refers to David Cameron s so called red card demand to give national parliaments an effective veto over new EU legislation . Under the plan , if 55 per cent of national Parliaments ( weighted by population ) objected to a new EU law , they could block the plan and prevent it from happening . It builds on the current yellow card system , where if a third of European Parliaments object to a measure they can require the European Commission and Council to reconsider it . But critics point out that the yellow card has been invoked only twice ( and was ignored by the Commission once ) . The 55 per cent threshold is much higher , they say , making it highly unlikely that it would be achieved .
