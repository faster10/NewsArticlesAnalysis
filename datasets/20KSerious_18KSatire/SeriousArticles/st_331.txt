There ' s no shortage of advice on how to develop an effective cover letter , but job seeker Roanald took some of that advice to the extreme .

Needless to say it ' s an entertaining read , and it impressed the cover letter ' s recipients ( Chicago bar The Aviary ) enough to get him a job . Source : The Huffington Post
