Now , 50 years after the Civil Rights Act , activists and city planners are working to redeem these boulevards of dreams deferred . In St . Louis , a retired postal worker named Melvin White teamed up with a local architecture firm to form Beloved Streets of America , which aims to make MLK streets everywhere into new sites of urban intervention .

Eventually they hope for stores , restaurants , and a recreation center .
