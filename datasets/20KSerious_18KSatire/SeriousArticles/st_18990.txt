Actor athlete Dave Bautista , a big plus in Guardians of the Galaxy , attempts to combine Bond villains Red Grant and Jaws into a steel clawed hulk named Hinx and fails . The filmmakers clearly love the line describing Bond as a kite dancing in a hurri ? cane . Or was it a candle in the wind ? I forget . The locations ? London , Rome , Austria , Tangier ? are worth the cost of entry . Yes , Bond is completely monetized , hawking clothes , shades , auto ? mobiles , booze and more , but I don t mind if the film is great .
