According to Information Week : " The PlayBook will first launch in a Wi Fi only configuration ( Sprint will sell a WiMax version this summer ) . That means the PlayBook can only snag emails and other data when in range of Wi Fi hotspots . Email , contacts , and calendar data are not ' live ' on the PlayBook as they are on a regular BlackBerry . In fact , the only way to access live corporate PIM data is to tether a BlackBerry to the PlayBook via Bluetooth . The PlayBook will then mirror whatever data is on the BlackBerry . "
