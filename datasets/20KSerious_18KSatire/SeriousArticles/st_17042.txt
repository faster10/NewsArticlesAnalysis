Humility of course is a Christian virtue , but it is also something that St . Ignatius Loyola , the 16th century founder of the Jesuits , specifically asked Jesuit priests and brothers to embrace . There are three kinds of humility , St . Ignatius said . The first is exemplified by the person who does nothing immoral . The second is the one who , when faced with honor or dishonor , is " indifferent . " The third is the person who chooses the humbler path , to be more like Jesus . Pope Francis exemplifies this " Third Degree of Humility . "
