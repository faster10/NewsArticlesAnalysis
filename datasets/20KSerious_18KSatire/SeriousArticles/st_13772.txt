To some extent , that is still true . Recently , however , some studios have hit it big by releasing movies in months in which there was little competition . For example , when the live action Alice in Wonderland film came out in 2010 , it was released in March , a traditionally quieter time at the multiplex , and did incredibly well . Oz the Great and Powerful did well in March the next year , too . And in 2014 , the animated film The Lego Movie became a blockbuster after having been released in February . ?
