The Patriots have a major advantage in that their strengths on offense jibe with the weak spots of the Broncos defense . Just as they attacked the Chiefs defensive left side last week , the Patriots will hit the middle of the Broncos defense with a full head of steam , as linebacker Brandon Marshall and safety T . J . Ward are liabilities in coverage and linebacker Danny Trevathan and safety Darian Stewart aren t very proficient in that regard , either . Plus , hobbled wounded cornerback Chris Harris will likely follow Julian Edelman , and that s a huge mismatch . The Pats couldn t dictate any matchups in Week 12 because Edelman and Danny Amendola were back in Foxboro , but they should flip that script this time around .
