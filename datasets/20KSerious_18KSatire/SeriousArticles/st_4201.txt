Anyway , for those who were watching MSNBC , what transpired was some sort of odd combination of the Jake Gyllenhaal film " Nightcrawler " and Charlie Brooker ' s Channel 4 series , " Black Mirror , " to which more and more moments in the media are becoming comparable . Viewers were treated to the sight of reporter Kerry Sanders rifling through Farook and Malik ' s belongings , with no editorial restraint whatsoever . Dude was literally just picking up household objects , shoving them in front of a camera , and broadcasting them to the whole wide world .
