There will be goblins : The star of it all is Gringotts , which in the series is a massive , goblin run bank that Harry visits to get money for his school supplies . In the real life version , visitors will be in awe of the marble lobby and cavernous passageways . They ' ll take off from here on a multi sensory thrill ride through the vaults . And the dragon that will perch atop the bank building ( reminiscent of when it escapes from the bank in the series ) really does blow a giant ball of fire quite frequently , says Mark Woodbury , president of Universal Creative .
