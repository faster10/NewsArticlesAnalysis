It ' s very interesting . I feel like years ago , there was a very different attitude around that kind of social situation with who you were sitting next to , and I can remember getting on planes and being even a little bit sort of excited and curious about who I ' d be sitting next to . You know , there would inevitably be a little bit of conversation about " How are you doing ? " and " Where are you headed ? " and I feel like that has sort of stopped in recent years . It really rarely happens anymore .
