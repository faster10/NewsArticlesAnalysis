Key player : Several players had key roles in Sunday s victory , but running back Jonathan Stewart set the tone on the first play from scrimmage . After missing the last three games of the regular season with a foot injury , the running back displayed fresh legs by racing through the middle for a 59 yard gain . Stewart had 84 of Carolina s 118 rushing yards in the first half on 11 carries . He scored two touchdowns as well . But it was that opening play burst that gave the Panthers a strong jolt of momentum .
