The Rising is real , and we are living it . It is a tribute to all who we have lost and all that we have been through . Most of all , it is the result of hard work . Yes , there have been mistakes and missteps along the way . Some would say with justification that this Freedom Tower milestone has been too long in coming , bogged down in red tape . But the path is less important than the destination . It is a towering act of defiance , reaching into the sky as evidence of our refusal to live in fear .
