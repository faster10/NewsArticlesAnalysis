Even before assuming office , Sisi was already responsible for an estimated death toll of at least 817 during the brutal clearing of a peaceful sit in in Rabaa Square on August 14 , 2013 . And under his administration the Egyptian Armed Forces operations in Sinai have reportedly killed more than 2 , 000 people so far , including an unknown number of civilians ( the Egyptian government acknowledges virtually no civilian deaths ) . The Egyptian people are so disillusioned that hardly anyone showed up to vote in the most recent parliamentary elections . Not even fatwas could get people to the polls ? and why should they vote , when Sisi s actions have made it clear that their votes do not matter ? But none of that is stopping the United States from supporting him .
