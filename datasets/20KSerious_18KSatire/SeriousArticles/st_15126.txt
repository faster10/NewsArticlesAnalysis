Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy Tuesday , less than a week after officials released dashcam video showing white police officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times . The department had refused for over a year to release the video that has since led to Van Dyke being charged with murder and sparked protests and demands for reform . Emanuel hired McCarthy in 2011 to take over the city ' s law enforcement . The mayor has also requested a " top to bottom " review of the city ' s police department .
