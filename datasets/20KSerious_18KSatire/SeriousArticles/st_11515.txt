Before the game , Chris Paul went through a shooting workout focused on pull up and spot up 3 pointers . The extra reps clearly helped , as Paul came out of the gate on fire . He scored 18 points on perfect shooting : 7 for 7 from the field , 3 for 3 from beyond the arc , and 1 for 1 from the free throw line . It was as if Curry had transferred his shooting powers to Paul . But Paul cooled down , scoring only five points in the second quarter , and 12 in the second half , finishing with 35 point for the game . For all the talk of how great Curry has been recently and rightfully so Paul showed he can still compete in his stratosphere .
