The album ' s core is still the blues . Clark dips into the historical timeline , sampling a juke joint ' s worth of 20th century styles : from the rural slide guitar picking of " Next Door Neighbor Blues " to the desolate tidings and incendiary lead guitar of " When My Train Pulls In " to the Cream y riffing and layering of " Glitter Ain ' t Gold . " But Clark won ' t be genre bound . " Ain ' t Messin ' ' Round " is pushy , updated Stax Volt soul with Clark ' s fuzztone leading the charge of a horn section . " Things Are Changin ' " makes another Memphis move with a fat Al Green style backbeat .
