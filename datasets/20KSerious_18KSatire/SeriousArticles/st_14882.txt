3 . Close second : Montreal Canadiens defenseman P . K . Subban sported a Jaromir Jagr jersey , fake Jagr mullet circa 1992 and the familiar Jofa helmet to pay homage to the Florida Panthers star during the breakaway challenge . " He had no idea , I didn ' t want to ruin the surprise for him , " Subban said . " I could see his smile when I came out , he had a pretty good smile on his face . I was just happy that he liked it and embraced it . He ' s had such a long and amazing career . I know when it ' s over for him , he ' s going to go down as one of the best players ever . Who knows , I don ' t know where this ranks in his highlights of his career but hopefully it ' s up there . " Jagr joined an on ice interview and joked that he had to talk to his mother about a brother he didn ' t know he had . Later the 43 year old said he enjoyed the getup , although he did complain there was too much gray in Subban ' s mullet . " That was very funny , no question about it , " Jagr said . " Yeah , I didn ' t know he was going to do it . It was cool . "
