My big issue , when I found out that Angie chose to stay in the house after she heard the news , was her estranged relationship with her son . Surely being by his side at a time like this is more important than anything ? I was estranged from my Mum when she died so I guess it ' s all a bit close to home for me as I can only see it from the view of Angie s son . But now is the time to build bridges , be selfless and do the right thing not for her but for her son . I actually get why , on a personal level , she might want to stay as she has a tight support network in the house now . I just feel so sad for her son . Death is so emotive and I know there are a lot of conflicting opinions on this . I ' m not saying mine s right . It s just my opinion .
