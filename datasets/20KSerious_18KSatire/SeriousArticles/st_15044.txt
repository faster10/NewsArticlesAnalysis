Founded in 1952 , the pulp magazine was the brainchild of Robert Harrison , a dapper , high living New York based publisher who made some money with 1940s soft core girlie magazines such as Titter and Wink . Pairing with editor Howard Rushmore , who had made the journey from muckraking Communist to muckraking anti Communist , Harrison relied on a formula of Hollywood scandal , redbaiting exposes and occasional investigative pieces to make Confidential , at a quarter a throw , the top newsstand seller of its time .
