? Odell Beckham Jr . can do wondrous things , but he can t do them by himself . He received virtually no help from the other receivers . Rueben Randle ( six targets , two catches for 22 yards ) continues to show he is not a legitimate starter , and Dwayne Harris used all his energy on that darting 80 yard punt return for a touchdown . ? He had little left for his 37 offensive snaps , with only one catch for eight yards . In 21 snaps , Hakeem Nicks was targeted only once and should have had an 8 yard ? touchdown ? instead of a 7 yard reception , had Manning made a better throw and Nicks run his route a yard or two deeper into the end zone . When rookie tight end Will Tye ( 3 70 ) is the most dangerous threat after Beckham , something is wrong .
