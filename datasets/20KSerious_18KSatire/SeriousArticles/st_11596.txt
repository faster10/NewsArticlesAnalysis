A few decades ago , I remember grousing to a college friend that as an Asian American male , everyone I met assumed I was studying some kind of science or engineering as if the idea that I might want to pursue a career in the arts , humanities or communications was ridiculous . My friend responded that as a 6 foot 7 African American pre med student , he would be ecstatic for someone to actually believe he had an interest in a STEM field , as opposed to , say , basketball . Back then , we laughed off the exchange as a sign of how the stereotype grass is always greener on the other side .
