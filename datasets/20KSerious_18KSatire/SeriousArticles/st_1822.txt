Well , the cutoffs themselves are great , because that first day of shooting we were in Burbank , and it was 102 degrees . It was a treat to be in the cutoffs . It ' s great , and it ' s a little surreal . I would say about half of the crew is back , the same crew from six years ago . We ' re all older and people are married , have kids now . There ' s no good way to do it . You ' re not gonna sit around on set and shoot the s for three hours and catch up . You just get there at 6 : 30 in the morning and go . And you know , an hour and a half later you ' re in front of the camera doing your first scene .
