8 . Rubio can t even balance his own checkbook . ? As Rubio waxes rhapsodic about his tax plan and other right wing economic ideas of the New American Century , reports of his disastrous personal finances will continue to dog him . Revelations ? of the fiasco ? have forced him to respond by calling himself an average guy with debt . In his 2012 memoir , he confesses to suffering from a lack of bookkeeping skills and an imperfect accounting system . While such statements may engender sympathy from some voters , others may reject economic ideas that will further impoverish the average American and have difficulty identifying with an average guy ? who still managed to buy himself an 80 , 000 ? luxury speed boat . Rubio s calls for a balanced budget amendment under these conditions will be fun to watch .
