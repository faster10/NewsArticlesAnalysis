But the fact that Kanye brought up Rose and Khalifa ' s kid ( " You wouldn ' t have a child if it wasn ' t for me " and " You own waves ? ? ? I own your child ! ! ! " ) is uncalled for . It ' s a weird statement on the surface ( vaguely hinting that Wiz ' s son is his , but wouldn ' t that also reveal that Kanye was cheating on Kim with Amber Rose ? Or it implies that Rose only had a baby with Wiz because she ' s wasn ' t with Kanye . But wouldn ' t that be Kanye openly pining for her ? If neither , how do you own another man ' s child ? ) , but it doesn ' t need much expounding on why someone ' s kid should be kept off limits . The perceived insult to his wife doesn ' t call for that type of escalation you don ' t need to machine gun to swat a fly .
