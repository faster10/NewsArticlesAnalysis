Finally , I do not believe the case has been made that there is a clear and imminent threat to our national security interests . Some say that projecting strength and showing a willingness to act against leaders who commit abuses are important enough reasons to strike Syria . A similar argument was used against Saddam Hussein , leading to the Gulf and Iraq Wars a similar argument was used against the Taliban and al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan a similar argument was used yet again against Moammar Gadhafi in Libya .
