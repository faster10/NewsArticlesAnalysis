Xavier ( 9 ) will make a run at a No . 1 seed . The Musketeers have built up a quality r sum already : road neutral wins over Michigan , USC , Dayton and Providence home wins over Cincinnati and Seton Hall . Now Xavier closes with nine games that all look winnable on paper , highlighted by Providence and Villanova at home Feb . 17 and 24 . If Chris Mack s team is a Big East regular season champion with just 2 3 losses heading into the conference tourney , it will deserve strong consideration for the top seed line .
