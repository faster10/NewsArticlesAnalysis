Connelly : A series character like Bosch can be a trap but it ' s a good trap to be in . This idea that it ' s an unfinished story with more to say . I guess I never write standalones . Even if I come up with a new character , I often bring them back . The last time I introduced a new character was " The Lincoln Lawyer , " and now that ' s going on seven or eight years . I ' m already writing my next book and it ' s Mickey Haller , but I kind of feel like creatively I need to come up with something new pretty soon .
