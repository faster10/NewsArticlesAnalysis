2 is a Hong Kong based teen clothing store . When you walk into the store , you will immediately breathe in a bubble gum scent which Fong describes as " juicy , girlish , sweet " that circulates through a diffuser in the shop . He recently lingered outside a 2 store to watch customers . He saw a teenage girl near the store entrance and overheard her saying , " Oh , that smell is 2 . " He took that comment as a successful sign in brand building . The clothing chain first hired him to work on two stores , sales increased and he now supplies the scent to all 35 stores in Hong Kong . Negotiations with 2 are underway to supply 100 of their stores in mainland China .
