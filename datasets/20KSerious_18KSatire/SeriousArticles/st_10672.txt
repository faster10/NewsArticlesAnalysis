British citizens have no legal right to a passport , which continues to be issued under the Royal Prerogative and therefore within the discretion of the Crown ( in practice , the Identity and Passport Service acting for the Home Office ) . Passports can be withdrawn or " canceled " for a number of reasons , including public interest grounds such as suspicion that the holder might be involved in international organized crime or in terrorism . The surrender of a passport can also be required as a condition of bail .
