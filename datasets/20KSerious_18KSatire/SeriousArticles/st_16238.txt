Just having another good player out there , coach Bill Belichick said as the Patriots prepared for Sunday s AFC Championship Game against the Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High . The more you have , the harder it is to defend . And Julian makes the yards after the catch . He s a strong runner after the catch , along with some other guys we have . So it s the passing game , it s the run after catch game , and that helps spread the defense and opens up things for other guys . So the more threats , the more weapons you have on the field , the easier it is to attack .
