Probably the funniest question that ' s come my way was on a flight . . . heading back from London to New York . I ' d been busy making a little stop action animation on my tray table using a postcard I ' d bought from the National Gallery and some sugar that I had poured on the postcard , and I was poking with one finger while I took pictures with the other hand . And I was sort of making this sugar shape swirl around on top of this image , and I finished that and I started working on something else , also using the sugar , and the guy next to me said , " I think the previous one was turning out better , " and I thought , " Uh oh , I ' ve had an audience and I haven ' t even known that .
