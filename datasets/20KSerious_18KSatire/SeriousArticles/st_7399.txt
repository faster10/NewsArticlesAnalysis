Either the producers of AMC ' s " The Walking Dead " are toying with fans , or Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) is really dead . Last week ' s episode 3 ended with Glenn trapped on the ground underneath a large horde of zombies after Nicholas ( Michael Traynor ) shot himself in the head , knocking Glenn off a dumpster . ? Unfortunately , Sunday night ' s episode 4 completely bypassed the Glenn situation , focusing solely on Morgan ( Lennie James ) . But fans noticed that something was off about the episode : Yeun ' s name was missing from the opening credits . ?
