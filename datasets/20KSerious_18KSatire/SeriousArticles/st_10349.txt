After coming home , I started to intern at a local newspaper and applied to journalism graduate schools . With extra time on my hands , I also began to intern at R B Records , a nearby music store . The owner , Val Shively , has more than 4 million 45s , spanning the genre from the Orioles to the lesser Jacksons . He and a lone employee , Chuck , are walking encyclopedias of the rhythm and blues tradition . When I ' m at the store , I mostly bask in their knowledge , sort picture sleeves and take notes . The experience has placed me knee deep into a research project on Philadelphia ' s music history .
