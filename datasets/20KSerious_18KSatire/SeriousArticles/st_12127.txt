What I aim to do is express why Bowie was important to me , and I can summarize that in this way ? he pursued his muse with a single mindedness virtually unrivaled , even in the upper echelons of rock music . He tasked himself with challenging his audience ' s expectations and was committed to trying something new , even if he expected ahead of time to fall flat on his face in the public eye . He refused to rely on what worked before , he didn ' t cater to anyone , and , against all odds , he was successful in it in every conceivable way . For what is the point of art when you ' re only recreating what you ' ve done before ? Recognizing this is why Bowie should be referred to as an artist first , with all other roles as singer , songwriter , performer and the like occupying distant successive slots . He ' s as culturally valuable as William Faulkner , Salvador Dali , John Coltrane , and Georgia O ' Keeffe .
