As cities like Flint have struggled in recent decades , the austerity policies ostensibly aimed at addressing financial woes have brought real harm to the people forced to bear their costs . After a Michigan law put some cities , including Flint , in the hands of unelected , state appointed emergency managers , the state moved in 2014 to change the city s water source to the Flint River in order to save money . As we know now , that water was toxic , corroding the lead pipes in Flint and poisoning its residents . I never would have thought one of the hardest daily decisions my family would have to make would be whether or not to bathe , shower , wash hair , brush their teeth or wash their hands in the water they are paying high prices for that flows from the faucets in the kitchen and in the bathrooms . ?
