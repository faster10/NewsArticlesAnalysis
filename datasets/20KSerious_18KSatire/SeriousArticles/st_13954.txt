" It isn ' t just meat potato chips have high levels of a cancer causing chemical acrylamide , its in the cooking you see . Cancer is primarily a degenerative disease , old people get it , so if you live long enough your chances of coming down with it are quite good . We have evolved to eat meat , we have meat eating teeth and the proteins in meat enabled us to grow big and strong without spending forever eating vegetables . While the west gets bowel cancer constant rice eating is linked to stomach cancer in Asia . It is almost impossible to avoid getting cancer from something a suntan can be a death sentence . Interestingly the oldest women in the US put her longevity down to eating bacon and eggs every day , she is 116 years old , it ' s in her DNA . Cooking creates flavours we like , unfortunately these flavour chemicals are carcinogenic to some people . We may have evolved to eat meat but we have not been evolving for long enough to offset the dangers of cooking it , which is quite a recent activity . However the process of natural selection is at work and in a few thousand years susceptible DNA will have been edited out of our genome and we will be able to eat bacon until the cows come home , but until then it ' s going to be risky .
