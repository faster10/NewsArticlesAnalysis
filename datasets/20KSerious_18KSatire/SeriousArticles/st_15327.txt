Well , the first thing you ll want to know is that I got about 83 percent of my predictions right . That s two percent down on last year , but still pretty good in a confusing year . You could argue that the difference constitutes one Lenny Abrahamson . If only the pesky Irish director hadn t defied huge odds then I d have retained my form . That s not fair . Nobody guessed that Lenny would be in there ( least of all the Room team themselves ) . My real mistake was running with a mad hunch , disregarding the consensus and not including Bridge of Spies in best picture . But would I have left out Carol to accommodate it ? Probably not . So , what s the point of fretting ?
