So I think we would all be very , very happy to talk about gun control as an adjunct of bomb control . If bomb control has been so successful , that would seem to indicate a fine path for reducing mass murder via guns as well . All we have to do is regulate guns like we regulate bombs . You can t buy them without a license . You can t get a license without a background check . And training . And even if you have a license and training you can t buy them except through tightly controlled dealers and a federal system for tracking every last pound of approved , registered , regulated material , because only a lunatic would argue that people be allowed to wander around random American neighborhoods with implements of mass murder dangling from their shoulder .
