In third was Universal ' s 17 million a cappella comedy Pitch Perfect , which earned a solid 14 . 7 million out of 2 , 770 theaters . Thanks to strong pre release buzz Pitch Perfect garnered an " A " CinemaScore grade and Universal opened the film a week early in 335 theaters last weekend the singing competition flick hit a box office high note with 5 . 1 million . Though its per theater average understandably dropped from 15 , 371 to a still strong 5 , 320 due to its expansion , Pitch Perfect is already a big success story . When the original trailer hit the net earlier this year , Pitch Perfect appeared to be an ill conceived companion to marginally popular teen titles like Step Up or You Got Served . But thanks to a dose of Glee ful vocals and strong reviews overall , the film no longer looks like a direct to DVD sibling of Bring It On 5 : High Five , We ' re Alive ! ( We kid . ) In fact , Pitch Perfect may just be a new Bring It On in its own right . The zeitgeisty film was cheap to make and is now well on its way to profitability . Plus , it seems tailor made for home market success with young women ( 74 percent of Pitch Perfect ' s opening weekend audience was female ) and repeat viewing . While Pitch Perfect may never earn as much as Taken 2 did in its first three days , it will end up being a well liked success story for Universal .
