A steady stream of blistering rap music opened the show , with Meek Mill and Waka Flocka Flame plunging straight into their current hits to rile up the early audience . " Turn up ! " may be this generation ' s " rock on ! " and Flocka embodied the phrase , leading a visceral set filled with little rapping and lots of gunshot sounds . " Sorry to all you ' real hip hop ' n as , " Flocka mocked after swarming through the crowd to club anthems like " No Hands " and his latest gem , " Fist Pump . " Later , J . Cole mellowed the venue with a grand sing a long to " Nobody ' s Perfect , " a slow burner featuring Missy Elliott that drips with all the songwriting promise the Grammy nominated MC showed early in his career . Performing with a full band , the once scrappy college rapper has matured under Jay Z ' s Roc Nation imprint , and the boss ' s shadow loomed as Cole led the crowd in a Roc A Fella diamond salute , and interpolated " Big Pimpin ' " into the tropical " Can ' t Get Enough " as tanned Long Islanders belted along to every word .
