Florida Senator Marco Rubio , whose answers mostly seemed pre planned , and whose tone was mostly self righteous , seized on the Cruz bobble in a subsequent response . " Don ' t worry , I ' m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me , " he said to Wallace , who then said , " Good . " Rubio , who trails in recent polls of likely Iowa Caucus goers , clearly targeted Cruz ' s strong support among evangelical Christian conservatives . " When I ' m president , I can tell you this , my faith will not just influence the way I ' ll govern as president , it will influence the way I live my life , " Rubio said . " Because in the end , my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years , but to live an eternity with my creator . And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do . "
