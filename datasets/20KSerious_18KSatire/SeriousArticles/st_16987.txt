Rob Rang predicts that the Los Angeles Rams will target Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook with the No . 15 selection . While Kiper doesn t feel that Cook is even a first round pick , Rang has him coming off the board during the opening half of the first round . Rang then has Memphis QB Paxton Lynch going to the New York Jets at No . 20 and NDSU QB Carson Wentz to the Houston Texans at No . 22 . That would be four first round quarterbacks selected if the CBS mock draft turns out to be correct .
