All of this is based on an equation I recently developed in an academic journal . Statisticians and economists often use econometric models to make forecasts , and the same kinds of equations can be developed for political events . The American political scientist Michael S . Lewis Beck created a model that aimed to predict US presidential elections with a margin of plus or minus 2 . 5 per cent ( I used it to predict President Barack Obama s 2012 election victory ) . Using data from the results in all 43 referendums on the EU ( and its previous incarnation , the European Economic Community ) since 1972 , we can come up with a similar equation .
