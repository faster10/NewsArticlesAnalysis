" The one thing my father always instilled in me is respect ? respect to treat people the way you want to be treated and have respect for the system , " Piazza said Wednesday . " I ' ve always just wanted to let the process play out . It ' s frustrating at times because you can ' t hit any more home runs when you ' re sitting at home . You just have to sit there and people criticize and that ' s the way the game is . So once it does come , you can ' t describe it , and no one can prepare you for it . It ' s an amazing honor . " ?
