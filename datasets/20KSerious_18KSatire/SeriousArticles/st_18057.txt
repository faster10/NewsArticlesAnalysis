For a town synonymous with left leaning politics , Hollywood has never looked so starched and conservative . The idea would probably make Rick Santorum recoil in horror , but Hollywood ' s embrace of the past is rooted in the same thing as Republican primary voters ' embrace of reactionary candidates : A profoundly uncertain future . I like " The Artist " as much as anyone ( OK , probably a little less ) , but for all its charms , it ' s not a forward looking film . And last night ' s Oscars was not a forward looking show . It was rooted in a kind of paralysis , the kind that accompanies a deep seated fear .
