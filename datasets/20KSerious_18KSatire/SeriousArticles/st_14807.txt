This wasn ' t just a ninth inning , it seemed . It was personal , as though he saw it as the last test of who he was as a pitcher , as a teammate , as a grown up man . He ' d only recently taken over the decisions of when he ' d pitch and for how long , and exactly what he ' d ask of the elbow that lay beneath that crescent scar . This , the ninth inning , the victory , whatever was to come of a trip to Kansas City , these would be the last he ' d ever have to address whether he bled first for Matt Harvey or the Mets . It ' s settled anyway . It ' s been settled for weeks . The Mets lost , and Harvey lost , but because of baseball , and not for the fear of what tomorrow might bring .
