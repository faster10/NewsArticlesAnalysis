Douglas : I studied Judaism a lot . I studied religion in general , and I have never imposed my Judaism on my kids . They are what they want to be . I think . . . you must care for others . That ' s the correct religion , I think . You have to learn eventually to care for other people . My mother said once to me and we were very poor but my mother said , " A beggar must give something to another beggar who is worse off than he . " And that has stuck with me . . . . If people give whatever they can give to help other people , we will solve all of the problems of the world . . . .
