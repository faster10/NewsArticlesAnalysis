In April 2002 a referendum allowed Musharraf to hold office for a further five years . Four months later , Musharraf implemented 29 amendments to the constitution , granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister . In a televised address in December 2004 , Musharraf announced that he would not step down as top military leader , even though he had previously agreed to give up the position of the head of the army at the end of 2004 . He said that he needed to maintain his position in order to watch over anti terrorist operations .
