Second , go read the April issue of Consumer Reports magazine . It starts circulating in March and is devoted 100 percent to car buying . You will be able to see what cars have proved to be reliable and which ones are prone to make you know your repair shop people on a first name basis . I won ' t consider a new or used car if Consumer Reports shows it to be unreliable . If you want to buy a car this month or in early March before the April 2009 issue is out , go to the library and use last April ' s issue as a guide .
