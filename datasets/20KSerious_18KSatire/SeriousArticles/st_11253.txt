Labeling all of " us " a sexist mob like our beef with Hillary has to do more with her being a woman than our general fears about another moderate , left of center , establishment democrat in office isn ' t just unfair , it ' s a blinders on generalization to defend a flawed candidate . Proof of this is the simple fact that I and many Sanders supporters would vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were in the race over Hillary or Bernie . That ' s why there were dozens of petitions from thousands of progressive liberals urging her to run , and why there just as many now in hopes she becomes Sanders ' vice president .
