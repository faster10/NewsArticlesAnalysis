Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of people who are sick or bodies of the dead . Health officials typically wait 42 days to declare a country Ebola free , because this is twice as long as the 21 day incubation period of the virus ( the time it takes for a person infected with the virus to show symptoms ) . Each time , at least one new case was later discovered . Of particular concern is the fact it is now known that Ebola is present in the semen of some male survivors up to a year later .
