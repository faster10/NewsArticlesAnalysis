Ziggy Stardust was the physical expression of Bowie s intellectual fascination with stardom and the power of exceptional individuals , fed by Warhol and Nietzsche .

Bestsellers included Hal Lindsey s grimly millenarian tome The Late Great Planet Earth . Hollywood s best directors struck a note of cynicism and unravelling . Newspaper editorials warned of irreversible decline . And there was Bowie as Ziggy singing , We ve got five years , my brain hurts a lot . Ziggy was killed off after a year because he had to die . Time was racing on .
