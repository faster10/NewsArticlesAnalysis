Remember when these two teams battled it out in the Western Conference finals , manufacturing instant classic after instant classic ? Yeah , we barely do , either .

Though Bryant s presence is welcome , it also leaves the Lakers in limbo between rebuilding ( around Julius Randle and D Angelo Russell ) and win now mode .
