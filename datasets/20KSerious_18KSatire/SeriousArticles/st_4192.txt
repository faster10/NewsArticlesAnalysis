Here is how Mark Pincus , founder of Zynga , the social network game developer , put it last year : " In five years , everybody will always be connected to each other , instead of the web . " Zuckerberg repeated the point : " If you look five years out . . . every industry is going to be rethought in a social way . And not just industries , but individuals , too . . . And no matter where you go . . . we want to make it so that all those experiences can be social . " And when Time Magazine named Zuckerberg its Person of the Year , it summarized the goal of his company this way : " Facebook wants to populate the wilderness , tame the howling mob and turn the lonely , antisocial world of random chance into a friendly world , a serendipitous world . You ' ll be working and living inside a network of people , and you ' ll never have to be alone again . "
