Whether or not the film eventually gets a ratings certificate in Nigeria , " Half of a Yellow Sun " will be seen by millions of Nigerians . The question is : will they be allowed to see it in their local cinemas and on legally acquired DVDs or will they be forced to watch it on pirate DVDs and through illegal downloads ? If the biggest film that ' s ever been made in Nigeria is available to Nigerians only in bootleg form , the censorship board will be doing to the Nigerian film industry what Boko Haram is trying to do to Nigeria : drive a stake through its heart . I sincerely hope they both fail .
