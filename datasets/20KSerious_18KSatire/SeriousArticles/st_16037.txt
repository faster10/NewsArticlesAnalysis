For the last 25 years , I ' ve worked as a flight attendant for a large U . S . carrier . Many times I ' ve been in Slater ' s position : A passenger opens the overhead bin to retrieve a carry on bag before the captain says the plane has safely reached the gate . ( For safety reasons , attendants are trained to make sure passengers stay in their seats , overhead bins remain closed and carry on bags are properly stowed " until the aircraft reaches the gate and the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign .
