Open hostility is not all Musharraf has faced , though . The Supreme Court has ordered Musharraf to appear before them on charges of treason , a crime punishable by death in Pakistan . Several lower courts are also considering murder charges against Musharraf for his role in several killings , including that of several seminary students at Islamabad ' s Red Mosque during a confrontation with security forces in 2007 . The Supreme Court has banned Musharraf from leaving the country and his name has been placed on an exit control list . He is currently under house arrest at his ranch compound outside the capital . Musharraf himself believes the claims are politically motivated .
