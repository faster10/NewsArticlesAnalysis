Pat Forde , Yahoo ! Sports : " At the University of Self Congratulation , aka USC , it s all in the family . Always . Nobody from the outside world need apply ? as football coach , or as athletic director . If you haven t already walked the hallowed halls of Heritage Hall , if you haven t already raised your fingers in a ' V ' for Victory , if you haven t already wrapped yourself in the cocoon of cardinal and gold , well , they don t need you there . It takes a special man to lead the Trojans . And only other Trojans are apparently special enough . That s the deduction from athletic director Pat Haden ( former star Trojan quarterback ) hiring Clay Helton ( former interim coach and offensive coordinator ) as the full time football coach . Previously , Haden had hired Steve Sarkisian ( former USC offensive coordinator under Pete Carroll ) . Prior to that , Haden s predecessor as athletic director , Mike Garrett ( former star Trojan running back ) , had hired Lane Kiffin ( former USC offensive coordinator under Pete Carroll ) . Neither of those previous hires worked out very well . "
