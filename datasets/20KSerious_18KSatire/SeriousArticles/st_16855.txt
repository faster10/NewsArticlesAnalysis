The Patriots set the tone right from the opening kickoff . The Chiefs won the coin flip , elected to kick off to the Patriots , then sat back and watched Brady carve them up like tenderloin on butcher paper . Re united with his offensive line and receivers Julian Edelman , Gronknowski and Danny Amendola , Brady marched the Pats 80 yards in 11 plays , capping the touchdown drive with an 8 yard strike to Gronk in front of the Militia Men in the lighthouse left corner end zone . The Pats did not make a rushing attempt on the surgical drive .
