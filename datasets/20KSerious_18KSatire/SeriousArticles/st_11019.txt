Roll : I think it ' s a little bit more than that . I think the important thing to bear in mind , that ' s been incredibly helpful to me in many instances in my life , is to remember that mood follows action . I think it ' s very easy to say I ' ll get to that when I feel better or when I ' m in the right mood , then I ' ll do that , or when the universe aligns and everything is perfect , then I ' ll dust off that dream , but it never happens . The action has to come first . You have to take the action before you know where it ' s going to lead you without knowing the outcome and irrespective of your mind set or how you feel at the time .
