Smile , you ' re on camera : Most depositions are not videotaped . It ' s expensive and the costs don ' t always justify the benefits . But Justin Bieber ' s opponents want him on camera , preferably preening and pugnacious . Watch , for example , when he answers : " Guess what ? Guess what ? I don ' t recall . " Had the deposition only been recorded in a transcript , on paper that looks pretty innocent . But watch the oozing hostility on the video , and his dramatic " I don ' t recall " might play to a jury as " I am conveniently forgetting negative evidence . " His opponent scored points deposing him on camera .
