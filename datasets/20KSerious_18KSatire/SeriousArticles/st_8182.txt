The online chatter has grown to such a volume that respectable journalists , including Salon s own Scott Eric Kaufman , are now having to pinch their noses and wade into the muck , explaining the allegations and counter allegations in painstaking detail .

Now the Anonymous aligned group is distancing themselves , claiming to have a more authenticated list coming later this week .
