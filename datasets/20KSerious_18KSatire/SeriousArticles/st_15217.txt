In its presentation , Third Way argued that a focus on issues like a 15 minimum wage , expanding Social Security benefits and advocating for single payer health care all create the political dynamics that make Democrats electorally vulnerable . But few Democrats have made their campaigns squarely about these three issues in past races . During the disastrous 2014 midterm elections , a number of senators called for expanding Social Security benefits . But talk of single payer health care was nonexistent outside highly progressive ( and largely dismissed ) quarters . And the debate at the time was about raising the minimum wage to 10 . 10 an hour , not 15 . Third Way itself calls for a wage floor of 10 12 , based on average hourly wages and regional cost variations .
