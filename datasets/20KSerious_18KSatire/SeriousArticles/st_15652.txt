I am sure Fincher is a good man , but I prefer to listen to Jesus on the role of Christians . After all , he said , " For I was hungry and you gave me food , I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink .

Those cuts would kick 3 . 8 million Americans off food stamps and end subsidized school lunches for 210 , 000 hungry children . Some 170 , 000 of the people who will be kicked off food stamps are veterans an especially heartless way to treat those who have worn the uniform .
