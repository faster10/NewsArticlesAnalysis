Eli Manning is 35 and probably has three years left at a high level . The Giants don t want to waste games having him learn his second new system in the last three years . But Manning is a smart guy and if Mara is convinced McDaniels will be a lot better as a head coach after failing in Denver , then they need to go outside the organization . It would be short sighted to pick a head coach just because it s best for Manning when they need a coach of the entire team . Potential positive development for McAdoo : The Giants are the most attractive job and presumably could have had Gase , the hottest candidate , if they wanted him . Gase going to Miami could be an indication McAdoo will get the job .
