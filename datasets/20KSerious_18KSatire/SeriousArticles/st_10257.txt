Park Guell garden complex , designed to be a housing development , was Gaudi ' s largest work in Barcelona . It ' s a garden city with fantastically shaped roofs , a house that looks as if it ' s made out of candy , and the famous serpentine bench made out of broken mosaic . Unfortunately , no one in Barcelona gravitated toward the idea . The only three houses built were for Gaudi , the developer and the developer ' s lawyer . I ' d live there in a minute for the spectacular views of Barcelona .
