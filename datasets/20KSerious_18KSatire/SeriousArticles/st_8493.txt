Kerr : That would have been fun to watch , wouldn ' t it ? You know , Draymond ' s a much more skilled basketball player in terms of ballhandling and playmaking and shooting , making 3s , that kind of thing . I think Dennis was a real inspiration to Draymond , though , in terms of the hustle and the rebounding . Nobody ' s ever rebounded like Dennis since Dennis . He had a way of impacting games emotionally that reminds me a lot of Draymond . I imagine there would have been a few technicals involved . Maybe a fight or two .
