This isn ' t a typical coach on the hot seat situation . Coughlin is a champion coach and possible Hall of Famer . The Giants like working with him , and they like the public face he puts on the franchise . When it is time for him to go , that day is likely to be met with as much celebration of his Giants career as with bitterness and anger . He ' s not ready to retire , and the organization would much rather see the team finish strong and make this decision easy . If the Giants don ' t finish strong , don ' t assume it ' s going to be easy for them to tell Coughlin goodbye .
