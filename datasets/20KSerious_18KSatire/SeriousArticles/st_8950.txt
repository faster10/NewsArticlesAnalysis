Green : I think about all of that stuff . It ' s just evolution and the more you try to keep something as you predict it , the faster it will slip away from you . We ' re in a day and age where anyone under 20 doesn ' t even understand the concept of " convergence of media " because it ' s already converged . To most teenagers or people under 25 , the portal to which they watch their content is inconsequential . Whether it ' s a phone or a tablet or a TV or a movie theater , it ' s really about the content .
