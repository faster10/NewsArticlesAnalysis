Late night TV has a generally troubled relationship to the Internet . When these shows are not strenuously trying to generate viral moments , they re laboring to convince young , tech savvy viewers that a middle aged white dude in a suit is worth listening to for 45 minutes every night . Colbert leans into the inherent fustiness of the gig with his investigation of the online o scape . In Stephen Colbert Gazes Into the InfiNet , he riffs on weird corners of the Internet , from websites he s discovered to strange Reddit threads . In the first installment , he discovers that there is a community of people who will pay lots of money for dollar bills with weird serial numbers . As with much of his ?
