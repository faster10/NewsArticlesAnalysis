PRESIDENT OBAMA : But there were people like Emily Purcell , a young woman ? she couldn ' t have been more than 25 , 26 , and was fearless and ran that thing with the sort of precision that you never saw . And so to see all that work by young , idealistic , but really practical and hardworking kids build a genuine movement and for then to deliver a victory was remarkable , and it also , I think , set the stage for our victories elsewhere and provided a buffer for us when things weren ' t going well , because it created a culture in which we said , The candidate may make a gaffe or we may be down in the polls , but this is not just about Barack , this is about us and our commitment to each other and our commitment to the leaders we ' re working with .
