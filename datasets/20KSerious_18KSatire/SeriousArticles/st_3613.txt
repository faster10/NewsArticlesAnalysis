It s glaringly obvious , or at least it should be , that those are exactly the same tendencies that the leaders of ISIS and Osama bin Laden and the Taliban perceive and despise in the West .

He probably never imagined the prospect of same sex weddings , gender neutral bathrooms or Kardashian centric reality TV , but would have perceived such outrageous developments as logical results of America s fundamental depravity .
