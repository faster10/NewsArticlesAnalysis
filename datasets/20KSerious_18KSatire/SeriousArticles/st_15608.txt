Many of us have our particular examples of head smacking Oscar nomination exclusions in front of and behind the camera . Last year it was certifiably ignorant for Ava DuVernay , director of " Selma , " not to receive an Oscar nomination . This year it was certifiably ignorant for Ryan Coogler , director of " Creed , " not to receive an Oscar nomination . It was certifiably ignorant for Michael B . Jordan , giving a sturdy , old fashioned star performance , not to receive a best actor nod for " Creed . " And while I have problems with " Straight Outta Compton , " it sends an amusingly clueless message to nominate only white folks from " Compton " ( for screenplay ) and from " Creed " ( Sylvester Stallone , a prime candidate for the best supporting actor prize ) .
