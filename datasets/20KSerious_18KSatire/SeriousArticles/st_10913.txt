What ' s worse , this mild , mediocre act of feminist revisionism seems oblivious to the very real , enduring and profound power of " Psycho , " which is so much more than just an effective scare machine . If you really want to see an honest movie about Hitchcock ' s troubled , fetishistic , conflicted , love hate relationship with women , see " Psycho , " " Vertigo , " " Marnie " or " Notorious " it ' s a film he made over and over again his whole life , and better than anyone else ever will .
