Defence is a moving target . The invariable aim is the security of the state and the protection of citizens , but circumstances , resources and threats change in such a way as to make any precise calibration of what is needed truly difficult . Add in the long development cycles of modern weaponry , the vested interests of the defence industry , budgetary panics , and the shifts in the public mood which can constrain the use of military force , and the wonder is not so much that we get it wrong but that we sometimes get it right . In Britain we certainly got it wrong in 2010 when we stripped out things we then belatedly realised we still needed , like maritime reconnaissance and some of our air squadrons ? and then along came Russian penetration missions in or near our airspace , and we found it a strain to register our disapproval of these incursions in the usual way . We gave up our carrier capacity for a period of years , and cut manpower in all three services but especially in the navy and air force . All this diminished our strength : the Falklands and Iraq missions would not be ? remotely possible today .
