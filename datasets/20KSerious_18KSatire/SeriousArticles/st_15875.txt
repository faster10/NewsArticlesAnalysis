At 23 , when I watched a moment of iconic cinema in The Perks Of Being a Wallflower ( 2012 ) as Emma Watson ' s character Sam stood up in the back of a pickup truck driving through a tunnel as the radio blasted Bowie ' s Heroes . It was as memorable as John Cusack holding a 1980s boombox above his head , playing Peter Gabriel ' s In Your Eyes in Say Anything ( 1989 ) . It reminded me of how I discovered the Berlin Trilogy era Bowie , one of his most fertile music making periods . I made a mental note to visit the Hansa studio in Berlin where he recorded the three albums Low , Heroes and Lodger on my next visit to the German capital . It would now be a pilgrimage of sorts and all the more poignant at that .
