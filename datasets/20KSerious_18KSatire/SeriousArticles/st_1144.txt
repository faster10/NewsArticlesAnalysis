It was not a coastline of resorts and golf courses , like so much of the South . It was grid based towns that went right up to the beach and were capped off with boardwalks that stretched for miles . Back home in Pennsylvania , we all knew those towns . We knew which had the best piers with the best rides , and we knew that the best sausage and pepper sandwich was at a boardwalk stand in Seaside Heights . We knew that Lucy the Elephant was actually a hotel in Margate and that the places on the Monopoly board really existed .
