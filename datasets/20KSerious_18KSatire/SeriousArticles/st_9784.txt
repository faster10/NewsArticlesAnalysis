Hughes skillfully worked to promote the court ' s public image as nonpartisan , not just in his narrow opinions , but , dramatically , in defending the justices against FDR ' s attacks and his court packing plan . Later , in grudging admiration , Roosevelt said that Hughes was " the best politician in the country . " That was hardly the way Hughes would have chosen to be remembered , but there was much truth in the president ' s remark . In June 2012 it may be said that Chief Justice Roberts , like Hughes , has employed political as well as judicial skills in his role as the leader of the Supreme Court .
