Cox isn ? ? ? t a founder , doesn ? ? ? t serve on the boards of other companies , and hasn ? ? ? t written any best selling books . He ? ? ? s not a billionaire , just a centi millionaire . He joined Facebook in 2005 , too late to be depicted in The Social Network , David Fincher ? ? ? s movie about the company ? ? ? s early days . While Zuckerberg manages an expanding portfolio of side businesses and projects ? ? Instagram , WhatsApp , the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset , a planned fleet of 737 size , carbon fiber , Internet beaming drones ? ? Cox runs ? ? ? the big blue app . ? ? ? That ? ? ? s Facebook ? ? ? s term for the social network that we all compulsively check a few dozen times a day . He ? ? ? s also the keeper of the company ? ? ? s cultural flame , the guy who gives a rousing welcome speech to new recruits every Monday morning at 9 ? ? a . m . It ? ? ? s a safe bet that all 12 , 000 Facebook employees know his name .
