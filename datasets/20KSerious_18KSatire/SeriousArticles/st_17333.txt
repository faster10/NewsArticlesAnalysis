Teicher : Kelce , from a statistical standpoint at least , had his best game of the season against the Texans . He has been replaced by Jeremy Maclin as Alex Smith s go to receiver . He had a solid year as an alternative target to Maclin ( 72 catches , 875 yards , five touchdowns ) but Kelce didn t finish the regular season well . He caught just one pass for 10 yards in Sunday s win over the Raiders . Kelce , though , is a threat . He runs well after the catch , which is how he gets most of his big plays .
