After an initial meeting , we went to a local restaurant for lunch , over which Sagawa recommended we visit the national park around Mount Fuji . " Breathtaking scenery , " he assured us , " and there is a part of the forest where people go to commit suicide called Aokigahara . If I could drive , I would go there and kill myself , " he remarked casually . I explained that , funnily enough , we had been there a few days prior , shooting a documentary surrounding the park , and actually the train was modestly priced .
