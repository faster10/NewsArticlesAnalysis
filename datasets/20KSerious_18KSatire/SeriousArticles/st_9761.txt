The trouble is Van Persie is no longer good enough to be treated differently to anyone else . Besides his slump in goalscoring , he is credited with only two Premier League assists this season . If Falcao improves and Van Gaal wants to give Wilson more of a chance , Van Persie will not be an automatic starter in every game , and that might be something the player finds difficult to handle . In the summer , he will have just a year left on his contract . He managed to extricate himself from Arsenal in similar circumstances .
