For right now , Dettman says the risk is extremely minimal . The Sky Dome has been closed to the public , while visitors will be able to tour the rest of the facility . Another stroke of luck : the dome ' s round shape makes it less likely to collapse on itself , Dettman said . But about 10 of the concrete footing supporting the structure ' s signature red spire , which shoots high over the museum , has been " undermined " somewhat . " We do have to shore it up even though part of it is bearing on bedrock , " he explained .
