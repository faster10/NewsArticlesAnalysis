If ever this Royals offense desired a nickname , it could call itself the Strip Club , because there are singles flying everywhere . Three times this postseason have the Royals strung together at least five singles in one inning . Kansas City saved its season in Game 4 of the division series by starting a top of the eighth rally with five consecutive singles . It vanquished David Price with four straight singles to start the seventh inning of ALCS Game 2 , with a pair more later sandwiched around a double . And after mustering one hit against deGrom in the first four innings of Game 2 of the World Series , the Royals scored four on a walk , two singles , a groundout , a lineout and three more singles .
