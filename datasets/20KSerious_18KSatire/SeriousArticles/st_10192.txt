In a letter to Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke , the governor wrote , " The waters offshore Louisiana ' s coast supply nearly one third of all commercial seafood harvested in the lower 48 states , with values in excess of 2 . 85 billion annually . As the largest provider of domestic seafood in the continental United States , protection of Louisiana ' s fisheries , habitats and catch are critical to our nation ' s economy and food supply . In addition to the potential biologic and ecologic impacts in these coastal communities , we must not overlook the crippling effect that this event will have on the commercial and sport fisheries in Louisiana . The seafood industry is not only a large economic driver , but a defining element of the unique culture , and a crucial tourist draw to the state . "
