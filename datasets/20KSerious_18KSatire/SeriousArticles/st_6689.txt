The easily accessible wreckage and intact recorders contrast with the scenes of other high profile crashes . After Air France Flight 447 disappeared over the Atlantic en route from Brazil to Paris in 2009 , the search for the recorders took two years . In the case of Malaysia Air Flight 370 , which went missing two years ago , the wreck has yet to be located , except for a piece of wing . And with Flight MH17 over Ukraine , the probe was hindered by conflict that limited access to the site and possibly contributed to evidence being tampered with .
