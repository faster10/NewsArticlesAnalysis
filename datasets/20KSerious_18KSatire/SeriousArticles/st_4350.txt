There was also talk about tweaking things at the top by bringing in new governors who would better reflect the national demographics . There is no doubting the President s sincerity , but I would be surprised if the moves led to a huge increase in the number of black actors nominated . An Academy dominated by old white men is a bad thing . A more diverse voting block is to be welcomed . But , though certain actors were overlooked this year , the greater problem is with the industry itself . Look to the Golden Globes for evidence . ? Viola Davis , ? Aziz Ansari , Queen Latifah , David Oyelowo ? and ? Taraji P . Henson and Idris Elba were all nominated in the TV section at those awards , whereas the unavoidable Mr Elba was the only black nominee among the actors at that event . The same electorate voted in both cases . Do they suddenly get a little racist when considering movies rather than telly ? Of course not . The unavoidable conclusion is that ? at the awards friendly end , anyway ? television is more democratic than cinema . The studios should take heed . Their colleagues on the smaller screen have no fear that poor white viewers will flee at the sight of a black face . Yes , the voters need to broaden their minds . But the producers also need to show commitment to telling stories concerning ? people of colour .
