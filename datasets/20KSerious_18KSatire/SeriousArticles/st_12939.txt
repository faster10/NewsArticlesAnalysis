This year , the Academy s voters barely had to look beyond their noses to see exceptionally deserving black nominees . Idris Elba , for example , is up for a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his career topping work as an African warlord in the child soldier drama Beasts of No Nation . You don t even have to like Elba ? I m far from his biggest fan , as it happens ? to recognise how special his performance is , and what a terrific fit it represents between actor and role . It s the kind of part that tends to help a very popular and respected star to join the ranks of the Oscar anointed . Somehow , though , the Londoner lost out . He wasn t pipped to it by the Puerto Rican Benicio Del Toro in Sicario ? Del Toro is another Bafta nominee missing from the Best Supporting Actor category ? but by five white stars . ?
