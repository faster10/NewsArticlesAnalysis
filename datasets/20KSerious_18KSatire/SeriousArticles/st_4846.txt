How should the public relate to this now ? Not putting too much faith in diplomatic summitry would be a good start : talks are a good way of biding time for those who don t want to actually do anything . Not giving up on international justice is also important . But facing up to our western inability to care enough about the plight of Syrians will be crucial . As Europeans , we need to reflect on how we have all along believed that most of this mess would ultimately be taken care of by others , in the US or elsewhere . That was delusional , and Europe will pay a high price because it is right on the doorstep of the Middle East .
