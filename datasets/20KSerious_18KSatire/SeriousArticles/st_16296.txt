Zuckerberg , 31 , and Chan , 30 , are not just young they have also begun their philanthropic careers at an early age ( they have already given away more than 1 . 5 bn ) . Philanthropy used to be a sort of valedictory endeavor , a vocation taken up after the money had been made , like golf or an ambassadorship . Gates and Buffett for the most part have followed that traditional pattern . Gates , for instance , didn t turn to philanthropy till he was in his mid 40s and then left Microsoft to devote himself entirely to his foundation s good works .
