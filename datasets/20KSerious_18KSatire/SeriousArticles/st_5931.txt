The performers ' trophies are even more uncertain . Will best comedy actor go to " Big Bang ' s " Jim Parsons again he ' s won three of the last five or Louis C . K . ? Will best comedy actress go to Louis Dreyfus , " Parks and Recreation ' s " Amy Poehler or " Orange ' s " Taylor Schilling ? Can Allison Janney , who won an Emmy at the Creative Arts event for her guest spot in " Masters of Sex , " win another for " Mom " ? It ' s enough to make you long for the certainty of " Parks and Recreation ' s " Ron Swanson ( Nick Offerman ) who ' s not , incidentally , up for an Emmy . Not that he would sweat over it .
