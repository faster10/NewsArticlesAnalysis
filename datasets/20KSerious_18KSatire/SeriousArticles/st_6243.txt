No matter who wins the election , the military will still wield enormous influence within the government . Under the constitution , 25 percent of the seats in Parliament are reserved for the military . That means to have a simple majority , Suu Kyi s opposition party must win two thirds of the vote . It also means that any government she leads would be hamstrung by the military s continued role in politics and power . Amendments to the constitution require more than a 75 percent vote . The military also retains control over three crucial ministries that oversee the police , army , border affairs and a vast bureaucracy across the country .
