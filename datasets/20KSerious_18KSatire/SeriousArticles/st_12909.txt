If you are scared of Muslims then you should also be scared of household furniture and toddlers : A study carried out by the University of North Carolina showed that less than 0 . 0002 of Americans killed since 9 11 were killed by Muslims . ( Ironically , this study was done in Chapel Hill : the same place where a Caucasian non Muslim killed three innocent Muslims as the mainstream media brushed this terrorist attack off as a parking dispute ) .

As a matter of fact , Americans were more likely to be killed by a toddler in 2013 than they were by a so called " Muslim terrorist " .
