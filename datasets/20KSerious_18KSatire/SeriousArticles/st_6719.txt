Denver Broncos : The player to watch Monday , when the Broncos return to the practice field and through the week , will be quarterback Peyton Manning . Sunday will be Manning ' s first start since Nov . 15 , a loss to the Chiefs , when an obviously physically compromised Manning threw four interceptions and was pulled from the game because of his left foot injury . In practices last week , Manning ' s teammates said he looked ready to go for the playoffs , but the coming week will be his first full week of work in team drills since early November .
