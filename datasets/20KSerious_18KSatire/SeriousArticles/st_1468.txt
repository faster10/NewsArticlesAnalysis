This seems like a good time to address a common question about my ballot : What about the PED players ? Where is the consistency ? I don t have a blanket policy against voting for players who are known to have used PEDs or ones who have admitted that use . I use the character clause ? and how it applies to cheating within in the game ? as a tool to chip my list down to 10 . With an unlimited ballot or a ballot of 12 , it s entirely possible that Barry Bonds , Roger Clemens , Mark McGwire , or Gary Sheffield would have received a vote from me . If the Hall of Fame , at any time , announces that it will mention transgressions on the plaque then I ll vote for Bonds and Clemens and watch as their plaques are carried into the Hall to hang near Shoeless Joe Jackson s and Pete Rose s . Seems reasonable .
