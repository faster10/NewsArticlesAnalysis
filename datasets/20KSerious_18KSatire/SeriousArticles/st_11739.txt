So , over the course of the past nine months , I have joined with domestic violence advocates , fellow legislators and countless victims to call on House leaders to end the discrimination against these populations of women . On the Senate floor we have told the painful stories these women have shared of being scared for their own lives . In television appearances , these brave women have plead for the protections so many other women across the country enjoy . And most recently , every Democratic woman in the Senate wrote to the Republican women of the House of Representatives to appeal for their help in passing our bill .
