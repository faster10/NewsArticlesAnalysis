" Hugo Chavez was a tyrant who forced the people of Venezuela to live in fear . His death dents the alliance of anti U . S . leftist leaders in South America . Good riddance to this dictator , " said U . S . Rep . Ed Royce , chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs . " Venezuela once had a strong democratic tradition and was close to the United States . Chavez ' s death sets the stage for fresh elections . While not guaranteed , closer U . S . relations with ( this ) key country in our Hemisphere are now possible . "
