The Chancellor says we need this rapid reduction in case another financial crisis happens . However , he ignores risks to the world economy over the next few years , which , with interest rates very low and spending cuts , leave the economy vulnerable . This was the mistake he made in 2010 , which lost the average household the equivalent of at least ? 4 , 000 . In addition , when interest rates and wage costs are low we should be borrowing to increase investment , as any dynamic firm would do . The Chancellor is fond of talking about extra infrastructure investment , but the change in announced public net investment compared to July is tiny : 0 . 2 per cent of GDP over five years . ?
