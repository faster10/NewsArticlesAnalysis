Van Gundy : ? I agree with , Mark . I find it individually , you have to consider all the numbers , but shooting percentage is a good place to start . I think individually , the true shooting percentage , which incorporates the three point shot , is a good place to start . But I think team wise , this goes all the way back to Dean Smith . So some of the stuff that s getting credit toward analytics now , Dean Smith was doing back in the 70s , which is points per possession . That takes into account pace of play , whether you play fast , mid or slow , and how many points are you scoring per possession . Team wise , I think those are the two most important ones , because they are the ones that directly tie into winning . I think , you know , we ve given it a term , analytics , but to analyze statistics , I think all good coaches use statistics . They may use them differently , but they use them to make points to their team , to try to correct things that are preventing them from winning , or to recreate to try to continue to win , and I think it s been going on in every sport for a long , long time .
