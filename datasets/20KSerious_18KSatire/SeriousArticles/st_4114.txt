In his eulogy for Jimmie Lee Jackson , King denounced the misuse of police powers , which he saw as a direct expression of white supremacy . He understood Jackson ' s shooting by a white officer to be symbolic of race based killings throughout the country . " A state trooper pointed the gun , but he did not act alone , " King said . " He was murdered by the brutality of every sheriff who practices lawlessness in the name of law . He was murdered by the irresponsibility of every politician , from governors on down , who has fed his constituents the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism . "
