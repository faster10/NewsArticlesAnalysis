They re not really detail oriented guys . They re outsiders . They don t have political bases the way the others do and Trump isn t really big on details . Carson really isn t big on details . They speak in broad terms . They address social issues and this was not their night . That wasn t a night where those things were brought up . It also wasn t a night of conflict . Notice the one thing the moderators didn t do once is try to provoke them into attacking each other . They just threw the issues out there and they went after each other and we had some good exchanges , but it wasn t really that kind of firestorm where Trump would really show .
