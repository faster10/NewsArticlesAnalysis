I don ' t mean to say that there aren ' t people and organizations still committed to Haiti . There are . Organizations such as Habitat for Humanity , Oxfam , the International Medical Corps , Project Medishare , Doctors Without Borders , Food for the Poor , J P HRO , Donna Karan ' s Urban Zen organization , and We Advance , just to name a few , have done and continue to do outstanding work . But after the earthquake , most ( including the media ) stopped paying attention , either believing they had done all they could , or maybe because they were simply tired or overwhelmed .
