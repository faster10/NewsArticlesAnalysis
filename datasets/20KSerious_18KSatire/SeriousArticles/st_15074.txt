The biggest resemblance to me between the 2015 team and the 1986 team are the once in a century power pitchers . If you ask people who watched the ' 86 Mets , they probably said these guys are going to win three or four championships in the next five years same could be said about these Mets , said Rodriguez , who is a Fox guest studio analyst during the World Series , and who worked the ALCS as well . " We ' re very lucky in this World Series . It ' s not often that you get the best two teams and the hottest two teams . I grew up watching baseball and watching the 1986 Mets .
