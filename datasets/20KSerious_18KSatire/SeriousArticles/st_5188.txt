For the new team in Saudi Arabia , it is time to act tougher than expected with Iran and terrorism . The execution of the 47 agitators , including the firebrand Al Nimr , shows zero tolerance towards both terrorism and Iran regardless of the reactions . What matters most is not Iran and the world s reaction , but the domestic audience . The bold Saudi government knew well in advance that the Saudi public urged decisiveness and was generally receptive to a tough approach to confront hardliners in Iran . They have had enough of Iran s bullying and genuinely feel that they are being targeted by Tehran as much as by Daesh ( the self proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ) .
