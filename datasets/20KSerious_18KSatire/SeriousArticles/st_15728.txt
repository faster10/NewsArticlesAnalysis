Both articles obsessively ? comb over every detail of ? Boulahcen s pre conversion life : Her partying , her drinking , ? the amount of sex they suspect she had , her clothes and even her heavy makeup , which both articles take pains to point out . ? It s the same kind of thing you see these right wing rags doing day in and out , ? simultaneously inviting their audiences to leer at and sit in judgment of young women for their clothes , their sexual choices , even their propensity to take selfies ( which is assumed to be motivated by base narcissism , unlike reading articles assuring you that your generation is superior to the kids these days ) . It s a weird display , considering that the reason Boulahcen is in the news has nothing to do with her sex life or vodka consumption . It s really the mass murder that is the reason we know her name at all , I d say .
