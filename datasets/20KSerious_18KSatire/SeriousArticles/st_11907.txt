I met Obama when he first threw his hat in the ring , when my jazz group played a rally in South Central . It was a pipe dream back then , and he had no security , so I got to hang for a few minutes with " the man . " I told him that recently my band got a star on Hollywood Boulevard , I was inducted into the Rock n ' Roll Hall of Fame , got a lifetime Grammy , but was more excited to meet him that day . Then several years ago I thought , " Wow , in my lifetime I might see an African American man and a woman become president of the United States ! " Then several months ago I thought , " I ' m really not that excited about the woman part . . . . What ' s wrong ? I like women . . . I love women . . . I like smart women . What ' s the problem ? Where ' s the inspiration ? "
