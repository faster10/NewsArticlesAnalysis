Second , the insurgent wings of both parties are redefining the contours of American politics . In 1999 , after the release of his film Bulworth , I asked Warren Beatty if he was a socialist .

We have no idea what to compare that with because it s simply not a question anyone would have asked before Sanders came on the scene .
