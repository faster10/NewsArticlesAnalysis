Anne Marie Canter of San Francisco , California I had three heroes on that day . Two of them were firemen walking up the stairs of the North Tower as we were all walking down and out . We had been backed up on the stairwells and some people were starting to panic but when the two firemen came up and told us all to carry on walking , we would get out and they just walked up the stairs past us . They had such brave , courageous faces and their voices were so confident . They carried on up the stairs and we all felt much better and continued our way down . We all got out but I don ' t think they did and I will never forget those brave faces and the hope their strong voices gave us . My other hero is my friend Debbie she walked down next to me all the way and kept cheerful and even managed to make me smile when she made a joke about what a mess our mascara must be it sounds silly but at that point we all had no idea what was going on outside but we needed to distract ourselves from some of the smells and sounds in the stairwell and seeing someone so calm made me feel a lot calmer . We all are so much stronger than we think , and our actions have such an impact on those around us .
