I found that out firsthand in the 1990s , while leading a team on an inspection of a military run underground facility that we thought might violate the 1994 United States North Korea denuclearisation agreement . My team was locked in a room surrounded by soldiers with bayonets drawn after one member of our team violated the inspection procedures . Many of us thought we were going to be killed . Eventually , we managed to extricate ourselves , but as we left the base in an old school bus , the military men followed us in a truck with a loudspeaker blaring anti American slogans . I asked our North Korean civilian escort if they were going to follow us for the whole ride back to our hotel ? two hours over bumpy roads . He responded with a smile : Do you want them to ?
