Despite my personal annoyance at the price hike and the inconsistent messages , I continue to respect Netflix and its brave CEO for their ( multiple ) public apologies , their speed in developing a new service ( Qwikster ) and their speed in canceling Qwikster when they saw the negative response . Hastings " failed fast " and then adjusted and adjusted again , which can be painful . His willingness to move forward , even in the face of public criticism , is all too rare among public company CEOs .
