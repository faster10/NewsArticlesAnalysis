It ' s the second police vehicle to be stolen in NCR after a senior officer ' s blue beaconed SUV vanished from outside his house in Noida last week . The bike , a yellow TVS Apache with registration number HR 25 CQ 1796 , was stolen on the intervening night of January 14 and 15 from Gurgaon ' s Hans Enclave , police said . The thefts have worried security agencies since the terrorists who attacked the Pathankot air base used a Punjab Police SP ' s car to get past checkposts , and could use a similar modus operandi again . NCR is anyway on high alert for Republic Day .
