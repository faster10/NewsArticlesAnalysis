I say " walks out " because Sylvia , of course , is played by a human , the very warm and friendly Annaleigh Ashford . If you think about the aftermath of such an operation in human terms ? you know , the sudden , consent free loss of one ' s reproductive organs ? comedy is not the first genre that comes to mind . And , indeed , the joke in the moment is that Sylvia , who can talk in this play , is temporarily annoyed by her owner , Greg , played in director Daniel Sullivan ' s production by Matthew Broderick , who naturally inhabits the quirkier end of the human species . But since Sylvia is a dog , and dogs are forgiving and all loving creatures , Ashford ' s Sylvia has to get over herself , and her new status in the world , and get with the program of unconditional adoration .
