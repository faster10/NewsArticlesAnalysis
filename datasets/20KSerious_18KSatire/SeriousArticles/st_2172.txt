" There was a guy auditioning for a stunt role , like Guy No . 15 , who gets his head chopped off , " Gosling said . " Nic talked to him for like two hours : what he thought of the story , what he thought about the film . He just really engages everybody and collects their ideas , and I think it ' s a really smart way to work . All these people come to you with an entire history and they can offer a perspective to what you ' re doing , whether you like it or not . It seems strange now to work in a situation where people are closed off to everything but their own ideas . "
