" He ' s a guy who seems to bring the energy , everybody seems to follow him , " Lang said . " He ' s a guy who ' s always in the backfield , always making plays . And when he ' s not in the backfield , like that play against Minnesota , he ' s chasing guys down to do everything he can to save the drive for his defense . He ' s a guy that it ' s ? a lot of fun watching him play , he ' s a guy that it sucks to compete against just because of how good he is , but he ' s a guy you ' ve got to respect what he ' s doing .
