Guy who makes pangolin music videos in his spare time : I am amazed by so many things about this animal , such as their gentle , almost friendly demeanor ( like an ugly cute version of my cat Sasha ) , their crazy long tongues that wreak terror on unsuspecting ant colonies , and their unbelievably versatile tails , used for things like hanging from tree branches and even walking on their hind legs . I ' d have to say my favorite characteristic , though , is its defense mechanism of rolling into a tight ball to ward off predators . While researching , I found this amazing video online of a pangolin that withstood an attack by eight lions by rolling itself up into this tight little ball . After something like three hours , the lions finally gave up and the pangolin just sauntered off into the woods again . Unreal !
