Blazing a trail : I don ' t race to prove how good women can be against men . I race because I love racing . Don ' t get me wrong , I see these little girls all dressed in pink with Susie t shirts on , and that ' s fantastic . Many girls who are really interested in motorsport watch Formula One and see no females there , so maybe they don ' t understand what they could do . I appreciate that I can have a positive influence in some kind of way . But I feel I still have a lot more to achieve before I can turn around and say I did something special , as a female in a man ' s world .
