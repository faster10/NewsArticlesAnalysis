Business reports indicate that the sharp rise in large retailers open on Thanksgiving Day has leveled off . Perhaps , as has been suggested , this is due to consumer dismay at seeing the holiday hijacked by the temptation to buy deeply discounted electronics and toys , rather than eating another piece of pumpkin pie . However , a few national retailers are opening their doors at the time most people are attempting to carve ( not hack ) their turkey into attractive servings . It is possible that if this trend increases , Thanksgiving dinner will become a brunch so people can shop in the afternoon .
