While increasing the recommended age for annual mammograms , ACS does acknowledge that " regular mammograms can often help find breast cancer at an early stage , when treatment is most likely to be successful . A mammogram can find breast changes that could be cancer years before physical symptoms develop .

" So why the change ?
