I still stand that he has no reason to be on the field , Jones said . Coaches are supposed to be held to a higher standard when it comes to stuff like that . Even when Mike Munchak grabbing Reggie s hair . Thank God that wasn t me . Cause I wouldn t have just walked away in the heat of the moment , I don t think . I just think coaches are held to a higher standard . It s pure and point blank . Let s just say one of their kids come over to our sideline and I snatch him down by the hair . I m quite sure I m getting kicked out the game and fined over 200 , 000 . I think coaches should be held to a higher standard . Period . Point blank .
