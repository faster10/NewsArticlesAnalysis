Ahead of the second round of voting on Sunday , its candidates are clearly ahead in six of the country s 13 mainland regions . For President Francois Hollande , this is not all bad . He is hoping that the FN will split the vote on the Right . That way he might find himself in a run off against Le Pen in the presidential election of 2017 . He might stand a chance against her ? he wouldn t against anyone else , notably from the Republican party of his old enemy , Nicolas Sarkozy . Others are more concerned about the political battles of today .
