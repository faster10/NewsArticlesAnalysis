Zachary Conen , senior vice president of sales and marketing at LRA Worldwide , a mystery shopping firm based in Pennsylvania , says they maintain a stable of 120 full time consultants who travel 42 weeks out of the year . They too are tight lipped , but happy to tell you their standards , which alter depending on the client . Is there a seasonally appropriate fruit at the front desk ? Did you get a call from the concierge within thirty minutes of check in ? Are the amenities Gilchrist Soames and perfectly arranged ?
