The reality is that this is not just an attack on Charlie Hebdo , but an attack on all of us who hold dear freedom of expression , no matter where we live . Charlie Hebdo is irreverent , anti religious and occasionally vulgar . The writers and cartoonists routinely anger many of its readers . Back in 2007 , for example , it reprinted the Prophet Mohammed cartoons that were first published in a Danish newspaper , illustrations that had outraged the Muslim community . And in 2011 , Charlie Hebdo " invited " Mohammed to be guest editor and showcased a caricature of him on the cover .
