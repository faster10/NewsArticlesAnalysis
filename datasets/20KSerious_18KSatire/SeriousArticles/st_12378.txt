Former Mizzou offensive lineman Max Copeland : Coach Pinkel is such an apt personification of the term toughness . Not just in his demeanor or speech , but in the success of our brothers and those who came before us . True leadership reflects itself in those who are led . Thus every fourth quarter victory , every converted 4th and 1 , and even the marred , stoic faces of the young men fighting for old Mizzou are vivid exemplifications of a man founded on toughness and drive . I ll forever remember being called into his office , on the assumption of impending lashes for the heavy metal volume in the locker room , and instead hearing the word scholarship ( and thereafter trying to calm the ringing in my ears from adrenaline ) . The legacy Coach Pinkel will be leaving is beyond question , as is the toughness he will take with him to his next battle . As I felt in the autumn of 2013 , so I do now : I fear for anything that dare test his will . ?
