Focusing on care for the elderly , Callahan and Nuland warn that our present attitudes " doom most of us to an old age that will end badly : with our declining bodies falling apart as they always have but devilishly and expensively stretching out the suffering and decay . " They hence call on us to abandon the " traditional open ended model " ( which assumes medical advances will continue unabated ) in favor of more realistic priorities , namely reducing early death and improving the quality of life for everyone . They further advocate age based prioritization , giving the highest to children and " the lowest to those over 80 . "
