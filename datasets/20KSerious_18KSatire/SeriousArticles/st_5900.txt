Detroit Lions : Todd Gurley hasn t rushed for 100 plus yards since Week 8 and perhaps not coincidentally , the Rams have not won a game since the 27 6 blowout of San Francisco . Gurley has been barely used by St . Louis the past two weeks as well . While the Rams have changed offensive coordinators , Detroit s run defense has been among the best in the league the past month . So with Detroit able to limit Gurley , it forces Case Keenum to try to beat the Lions . That won t happen . Lions 20 , Rams 13 . Michael Rothstein
