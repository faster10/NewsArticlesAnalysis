To start , let ' s talk about what , precisely , the actual news is today . We already knew that Zuckerberg and Chan planned to give away most of their wealth . How ? Because they signed onto the Warren Buffet ' s and Bill and Melinda Gates ' " giving pledge , " in which America ' s richest promise to donate most of their money to philanthropy . So the first story here is that Zuckerberg and Chan are , like Buffett , going to give away substantially all of their fortune , rather than just the majoirty of it . ( Gates is aiming for a mere 95 percent , for some reason . ) The second big story is how they ' re planning to distribute that money . Rather than , say , follow Buffett ' s footsteps and dole out their resources to other people ' s foundations , the couple is starting the Chan and Zuckerberg Initiative , an organization that will initially focus its efforts on personalized learning , curing disease , connecting people and building strong communities . 1 The upshot is that the couple see themselves as philanthropists in the Gates Mike Bloomberg mold , using their money to fund very specific causes close to their hearts . ?
