Peyroux : No . I think of the things that I wrote on this record as stories of being a young woman walking the streets of Paris late at night in " Our Lady of Pigalle , " or trying to touch on the Southern culture of drinking and surviving on the basic sayings that we have in order to understand what life is all about . . . . But the question was . . . would anybody want me to actually tell the full story from beginning to end and make sense of it ? Because in the end , I ' d like these songs to make sense to everyone and not just be my story .
