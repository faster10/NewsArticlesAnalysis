Numerous folk and gospel songs gave accounts of the event , including the Carter Family ' s " The Titanic , " which Dylan drew from . " I was just fooling with that one night , " he says . " I liked that melody I liked it a lot . ' Maybe I ' m gonna appropriate this melody . ' But where would I go with it ? " Elements of Dylan ' s vision of the Titanic are familiar historical figures , the inescapable finality . But it ' s not all grounded in fact : The ship ' s decks are places of madness ( " Brother rose up against brother . They fought and slaughtered each other " ) , and even Leonardo DiCaprio appears . ( " Yeah , Leo , " says Dylan . " I don ' t think the song would be the same without him . Or the movie . " ) " People are going to say , ' Well , it ' s not very truthful , ' " says Dylan . " But a songwriter doesn ' t care about what ' s truthful . What he cares about is what should ' ve happened , what could ' ve happened . That ' s its own kind of truth . It ' s like people who read Shakespeare plays , but they never see a Shakespeare play . I think they just use his name . "
