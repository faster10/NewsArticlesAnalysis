The Sanders campaign s critics had plenty of material to work with beyond those blithely condescending columns . They could throw in a bunch of bottom feeding social media sexists , like ? the poster in a pro Sanders Facebook group who called Hillary clitrash . The campaign also made its own gendered gaffes , including the ? smug statement that Bernie was willing to consider Hillary for veep . Finally , there s the tendency of online Sanders supporters to call Clinton fans corporate shilling Hillary bots and to argue that journalists are auditioning for jobs with the Clinton White House . Put it all together , and you have a perfectly reasonable ( though not unimpeachable , and certainly not universal ) argument that Bernie has a little bit of a Bro problem .
