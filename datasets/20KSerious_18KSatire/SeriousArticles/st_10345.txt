But to go into McKale and beat the Wildcats , you need to get production on both ends . That ' s exactly what Oregon got . Not only did the Ducks force this game to be played at their higher tempo , but they also forced 19 Arizona turnovers that led to 21 points . Compare that to the four points the Wildcats were able to score on only six Oregon turnovers , and that ' s your ballgame right there . Not even the Wildcats ' blistering 61 percent shooting could make up for the extra possessions that they gave up .
