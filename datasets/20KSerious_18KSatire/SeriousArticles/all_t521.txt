Senate may take up Homeland Security funding bill next week
The Senate could begin consideration of the House’s hardline Homeland Security funding as soon as next week.

Keystone has been bogged down in a dispute over amendments but Republicans said progress had been made on Tuesday.

Republican leaders have not said what their backup plan is for when the House bill fails in the Senate.
