You re calling from Iowa , and the caucuses are Monday , so let s start there . Your book traces conservative discontent from Barry Goldwater and 1964 forward , but it also seems to me that the Republicans created this uncontrollable Trump Frankenstein themselves with their big wins in 2010 . They gerrymandered a decade long permanent majority in the House , built districts where the only challenge could come further from the right , and created a sense within a restless base that they were about to have big victories . Those victories would never come with a Democrat in the White House . But the base looks at this and believes the party just isn t fighting hard enough . So you get Trump and Cruz ? and a plan that looked brilliant after 2010 spirals out of control
