Bettman has never been one to try to placate fans en masse but the John Scott triumph ? let s not call it a dilemma , a fiasco , or even a situation anymore as it deserves a much more positive association ? should serve as a warning : NHL fans are a discerning , evolving bunch who demand a product that serves their interests as much as it does the owners . If Bettman tries to push an element of the game that doesn t sit well with the fans , they ll voice their displeasure and embarrass the league , as they did by ultimately forcing it to let Scott participate in All Star Weekend . Further proof lies in their general rejection of the advanced stats feature on the NHL s website in favor of fan built sites that offer a much more accurate and telling look inside the game .
