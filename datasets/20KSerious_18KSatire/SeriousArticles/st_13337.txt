" I am going to bed with my heart full of your adorable image . . . . I cannot wait to give you proofs of my ardent love , " he writes in November 1796 . " . . . How happy I would be if I could assist you at your undressing , the little firm white breast , the adorable face , the hair tied up in a scarf a la creole . You know that I will never forget the little visits , you know , the little black forest . . . . I kiss it a thousand times and wait impatiently for the moment I will be in it . To live within Josephine is to live in the Elysian fields . Kisses on your mouth , your eyes , your breast , everywhere , everywhere . "
