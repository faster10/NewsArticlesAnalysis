The original nine season run of The X Files lasted 202 episodes . Only four episodes were written by Darin Morgan . But those episodes loom large in the show s history . Humbug , Clyde Bruckman s Final Repose , War of the Coprophages , and Jose Chung s From Outer Space pushed the series in a direction that was playful , experimental , and even metaphysical , with a sensibility that was lighthearted and melancholy and brain twistingly cerebral all at once . ( Morgan also received a story credit on Blood , a season 2 episode which he developed with his brother , longtime X Files writer producer Glen Morgan . )
