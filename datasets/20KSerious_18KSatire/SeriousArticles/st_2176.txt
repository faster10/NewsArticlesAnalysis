The A9 ' s 13 megapixel camera is good but doesn ' t quite match the best ( Sony Z5 , Samsung S6 , iPhone 6S ) , despite some extra features such as hyperlapse and raw capture . It comes with Google ' s latest Marshmallow Android operating system , which tweaks things like app shortcuts and voice search . One element that is still an advantage for some people is the MicroUSB charging system . Some new Android phones are changing over to USB C , but most people are more likely to have a few of the older variants around . The HTC One A9 comes with 16GB of storage but also takes expandable memory cards . It is also available in several colours .
