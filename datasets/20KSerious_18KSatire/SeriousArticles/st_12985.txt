Thorough investigation has established that Jihadi John was indeed Mohammed Emwazi , a British citizen , and that he had killed at least two fellow British citizens , David Haines and Alan Henning . With that track record , it was entirely credible that he might carry out further killings . In complex modern warfare , where international boundaries are not recognised by our opponents , who do not wear identifiable uniforms , it is entirely legitimate that a lethal strike is carried out against a man who has killed and would very likely have killed again .
