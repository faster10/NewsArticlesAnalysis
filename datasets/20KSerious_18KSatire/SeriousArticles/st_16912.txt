Some Egyptians pin the blame for the current setback on the Muslim Brotherhood ' s political overreach . In the parliamentary elections last December , it ran candidates affiliated with its Freedom and Justice Party for seats reserved for independents , helping it win a larger share of seats . This was one of the explanations for the Supreme Constitutional Court ' s ruling invalidating those seats and dissolving parliament . Also , after insisting it would not run a presidential candidate , the Muslim Brotherhood did join the presidential race . Its candidate , Mohammed Morsi , led the field in the general election last month and will compete against Ahmed Shafiq in the runoff election , which starts tomorrow .
