The Democratic endorsement , Yepsen noted , may be more influential since the paper ' s left leaning editorial board tends to connect better with Democrats . The Register , he added , would have been hard pressed to ditch Clinton , whom it backed over then Sen . Barack Obama in late 2007 . The paper that year described her " readiness " to lead the country . " We believe as president she ' ll do what she ' s always done in her life : Throw herself into the job and work hard , " the board wrote . " We believe Hillary Rodham Clinton can do great things for our country . " ( If Sanders wins , it probably turns this story upside down , since that would be a big surprise . )
