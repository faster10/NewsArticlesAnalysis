Despite voters unified focus on money in politics , so far the moderators of the Democratic presidential debates have missed the opportunity to ask the candidates about this issue , with not a single question on it yet . The moderators this weekend John Dickerson , Nancy Cordes , Kevin Cooney , and Kathie Obradovich should disrupt this trend and put money in politics reform measures front and center in the debate . And candidates should show voters that they are serious about fixing this crisis by laying out the specifics of their plans to address the big money takeover of our democracy . ?
