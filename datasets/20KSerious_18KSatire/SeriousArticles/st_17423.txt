While Flint residents wait , they also face an increased number of shut off notices due to unpaid bills . In August , Genesee Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an emergency injunction to stop them , but last week finance director Jody Lundquist said the city will begin issuing water shut off notices soon . Kristin Moore , a city spokesperson , said Flint has a legal obligation to bill for utility services , but that the state of emergency declared by Snyder is forcing the city to review its policy on shut off notices . None have been issued since December .
