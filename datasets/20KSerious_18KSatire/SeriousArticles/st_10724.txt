While Europe ' s wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year round in the south , wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark . English language tours , common in the summer , are rare during the off season , when most visitors are natives . Another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness . The solo traveler won ' t have the built in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season . Still , this can be a plus , since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet .
