I am probably being too generous to him because he is now deceased , but Finicum reminds me of hardworking , independent minded ranchers I ve gotten to know during forays into Montana cattle country . Most of them are pretty well convinced that they know how to manage their land better than anyone from federal , state , county or local government . I know that sometimes they are right and , also , that sometimes they fail to recognize the greater good in having the nation s natural heritage guarded by prudent laws and outside regulators . Nevertheless , none of the ranchers I know have careened off the deep end into armed rebellion the way Finicum and his compatriots have done .
