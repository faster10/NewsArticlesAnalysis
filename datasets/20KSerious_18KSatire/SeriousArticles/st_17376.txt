So what about that surprise nomination for Abrahamson for Best Director ? Brilliant stuff , especially in a category so tightly contested . Room ? is an excellent film , and the Academy seems to have recognised Abrahamson s gorgeous style , as well as his skill in translating a claustrophobic and almost impossible to imagine set so intelligently and sensitively to screen . Abrahamson is an extraordinarily sophisticated director , and Room ? shows off that unique trick brilliant directors can pull ? allowing the style and nuance of the mechanics of their directing to become inextricably intertwined with the atmosphere of a story , its tone , and in Room , ? its beautiful realisation . Anyone who has read the novel has to be excited to see how that oppressive yet somehow ethereal setting could be imagined cinematically , and Abrahamson doesn t just pull it off , he pulls it together , from the spine tingling closeups of the opening sequence , to the almost stage like interplay of the two lead actors in room , the place , as their strife and hope unfolds in devastatingly close quarters .
