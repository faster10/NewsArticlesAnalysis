I was startled by the message , but not shocked . I ' m the father of a boy with Down syndrome and had at least an inkling of what Jane was going through . On the other hand , although safe haven laws make leaving a child at the hospital legal , and American children with Down syndrome do often get adopted , this clearly wasn ' t the right way to go about it . So I told Claudia I ' d be back shortly to help , got my own children safely off on the bus to school , and returned to my computer 40 minutes later .
