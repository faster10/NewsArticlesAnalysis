Plan ? Who needs a stinkin ' plan ? The Super PAC for another participant in tonight ' s Fox Business Wall Street Journal debate , Carly Fiorina , is out with a video defending her statement on " Meet the Press " that she doesn ' t need a tax plan or any other plan . " Anybody can write a plan , " replaying what Fiorina said on " Meet " on Sunday . " How often do politicians put out detailed plans ? How often do they get enacted ? Never . That ' s the problem . " The other three participants in tonight ' s main debate , which begins on Fox Business at 9 : 00 pm ET , are Ted Cruz ( who has been climbing in the polls ) , John Kasich ( who started off strong in the last debate but faded after that ) , and Rand Paul ( who has to avoid being the next Republican cut from the main debate stage ) .
