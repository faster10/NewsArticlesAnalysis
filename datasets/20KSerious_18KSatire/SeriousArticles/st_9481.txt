After 20 plus years in this racket , my instinctive inclination is to dismiss out of hand such declarations as overheated , hyperbolic gibberish . Of course in presidential politics there are moments that prove to be turning points , either laying a candidate low or vaulting him to greater glory . But it s rare that such occasions can be predicted in advance . And even rarer is the single setback , however crushing or humiliating , from which a sufficiently determined and resourceful candidate finds it simply impossible to recover . ?
