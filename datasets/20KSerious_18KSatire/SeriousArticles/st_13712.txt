Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated he believes there is no man created global warming . He says the claims were fabricated to restrain industrial development in several countries , including his own . Currently , Russia s pledged carbon dioxide reductions actually amount to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions . Russia has said its emissions will be 70 to 75 percent of 1990 levels by 2030 , yet this amounts to a significant increase in emissions from current levels . Russian emissions are currently far below the levels produced in the Soviet era . Russia will also count its forests as carbon sinks when accounting for emissions , meaning every molecule of carbon dioxide Russia s forests absorb will counterbalance an additional molecule of carbon dioxide its industries will be allowed to emit .
