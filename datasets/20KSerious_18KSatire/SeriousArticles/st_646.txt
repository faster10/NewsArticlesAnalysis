I did not know the man , I have no personal anecdotes about chance encounters with him to share . I have only what most people have : his legacy . Few on this side of the pond had heard of Alan Rickman when he signed on to star opposite Bruce Willis in 1988 ' s Die Hard . In retrospect it seems hard to imagine how risky a gamble that movie was considered at the time : an expensive action picture with an untested TV actor in the lead and an even lesser known British stage veteran as the villain . Yet it ' s almost a perfect piece of cinematic entertainment , and so much of its success hinges on the strength of the two men pitted against one another . Rickman , with his singular , resonant , sepulchral tones coiling themselves lovingly around clever , literate dialogue with the slickness of an eel drenched in light sweet crude , crafted the perfect foil for the wisecracking , blue collar Willis , and established a standard for memorable villains that led every single movie casting agent to burn through their Rolodexes hunting for the next Shakespearean Brit they could pluck from obscurity to face off against the mumbling American action star du jour .
