Lilla Crawford : Well , my manager called up and said that we had to be at the agent ' s office to do a video audition , and so we came over and he said it was going to be an interview about dogs . It was just going to be questions about dogs , so he started asking me a couple of questions about them , and then he finally said , " How does it feel to be ' Annie ' on Broadway ? " And I was like , " What ? What the ? " And he said , " You ' re going to be ' Annie ' on Broadway ! " And I was like , " Really ! ? " That ' s what happened . When I found out , oh my gosh , my heart just stopped . I was so amazed and I was so excited to start .
