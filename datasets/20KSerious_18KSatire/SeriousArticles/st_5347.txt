You spend eight months with a group of men , you re gonna get to know em just by hanging out with em , Murphy said , but to truly get to care and love the guy next to you I think is unique , and that s what I felt like we had in this group . I ll miss each and every one of em this offseason . I most certainly think that this ll be a group of guys that I continue to text with and stay in contact with , and that doesn t happen with every ballclub during the offseason . I made lifelong friends this year , and it s a unique thing , I think in this game , because of the turnover .
