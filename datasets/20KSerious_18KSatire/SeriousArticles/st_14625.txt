The line between those born in the U . S . versus abroad to U . S . parents certainly seems debatable . ? But it is no less sensible than the alternative line between those born abroad to U . S . parents versus those have been naturalized citizens for decades . ? This is one of those issues where general principles ( even living ones ) do not dictate any particular dividing line , and we need some technical fixed rule . ? Unfortunately for Ted Cruz , that technical rule does not permit his candidacy .
