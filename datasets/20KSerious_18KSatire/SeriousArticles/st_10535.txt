The Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades were first heard from when they claimed responsibility for an attack on a Red Cross office in Benghazi late last month . A purported video of the attack was apparently posted on jihadist websites that regularly feature statements by al Qaeda . The video showed several rockets being fired into a building at nighttime . In claiming responsibility , the group stated , " We do not recognize state borders when we plan for our operations , and we have prepared a message that will soon reach America in response to polluting the clarity of the defiant city of Derna , " according to a translation by Flashpoint Partners , which monitors jihadist websites .
