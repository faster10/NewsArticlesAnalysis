A court might simply avoid the harder issue of defining " natural born citizen " and find reasons to allow him on the ballot . It might conclude that no state law authorizes an election official to scrutinize a candidate ' s eligibility , as occurred in some challenges to Obama ' s eligibility . Or a court might conclude that a political primary is not binding on the Republican National Convention since a brokered convention could sort out any prospective nominees ' eligibility questions . A court might also say that this is simply a primary race , not the presidential election itself . So any decisions about his eligibility would be premature .
