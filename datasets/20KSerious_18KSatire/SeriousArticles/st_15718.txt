Based on Chris Claremont and Frank Miller ' s much loved 1982 comic book arc , The Wolverine is an existential ( and at times soddenly heavy ) story about our razor taloned hero grappling with the burden of immortality and loss . But before we wade into that therapy session , the film opens with a harrowing sequence set , like most of the film , in Japan . It ' s WWII , and Jackman ' s Logan is imprisoned in a Japanese POW camp in Nagasaki as B 29s fly overhead to deliver the atomic bomb . During the blast he saves one of his captors , a soldier named Yashida , who , during the explosion , learns of Wolverine ' s invincibility and ability to heal his own wounds .
