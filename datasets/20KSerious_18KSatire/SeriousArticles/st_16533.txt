The Iraqi army s stockpile swelled around the Iran Iraq war in the 80s . This was a seminal moment in the development of the modern global arms market , when at least 34 different countries supplied Iraq with weapons ? 28 of those same states were also simultaneously supplying arms to Iran . After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 , a UN arms embargo decreased imports until 2003 . However , during and after the US led invasion , Iraq was again flooded with weapons imports . Those weapons weren t properly audited by the US led coalition forces and hundreds of thousands went missing . ?
