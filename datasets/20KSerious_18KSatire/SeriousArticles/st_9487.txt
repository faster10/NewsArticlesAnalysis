It s possible , to be sure , that reports of Bush s death are exaggerated , and that the Boulder debate will turn out to be , in the argot of addiction , the night when he hit bottom and rehab and recovery became possible . Bush still has ample resources supporting his candidacy ? although they reside for the most part in Murphy s hands . The race is now arguably wider open than ever , with no clear establishment front runner ? though Rubio may rapidly stake a claim to that spot if his polls numbers rise as sharply as I expect they will , and even New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is showing signs of life that were unthinkable over the summer . If Bush were to shift most of his focus to New Hampshire , a la John McCain in 2008 , it ' s not inconceivable that he could win there ? though in visits to the Granite State ? throughout the year , it has been difficult to locate , and not for lack of trying , voters who are enthusiastically for him .
