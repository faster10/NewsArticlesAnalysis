As a writer , one of my most important responsibilities is listening . I try to do so with an open mind , so I can hear the voices of the characters whose stories I will tell . When I wrote about Afghan women in my second novel , I thought about the brave women I had met in Kabul and about their stories . Their voices came to me in hushed whispers . At times they woke me in the night with the urgency of what they had to say . I am indebted to those women , because without them , my novels would lack authenticity and would also be far less likely to resonate with readers .
