Because one might wonder why an INSANELY patient man just happens to be living in a secluded cabin with a man sized cage , it turns out Eastman has his own tragedy to deal with . A criminal that he assessed for the state the only truly evil person he ' s met broke out of prison just to kill his entire family . Eastman ? built the cabin , and the cage , with the intent to lock the murderer in it and let him starve to death . And yes , he did do it . It turns out he and Morgan have more in common than they thought . ? It was also this act , this murder , that led Eastman to become the man he is . It ' s why he refuses to kill anyone or anything ( he ' s a vegetarian , even ) , and why he wants Morgan to do the same . All life is precious , he says , and he ' s the man who ' s killed a ? truly evil person . And Morgan starts to get it .
