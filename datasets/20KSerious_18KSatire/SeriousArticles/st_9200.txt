The scrums were a major blight on this match and Irish referee George Clancy never got to grips with them , one factor in styming Scotland ' s attack . He scolded both front rows at one stage for a " terrible attitude " as successive scrums ended in penalties , twice against Scotland for ' early engage ' , and seemed to give up in the second half . The lineouts were not much better , and ultimately the Italians used two one at the end of each half to turn one area of dominance into the match winning points .
