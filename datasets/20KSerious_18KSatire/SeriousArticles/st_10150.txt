Detroit Lions : The Lions have to cram two days of work into Tuesday as the Thanksgiving day game against Philadelphia approaches . The good thing for the Lions is they don ' t have any major injury holes to fill on the short week something that hasn ' t always been the case this season . Detroit came through Sunday ' s game against Oakland relatively healthy . This is critical , especially on defense , since Philadelphia ' s offensive pace is something a lot of the Lions have not yet faced . Michael Rothstein
