Additional sanctions should target North Korean use of international banks to conduct illicit activities . Although some of these institutions have been targeted ( most notably Banco Delta Asia in 2005 ) , more can be done to cut North Korea off from its international financing .

This same coalition would work together to pressure Beijing to increase inspections and cut off illicit banking activities with North Korea .
