I would arrive in the morning through the garage and come up on the elevators and come in through the cabinet office door , which is downstairs , and then in the evening when I left , you know , sometimes it d be late , depending on what was going on , I would go the same way . I would go down the elevators and out through the garage and be driven ? driven to my car from the garage , just because there were a lot of people out front on the main floor , and , at least in this small pond , knowledge of my presence would have been provocative , because I have a political background .
