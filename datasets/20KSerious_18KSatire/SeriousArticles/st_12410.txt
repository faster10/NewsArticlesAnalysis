First time feature writer director Marielle Heller handles a tricky task in her adaptation of cartoonist Phoebe Gloeckner ' s semi autobiographical graphic novel about sexual and chemical experimentation in 1970s San Francisco . Heller nods to the story ' s comic book origins with a few animated interludes , but for the most part her best special effect is young British actress Bel Powley , who lights up the screen as a precocious high schooler . The film suffers some from imposing a plot arc onto material that might ' ve worked better as a series of anecdotes about a libertine youth . But Powell brings a combination of carnality and wide eyed innocence to a character who treats sex , drugs and art as pass cards into the secret club of adults . The DVD and Blu ray include deleted scenes and featurettes .
