In fairness , the idea of avoiding past liability is not a novel concept in the esoteric world of bankruptcy . In fact , the public policy behind it makes sense . Bankruptcy is a process where people and businesses can eliminate or repay some or all of their debts , under the watchful eye of an intervening federal bankruptcy court . To help them " start over , " companies or persons may obtain a discharge , or forgiveness , of debt in the process . The debtor is released from liability for the debt . Sorry creditors .
