In one league I ' m in , the playoffs start in Week 21 , on March 14 . If Griffin comes back on the shorter end of his timetable and avoids any discipline , which seems unlikely you ' ll get him back with three weeks to go before the playoffs . However , if it starts pushing toward a six week timetable , Griffin may not be back until right before the playoffs even without a potential suspension . If you ' re scratching and clawing for a playoff spot as it is and without Griffin , that seems likely and don ' t have an injury spot to spare , you might actually have to consider dropping Griffin .
