Remember , Alabama was left for dead after it lost at home to Ole Miss . The dynasty was over . But not only did the Crimson Tide return to reign over the SEC once again , rocketing back into the College Football Playoff conversation and No . 2 in the rankings , they did so by winning in almost every way imaginable . There have been close games and blowouts . When the passing game has failed , the running game has been the saving grace . When all else fails , the defense has been there . Even special teams have shown up with punt returns for touchdowns and more field goals made than we ve seen in years .
