The Broncos have a superior defense , but Newton showed he can perform against a talented defense when he ran for two touchdowns against a Cardinals unit that had allowed only one to opposing quarterbacks all season . The age difference between Manning and Newton has developed into a storyline , and Super Bowl 50 is becoming a matchup of old school vs . new school . " Just a lot of unorthodox things , and we just weren ' t very sound in our defense today " . I ' m excited . But we ' re not done yet . And they were in contention for home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs until losing at home in a blowout to the Seahawks in the regular season finale to finish with the NFC ' s No . 2 seed behind Carolina . " We put Carolina up at 5 . 5 , and it was quickly bet down " , Kornegay said .
