In his address to Congress in March 1964 , Johnson said : " What you are being asked to consider is not a simple or an easy program . But poverty is not a simple or an easy enemy . It cannot be driven from the land by a single attack on a single front . Were this so , we would have conquered poverty long ago . Nor can it be conquered by government alone . For decades American labor and American business , private institutions and private individuals have been engaged in strengthening our economy and offering new opportunity to those in need . We need their help , their support , and their full participation . Through this program we offer new incentives and new opportunities for cooperation , so that all the energy of our nation , not merely the efforts of government , can be brought to bear on our common enemy .
