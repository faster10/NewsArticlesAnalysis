Minorities can be prejudiced against one another . But in the long run , any party that targets and demonises one entire group will lose support from all other minorities .

They really need a Hispanic candidate if they are to have a good chance of winning next year , and reversing the catastrophic damage already inflicted upon them by Trump .
