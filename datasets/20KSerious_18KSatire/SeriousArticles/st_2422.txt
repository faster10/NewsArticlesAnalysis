On Saturday I received an e mail with an eyewitness account from a women ' s organization with offices in the heart of Istanbul . It read : " Three days ago at midnight bulldozers charged into Gezi Park , home to century old trees . Concerned citizens quickly shared this information on Facebook , Twitter ( direngezipark , occupygezi ) , Instagram , and other social media , and numerous other people joined them to stop the destruction . From then on , protesters have been occupying Gezi Park day and night , despite being attacked by police forces with pepper gas and high pressure water jets . "
