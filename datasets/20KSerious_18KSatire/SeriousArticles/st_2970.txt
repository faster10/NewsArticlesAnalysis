As far as Greg , he s done a really good job in our locker room of presenting himself as a good teammate , Romo said . I think a lot of times the people who are in the locker room , we get to see people on a daily basis and what you find sometimes is you can create relationships getting to know someone day in and day out and how they compete and how they play . Then guys obviously have lives when we leave this place and we all want to be better and we want to be the best version of ourselves day in and day out . I think Greg s trying to continue to do that same thing . He comes in with a good attitude and a good work ethic here in the building so the teammates obviously work for him .
