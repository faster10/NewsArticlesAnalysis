Dwayne Harris became the first Giants player in 60 years with a punt and kickoff return for a touchdown in the same season . He joins Emlen Tunnell ( 1951 ) and Jimmy Patton ( 1955 ) as the only Giants with that rare double . Rueben Randle did not start the second half he was replaced by Hakeem Nicks . For the first time this season , the Giants had Beckham back on punt returns along with Harris . Pugh , on how tough it is to lose to the Jets : Yeah , because you see em around town . I got to see em at charity events , I feel like I was getting after some of their guys up front and I was feeling good about it . Hey , they won the game , hats off to them , they beat us . It s a tough one , yeah , for sure . For sure . It s no fun .
