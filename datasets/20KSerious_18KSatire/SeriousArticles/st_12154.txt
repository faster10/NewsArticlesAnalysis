" The Texas Constitution clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman , as Texas voters approved by an overwhelming majority , " he said in a statement on Wednesday . " The law of Texas has not changed , and will not change due to the whims of any individual judge or county clerk operating on their own capacity anywhere in Texas . Activist judges don ' t change Texas law , and we will continue to aggressively defend the laws of our state and will ensure that any licenses issued contrary to law are invalid . "
