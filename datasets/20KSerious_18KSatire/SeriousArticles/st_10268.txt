Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called an emergency Cabinet meeting in Rome . Speaking to journalists later , he defended Italy ' s response . " Adding 10 more vessels " to patrol the Mediterranean , Renzi said , wouldn ' t solve the root of why the tragedy occurred . " This has to be clear : there was not an absence ( of rescue vessels ) which led to the disaster . And this is the proof that if you want to eradicate the problem from the root , you have to respond in a different way . And what we ' re doing in the next few hours will show this . "
