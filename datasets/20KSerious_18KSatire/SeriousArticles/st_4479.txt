For me , that s the saddest moment of all of Morgan s journey ? ? in the sense that he s given two choices , and he picks neither . I think you re absolutely right : He s not worth it at that point . It s why he keeps asking Eastman to kill him . He has craved death since he lost his son . So that moment where Eastman goes , you can do this or you can do that , he s simply not capable any more at that particular point . He s defeated . He s physically defeated because Eastman has just kicked his ass , but he s also just emotionally defeated . And actually the only sanctuary is in a cell that has a door that isn t even locked , but he wants that door closed . That , for me , was Morgan s rock bottom .
