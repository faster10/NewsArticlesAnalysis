There are two major hurdles to the contract . First , New Delhi and had Paris agreed the price of the 36 Rafales would be less than what Dassault had quoted in response to the Indian tender of 2007 for 126 medium multi role combat aircraft ( MMRCA ) . Of those 126 fighters , the first 18 were to be supplied in " flyaway condition " , i . e . fully built . Since 36 Rafales are now being bought in " flyaway condition " , their per piece price must be lower than what Dassault quoted for those 18 fighters .
