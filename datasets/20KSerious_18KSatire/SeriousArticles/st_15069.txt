I hesitated to check in with them because I didn ' t know what kind of reception I would get . I was pretty confident his mom knew me well enough that she wouldn ' t believe any lies he might tell and , despite everything , I had a hard time really believing my ex could be that vindictive . Turns out , my instinct was right his mom texted me on my birthday , as did his sister . It was a wonderful birthday present , knowing he hadn ' t tried to taint their view of me and that they still very much wanted to keep in touch .
