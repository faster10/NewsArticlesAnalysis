An example of this shaming came in an exchange with Charles J . Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan . As Cooper propped up the notion of " responsible procreation " as being the reason why marriage should only be between a man and a woman , Kagan destroyed this reasoning , saying , " Suppose a state said , . . . Because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation , we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55 , " adding , " I can just assure you , if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55 , there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage .
