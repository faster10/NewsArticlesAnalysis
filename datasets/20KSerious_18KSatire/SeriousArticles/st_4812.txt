This huge cut will happen , but it is part of a bigger plan . Since 2013 , with some caveats , councils have kept half of the money they get from business rates , and carried on putting the rest into a centrally administered pot . This is then spread around the country according to the current council funding formula ? whose iniquities are a big source of complaint among council leaders , but which at least represents some residual idea of redistribution , not least from south to north . Now , councils are to largely keep all their income from business rates , while the money passed to local authorities from central government will eventually be cut to nothing . How this will be phased in and what any redistributive element might look like is unclear , though it s pretty obvious that a system of top ups and tariffs will be much less redistributive than the current system .
