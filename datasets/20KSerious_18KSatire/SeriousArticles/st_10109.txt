It was emotional . I think we all went out afterwards me , Britt and Anna just to sort of have a little celebration . But it was very very emotional . I don ' t think there was a dry eye when we shot that scene . It ' s very clear the relationship when Tara goes , " I would die for you . " Basically , I would take a bullet for you . That ' s not necessarily a best friend she ' s like my sister . I think it was so amazing to see that . To see her walk in and go , " Oh , uh uh . " That goes to show you how much love Tara has . Anna in that moment I think played it so beautifully , and it was hard for me because I was like , " Okay , play dead . Play dead . "
