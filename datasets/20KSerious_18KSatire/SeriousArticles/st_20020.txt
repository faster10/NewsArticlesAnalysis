Roberto Martinez , Manager of Everton Football Club , said : ' This is a sad day for Everton Football Club and for every Evertonian . Sir Philip was an incredible custodian of the Club , a pure gentleman and a man I feel really fortunate to have met , for I learnt much about the essence of Everton from him . From my earliest days here , I was able to sit down and chat with Sir Philip at Finch Farm . He was generous with his time and with his recollection of so many of the experiences he went through as Chairman . Some of those moments had been extremely difficult but , ultimately , his guiding hand contributed to some of the Club ' s greatest successes and , for me personally , the conversations we shared will always give me guidance in terms of the future that we are trying to build for Everton .
