The irony of right wing pundits lamenting Palin s huckterism is impossible to miss . Palin only exists because they propped her up , and because of John McCain s bottomless cynicism . And no one in the party or the punditocracy has really owned this . Nominating Sarah Palin to be Vice President now feels like a turning point , both for the country and for the Republican Party . It was the culmination of a conservative politics fueled by Fox News and talk radio . ? Palin s nomination and ? the Tea Party movement that followed ? really prepared the way for Donald Trump . And despite ? all their hand wringing , Sarah Palin is the child of right wing media , and Donald Trump is now the face of the party .
