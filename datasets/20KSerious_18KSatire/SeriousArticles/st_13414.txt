What Fidel took away , the damage he did , is hard to understand for those who didn t experience it directly . The rage he still provokes is well deserved . Even I feel it sometimes when I see video of him standing at a podium , giving one of those endless speeches ( similar to Cruz s infamous 21 hour filibuster ) . He turned his back on those whose courage had helped bring him to power , and destroyed what was then among the most advanced , culturally rich societies in Latin America . He tore apart families , including my own , and worst of all , he got away with it .
