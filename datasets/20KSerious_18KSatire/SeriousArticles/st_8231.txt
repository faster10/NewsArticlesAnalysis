These markets are where the romance of the holiday comes alive in grand tradition smells of gingerbread and roasting sausages waft through the cold air , handmade ornaments adorn ancient fir trees , master glassblowers and other artisans ply their crafts in wooden stalls , shoppers bustle past Gothic church facades and half timbered houses , pausing to sip their gl hwein , heavily spiced and mulled " glow wine " the piping hot beverage of choice at any self respecting Teutonic Christmas market .
