Considering that the game came down to energy , one could argue that the Bucks didn t beat the Warriors , the schedule did .

To compound matters further , Golden State had just squeaked out a grueling double overtime win over the Boston Celtics the night before at TD Garden . Added to this , forward Harrison Barnes was out , while Klay Thompson was playing with an ankle injury that had kept him out of the Boston game .
