In the two games since his second injury , the results have been mixed . In the first , a convincing road win in Detroit , they looked sharp and cohesive . Gasol , whose fit with Noah had been questionable since arriving from L . A . , poured in 31 points and 10 rebounds , and four other Bulls scored in double digits . But if there was ever a game that would test how the Noah less Bulls would match up against elite competition , it was Wednesday against Golden State , and they were no match for the defending champs . The Warriors shredded Chicago s interior defense and out hustled them on the boards , resulting in a second straight beatdown of a top team in the East . The Bulls looked flat and unmotivated , and they surely missed Noah s energy in a game where they showed few signs of life .
