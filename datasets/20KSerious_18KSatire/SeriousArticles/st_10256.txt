It ' s amazing that the project continued after anarchists burned Gaudi ' s studio , along with the plans for the church , during the Spanish Civil War . Luckily , Gaudi had made plaster models of the church ( we see them in the museum at the site ) and though they were also smashed , his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue . Gaudi , so obsessed at the end of his life with completing the church , slept on a bed in his workshop . He is buried in the church ' s crypt .
