I feel particularly sad for the grieving parents who might not be Christian , Jewish or Muslim . Besides learning that they are somehow lacking in empathy or goodness or the ability to heal , little guidance is being provided to those who among them have decided that they cannot believe in a sometimes violent and irascible God or who in fact have found their faith in God in question as a result of this tragedy . For these people , as for me , the thought that God has " called their children home " is simply offensive .
