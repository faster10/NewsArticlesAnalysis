The first inkling that the Paris attacks might have had a Molenbeek connection was the fact that one of the vehicles they used was a rental car from Brussels . French police then found a second car on Sunday used in the attacks abandoned in the Paris suburb of Montreuil , inside were Kalashnikovs and a Molenbeek parking ticket . Some seven people were arrested in four raids in Molenbeek on Saturday . On Sunday , French authorities said two of the attackers were French citizens who had been living in Molenbeek .
