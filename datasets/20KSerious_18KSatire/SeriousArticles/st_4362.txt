The legacy of brutal enforcement in China is nevertheless profound : there is a national gender imbalance , the product of the preference for a male child , which could leave some 19 million young men in want of a wife . Precariously financed local governments have collected billions in fines for children born without party approval , revenues they will only reluctantly forgo . Those who could not afford to pay found other ways : in extreme cases they resorted to infanticide others abandoned unwanted infants or sent them to relatives . One result is an unknown number of undocumented citizens , and children who have been denied access to public education or health services . Will the government truly abandon its interference in family life and declare an amnesty for the casualties of an overbearing and cruel policy ?
