A lot of that firepower is being used in Yemen . The 10 month bombing campaign against the Iran backed Shia rebels , the Houthis , has been sloppy . The UN estimates that 2 , 600 Yemen civilians were killed from March to October , including 1 , 600 in Saudi led airstrikes . To pay for the war , the Saudis have been dipping into shrinking foreign currency reserves . The only thing it accomplished is to create a major humanitarian crisis , Hartung says . The air campaign has been led by the king s 30 year old son , Mohammad bin Salman , the youngest defense minister in the world . They should be worried about ISIS , but instead they re spending all their blood and treasure in Yemen as some kind of anti Iranian measure , Hartung says . And it s a disaster .
