The US Deputy Secretary of State expressed his appreciation for the efforts that Pakistan has been making for regional peace and development . He remarked that successful holding of Heart of Asia Conference was a clear manifestation of Pakistan s sincerity to promote security , peace and development not only in the neighbouring Afghanistan but also the entire region . The minister said that while there is a need to make collective efforts against extremist elements , individuals and groups , the international community must not close its eyes to certain actions at the state level in some countries that appear to be targeting certain communities and specific groups . He said that hatred and vindictiveness at any level would only sow the seeds of discontent and would be counterproductive towards ensuring lasting peace .
