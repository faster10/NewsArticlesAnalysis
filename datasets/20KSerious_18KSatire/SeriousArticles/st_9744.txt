On Monday , I wrote a piece about how a Black Lives Matter protester was beaten upon by Donald Trump supporters at a Birmingham , Alabama , rally over the weekend . Trump endorsed that thuggery and was proud that his supporters were so spirited . Adding to the grotesqueness of Donald Trump s embrace of political violence , Robert Kiger , a fundraiser aligned with a group backing Trump , made the bizarre suggestion that he , as a white man , would be beaten up if he went into a black church . Therefore , the violent attack on a Black Lives Matter protester at Trump s rally was expected , understood and reasonable in Kiger s twisted , demented and profoundly racist imagination .
