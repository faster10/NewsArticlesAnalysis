Banerjee , Patnaik , Mulayam Singh Yadav and even the Left parties might draw a line at joining a government headed by Gandhi or the Congress . Kumar presents no threat . For Gandhi and the Congress , this is a difficult choice to make . On the one hand , the Congress should not , and must not , dilute its strength at the altar of opposition unity . On the other , being exclusivist can only end in isolation and decimation . Being part of a coalition needs sacrifice and the Congress knows this better than anyone else . Will Gandhi yield in making this existential choice ? Or will he continue to press on alone , even if it means the decline of the Congress and rise of the BJP ?
