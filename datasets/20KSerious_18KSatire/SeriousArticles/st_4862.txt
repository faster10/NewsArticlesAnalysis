We recently caught up with Eddie at his 5150 Studio , high in the hills above Los Angeles . It ' s where the album " 1984 " was recorded , along with every subsequent Van Halen record . The studio sits on seven acres , just a stone ' s throw from the Tudor mansion he bought in 1980 . He and his fiancee publicist , Janie Liszewski , scoot around the property in golf carts . The red , white and black striped motif of his signature Van Halen guitar is painted on the walkway . The following is an edited version of the interview .
