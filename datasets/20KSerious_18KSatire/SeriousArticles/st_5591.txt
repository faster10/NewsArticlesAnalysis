Unlike Ted Cruz , which is why Cruz won . Trump also didn t prove popular among ideological conservatives or lifelong Republicans . He did well among those who had never caucused before and ? believe it or not ? self described moderates . Perhaps this is because Trump used to be for legalised abortion or because he s sympathetic towards President Barack Obama s health care reforms . Either way , the very conservative voters of Iowa went for Senator Ted Cruz instead ? a candidate even more loathed by the party establishment .
