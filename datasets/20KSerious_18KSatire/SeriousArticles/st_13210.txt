There is evidence that sacrificing human rights has not made America any safer . For instance , the increased use of drone attacks might or might not have disrupted terror networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan , but we do know that they have killed and injured countless civilians and inflamed anti American rhetoric . The issue isn ' t whether the United States will be able to win a popularity contest in the region ( this is doubtful even in the best of times ) , but rather , that alienating large swaths of the local population makes it much more difficult to defeat terrorism .
