In South Africa , I met courageous journalists who had risked their lives and lived in daily fear because they dared to speak out against apartheid . They taught me more about journalism ethics and reporting than any college course could . And I met loving mothers and young women and men who refused to let generations of oppression crush their determination to fight for freedom , or their joy for the small blessings in life . And I learned that though there are times when the best battle strategy is take up arms to fight your enemies , it is wiser in the long run to show grace in the face of hatred .
