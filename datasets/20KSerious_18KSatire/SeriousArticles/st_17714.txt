LZ : The person who could fall the most from tonight is Ben Carson he definitely has the most to lose . He didn t even know what the debt ceiling was a couple weeks ago . If that s where he was two weeks ago , I don t know how he is going to come up with a plan for this country . You have to understand economics on a large scale , a global scale to communicate those holes and your plan for addressing those holes and I don t know if a guy who didn t know what the debt ceiling was could do that .
