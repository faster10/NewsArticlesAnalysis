In an assertion of same sex marriage rights , Attorney General Eric Holder is applying a landmark Supreme Court ruling to the Justice Department , announcing Saturday that same sex spouses cannot be compelled to testify against each other , should be eligible to file for bankruptcy jointly and are entitled to the same rights and privileges as federal prison inmates in opposite sex marriages . The Justice Department runs a number of benefits programs , and Holder says same sex couples will qualify for them . They include the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and benefits to surviving spouses of public safety officers who suffer catastrophic or fatal injuries in the line of duty . ' In every courthouse , in every proceeding and in every place where a member of the Department of Justice stands on behalf of the United States , they will strive to ensure that same sex marriages receive the same privileges , protections and rights as opposite sex marriages under federal law , ' Holder said in prepared remarks to the Human Rights Campaign in New York .
