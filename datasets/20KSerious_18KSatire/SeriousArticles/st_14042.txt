There is a growing concern that the president will not seriously negotiate with Congress on a compromise to sequestration until after it takes place on March 1 and each member of Congress hears of the pain affecting his or her constituents . But the real pain will be felt by the men and women serving our country , who will see arbitrary cuts to the resources they so desperately need . They will be asked immediately to do more with less and accept greater risk in a world that is becoming more dangerous by the day . This is an unconscionable position and a dereliction of duty .
