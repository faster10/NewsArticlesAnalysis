This has been a good game so far and it seems quite likely that there will be more goals in the second half . Everton are really trying to stretch the play instead of staying narrow and making it difficult for Man City to play . Pellegrini is trying to do something about that and is getting Jesus Navas ready to come on for the second half . Beware Navas and his pace ! But almost nothing else . Navas ' favourite thing to do is run in a straight line then either cross to no one or pass backwards he never , ever shoots . And when he does he usually misses . Don ' t get me wrong , he ' s still clearly very good , but I ' m not sure he ' s the answer .
