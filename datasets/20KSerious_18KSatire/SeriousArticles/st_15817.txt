Rubio supporters point out that Cruz did believe at one time that there should be more visas for skilled workers and some kind of path to legalization . And there s no doubt he s become more dogmatically anti immigrant in recent years . But if Marco Rubio s argument to the rabid GOP base is that Ted Cruz is just as bad on immigration as he is , it s unlikely to be very persuasive . Cruz has a lot of problems but being insufficiently right wing isn t one of them . It s hard to see how that helps Rubio in any case .
