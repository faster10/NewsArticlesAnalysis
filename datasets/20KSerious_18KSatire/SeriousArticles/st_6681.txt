" Early on I wanted to run a company , but I quickly realized there was this other model available . Maybe I ' m blazing a new path with this model because you don ' t typically see this . You see investors who have portfolio companies but aren ' t very active , or entrepreneurs who typically run one company for their entire life , or occasionally , serial entrepreneurs who do a series of small companies . But they typically run them for a fairly long period of time . I ' ve been doing a hybrid of investing and entrepreneurship , which I think initially I wasn ' t set out to do . But I realized it fit my personality . "
