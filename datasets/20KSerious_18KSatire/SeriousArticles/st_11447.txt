This semi final was supposed to be all about Lionel Messi v Ronaldinho , who both played for Barcelona , but Sergio Aguero took centre stage instead . Former Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano was also to play a pivotal part and , again , there were red cards . Brazil finished with nine men after having Lucas Leiva , also of Liverpool , and Thiago Neves sent off in the last 10 minutes , both for tackles on Mascherano . Watched by Maradona , Aguero scored twice in five minutes , with suggestions that the first hit his hand . Aguero also won the penalty as he drew a challenge from Breno and Juan Riquelme scored from the spot .
