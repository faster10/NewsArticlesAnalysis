Denver is now a more traditional team , and relies on the run and an ornery defense . Indeed , on the game winning drive against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday , Manning threw just three passes . Overall , he completed 21 passes for 222 yards and no touchdowns . All world wideouts Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas caught a combined nine passes . Meanwhile , the Broncos handed the ball to C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman a total of 31 times . While Brady clearly carries the Patriots , the overwhelming sense is that the Denver defense carries the quarterback .
