Pressurized crankcase due to clogged PCV or breather system : Your car ' s engine is a giant air pump , consequently it must breathe . The PCV ( Positive Crankcase Ventilation ) system allows the engine to exhaust the excess pressure buildup ( which is a natural phenomenon of the internal combustion engine ) . Carbon is a by product of an engine and can build up in the PCV system , clogging the breathing passages . This in turn pressurizes the oil pan and pushes oil up into the fuel delivery system where it is fed into the engine and burned . AOL Autos : Do I need to replace my air filter ?
