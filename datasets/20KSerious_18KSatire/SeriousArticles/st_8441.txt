It is no coincidence that the country with one of the highest rates of civilian gun violence in the world also has the most heavily armed civilian population on the planet . Home to fewer than 5 per cent of the world s population , the United States has between a third and a half of the world s civilian owned guns . It has about 270 million firearms , or 89 per 100 people , according to the Small Arms Survey 2011 , a Geneva based research project that collects data on guns . This bursts the myth that more guns makes the country safer .
