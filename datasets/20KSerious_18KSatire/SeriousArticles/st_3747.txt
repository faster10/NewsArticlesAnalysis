Not only have the Liberal Democrats advanced ( they took 62 seats last time with 23 per cent of the vote ) but so have other smaller parties . In Scotland and Wales in 2005 the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru ( Welsh Nationalists ) won 10 seats between them . And in local government contests and European Parliament elections , fringe parties like the Greens , the British National Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party have shown their ability to collect significant voting support .
