Jude must have known Christian Bale had the gale winds of " American Hustle " at his back . David , a great strategist , and Miles the Scorsese devotee , both recognized Leo DiCaprio ' s high standing with the Academy , even if Miles won ' t be seeing that film anytime soon , I pray . We all had faith in Bruce , Matthew and Chiwetel ( funny how we know them all by first name . ) I held out for Robert Redford because , well , he ' s Redford , and because I ' m un young . That should teach me to stop leading with my heart . But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr Oscars himself , Tom Hanks , could pay off ? If I had I would have won for once .
