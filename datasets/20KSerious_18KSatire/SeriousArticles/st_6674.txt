MM : In September 2014 , we saw on Facebook that there had been boil advisories for E . Coli . That was how they notified the citizens just put it on Facebook . They told us if we boiled the water , it would kill the E . Coli . But here ' s the thing : When you boil water with metal in it , it becomes more concentrated . Then it enters your bloodstream directly . So basically , they were poisoning the city by telling us to boil the water . They knew that and they didn ' t tell us . They should have told us to use bottled water and a filter . People were showing up at meetings with brown , red , yellow water , and the officials just said , " You have a rusty pipe , you have to deal with it . " They took away our ability to protect our families .
