" Hartsfield Jackson provides designated , specially designed smoking lounges on each concourse for the convenience and comfort of our passengers who choose to smoke , " airport spokesman John Kennedy said in an e mail . " The Airport ' s layout and design does not allow for outside smoking areas in the sterile concourses and the smoking lounges eliminate the need for passengers wishing to smoke to exit and then re enter the secured areas , or seek other alternatives to smoke inside the Airport .
