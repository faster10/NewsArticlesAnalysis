Which begs the question : at a time when Rihanna can make the biggest impact and has apparently been working on this record longer than her others , why does Anti feel so undercooked ? This is not the bombastic swagger we ve come to expect from RiRi . Neither does it feel particularly intimate . There are neither commercial hits nor interesting personal explorations . There are neither radio baiting by numbers tunes , nor avant garde , innovative production techniques . There is neither an all star supporting guest list featuring on tracks , nor an asserting of her unique personality and identity . ? ?
