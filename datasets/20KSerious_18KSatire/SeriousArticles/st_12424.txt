This is a tough inclusion because , by all accounts , Gundy realized that he ' d made a mistake with his approach to defending a player . And there ' s no question that his instinct to stick up for one of his own was the right one . Even in 2008 , though , the Internet culture of ridicule and mockery had taken root , and Gundy ' s emotional outburst became fodder for so many jokes and lists like these . In an ideal world , maybe Gundy ' s rant would remind us all that people can change and that we aren ' t defined by our most visible moments ? a lesson Kanye West has had ample opportunity to learn . Unfortunately , this is not that world .
