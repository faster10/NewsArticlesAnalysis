The second possible explanation is that while we had some information about al Assad ' s plans , we didn ' t have enough confirmation to act on that information . This is probably the most likely explanation . We can ' t act on inklings , hunches , or possibilities . We probably can ' t even act on probabilities we have to be sure . But when it comes to intelligence , it ' s hard to be sure . There could always be something else going on something we ' re not able to eavesdrop on , spy on , or see from our satellites . Again , our knowledge is most obvious after the fact .
