Can Kirk Cousins keep the Redskins offense rolling ? During a four game winning streak , the Redskins have scored at least 24 points . Cousins , in that period , has completed 74 percent of his passes for 1 , 160 yards , 12 touchdowns and just one interception . The fourth year quarterback s decision making has been exceptionally sharp lately and that will need to continue on Sunday . Of course , tight end Jordan Reed will be a factor . When Cousins and Reed are rolling , it s hard to stop the Redskins and their complete arsenal of playmakers such as wide receivers DeSean Jackson , Pierre Garcon and rookie Jamison Crowder . The Redskins have been particularly strong in the first quarter and another fast start is desired on Sunday .
