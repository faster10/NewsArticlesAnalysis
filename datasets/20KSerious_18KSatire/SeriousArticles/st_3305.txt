? Dom Cosentino , Jets beat reporter ( 5 6 against the spread , 6 5 straight up ) : ? The Jets have already proved they can win without Revis . But they did it against the Dolphins , who stink on ice , so forget I mentioned it . Their best strategy , even without Revis , is to double Beckham . And the Dolphins game revealed a willingness to play more zone coverage when necessary . On offense , if the Jets can get a receiver other than Brandon Marshall or Eric Decker to make a play , they ought to be OK . Also , it ' s going to be great when the eventual NFC champ is 7 9 . Jets 24 , Giants 21 ?
