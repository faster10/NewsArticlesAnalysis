Francis took to the balcony with the word " bishop " crossing his lips more than " pope " or " pontiff . " He referred to himself first as the bishop of Rome and to Benedict XVI not as retired pope but emeritus bishop . There was something genuine about the way he referred to the journey of faith as one that he and the faithful take together in love and trust . He asked for help and the favor of a prayer but this wasn ' t the standard " pray for me . " Pope Francis bowed to receive that prayer from the people of God he now serves .
