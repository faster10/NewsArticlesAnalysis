Indian FM Suashma Swaraj came for the conference , met Pakistani leaders and there was a decision about the resumption of dialogue between the two countries . This is a welcome development . But the way the news about her arrival and interaction with our leader overshadowed news about rest of the conference in the media shows the schizophrenic mindset of our mainstream media . On the one hand it is ready to go into an anti India crusade at the throw of a hat and on the other hand it is over exuberant and overexcited at any news about reapportionment between the two countries . A few years ago there was a lot of hue and cry about a remark of former President Asif Ali Zardari when he had said that there is an Indian hiding inside every Pakistani . In view of the aforementioned attitude of our media it seems he was not wide off the mark .
