Last week after reading the tealeaves , Transcanada asked to pause the permitting process to allow Nebraska to study a re route plan to deal with objections there . I believe the real reason was that they were betting that a delay could give them an opportunity to get it approved under a new president in 2017 . Hillary , the likely candidate for the Dems and leading most all national polls , had a serious political problem . . . if she supports the project , she ' ll lose her environmentalist base . If she rejects , she would lose a huge part of her money base , Wall Street and industry . I believe Obama , with little to lose at this point , decided to fall on his sword and reject the pipeline , taking it off the table for the 2016 election . While being couched as a climate change issue , the real reason for the rejection was pure politics . Surprise !
