There are those who insist that without the cooperation of Congress and Senate the presidency can achieve nothing , that one can only bring change by working " within the system " . One could take this argument seriously were it not for the fact that the failure of Congress to pass sensible gun laws , the sabotage of the Affordable Healthcare Act and the immutability of the Bush era tax cuts for the rich are staring us in the face . Unfortunately , what the Obama administration continued to do was to work " within the system " which allowed the GOP to block any legislation that ran contrary to the interest of corporate lobbies . The President of the United States is most certainly not a powerless puppet unless the office allows itself to be as such . In Bernie Sanders we have a candidate who will at least resist the influence of lobbies and use Presidential power to do what he constitutionally can to rid the country of the parasitic oligarchy that currently dictates terms .
