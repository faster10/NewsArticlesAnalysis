One hesitates to call the Party of Putin suicidal , masochistic or driven by self hatred or a taste for treason yet its members say nothing when , for the first time since the Cold War , the Kremlin alters by force frontiers upon which the continent ' s collective security depends . They do not know , or pretend not to know , that Putin is an empire builder surrounded by ideologues whose vision of the world , though complex and robust , is in all key respects opposed to that of the West . They place right and law in the service of strength and force , rather than vice versa , prioritize order over liberty and treat gay people and other " deviants " as the quintessence of a decadent West emasculated by the poison of cosmopolitanism .
