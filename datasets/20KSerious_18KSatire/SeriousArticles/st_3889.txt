( On pass protection for Russell Wilson ) We got sacked on the big play pass when he was trying to wait it out and see if he could get a guy to come clear , and that was a long time to hold the football on that one . I don t remember the other one , I don t know which one it was . I do know that we worked really well together today . Those guys worked hard to give him a chance , and we were able to get the ball out and not get nailed back there . We re getting better . We certainly have improved . After the start of the season , when you look at the last three weeks , we ve improved considerably . It s about time .
