Think back to your favourite new TV shows from last year , and my bet is that a Netflix original will be among them ? maybe it was the raucous new season of Orange is the New Black , or the gritty , Spanish language Narcos chronicling drug baron Pablo Escobar s outrageous life . Whatever floated your boat , 3 . 2 billion of us collectively streamed 42 . 5 billion hours of Netflix in 2015 , with 12 billion hours in the last three months alone . Netflix ended the year officially available in 60 countries .
