The reason Type Ia supernovae are special is their uniformity . Basically , they all explode at about the same mass , so they are all roughly equally luminous . Better understanding the physics of that explosion and the effect of local galactic environment will make Type Ia supernovae even better " standard candles " and improve our understanding of the properties of dark energy and the cosmological evolution of the universe . The more data we can get , and the closer the supernova , the better the calibration .
