Toxic water that infected Flint schools and neighborhoods was the result of a money saving scheme supported by the governor ' s appointed emergency financial manager in Flint . The people of Flint were robbed of trust as their complaints about the water fell on deaf ears . The inaction of Governor Snyder in light of all the red flags is inexcusable . Snyder ' s dismissive behavior and his failure to make public the state ' s records and information about the handling of the issue has shattered the public ' s confidence in him . In the face of disaster , Snyder ' s response shows how out of touch he is with his constituents .
