So the cigarette manufacturers have a point when they say the government is overstepping by demanding nauseating images on their packages . Free speech does not only refer to our right to say anything we choose it also refers to our protection from having the government force us to say things against our will . Even convicted killers , when speaking in court before sentencing , are not required to say they are guilty . The government has a right to create , publish and broadcast the strongest anti smoking campaigns it can come up with , but the cigarette companies make a compelling case in saying that , as long as their product is legal , they should not be forced to print repellent images on their packages .
