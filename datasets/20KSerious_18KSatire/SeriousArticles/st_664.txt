The Federal Air Marshal Service officially began in 1968 as the Federal Aviation Administration ' s Sky Marshal Program , and in the 1970s , extortion type hijackings in the Middle East led to the deployment of some air marshals overseas . In 1985 , President Regan expanded the program , increasing the number of air marshals , in response to a series of domestic and international hijackings , including TWA Flight 847 , in which a U . S . Navy Diver was killed and his body dumped on the tarmac in Beirut , Lebanon .
