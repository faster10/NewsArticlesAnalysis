The speaker said Weinstein ' s fate lies with U . S . President Barack Obama . " I warn you of Obama ' s lies and deceit because he hopes that this man gets killed so he doesn ' t have to worry about his problem . Obama is a liar . He lies , lies and will lie . He may say to you , ' I sought the release of your relative but al Qaeda got stubborn , ' so do not believe him . And he may say to you , ' I tried to contact them , but they did not answer , ' so do not believe him . He may tell you , ' I do everything in my power to release your relative , ' but again do not believe him . "
