" Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted advisor . His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built . It will be the millions of people he inspired , the lives he changed , and the culture he defined . Steve was such an ' original , ' with a thoroughly creative , imaginative mind that defined an era . Despite all he accomplished , it feels like he was just getting started . With his passing the world has lost a rare original , Disney has lost a member of our family , and I have lost a great friend . Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time . "
