Greek politicians , particularly Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras , will probably respond to that message with a different one , which he will transmit back to Brussels , Paris , Berlin and Frankfurt ( home of the European Central Bank ) : Europe cannot afford to let Greece fail and therefore , in the name of solidarity , Europe must continue to do whatever it takes to support Greece . But this time it should not require Greece to take such painful measures . Oh , and Europe will need to give Greece additional funds ( in the name of " growth " ) no matter what combination of political parties enters parliament and forms a new government .
