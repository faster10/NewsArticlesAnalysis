It ' s the very opposite kind of movie to the one Affleck makes . There ' s nothing showy or spectacular about his filmmaking . He puts the emphasis squarely on story and situation . He may not probe his characters very deeply , but they ' re believable victims of dire circumstance . He also casts very well : Bryan Cranston as Mendez ' s CIA boss , Victor Garber as the Canadian ambassador , Christopher Denham as the most skeptical and reluctant of the hostages . They ' re all absolutely on point .
