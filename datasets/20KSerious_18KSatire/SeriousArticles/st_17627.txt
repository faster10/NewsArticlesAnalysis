Perhaps helping the chances that " Funk " can remain at No . 1 on the Hot 100 , at least for another week : while it ' s down by 11 percent in overall activity , the No . 2 song ( for a third week ) , Maroon 5 ' s " Sugar , " decreases by 3 percent , while Ed Sheeran ' s " Thinking Out Loud , " at No . 3 ( for a third week , after peaking at No . 2 for eight weeks ) , is off by 2 percent . And , the lead of " Funk " over those songs is still significant : they each boast approximately two thirds of the Hot 100 points of " Funk " this week .
