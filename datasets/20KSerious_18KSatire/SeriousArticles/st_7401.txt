Tonight s Golden Globes , hosted by Ricky Gervais , back after hosting from 2010 2012 , perfectly embodied this no one cares about the Golden Globes except we re all here caring about the Golden Globes spirit . For the last three years , the inherent ridiculousness of the Globes had been somewhat obscured by hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler , who by their very presence made the Globes seem like something worthwhile . But Gervais s whole shtick is to make cracks about the crass absurdity of the Globes , standing on stage with a glass of beer , appearing exhausted and aggrieved as the show goes on , even as he , like everyone else in attendance , is there of his own free will . When a room full of actors conspire to convey the impression that an awards show is the greatest party they don ' t want to attend , after three hours , you start to believe them .
