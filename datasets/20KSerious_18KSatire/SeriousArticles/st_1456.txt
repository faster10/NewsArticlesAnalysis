The Panthers , like most teams , typically reserve max protections for blitz looks . Having the NFL s fiercest four man front , the Broncos don t blitz often . But with Carolina s O line being average athletically , max protections might still be necessary against some of Denver s four man rushes . It will be interesting to see what happens on the backside of those full line slides . Say the O line slides right , toward Von Miller . That leaves Dickson and the running back doubling DeMarcus Ware on the left . Dickson and the backs are accustomed to blocking blitzing safeties and linebackers facing an eight time Pro Bowl defensive end is a much taller order , even if it is a two on one battle .
