Kotkin : The U . S . has relatively younger demographics , which gives it a competitive advantage . This nation attracts people from all over the world , and that ' s what gives it global advantage we have the potential to be energy sufficient . We are the only advanced country with a growing population , agricultural surplus , lots of raw materials , significant domestic energy . The nation is entrepreneurial in culture and has a reasonably stable political system . That doesn ' t mean that the U . S . will be a hegemonic global power , but I believe the economic condition , due to these factors , will definitely improve in the future and the census will reflect that .
