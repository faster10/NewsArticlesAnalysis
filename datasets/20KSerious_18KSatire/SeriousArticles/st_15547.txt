This is a message to all liberal and progressive people to keep quiet , and scare and intimidate them . " She says Giffords ' shooting was an isolated incident , which has no chance of gaining popular support in the United States . " The impact is different . And the fear among the people . I ' m sure in Arizona the general public is not feeling threatened , or not fearing that they can voice their views or openly condemn it . We are in a totally different situation . People who support us can lose their own lives . "
