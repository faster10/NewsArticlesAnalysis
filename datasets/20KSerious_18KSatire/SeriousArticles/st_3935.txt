We lived peacefully in Ramallah , a West Bank city just north of Jerusalem , when we moved there in 1997 . My father built a home in Area C , an Israeli controlled region of the West Bank . During the first two years , the Israeli Palestinian conflict was at a quiet period . Our lives were pretty normal . My older brother and I attended a private school operated by the American education system , and my two older sisters went to a French all girls Catholic school . In our free time , our days consisted of shopping in Ramallah , taking cabs to Jerusalem and hiking mountains .
