With his bold , and many would say graceful , public offer to the Lib Dems Cameron has accepted political reality and at the same time taken a huge gamble . If he fails to bring off a deal then it will be seen as a compounding failure by his critics . But he will be in internal trouble too if , in order to clinch the deal , he concedes more than his party hardliners would like . Many Tories are viscerally opposed , for example , to voting reforms , especially proportional representation , because they fear that it would ensure that future British governments are nearly always " progressive " coalitions between Labour and the Liberal Democrats .
