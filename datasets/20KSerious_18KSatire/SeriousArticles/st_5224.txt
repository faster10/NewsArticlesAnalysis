TRUMP AND CLINTON MAINTAIN NATIONAL LEADS New national polls continue to show Trump as the clear frontrunner on the Republican side . Ted Cruz is rising , but remains nearly 20 percentage points behind in the HuffPost Pollster national average . Sen . Marco Rubio ( R Fla . ) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson seem to be declining . On the Democratic side , Clinton has a 14 point lead over Sanders , but the gap is narrowing slightly . Keep in mind , though , there is not a national primary election , so national polls should be thought of as an indicator of the national mood not as what is likely to happen electorally .
