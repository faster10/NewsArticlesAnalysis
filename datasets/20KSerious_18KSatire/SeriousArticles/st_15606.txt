I think the other thing that really strikes me as the election season begins is that the older party leadership ? I m skeptical of the word establishment ? the older party leadership is desperate to stop Trump and Cruz , but when they look around , the votes to stop them aren t in the Republican party anymore . Because by pursuing this turn to the right ? a lot of it rhetorical , some of it real ? they have driven out all of the moderate voters . People who were good moderate Republicans , or even moderate conservatives , who voted for George H . W . Bush back in 88 , they don t vote in Republican primaries anymore . They started shifting to being independents or even Democrats during the Clinton years , and that s continued . When they need voters to save them , the voters are gone . I think that s a central dynamic of what s happening in these primaries right now .
