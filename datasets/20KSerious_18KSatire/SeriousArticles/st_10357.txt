When I got on the bus this morning , everyone was wearing masks . We passed by lines after lines of tall trees shrouded in a think blanket of dusty smog . It looked rather like the aftermath of an earthquake . On quite a few of trees I saw nests , but there was not a single bird to be seen . Just how many birds are dying in this environment ? I had to wonder . These days , I find myself wishing for strong winds in the capital , and yes , even if it means bitter cold weather and severe wind chill factor because that ' s the only hope we dwellers in this city have for a chance of seeing some clear skies . ( Here ' s a map that shows the wind patterns that are bringing the pollution to Beijing , from Greenpeace analysis using the U . S . NOAA Hysplit model . This map was originally included in a Washington Post article about the red alert . )
