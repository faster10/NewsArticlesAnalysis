There are dozens of NFL coaches who have gone through these stretches and bounced back , but Kelly is distinct because of his college ( genius ) background . The idea that Kelly isn ' t cut out for the NFL as a coach and needs to return to college is also silly . It ' s a narrative built around Kelly ' s uniqueness in terms of tempo and play design , schematic advances that were already being copied around the NFL by teams such as the Patriots and Washington before Kelly even left Oregon . If Kelly ' s system hadn ' t worked in the way that somebody like Steve Spurrier or Bobby Petrino washed out in the NFL , he wouldn ' t have had two years of success with middling quarterbacks before struggling this year .
