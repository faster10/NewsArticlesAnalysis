This may seem like splitting hairs , but it ' s a distinction worth making . Bernie may point out that he supports a 15 minimum wage while Clinton only has committed to 12 an hour . But he won ' t call her a secret conservative , or call her out of touch with reality or anything . Sanders , in the first debate , had to introduce himself to millions of people who had never heard him speak and hadn ' t looked at what he stood for . He won ' t have to do as much " reintroducing himself " this time around , which means he ' ll probably focus more on the specific differences between his platform and Clinton ' s .
