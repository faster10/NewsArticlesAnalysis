About an hour southwest of the Castle Hill Resort and Spa is another mansion hotel , the Wilburton Inn . Sitting atop a hill on a plot of land rumored to have been won in a high stakes poker game , the building was completed in 1902 , as the country estate of Chicago industrialist and railroad manufacturer Albert M . Gilbert . Several owners and reincarnations later , the property now serves as a quaint and cozy retreat for travelers visiting this popular summer vacation destination . Current proprietor Melissa Levis claims it ' s so magical here , they give guests magic wands when they check in .
