We dedicated the trip to our 11 year old American Staffordshire Terrier , Dyuki ( Mr Dukes ) . He was in his final stages of Grade III mast cell cancer at the time . His most favorite activity was swimming in our family pool , but until then , he had never seen the ocean . It was a very special trip for us , and I ' m so grateful we were able to make it happen . He passed away a month later , but he put up one hell of a fight almost two years . '
