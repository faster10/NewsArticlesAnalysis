Martin : I really enjoyed it . I had been an editor before I became a full time writer , so this was like putting my editorial hat back on . I am a huge outliner . I outline everything . The authors that my editors , and I chose to write the other books in the series were people who either I had worked with or the editors had worked with before and we felt that they could continue the voice of the characters . We kept the number of other writers very small to try to maintain this consistent voice for the series , and each of the authors had read all of the books in the series up to the point from which they would be writing so they would have the background . I trusted the writers we had chosen , and I felt that we worked really well together . I almost didn ' t have a choice , because there is no way I could have written all those books myself ! I felt that this was the best of both worlds because I couldn ' t do it myself , but this was the schedule that Scholastic wanted , so it became what I thought was a very nice group effort .
