Marcus Stanley of Americans for Financial Reform : " Your ' little birdie ' yesterday got it wrong . Big commercial banks like Citibank and JP Morgan provided all kinds of support to shadow banking after the repeal of Glass Steagall . They had massive exposures to ' toxic assets ' and to failing investment banks through the securitization , repo , and derivatives markets , not through conventional lending . Preserving the original Glass Steagall would have prevented a fair number of those exposures , and the modernized 21st Century Glass Steagall Act that Sanders has endorsed would ban almost all of them .
