That afternoon , both campaigns held large rallies at sites around downtown . ( Martin O Malley also held a rally , where little more than a hundred people heard a brief speech and listened as he played the guitar . ) An estimated 4 , 000 people gathered outside of the Hy Vee Hall ? where Iowa Democrats held the actual dinner that evening ? to see Katy Perry perform for the Clinton campaign . Opening , of course , was Bill Clinton , who made an impassioned pitch for Hillary as the president America needs to protect and defend progressive gains from the Republican Party . Stop rewarding the strategy of destruction , he said , urging the crowd to oppose GOP antics in Congress . President Clinton wasn t just an advocate he also showcased his much heralded political skills to deal with an animal rights protester . We got it . Will you please quit now ? he said to the man , who was moved offstage . Clinton turned then to the crowd and praised the heckler , making him a contrast to the Republican Party . At least that guy is for something . He didn t come here to bad mouth anybody .
