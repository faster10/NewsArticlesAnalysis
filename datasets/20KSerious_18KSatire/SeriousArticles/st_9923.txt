For more than 20 years Susie Walton has conducted parenting seminars across San Diego County , teaching anxious young mothers and fathers how to raise children in what she calls a democratic household . " Everybody works in cooperation , " Susie explains . " Everybody shares mutual respect . There are leaders , but the leaders don ' t use the heavy hand , as they would in an autocratic society . Kids take on greater responsibility , not because they ' ll get in trouble if they don ' t , but because they are given greater freedom . And isn ' t that the whole point , preparing them to take on responsibility when you ' re not there ? "
