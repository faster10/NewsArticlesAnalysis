You would have to send 200 bottles a day , per person , to cover what the average American ( we are Americans in Flint ) needs each day . That ' s 102 , 000 citizens times 200 bottles of water which equals 20 . 4 million 16oz . bottles of water per day , every day , for the next year or two until this problem is fixed ( oh , and we ' ll need to find a landfill in Flint big enough for all those hundreds of millions of plastic water bottles , thus degrading the local environment even further ) . Anybody want to pony up for that ? Because THAT is the reality .
