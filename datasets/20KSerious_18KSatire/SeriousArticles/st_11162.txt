It was Bowie s next work , Hunky Dory , that kicked off his classic run . On one level , that 1971 album seemed to boldface the star s influences , with one track titled Song for Bob Dylan and another Andy Warhol . A third cut , Queen Bitch , nodded to the decadent rock flash of the Velvet Underground . At the same time , Bowie transformed those references into a sound very much his own , marked by high drama vocals and a deep melodic command . Life on Mars ? had such a theatrical flair , it later provided a suitable cover for Barbra Streisand . Bowie advertised his ability to move swiftly between all these styles with the album s opening proclamation , Changes , a song that doubled as a mantra .
