I ' ve screened the film at the U . S . Department of Energy , to the general assembly of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , at nuclear engineering departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford University and Texas A M , to name just a few of the tech savvy viewers who ' ve scrutinized it . This film has received nothing but support from the technical and scientific community regarding the facts presented . So if Lyman has criticisms and sees flaws , his views are not representative of those who know the most about this technology .
