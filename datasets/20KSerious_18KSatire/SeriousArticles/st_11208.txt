Zakaria : The Chinese have been pretty helpful on managing the situation , making sure that it doesn ' t spiral out of control , but we haven ' t been able to get to the next level with the Chinese , which is to say that the Chinese sustain this regime . The Chinese provide about 90 percent of their energy and about 40 percent of their food aid . It ' s pretty reasonable to say that without Chinese support their regime would collapse , but the Chinese have legitimate concerns about what the future of the Korean Peninsula would look like if there were a North Korean implosion .
