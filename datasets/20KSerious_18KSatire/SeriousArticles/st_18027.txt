Room to work : The Panthers led the league in the regular season in interceptions ( 24 ) and turnover margin ( plus 24 ) . But when they faced the more accomplished passers on their schedule , those quarterbacks were able to move the ball against the defense . Aaron Rodgers threw for 369 and four touchdowns , Drew Brees threw for 282 and three touchdowns , Eli Manning threw for four touchdowns and Matt Ryan threw for 306 yards in Week 16 . That ' s to go with Russell Wilson ' s 366 yards and three touchdowns ( the Panthers did intercept him twice ) in the NFC divisional round . Though Peyton Manning was leading the league in interceptions at the time when he was benched against the Kansas City Chiefs , he has been far more judicious with the ball in his return after seven missed starts . He has shown a little better arm strength since the foot injury has begun to heal . And the Broncos have the kind of catch and run receivers in Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders to create big plays out of play action . As much as the Broncos like a two tight end set when they want to protect Manning , they probably will spread the Panthers ' defense out with a three wide look to see if they can find some of the same kind of room the other quarterbacks did .
