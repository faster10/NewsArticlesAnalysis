These Seattle Seahawks rumors are a big deal , as a healthy Marshawn Lynch could have a lot of success against the Carolina Panthers . During the divisional round of the 2014 NFL Playoffs , he had 59 yards on 14 carries , averaging just over 4 . 2 yards per carry . In a 2014 regular season victory , he had 62 yards on 14 carries to average about 4 . 4 yards per carry . It may become very important for him to average that or better on Sunday , as the Seahawks will have to mix up the offensive plays to present the Panthers with a new look .
