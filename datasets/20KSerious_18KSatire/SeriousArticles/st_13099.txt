The problem for the Patriots is less about Edelman and more about how they ' re becoming increasingly dependent on the few weapons they have left .

They still have Rob Gronkowski , but we ' re still not too far removed from the days when Patriots fans closed their eyes and prayed that Gronk was going to get up every time he was tackled .
