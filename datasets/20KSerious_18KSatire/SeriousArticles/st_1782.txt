Clark : I share traits in common with all the characters . I don ' t know if there ' s a way to avoid putting yourself into each and every character , the bad guys as well as the good ones . I ' d like to try because I certainly don ' t want the book to be about me , but it is about a female prosecutor so there ' s going to be things in common . I was only conscious of giving her my bad traits . I think of Rachel as being so much better than me , with the exception of the places where she ' s like me and then she ' s not so good .
