Green , the former second round pick and All NBA Defender , enables the Warriors to play positionless basketball . He can check all five spots on the floor , and his effectiveness as a point forward provides the necessary flexibility for head coach Steve Kerr ( or interim coach Luke Walton ) to rest Curry and Thompson when need be or simply play Curry off the ball , which essentially amounts to a rest period anyway . The same can be said about swingman Andre Iguodala , the Finals ' MVP , who often flanks Green in the frontcourt . And then there ' s Barnes , who is the ultimate small ball four man at 6 feet 8 inches : strong enough to defend bigs on the block , but agile enough to create perimeter mismatches on the other end .
