When you watch a lot of the Belgian players and a lot of them are pretty small ? they have beautiful hands , they play lots of different shots , and they ve got variety , Murray said . That takes a little bit longer to develop . Maybe they don t put as much emphasis on the results at such a young age . I do think that that does happen in our country a bit : that it s like you need people winning when they re 16 , 17 , 18 years old and when they don t , it s like Oh God , they re garbage . I do feel this happened to me a bit . There was so much pressure on me that I ended up focusing on the win and not on how I was trying to play .
