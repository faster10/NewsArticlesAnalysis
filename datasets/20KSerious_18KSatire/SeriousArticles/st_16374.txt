On Friday morning , the Cleveland Plain Dealer s Peter Krouse published a masterfully trolling or insanely stupid column titled Trade LeBron James , arguing the Cavaliers should get rid of the NBA s best player of the past decade because he had difficulty taking orders from a successful but totally replaceable coach . A few hours later , the Cavs fired David Blatt . NBA watchers quickly pointed the finger at coach killer LeBron . Why else would Blatt ? who had brought his team within two wins of a title last season and had guided the Cavs to the best record in the Eastern Conference this season ? get the axe ?
