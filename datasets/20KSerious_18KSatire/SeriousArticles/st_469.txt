In 1979 , the Ayatollah Khomeini installed an anti Western Islamic theocracy , which replaced the pro Western monarchy of the Shah of Iran . The U . S . was referred to as " the Great Satan " by the new Iranian government , and Iranians looked at the United States with suspicion because of its role in keeping the Shah in power . Iranians felt the United States meddled too much in Iran ' s internal affairs , and were afraid the CIA was plotting to return the Shah to power . The Ayatollah himself blessed the hostage taking at the embassy , further fueling the government ' s hard line against the United States .
