GOP party leaders , in the event of a Trump or Cruz break away in the caucuses and primaries , can do one of three things . They can continue try to rally support behind a Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio , the party establishment ' s preferred respectable choices . They can pretend to remain neutral , which just gives Cruz and Trump even more room to roam . They can jump on the bandwagon of either one of them . If either one is the eventual party nominee , GOP party leaders , donors and bundlers , and the national and state committees will have no choice but to go full throttle in support of the nominee . Anything less would insure a runaway win for Hillary Clinton , the possible loss of the Senate to the Democrats , put at risk the loss of some GOP controlled statehouses to the Democrats , and worse , split the GOP . A Trump or Cruz presidential nomination snub would risk incurring the anger of millions of GOP grassroots voters . That ' s a catastrophe that GOP leaders will do all to ensure doesn ' t happen , even if it means holding their nose and backing a Trump or Cruz .
