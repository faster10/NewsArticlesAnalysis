We have a motto on this team that iron sharpens iron and another man sharpens another , Ware said after the game . I said , We melted down that metal . I said , The only way you re going to make metal hard , is if you beat it down . I said , We beat it to this thing , and I opened up and I pulled out the first Super Bowl trophy that the Broncos won . I sat it on the table , and I just got really quiet . I saw in all the guys eyes how they felt , what they felt , because I felt the same way . . . . I said , The Patriots are coming into our house trying to take what we built .
