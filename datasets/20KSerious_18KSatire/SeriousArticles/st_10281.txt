Manning has been exceptional at making the right audible call and getting Denver into the perfect run play against certain looks , but I cannot imagine Bill Belichick is going to let Ronnie Hillman or C . J . Anderson beat him Sunday ( and they ' ll have to duplicate their fourth quarter surge again this week , if not much sooner , against this defense ) . And if Manning is routinely taking 30 seconds or more to snap the ball , that should help a Patriots defense battling the altitude catch its breath between plays .
