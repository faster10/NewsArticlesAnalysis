Yes . We actually use it in dentistry . When we take out teeth today , we can get a dry socket . For instance , when removing a wisdom tooth , the blood clot may wash away , which leads to an exposed bone . That ' s a dry socket , and it ' s incredibly painful . A lot of the dry socket dressings from a major dental supply company like Henry Schein contains oil of cloves . It is a paste we actually put into the tooth socket to sooth the bone and allow it to heal . Oil of cloves is excellent for something like that . Another good anesthetic is whisky . When kids are teething , instead of doing Anbesol , a lot of doctors recommend taking some whisky to rub on their gums . But definitely not the good stuff .
