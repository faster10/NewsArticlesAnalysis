Finally , courage matters . Walker is not eager to grab hold of thorny issues . On immigration , he likes sound bites , declaring his opposition to " amnesty " and his support for " securing the border . " He uses platitudes about how ours is " a country both of immigrants and of laws . " During a recent appearance on ABC ' s " This Week with George Stephanopoulos , " host Martha Raddatz asked Walker what he would do about the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . The governor responded that , while he didn ' t support the immigration bills in Congress , he did think the debate needs a " healthy balance " and he was not " advocating " the deportation of all illegal immigrants . Finally , he said , " we need to enforce the laws in the United States , and we need to find a way for people to have a legitimate legal immigration system in this country , and that does not mean amnesty . " Clear as mud , eh ?
