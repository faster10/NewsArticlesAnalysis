I ask this because this is how I would have typically expected a news organization to handle this situation . A crew enters the apartment , they shoot footage , the reporter explores the scene , asks questions , directs the camera to points of interest , offers on the scene explanations , all very patiently and professionally , and then they step outside and edit everything into a cogent package , focusing only on what ' s important and omitting that which isn ' t , perhaps under the supervision of another adult whose job is to " produce " this package .
