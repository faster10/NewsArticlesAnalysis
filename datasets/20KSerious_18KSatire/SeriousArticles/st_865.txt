I looked deeper into the performance of the Giants defense this season using advanced stats from the trusted experts at Pro Football Focus . For the uninitiated , PFF analyzes and scores how well players execute their assignment regardless of outcome of the play ? in other words , whether they do their job ? then converts their totals to a grade on a 0 100 scale . This allows you to evaluate a player s performance independent of how his teammates may influence his numbers ? for instance , a QB gets a good grade for making a perfect throw that the receiver drops , which otherwise goes in the books as an incompletion .
