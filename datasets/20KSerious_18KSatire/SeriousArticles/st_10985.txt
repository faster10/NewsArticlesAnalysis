Williams : ' Best advice : have someone break his nose , so it heads off on a weird angle ( KIDDING . . . DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME . ATTEMPT AT SELF EFFACING HUMOR DUE TO BROKEN NOSE IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ) but seriously . . . if I ' d known I was gonna work in television I wouldn ' t have settled for having my nose put back into place . . . after being broken by the bridge of my helmet . . . with two popsickle sticks on the sidelines . Other than that : tell him to rock a good tie and walk around saying we ' ll look for you right back here tomorrow night . '
