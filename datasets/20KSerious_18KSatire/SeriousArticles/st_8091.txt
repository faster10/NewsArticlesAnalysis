First , bystanders shouldn ' t support bullies with attention , laughter or anything that could make them proud of what they ' ve done . Bullies aren ' t usually bullying out of anger they ' re trying to get something they want , like approval or social status . And in general , they need witnesses for that . So bystanders who see bullying should respond in such a way that the bully feels isolated afterward not more powerful or popular , not encouraged . Taking away the reward for the behavior can take away the inspiration for it .
