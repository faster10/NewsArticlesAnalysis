So the Occupy movement may be finding its next phase in helping struggling Americans across the United States keep their homes out of foreclosure or occupy vacant homes that have been foreclosed . Eviction defenses and occupations are planned in more than 20 cities . And the idea is catching on beyond organized protests . In Atlanta this week , police and movers refused to evict a 103 year old woman from her home when the bank foreclosed on it . Of course , if you think foreclosing on a 103 year old woman ( and her 83 year old daughter ) is heartless , ask yourself at what age is it ever acceptable to kick struggling families out of their homes in a bad economy , only to leave the houses vacant and decaying ?
