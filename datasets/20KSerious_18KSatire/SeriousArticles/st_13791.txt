It ' s that sense of community that made me feel blessed when I learned this week that Richard Dawson passed away . As soon as I heard the news , I went online to a game show message board I frequent . There , I read stories from friends and colleagues about how much they enjoyed Dawson ' s work as an actor and emcee . Through the forum , I found a YouTube clip of a short lived 1970s game show called " Masquerade Party , " which Dawson hosted a few years before " Family Feud . " And I learned that Dawson may not have been the first choice to host " Feud " Geoff Edwards , Jack Narz and William Shatner were all supposedly under consideration .
