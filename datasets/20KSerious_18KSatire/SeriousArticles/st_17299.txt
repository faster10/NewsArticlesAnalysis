In the third quarter , defensive end Chandler Jones forced a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Dont a Hightower . New England didn t do a lot of blitzing , but enough pressure was put on Smith to force him into a completion percentage of only 58 percent . Jones did make New England s only sack . Smith s biggest plays were with his feet , particularly on a scramble where he avoided a seemingly inevitable sack to complete a pass and convert a third down . That kept alive Kansas City s first touchdown drive of the game .
