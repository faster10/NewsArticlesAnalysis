Jackson : I ' ve been trying to get a hold of my mom . I talked to Jackie . I talked to Tito . They feel the same way . A piece of our heart a piece of us went with him . It was a shock to them , too . I talked to my brother Jackie and he said , " Marlon , is it true ? " I said , " I ' m calling them right now to see if it ' s true . " That ' s when I called Frank Dileo and I couldn ' t get to my mom . I talked to him the first time and he was at the house and my mom was in the background crying , and she was just upset .
