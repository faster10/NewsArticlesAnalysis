Vanessa : I think one of my mother daughter memories was at the first state dinner that I attended , when President Reagan invited me to the White House that October as Miss America , and my mother said , " Whatever you do , get the president to sign the menu ! " I ended up sitting at his table and trying to think , how am I going to get through this dinner with the president and get him to sign my menu ? I listened to him talk about his life in Hollywood and towards the end , I said " Can you please sign this menu for my mother ? She will kill me otherwise . " And he very politely did it , and she still has it . The things that you do for your mother !
