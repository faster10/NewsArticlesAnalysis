Pete Fiutak , College Football News : " Clay Helton might turn out to be special . He might be the next Urban , the next Saban , the next Carroll , but that s a guess . Athletic director Pat Haden claimed he took the ' inexact science ' part of the hire out of the equation because Helton is a ' man of integrity , ' but screw that . You know who s the ultimate man of integrity in college coaching ? Mark Richt , and he got his butt tossed to the curb . You take integrity . I ll take a team full of Reggie Bushes who give me a dynasty that some phony baloney NCAA type tries to take away with a keystroke . Hopefully this really does work out for Helton , who really does have the good guy , no drama thing happening that s a must at the moment after the Kiffin and Sark misfires ? although I ll argue that neither one should ve been fired , but that s for another day . But there s more pressure on this hire than there d be with just about any other coaching option , mainly because of what Haden is passing up . "
