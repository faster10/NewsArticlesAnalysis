The high rates of cell phone only homes were not that surprising , said Blumberg . What was surprising , he noted , was the wide variation from state to state .

In other areas , it ' s a different story in Nebraska the rate is 23 . 2 percent , and in Arkansas it ' s 22 . 6 percent . Check your state ' s percentage of wireless phone only homes .
