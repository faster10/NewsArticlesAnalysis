The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso ' s Parisian life . He arrived here , aged 19 , in 1900 , for the World ' s Fair , where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show . You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais , built for the event . Picasso first settled in Montmartre as seedy and provocative now as it was then . His studio in the Bateau Lavoir ( ' Laundry Boat ' ) was destroyed by fire in 1970 , but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau . It doesn ' t look much and it was squalid in Picasso ' s day , which suited him in his scruffy overalls .
