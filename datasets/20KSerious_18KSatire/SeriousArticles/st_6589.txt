Who could you count out in the ancient world . . . women , children , lepers , unclean , adulterers , tax collectors , prostitutes ?

That ' s because perfection for Jesus was not the elimination of the negative , but the inclusion and redemption of all things . Anybody you could count out , Jesus will find a way to count them in .
