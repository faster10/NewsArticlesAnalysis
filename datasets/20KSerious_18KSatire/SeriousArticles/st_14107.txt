Deshaun Watson has played brilliantly all season , but if he has one weakness , it s his tendency to try to make the big play when the better choice is probably to just throw the ball away . We saw this toward the end of the first half against Oklahoma when Watson tossed one up into the end zone for an interception , costing his team a probable three points before halftime . He cannot make the same mistake against a team like Alabama that has forced 26 turnovers on the season and also leads the nation in sacks ( 50 ) .
