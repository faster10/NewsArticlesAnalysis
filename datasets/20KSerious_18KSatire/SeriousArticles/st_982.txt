Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and Sen . Bernie Sanders ( D Vt . ) clashed Sunday over key issues like gun control and Wall Street in the last presidential debate before the Feb . 1 Iowa caucuses . Sanders accused Clinton of being too close to Wall Street , a major source of her campaign contributions . Clinton tried to puncture the grassroots appeal that has helped Sanders surge in the polls , saying he had voted " with the NRA " several times against gun control . The third candidate , low polling former Maryland governor Martin O ' Malley , said both his rivals had been " inconsistent " on gun control while he signed sweeping gun laws .
