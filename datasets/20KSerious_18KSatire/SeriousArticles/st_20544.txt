I was invited to debate Gloria Steinem on The Phil Donahue Show ? yes , I am that old ? and I was shocked by the ease it took to tee the ball up for her to hit into an angry crowd . She was saying that all women should support the Walter Mondale Gerladine Ferraro presidential ticket and I asked her if she would be so compelled to support a ticket with Phyllis Schlafly on it . I then proceeded to ask her why she , and all feminists , vilify any woman who disagrees with them when they claim they are about free choice , equality , women s rights , freedom , blah blah blah .
