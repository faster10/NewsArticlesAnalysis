There s a lot of stick play that goes in , and one of the brilliances of John Carroll Lynch is that by the time we shot episode 4 ? ? because we shot it out of sequence ? ? I ve had the bow staff in my hand for a couple of months . So for a few months I ve been with rehearsals and practice and training that I did before I got to Atlanta . It was close to if not three months I ve been swinging the stick , and John had to come in , and he was playing Eastman who s my mentor and the guy who taught me to use the stick , so he had to come in at a higher level than I was at , and that just meant practicing during every waking moment that he had when he wasn t learning all of the lines that he had to learn . Because the other thing in it is that Morgan is silent in episode 4 for large parts and John is doing all the taking , so he had to take that on board as well .
