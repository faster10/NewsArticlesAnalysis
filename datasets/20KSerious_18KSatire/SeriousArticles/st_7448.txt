Is Hollywood finally ready to forgive him ? Again , watch the crowd shots as he takes the stage as a presenter on Sunday . Mr Gibson , who became an industry pariah in 2006 following a drunken driving arrest and anti Semitic outburst , has a new film on the way ? ? his first in a decade as a director ? ? perhaps explaining his Globes invite . A rather forgiving lot , Globe organizers also had him on in 2010 the host that year ( Ricky Gervais , returning as host on Sunday ) made fun of him then .
