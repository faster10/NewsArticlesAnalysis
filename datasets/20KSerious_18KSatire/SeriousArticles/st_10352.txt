So mom , listen when your daughter is struggling with math and only wants to create art projects . She may be revealing her talents . Listen when you have adamantly declared no way is she doing that ( whatever that may be ) , when you find out you misinterpreted her intent or the circumstances she was entering . Listen when she wants to bend her curfew rules because she has a world premier movie to see after she gets off work , but to safely deposit her friends to their homes will make her late . She does have a job , mom it ' s a good time to be persuaded .
