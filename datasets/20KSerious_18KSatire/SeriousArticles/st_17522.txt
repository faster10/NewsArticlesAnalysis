As Germany s Chancellor , Angela Merkel , has discovered , pushing through liberal immigration policy without winning public support can have disastrous consequences . Last August , Germany unilaterally suspended the Dublin accord , the EU rule that migrants have to apply for asylum in the EU member state they enter . Merkel made little effort , however , to convince the German people of the worth of her new policy . There was an intense backlash and within a fortnight Germany had reversed its stance and reintroduced border controls . The consequence was greater hostility both towards migrants and Merkel herself .
