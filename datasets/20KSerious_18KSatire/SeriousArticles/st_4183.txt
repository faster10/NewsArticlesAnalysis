A better politics doesn t mean we have to agree on everything . But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens . It doesn t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice , or that our political opponents are unpatriotic . Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested , and we listen only to those who agree with us . Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention . Most of all , democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn t matter that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest .
