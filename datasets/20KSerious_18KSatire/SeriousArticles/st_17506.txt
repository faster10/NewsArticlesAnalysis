And third , let s face it , a comprehensive dialogue , while it puts things back on track , has pretty much run its course . I am talking about the way it is structured . To keep it to the level of officials . For instance , water sharing is a very difficult political issue . Can Secretaries Water Resources really push anything through ? It hasn t happened in the past , I don t see it happening in the future . Officials by definition have a very limited mandate . so perhaps there is a case for rethinking the structure of the composite dialogue .
