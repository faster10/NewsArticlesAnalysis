However there is a second species we are concerned about . It ' s the one called Aedes ? albopictus , which is the Asian tiger mosquito . It is also an invasive species , also found in the southern States , and it ' s moving its way northwards . In fact , this is one of the mosquitoes that ' s being transported all over the world and becoming an invasive species everywhere it ' s going , and it can ? tolerate cooler temperatures . So the concern is that it may in the future be able to establish in Canada .
