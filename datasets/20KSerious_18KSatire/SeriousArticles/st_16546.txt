Scottish Rugby has marketed this game in the usual way they always market the game and , as a result , they will get the usual crowd . This was a great opportunity to try something different as everyone is looking for something to do by the 2nd January . I would love to have seen an attempt made to fill Murrayfield and try and attract the latent support for rugby that exists in Edinburgh . Remember , 38 , 000 fans came to Murrayfield to see Edinburgh play Toulouse in the Heineken Cup a few years ago so the support is there , it just needs to be attracted in . Make the tickets 10 for adults and kids free , bombard social media and other advertising mediums with a campaign to ' Fill Murrayfield , and get people talking about the game .
