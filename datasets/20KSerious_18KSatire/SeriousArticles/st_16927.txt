It s no less important for Trump , who has to show he can do more than hold rallies . Iowa could make him one of those losers he trashes . He seems mindful of the possibility lately . In Council Bluffs , Iowa , where he flew right after New Hampshire , he took a stab at ( feigned ) humility , suggesting that I could be setting myself up by bragging about his unbelievable standing . Could Trump be lowering expectations ? He s also started pleading with his audiences to do more than show up at rallies and counteract the prediction that they won t show up at the polls . There is a school of thought that holds that the crowds turn out to see Trump the celebrity , but they might not be as eager to trudge to a dreary voting site .
