On other occasions , you find yourself questioning the sanity of those who said no . You could see why Adele might have rejected a sure fire , nailed on hit such as Alive if she wanted to move away from heartbroken piano balladry , but given what ended up on 25 , the decision seems completely baffling . Even if she had done , it s difficult to see how she could have sold it better than Furler , who sings Alive in a cracked , rasping , vulnerable voice to considerable effect . It s the one moment here where she seems to transcend the role playing inherent in the album s title , really connecting with the song she has written in the same way she did on Chandelier ? a song about alcoholism that fairly obviously adhered to both the victim to victory and high concept rules , but spiked them with autobiographical intensity . Elsewhere , the listener has to settle for being fascinated by the way Furler can think herself into the head of the artist the song was intended for . You end up only half listening to what Furler is doing : the rest of your attention is occupied by imagining how Rihanna might have tackled Cheap Thrills , or what Beyonc could have done with the Sisquo sampling Sweet Design . On one level , that s clearly the point ? you don t sell songs to superstars if you ve imposed your own personality on them so thoroughly that they can t imprint theirs ? but it makes for a slightly unsatisfying album .
