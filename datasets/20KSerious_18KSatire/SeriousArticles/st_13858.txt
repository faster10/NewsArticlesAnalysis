Yu : The title comes from the last story in the book . It was originally a piece that I actually wrote onto a cocktail napkin , as part of Esquire ' s Napkin Fiction Project , and which I expanded for the collection . A lot of the stories in the book are about different universes , some big , some small , some of which already exist today , and some of which are not hard to imagine in the near future . These are artificial environments created or enabled through technology , and I was interested in how people communicate , in these environments , about how people talk to each other , about what limitations there are in language as a medium to express our desires , how technology might remove some of those limitations , but create new ones we ' ve never had before . " Sorry Please Thank You " seemed appropriate as a title , being words for concepts that , if not universal , are found in a great many languages and cultures .
