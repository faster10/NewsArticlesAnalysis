The Seahawks locker room was a little of those Pirates , a little of those DePaul Blue Demons and a lot of something else : Pure anger .

In between , I saw Seahawks players ignore protocol in these situations . Instead of saying the Earth is flat and their offensive brain trust knew what it was doing near the end , they ripped that nonrunning play like the rest of us .
