' I came in one Monday morning at Fulham after we ' d lost 3 0 and I was stretching and laughing with Danny Murphy , Paul Konchesky and a couple of others . Roy Hodgson ' s come in and gone , " Stop laughing , we lost on Saturday " . Then his next team talk on Thursday is , " C ' mon , let ' s look forward to the next game " . Well , I can ' t really , Roy , because you ' ve just murdered me on Monday for laughing . A lot of managers do that . They say something and don ' t really mean it . On Thursday it ' s all right to have a laugh , is it ? Monday too fresh ? So , when ' s the rule come in ? When can I laugh ? Tuesday night ? Let me know . Breakfast time Wednesday ? Is it longer depending on the score ? I don ' t understand it . '
