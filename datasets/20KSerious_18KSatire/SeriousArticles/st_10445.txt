NBC s decision to feature Trump as host of SNL also shows the extent to which Latino unity grows and persists . The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda , a nonpartisan association of major Hispanic national organizations and distinguished Hispanic leaders from all over the nation , sent a letter to the television network stating : We are appalled that you would enable Trump s hateful speech for nothing less than a ratings ploy and ask that you rescind the SNL invitation . Groups including the National Council of La Raza , MoveOn . org and America s Voice also have campaigns targeting NBC , and most recently the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have officially come out in opposition to Trump hosting the show .
