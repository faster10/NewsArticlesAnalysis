Despite being listed as questionable to play all week , running back Marshawn Lynch declared himself in for Sunday s NFC divisional round game . He ran six times for 20 yards in what could be his final game with Seattle . The ? Seahawks ? allowed Lynch to rehab when , where and with whom he wanted after he had midseason surgery . Lynch has missed large chunks of time over the last few years and considered retiring last offseason . He will turn 30 in April and has two years left on his deal . Whatever the team and Lynch decide to do , the ? Seahawks have comfort in knowing they found a big time talent in undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls , who will have to come back from a fractured ankle suffered in December .
