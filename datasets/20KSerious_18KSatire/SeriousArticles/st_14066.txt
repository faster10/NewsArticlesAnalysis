This is confusing , because there is so much great work to celebrate by diverse filmmakers , actors , screenwriters and cinematographers . Yet not one woman director or black actor received a nomination this year . And don t say there wasn t quality work or the audience wasn t interested : the largest grossing film of the year , Star Wars : The Force Awakens , starred a woman and two men of color and ignited a whole new generation of movie fandom . Many acknowledged the amazing performances of Will Smith , Michael B . Jordan and Idris Elba ? yet it seemed few women of color were even considered . Film stands to reap huge benefits , never mind be on the right side of history : increased diversity in television has brought in increased viewership and new frontiers in artistic achievement .
