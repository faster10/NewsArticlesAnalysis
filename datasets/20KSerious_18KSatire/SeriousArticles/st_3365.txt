" And so , on the following Saturday ( February 14 ) , the Jews were conducted to the cemetery to be burnt in a specifically prepared house . And 200 of them were completely stripped of their clothes by the mob , who found a lot of money in them .

All the rest were burnt , and many were killed as they leaped out of the fire . "
