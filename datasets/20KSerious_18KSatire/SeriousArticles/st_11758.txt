For the next five hours and 14 minutes , everyone who ever cared about tennis was treated to , arguably , one of the greatest tennis matches ever played . It was as if Nadal was playing against a mirror ? ? a Spaniard southpaw , heavy on topspin and quick on his feet . Verdasco returned everything , he was everywhere . But Nadal at his prime could bring down gods and eventually nerves got the better of Verdasco . Nadal came out victorious 6 7 , 6 4 , 7 6 , 6 7 , 6 4 , and perspired , perhaps , ? ? like he never had before .
