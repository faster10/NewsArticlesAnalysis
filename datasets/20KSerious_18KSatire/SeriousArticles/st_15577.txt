Veep : Veep is like the comedy version of Breaking Bad . The HFPA never really cared for Breaking Bad and was more or less peer pressured into nominating and rewarding the show and Bryan Cranston because everyone loved it . It ' s been totally meh on Veep until now , nominating the political satire for comedy series for the first time three months after it won the top prize at the Emmys . The show might not win at the Globes , but the nod bodes well for Julia Louis Dreyfus , who has never won a Globe for Veep despite four straight Emmy wins . This might not be unlike what happened two years ago , when Amy Poehler won comedy lead actress the first and only time Parks and Recreation received a series nomination .
