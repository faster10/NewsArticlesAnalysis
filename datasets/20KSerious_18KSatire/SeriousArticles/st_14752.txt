Bush firmly replied , citing as he has for months his tenure as Florida s governor . I m a guy who balanced eight straight budgets , and created 8 billion in reserves , Bush said . I cut taxes every year and personal income grew by 4 . 4 percent . It was a common line from Bush s typical presentation , and it earned applause from the 100 or so gathered at the store . After the confrontation , Bush approached Bettilyon , saying : Lighten up . Put a smile on your face . Bettilyon conceded , I did like you saying American had a future . That s the first positive thing I ve heard from Republicans .
