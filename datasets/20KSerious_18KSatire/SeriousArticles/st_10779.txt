The anatomy swappers here are Mitch ( Ryan Reynolds ) , a swingin ' , irresponsible single guy , and Dave ( Jason Bateman ) , a driven lawyer husband dad . The switcheroo goes down because the two buddies since childhood do something stupid during a Guys ' Night Out in their hometown of Atlanta : They pee in a fountain .

' ' ( For the record , Metis is the goddess of counsel , advice , planning , and cunning . )
