Apparently he immediately realized his mistake after exiting the stage , and thanked Coogler and Jordan during the commercial break that followed , which is sweet . And at 69 , he s certainly not a youngin anymore , so his memory is probably not the greatest . Still , forgetting to thank your co star as well as the guy who is directly responsible for your standing on that stage to begin with ? and especially when those two collaborators are people of color ? is not a great look . Here s hoping that should Stallone win on Oscar night , he makes up for that mistake .
