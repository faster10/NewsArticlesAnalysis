Doing what Durant asks ? not going as " in depth about how bad he is , " grading Kobe ' s 2015 16 performance on a curve informed by his 2005 06 performance , approaching it as if this particular version of Kobe isn ' t a negative on court presence for this particular version of the Lakers ? would mean the media ' s failing to do its job . Baseball writers wrote harshly about Jeter ' s declining defensive range and utility before he kicked off his farewell tour , and basketball writers will do the same to Duncan just as soon as he stops playing All NBA defense while shooting 50 percent from the floor and ranking third on his team in assists . ( If that ever happens . )
