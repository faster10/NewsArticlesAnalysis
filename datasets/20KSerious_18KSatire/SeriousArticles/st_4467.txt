Litvinenko had been preoccupied by fighting organised crime since his days in the KGB , forerunner to the FSB , the report said . He wrote books and articles seeking to expose links between the FSB and Russian mobsters , and towards the end of his life was working with Spanish authorities on investigations into Russian gangs there . Sir Robert found the involvement of Russian organised crime was not implausible but was not supported by the evidence that is available to me .

I am satisfied . . . that Lugovoi and Kovtun in fact received their orders from another source , the chairman said .
