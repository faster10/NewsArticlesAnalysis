Occasionally , however , Amtrak will go public and set up a table at a boarding gate for one train . Perhaps one in nine passengers will be quickly pulled aside . Their luggage will be swabbed for explosives . They are never personally searched or put through any other kind of screening . And O ' Connor ' s rules say passengers are always to be treated with courtesy . If passengers refuse the search , an Amtrak police officer is to courteously take them to the ticket counter and be certain they get a full refund .
