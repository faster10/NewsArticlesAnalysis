See Paris through local eyes . There ' s nothing like traipsing through a city with a local resident by your side . The Parisien d ' Un Jour , Paris Greeter program , pairs city visitors with regular residents students , working people , retirees and others . These folks aren ' t formal guides or interpreters , just passionate Parisians willing to spend two or three hours walking with groups of six or fewer tourists , showing off their favorite areas and spots based on your interests and language . Just go online to register . ( Paris Greeters welcome visitors with disabilities , too . ) Got questions about navigating the M tro or Parisian quirks ? Ask away . And while the service is free , the program happily accepts donations .
