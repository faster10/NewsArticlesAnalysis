Plagues are inevitable wherever people congregate . With a global population of 7 billion , rising by 80 million annually , the question is not whether another big plague will come , but when it will happen , what will cause it , and who will be affected .

With a huge world population that is essentially contiguous , and with so many people with weakened defenses , we are vulnerable as never before .
