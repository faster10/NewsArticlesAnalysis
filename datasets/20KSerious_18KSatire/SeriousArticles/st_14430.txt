The president has made this observation before ? at some point , people who are in favor of gun safety measures , at some point they may just have to conclude they are going to be single issue voters , that they are going to set aside all the other issues , that this one is going to take precedence over all of the others , Earnest told reporter . There are plenty of people on the other side of the debate who are single issue voters . Maybe it s time for people on the side of gun safety , on the side of keeping guns out of the wrong hands to display a similar passion .
