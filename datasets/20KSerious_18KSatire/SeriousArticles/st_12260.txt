The GOP won t be able to defeat Clinton by nominating a know nothing who thinks he can get along with Vladimir Putin ( e . g . Donald Trump ) or someone playing footsie with isolationists ( e . g . Sens . Ted Cruz and Rand Paul ) who thinks we have no interest in Iraq or Syria , or heaven forbid , someone who opposed military action against the Taliban after 9 11 ( Ben Carson ) . That leaves plenty of candidates who would be credible commanders in chief . Surely , Republicans can pick one of them . Really , what good is a national party if it cannot offer an alternative to gross and unprecedented foreign policy malpractice ?
