A group of developed country parties were trying to introduce a condition that the finance mechanism for developing countries under the Paris agreement would depend on domestic mobilisation of resources , Ambassador Nozipho Joyce Mxakato Diseko , chairperson for the bloc , said at a press conference at CoP21 . The G77 China views this as a deviation from what was agreed at the Climate Change conference held in Durban in 2011 . The mandate at that event was for full implementation of the UNFCCC , and come up with an agreement to deal with climate change beyond 2020 . There is no purpose trying to renegotiate the convention , Ms . Mxakato Diseko said .
