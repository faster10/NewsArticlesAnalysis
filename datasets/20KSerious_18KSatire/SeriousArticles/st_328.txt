The low key part may have played a role in failing to win in picture , director or screenplay categories . The ensemble part may have led to it receiving no nominations for acting . ? The movie ? starring Michael Keaton , John Slattery , Rachel McAdams and a host of other stellar performers ? is seen as such a team effort that no one is getting recognition . Though a Screen Actors Guild ensemble prize could be in the cards , the film s actors could get shut out again come Oscar night ? ? many of the male actors will go into supporting , and that prize could well go to Sylvester Stallone ( he won Sunday night ) . To paraphrase Yogi Berra , the movie won t win ? it features too many good people .
