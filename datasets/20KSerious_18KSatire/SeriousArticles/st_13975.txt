It ' s common ground in sports analytics to measure a player ' s improvement and then their decline as they age . This helps teams project performance over a player ' s career and yields insight during contract negotiations . Quarterbacks tend to peak around age 28 and , on average , appear to steadily decline after that . But that apparent steady decline with age obscures what ' s really happening . The final year of a quarterbacks ' s career averages a decline of 0 . 75 yards per attempt ( adjusted for interceptions ) . In simple terms , this is far worse than any one year of average decline due to age .
