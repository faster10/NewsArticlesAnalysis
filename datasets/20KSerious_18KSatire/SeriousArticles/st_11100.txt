ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : Republicans are coming around to the idea of Donald Trump as their nominee , with two thirds of voters saying they think that will happen , and a similar portion saying they ll accept him in that role , according to the new ABC News Washington Post poll . But while Ted Cruz warns that an Iowa win for Trump could make Trump unstoppable , other sentiments still point to a longer fight ahead . That could make Marco Rubio s voting results the ones to watch in the coming contests . He s third in the new poll , behind Trump and Cruz . But asked for their second choice , respondents made Rubio No . 1 ? the selection of 23 percent of GOP voters . That s up 9 points since last month , despite an onslaught that s made him the target of basically all of his rivals . Trump has consolidated his lead and shows strengthened support , across demographics and issue areas . All of his rivals are craving a one on one opportunity against Trump , whose conservative credentials are only now being aggressively questioned on the airwaves . Such a matchup may be most favorable to Rubio , who has stayed in the mix without a breakout moment that would take him from top prospect to all star .
