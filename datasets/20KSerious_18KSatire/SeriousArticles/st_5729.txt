In Alabama , a judge structured a 40 year sentence for rape so the rapist would serve two years in a community program for nonviolent criminals and three years of probation at home . The judge , much like McFadden , argued that the victim just didn ' t behave correctly . He said , " You didn ' t hear the evidence . The original allegation was that both of these crimes were forcible . But then you have to believe that although she was forcibly raped twice , she continued to come back and have a social relationship ( with the rapist ) . "
