We sit there and begin to get their life stories . The young girl sitting next to me , the one Scott chose , is extremely pretty . It is impossible to tell how old she is she claims to be 21 , I would believe it if she was 14 . She says she doesn ' t come from Phnom Penh , and she is working here because her family is very poor and needs the money . Her family doesn ' t know what kind of work she is doing , she said . If they find out , they will be angry with her . She has a very pretty smile , but there are moments when I watch her where the smile disappears , and she looks very sad .
