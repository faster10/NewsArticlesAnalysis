Things were better last week as Alfred Morris , Matt Jones and Chris Thompson combined for over 200 yards . That ended a month of futility . But can they do it again vs . a stout Carolina defense with linebackers who fill their gaps quickly and an underrated defensive front four ? That won t be easy . The Redskins fancy themselves a power team capable of imposing their will on the defense . At times earlier this season they were that and then disappeared . Carolina has one of the best pass defenses in the NFL , though . The running backs need to take some of the pressure of quarterback Kirk Cousins .
