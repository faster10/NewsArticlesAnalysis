At the second level , the Texans are led by inside linebacker Brian Cushing ( 6 4 , 249 ) , an instinctive seven year veteran who leads the Texans in tackles with 110 after knee injuries wrecked his 2012 and 2013 campaigns . He s often flanked on the inside by second round rookie inside linebacker Benardrick McKinney , who has supplanted game one starter Akeem Dent ( 6 1 , 239 ) . McKinney shows promise as a blitzer and run stopper and has been better than expected in coverage . Meanwhile , the Texans three primary edge rushers ? fourth year pro Whitney Mercilus ( 6 4 , 258 ) , 2014 No . 1 pick Jadeveon Clowney ( 6 5 , 266 ) and three year veteran John Simon ( 6 1 , 252 ) ? are all capable run defenders .
