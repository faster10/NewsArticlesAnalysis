Which isn t to say that great black films and performances don t get wrongly snubbed . Spike Lee s masterful Do The Right Thing got snubbed in 1990 while the much safer and more soothing ( to white audiences ) Driving Miss Daisy won Best Picture . I ve always suspected Oscar voters recognized the genius of Lee s film , but were unnerved by its unblinking , unapologetically black vision of race relations in a Brooklyn neighborhood . Lee s vision was not their vision . His experience was not their experience . They couldn t relate .
