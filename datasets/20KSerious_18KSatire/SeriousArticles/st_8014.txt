Director Alastair Siddons shows JR ' s work in the context of its environment , and underlying it is a consistent strand of social justice and political activism . In " Women are Heroes , " eyes and faces of women cover the rooftops of houses in the Kibera slum in Kenya . Seen aerially , the haunting group of eyes seems to call out to the heavens for help , for relief . In " Face2Face , " monumental portraits of Israelis and Palestinians in the same professions were pasted next to each other on both sides of the Separation Wall and in nearby cities . Most people couldn ' t distinguish the Israelis from the Palestinians .
