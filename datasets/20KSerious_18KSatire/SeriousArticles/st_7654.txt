? Origin of Life : I remember once , a few years ago , there were about eight or nine panelists . They were all Nobel Prize winners . And the question came up : how did life originate ? And after all their machinations , they finally came to the conclusion that life emanated as a result of a bunch of promiscuous biochemicals getting together . That was the best that they could come up with . And see that s the wonderful thing about having a relationship with God . God has already told us what happened , so we don t have to come up with fanciful theories so that we can take the place of God . We don t have to do that .
