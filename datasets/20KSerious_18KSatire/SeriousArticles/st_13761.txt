Tsuji : At first we were using characters which were created by outsiders , such as cartoonists or artists , but in this case we had to pay the royalty . So we decided to create our own characters . We hired many artists and asked them to create various characters . According to our own research , the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear . Snoopy already existed as a dog character that ' s why we went for the second most popular character . We asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat .
