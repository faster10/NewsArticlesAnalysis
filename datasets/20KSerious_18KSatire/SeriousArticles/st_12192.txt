This is reflected in the exhibition itself , which is set up like an archive . Works from the luminaries Fraser knew , showed or admired are on the walls , while personal effects a thank you note from Ed Ruscha , a Sex Pistols Never Mind the Bollocks poster , arrest warrants , an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver are kept behind glass cases . In one corner , there ' s a recreation of his desk . Take a few steps , and you ' re looking at the drum from The Beatles ' 1967 Sgt . Pepper ' s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover , which Fraser art directed .
