Here s the problem . They re working hard . They re paying a lot . They are trying to do right by their families . And they are going nowhere fast . They never get a raise . They never get a break . But the bills keep piling up ? and the taxes and the debt . They are working harder than ever to get ahead . Yet they are falling further behind . And they feel robbed ? cheated of their birthright . They are not asking for any favors . They just want a fair chance . And they are losing faith that they will ever get it . Then they look at Washington , and all they see is chaos .
