Jerry Palm ' s analysis : Remember everything I wrote about Florida and Ole Miss ? Forget all that . The College Football Playoff Selection Committee must be looking at a different set of results than I am . Ole Miss ( 9 3 ) checked in at No . 13 in this week ' s rankings , and Florida ( 10 2 ) is way behind at No . 18 . The only way to justify those rankings is if Ole Miss beat Florida 38 10 and not the other way around . I double checked though . The Gators still show up as the winners of that game .
