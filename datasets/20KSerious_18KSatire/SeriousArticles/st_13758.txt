The Hall of Fame , after all , is not about the greater good . It never has been . It is exclusionary by definition . If someone believed there were 11 worthy candidates on this year s Hall of Fame ballot ? and I question that thinking , too ? then the logic of omitting Griffey is , as we like to say , ass backwards . Griffey should have been the first name on this year s ballot , not the 10th . You want to bounce Alan Trammell from the ballot for Lee Smith , we can have that discussion . But Junior should have been bounced for no one .
