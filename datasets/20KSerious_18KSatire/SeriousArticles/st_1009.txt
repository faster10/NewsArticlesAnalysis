Injuries played their part in the massive downturn . Sergio Ramos and Pepe were missing from defence and Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from midfield . Supporters bemoaned the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo , Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema should still have been able to carry the team to victories but that view did a huge disservice to the way Modric controls games , Rodriguez loads the bullets for the front three to fire , and Pepe and Ramos ' pace enables the team to play ten yards higher up the pitch than when they are not available .
