The legal case I just mentioned was filed in court before the public was aware of the lead contamination in Flint ' s water , but the ruling in that case that placed the moratorium on shutoffs was issued around the time that Flint water customers were just beginning to learn how bad the water they were drinking really was . Many residents , with good reason , decided now that a moratorium on shutoffs was in place , that they were simply not going to pay for the poisonous water that the city had been selling them . It has been estimated that more than 80 percent of Flint ' s water customers stopped paying their bills after the judge issued this ruling .
