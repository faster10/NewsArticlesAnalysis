As much , yes ? but not more . Sure , Obama was out front on climate in 2008 , when the nation was looking for some fresh air after two terms of George W . Bush . But it was relatively easy then , because his Republican opponent , John McCain , basically agreed with him . Once in office , Obama did push for a climate bill , but he pushed harder on health care , which was fine . It s not entirely his fault that the Republican response to his Obamacare victory was to swerve hard to the right , blocking and demonizing the rest of his agenda , including anything climate related .
