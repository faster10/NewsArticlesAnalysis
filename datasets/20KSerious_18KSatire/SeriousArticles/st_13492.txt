Florida DB Keanu Neal : When it comes to stopping Henry , the most important player on Florida s defense might not be Antonio Morrison or Jonathan Bullard . It might be Neal . The physical safety is third on the team in tackles ( 77 ) and might be the difference between Henry picking up 5 yards and picking up 25 yards . The only SEC team to keep Henry under 100 yards this season was Arkansas , and part of the reason was that Henry s longest run in that game was only 10 yards . Neal has to make sure Henry doesn t get past him .
