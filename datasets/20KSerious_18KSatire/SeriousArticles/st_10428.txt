" Our owner is committed to winning and it ' s a sign that he ' ll do anything to help us go out there and perform , " James said before referencing his beloved New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys . " They don ' t win it every year but that ' s what they believe in . They believe in going out there and getting the best talent that can play . They believe if they put the most talent out there they give themselves a great chance . I ' m not comparing us to them because we ' re not , we haven ' t won anything , but when you have an ownership group 1 8like that3 8 , then money is not an object . "
