Encouragingly , the film , which Lionsgate acquired for slightly less than 20 million , ticked up from 5 . 5 million on Friday to 5 . 7 million on Saturday a rare increase for frontloaded horror films and fanboy flicks ( Cabin is both of these things ) . This may have been the effect of strong word of mouth and stellar critical reviews overall ( the film stands at 93 percent " Fresh " on Rotten Tomatoes ) , although audiences polled by CinemaScore didn ' t prove overly enthusiastic . They gave the film a harsh " C " grade . Increasingly , CinemaScore grades don ' t seem to line up with critical opinions this recently happened with Drive , which critics loved , but audiences issued a " C " grade . Only time will tell whether word of mouth proves a boon or an anchor for Cabin , but it has a shot at becoming a mid level sleeper hit .
