While the News of the World exposed other people ' s extra marital affairs , its married leading executives were having one themselves , the court heard . On a computer belonging to Brooks , detectives found a draft letter written by the former News of the World editor to its then editor , Andy Coulson in 2004 which suggested they had been having an affair for six years . The prosecution suggested the closeness of that relationship meant Brooks must have known about phone hacking when her lover was editing the paper which she denied . In a passage from the letter read out to the court by a prosecutor , Brooks wrote : " The fact is you are my very best friend , I tell you everything , I confide in you , I seek your advice , I love you , care about you , worry about you , we laugh and cry together . " No British newspaper exposed their affair , though it made front page headlines a decade later . When a lawyer suggested to Coulson that the relationship was " pure hypocrisy , " he replied : " The irony is not lost on me . "
