For those not willing to hop on a board , there was the Schwinn Sting Ray , a banana seated , high handle barred beast of a bike that had been introduced the year before , and appeared in the Schwinn catalog for the first time in 1964 . For 49 . 95 , folks could take one home in flamboyant lime , red , radiant coppertone , sky blue or violet . A version " for mother , daughter or even grandmother " called the Schwinn Fair Lady sold in radiant blue , violet , or white with rose . For a little more flash and a few more bucks , people could pick up a version with chrome fenders and whitewall tires .
