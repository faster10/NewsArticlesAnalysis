Trump s a TV man he understands the landscape . He knows interesting is preferable to informed or reasonable or lucid . Which is why he eschews talking points or scripts and instead riffs on stage like a stand up . Trump s free wheeling approach means he could say literally anything at any moment , and that s the kind of thing people want to watch . The bit about Mexicans being criminals and rapists , for example , was entirely improvised during Trump s announcement speech , and while it was an egregious thing to say , the sheer craziness of the remarks won him a week s worth of headlines and catapulted his campaign .
