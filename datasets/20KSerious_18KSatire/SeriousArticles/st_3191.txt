There has been too much of brouhaha about the reform and it is necessary to exercise prudence and caution . The Union finance minister has termed it as the reform of the century and a game changer , and this has been echoed by the champions of industry and much of the media . While the reform is extremely important , too much optimism could lead to disappointments and it should only be considered as the next stage of consumption tax reform . There is no acceptable empirical evidence to show that this will be a game changer . The study done for the Thirteenth Finance Commission assumes a flawless GST and estimates potential gains in incomes and exports using the 2003 04 input output table . In subsequent years , there have been several developments including the induction of technology in tax administration and the replacement of the cascading type sales tax with multiple rates with VAT at two rates . It is time the industry and trade also play a more proactive role in the architecture , engineering and management of the tax , rather than simply acting as cheerleaders to ensure that the fundamentals of the reform are in place .
