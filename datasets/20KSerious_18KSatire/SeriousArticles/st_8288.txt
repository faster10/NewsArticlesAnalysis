President Obama can point out that global warming is acknowledged in 96 different U . S . statutes . Several of them include findings by past congresses that climate change is real and dangerous and requires an international solution . In several of them , Congress delegated powers to the Executive Branch to confront climate change . One example is the Clean Air Act , which establishes our obligation to prevent any air pollution that " may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country . " In addition , making the United States party to a binding agreement would be consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) , which the Senate approved and President George H . W . Bush ratified in 1992 .
