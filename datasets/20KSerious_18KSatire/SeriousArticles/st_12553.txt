The Bengals are 6 0 and riding high , but they face a desperate Steelers team with Big Ben coming back from injury . Roethlisberger and his teammates swept the Bengals last year on their way to winning the division . In those two wins , Roethlisberger threw five touchdown passes and was not sacked once . When Big Ben plays , the Steelers average 34 pass plays per game . And when he ' s out , the team averages just 25 pass plays . The bump in pass plays usually means more balls thrown to Antonio Brown . Last year in two games against the Bengals , Brown was targeted 27 times , caught 16 for 245 yards .
