Maybe it ' s just legislative recognition of what we ultimately believe : Sure , child development has as a general rule that kids are redeemable , but there are exceptions to every rule . Some kids are just bad to the bone they are trouble , and they will always be trouble . And if your mind just wandered to a specific kid in your neighborhood , maybe you agree with that concept . But there ' s probably one notable exception : your own kid . Your little snowflake is really a good kid and would never do anything wrong .
