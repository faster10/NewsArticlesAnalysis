What To Watch For : Has Seattle figured anything out about its languishing offense ? Any hope that coordinator Darrell Bevell can open things up and expand the scope of his group ? The Seahawks haven ' t topped 24 points since September , they rank a lowly 29th in offensive points scored and their 12 touchdowns on offense are worst in the league . I would imagine that it ' s time to start riding Beast Mode more he ' s as healthy as he ' s going to get and set up play action and run action off of that The Cardinals have the kind of speed and athletes in their secondary that may be able to limit how much Russell Wilson can do outside the pocket . Expect plenty of Patrick Peterson crashing down on read option runs This is the time of year when Michael Bennett does his best work as we move into the home stretch , and I expect a strong finish on the pass rush from Bruce Irvin in a contract year as well I don ' t anticipate the Cardinals getting away from Chris Johnson as their top rushing option . The Seahawks remain very stout against the run For all the hand wringing , Jimmy Graham has been the best receiving option on the Seahawks , leading them in yards and catches . He ' ll get over 1 , 00 yards receiving , have a bigger second half , and while his overall targets will likely remain on current pace , his red zone looks must increase . The Seahawks are scoring touchdowns on just 29 percent of their red zone opportunities and their five red zone TDs are nearly twice as few as any other team in the league ( nine is the next lowest figure ) .
