The Guardian notes that as recently as September , Sanders still didn ' t have a foreign policy page on his campaign web site . At long last , days before the first democratic debate , Bernie rushed out a press release titled " Sanders foreign policy experience . " The contents , however , centered exclusively on Bernie ' s congressional vote not to go to war in Iraq , without offering any other policy making proscriptions . In the debates themselves , Bernie seems eager to shift the focus away from foreign affairs and return to his common refrain of the " billionaire class " and income inequality . On foreign policy , the Guardian concludes , " Sanders nista is nowhere to be found . "
