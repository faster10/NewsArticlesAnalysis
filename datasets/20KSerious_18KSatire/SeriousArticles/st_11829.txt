Flint water customers are forced to pay one of the highest water rates in the nation . This is adding insult to injury , because more than 40 percent of Flint ' s residents live below the poverty line . Half of the residents in poverty also live in what ' s considered to be deep poverty , which equals earning less than half of the income of poverty . These residents do not earn enough money to pay for this very expensive water in the first place , and to add to the dilemma , they have been expected to purchase bottled water for the past several months with not even a penny being credited to their water bills for reimbursement . On Dec . 1 , 2015 , the city of Flint sent shut off notices to more than 7 , 000 families , while 60 percent of families have bills that are very overdue , and there are a total of more than 80 percent of families that have missed at least one recent payment . So to sum up the gravity of this situation , in less than 90 days from now , not only could up to 80 percent of Flint ' s population have their water cut off , but these 80 , 000 people also face the real possibility of being homeless as well .
