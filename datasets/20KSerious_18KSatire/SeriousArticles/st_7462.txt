LOW POINT : The Cubs great season ended with a thud , as they were swept in the NLCS by the New York Mets . As is often the case in October , the team that gets hot , and sometimes even the player that gets hot , determines whose season ends and whose continues . The Cubs ran into that team , led by a foursome of excellent young pitchers in Matt Harvey , Jacob deGrom , Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz . They also ran into that player , as Daniel Murphy is rewriting the postseason history books .
