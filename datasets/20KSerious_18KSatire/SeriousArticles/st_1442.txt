If Trump or Cruz pulled off such a feat , the proper collective action response for the establishment would be to tell three of these guys to pop off . Kasich may well exit soon after New Hampshire . But the other three may not have any reason to drop out . Christie , the least resourced of the three , will get all the money he needs from megadonor Ken Langone and his pals if he can put in a not terrible New Hampshire showing . Rubio , Bush , and their affiliated super PACs will have preposterous amounts of money to work with , for as long as they want . Consider that Bush s super PAC is currently doing the ad buy equivalent of lighting money on fire for sport right now , and there will still be plenty left over .
