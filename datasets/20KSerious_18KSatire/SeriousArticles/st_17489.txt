Lander : People send in stuff all the time , and one of the things is that people just don ' t get what I am going for here . They send in suggestions such as guns , NASCAR , trailer parks these old stereotypes that are not what I ' m after . The one I reject a lot is people say , " Well , you know what , ' Stuff White People Like ' should be on the list of ' Stuff White People Like . ' " I ' m just like , " All right , postmodern hero , you ' re not the first person to send this in . I ' m not putting it on the list . "
