Salkantay is the most frequented Inca Trail alternative . This trek is usually recommended for people who can ' t get on the Inca Trail , but still want a similar experience . Traditionally five days four nights , it leads trekkers up Salkantay Mountain ( one of the highest peaks in the Andes of Peru at over 20 , 000 feet ) and passes by some Quechuan communities and lesser known Inca ruins , traversing everything from snow capped mountains to hot springs . However , as it has become increasingly known as the alternate trek to the Inca Trail , the serene views of the trek often compete with crowded trails and camping sites .
