The CHP s election manifesto in June was centred on economic and labour issues : the party promises to introduce higher pensions , to tackle the current unemployment rate of 11 . 2 , and to improve employment among young people . It also promises to increase the minimum wage from 950 lira ( ? 235 ) to 1 , 500 lira a month , whereas the working week is not to exceed 40 hours . The CHP supports the reform of the current constitution , introduced by the military junta after the 1980 military coup , but opposes the AKP s plans of an executive presidency .
