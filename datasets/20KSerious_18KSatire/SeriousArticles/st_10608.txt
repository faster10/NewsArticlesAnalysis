Beyond policy , this is also bad politics for anyone in the establishment wing who s hoping to prove that nuance and knowledge should eclipse bluster and belligerence in the nominating race . In that regard , Rubio s position , while disappointing , makes some sense : He s currently finding some success by keeping one foot in the outsiders lane while keeping his other in the establishment one . The last thing he wants to do now is look moderate . Christie s not even orphans stance , meanwhile , is more politically questionable ? though perhaps also predictable given he failed a similar leadership test during last year s Ebola scare .
