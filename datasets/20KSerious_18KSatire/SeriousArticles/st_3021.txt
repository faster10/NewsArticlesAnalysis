Former Tennessee Gov . Don Sundquist did it too , taking a pass on sharing a stage with a perennial gadfly universally regarded as a less than serious candidate . They were all , of course , criticized for their decisions but were none the worse for wear , in part because they were known quantities , whose performance and policies had stood the test of time and had already been scrutinized and evaluated by voters . Alternative methods for delivering information were available to voters then and democracy survived . How much more is that true today ?
