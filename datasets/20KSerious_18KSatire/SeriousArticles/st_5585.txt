Don ' t confuse positions with core values . The Republicans get the penalty flag here . " No new taxes " is a position , not a core value . People should never compromise on their core values , but they should be prepared to let go of their positions . Likewise , for Democrats , " go back to the pre Bush tax rates for the wealthy " is a position , not a core value . The core values are far more interesting : growth , opportunity , fairness , and responsibility . Imagine a bill , signed by the president , that honored those principles , instead of merely cobbling together the demands of both parties . Everyone wins , and the lawmakers would truly be leaders .
