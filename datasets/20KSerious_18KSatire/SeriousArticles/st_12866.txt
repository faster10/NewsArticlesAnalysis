I feel so happy for these players and our entire organization , Jeff Wilpon said on Saturday morning . Sandy ( Alderson ) had a plan and we stuck to that plan . Ownership stuck to it , the front office stuck to it , Terry Collins stuck to it . And was it difficult sometimes ? Everybody knows it was . Nobody likes to lose in sports . But everybody involved knew that there s no straight line to get you where you want to go . And everybody involved knew something else : That there s no easy solutions , including the one that says that all you have to do to stop losing is spend more money . It didn t work that way for the Royals and it didn t work that way for us .
