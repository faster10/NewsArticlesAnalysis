For quite some time I have contended that the mainstream media will do everything in its power to prevent a conservative woman , black or other minority from being elected to the White House . The left has believed that minorities and women would have no political power without the progressive agendas of the past . Therefore , they want to keep these groups on an ideological plantation , with women and minorities marching in lockstep . I assume the progressives don ' t realize that the idea behind " giving " these groups their freedoms was to empower them to be able to disagree with their agenda . That is , after all , what freedom is all about . The progressives in journalism want minorities to feel free to make all the money they want , go right ahead and pursue the career they have passion for . But minorities should not dare run for the highest office in the land unless they are willing to adhere to the orthodoxy that " gave them " the right to vote .
