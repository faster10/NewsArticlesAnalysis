Combine this administrative brilliance with generational politics and you get a silent grass roots revolution that is putting many Paulites in positions of power . In 2010 , more than a dozen of them won elections as Republicans , including Rep . Justin Amash of Michigan and Sen . Rand Paul ( son of Ron ) of Kentucky . This year , two dozen active Paul backers are seeking election to Congress , along with more than 200 running for local office . The Paulites have effectively taken over the Iowa GOP . The state central committee now has six members who are passionate for Paul , and the head of the local party is now a Paulite . Given the importance of Iowa to the 2016 nomination , this is a coup in every sense .
