The threat of " lone wolf " terrorism a single individual who is inspired to commit an act of terrorism in the name of a radical cause has long been a major homeland security concern . For years , violent extremist groups such as ISIS , al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula and Al Shabaab have been calling on Muslims living in the West to wage jihad against the unbelievers on their home soil . For example , the former leader of AQAP , a U . S . born cleric named Anwar al Awlaki , gained notoriety for a cover article in his English language " Inspire " magazine entitled " How to Make a Bomb in Your Mom ' s Kitchen . " Likewise , in a 2013 video , Al Shabaab called on Muslims in the West " to grab whatever you ' ve got " to attack non Muslims .
