Outside the stadium after the game , I got Nolan Ryan to autograph my baseball , and then I tried to get Roger Clemens ' autograph and learned a valuable lesson from my dad . Clemens was intimidating . My dad patted me on the back and said , " Don ' t be afraid . Go up to him and ask him for an autograph . " With quivering hands I gave Clemens the ball . Clemens took the ball , and now I can say I ' m the proud owner of Roger Clemens scribble . Most days I ' ve spent watching Rangers baseball haven ' t compared to that day . But we Cubans love our baseball , and we ' ll take it any way we can get it .
