On the broader Hollywood perspective , make sure that you re greenlighting films and are being open minded as to who can play those roles . Look at last year . Michael Keaton did a fantastic job in Birdman , but was Ken Watanabe called for that role ? Did Andy Garcia audition for that role ? Was Denzel Washington ' s name on the list ? Because all of those men are incredible actors and could have played that role as well . From the very start , don t just assume that a white man or woman can play a particular role . Open your minds to exploring the same film with a different person .
