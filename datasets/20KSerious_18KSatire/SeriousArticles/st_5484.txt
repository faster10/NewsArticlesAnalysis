Brooklyn , New York ( VBS . TV ) Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with . After we went back and forth with their representatives for months , they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang . Just before our departure , they suddenly said , " No , nobody can come . " Then they said , " OK , OK , you can come . But only as tourists . " But they already knew we were journalists , and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you ' re supposed to be a tourist you go to jail . We don ' t like jail . And we ' re willing to bet we ' d hate jail in North Korea .
