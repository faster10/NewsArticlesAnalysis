I ' m on set right now and just heard this amazing news . I am absolutely ? blown away ! I couldn ' t be more grateful to the Hollywood Foreign Press ? Association for this nomination and their continued support . Downton Abbey ? and Anna Bates have been a big part of my life for some years now . It has ? been the most exciting journey alongside the most wonderful people . I feel ? so lucky to have portrayed this character and to be recognized along side ? these incredibly talented actresses , who have given such strong , ? inspirational performances . I couldn ' t be happier ! ! ! !
