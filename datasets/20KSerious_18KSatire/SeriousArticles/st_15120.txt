What " local forces " is Obama talking about ? If he means Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria , yes , they ' ve performed admirably . In Kurdish areas . They don ' t want to clear and hold the Sunni heartland of the Islamic State , nor should they . If Obama is talking about the Shiite led Iraqi military , their performance is still just barely adequate , even backed by American air power , and they ' re disdained and mistrusted by the Sunnis of Ramadi , Fallujah and Mosul . If he ' s talking about the Islamist brigades in Syria armed by Saudi Arabia , Turkey and Qatar , it ' s still not entirely clear whether they ' re friend or foe .
