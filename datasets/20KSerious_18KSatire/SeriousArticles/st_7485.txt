There is nothing healthy about smoking . Even if this test pegs you at low risk of developing lung cancer , it doesn ' t mean you won ' t develop a dozen other cancers commonly cause by smoking . If you smoke , the No . 1 thing you should do is quit . But that is easier said than done . If it were easy , 23 percent of adults in the United States would not smoke regularly .
