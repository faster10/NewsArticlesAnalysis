Reconciliation is a powerful tool to get legislation through Congress , but it has no value as a law making exercise with President Obama in the White House ( i . e . any Republican bill will be vetoed any bill he would sign would get Democrat support and 60 Senate votes and not need the reconciliation process ) . Therefore , reconciliation should be used on a unifying effort to create a contrast with President Obama and send a winning message to the American people . And nothing unifies Republicans and provides a better messaging opportunity than repealing Obamacare .
