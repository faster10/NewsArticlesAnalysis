It was someone that I always knew I had to be in the gym , James said . I knew I had to be better because of Kobe Bryant . I knew he was in the gym and I knew he was working on his game . And I knew he was great . So every day that I didn t want to work out or every day I felt like I couldn t give more , I always thought of Kobe . Because I knew that he was getting better and I was like , Man , if you take a day off , he s going to take advantage of it . You cannot take a day off . You cannot take a day off . And I used him for my motivation throughout my career because I always knew that he was working on something . So , that part will be missed a little bit .
