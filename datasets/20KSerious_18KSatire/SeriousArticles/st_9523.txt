I sincerely appreciated the passion and clarity with which she addressed topics such as gun control ( " A minority of people hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people " ) , marriage equality ( " I ' m very , very proud to state that I ' m a full supporter of marriage equality right now " ) and voting rights ( " I deplore the efforts by some to restrict the right to vote " ) . And she was downright funny when she joked that she hadn ' t smoked pot yet and wasn ' t about to start anytime soon .
