At the end of the 1970s , Merkel applied for an assistant professor position at an engineering school and was asked to join the Stasi ( East German secret police . ) She says she refused , claiming that she would make a bad spy because she was too much of a blabbermouth . She didn t get the job . Had she joined , a future career in German politics would have been impossible , according to a profile in Bloomberg BusinessWeek .
