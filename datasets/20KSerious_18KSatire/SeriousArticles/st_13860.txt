Yu : With , say , social media , in the short term , I think it ' s a multiplier and an aggregator and an accelerator . It doesn ' t change who we are , it just enables us to say things faster , and to more people but at some point that quantitative effect shades into a qualitative change in how we relate to each other . And some aspects of social media make us more connected . But other aspects reduce the need , and to some extent , desire , to talk to people face to face , and it ' s easy to understand how those aspects might be making some people feel more lonely than ever . But social media is just one part of technology . There are so many other incredible things being developed now . For instance , I watched that video a few weeks ago , of the woman , a quadriplegic woman , who moved a robotic arm with her mind . So that she could take a sip of her drink . The look on her face as she did it ( and the look on the face of the researcher who was with her ) it was unbelievable and moving and I could not stop watching it , over and over again . Here is a person who is , in some ways , more isolated than anyone her desire , her will to move is trapped inside of her unmovable body . And technology and human ingenuity has brought her will back into the world , reconnected her with the objects and people around her .
