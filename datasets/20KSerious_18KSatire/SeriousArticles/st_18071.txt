Except that it ' s happened before . In 2000 , before he was elected Real Madrid president , Perez convinced Barcelona star Luis Figo to sign a pre contract with him in case he won the office ? he would then use Figo ' s buyout clause , which are mandatory in every Spanish contract , to get him released . Figo ' s management apparently thought Perez had no chance of winning and that they could just pocket the signing bonus . Only then he won and Figo became one of the most loathed people in Catalonia ' s history .
