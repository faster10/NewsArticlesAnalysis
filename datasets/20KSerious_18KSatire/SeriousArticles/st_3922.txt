Neal was a friend of Sun Records ' Sam Phillips the two later founded a management firm and handled Elvis for about 18 months until Parker came into the picture in 1955 .

But lightning struck him twice : Cash struck up a friendship with Stu Carnall , a California booking agent , who became Neal ' s management partner and then Cash ' s sole manager . " All of a sudden Stu Carnall comes in and ( Neal ' s ) thinking , ' This can ' t happen twice , ' and he takes him away , " says Hilburn .
