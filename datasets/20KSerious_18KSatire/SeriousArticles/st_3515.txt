Perkins ' s memory is pretty good about having blown a save with a three run lead . It ' s happened twice , although it never happened in a playoff game , and in Perkins ' s case there were no outs either time when he came into the game . And one of the times , the Twins came back to win the game anyway . Regardless , Perkins was using a common experience and self effacing humor in order to be kind to Blair Walsh on social media a place where Perkins ( like many other pro athletes ) has been savaged for occasionally failing at his job .
