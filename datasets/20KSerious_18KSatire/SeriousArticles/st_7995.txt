Last week , I had the privilege to chair the Rhodes Scholarship selection committee for the D . C . , Maryland , North Carolina district . We interviewed 13 semi finalists and selected 2 award winners . All 13 were exceptional the final decision came down to the splitting of hairs . Out of the 32 Rhodes Scholars named across the United States , Harvard students came away with 6 , an impressive outcome however one slices the pie . Perhaps they are all A students . But now we know many Harvard students receive As .
