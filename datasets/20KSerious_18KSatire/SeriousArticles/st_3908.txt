The city of New Rochelle held an annual Ray Rice Day , where he returned to the local high school ( his high school ) and taught hundreds of kids the basics of football . He was revered at city hall . The Boys and Girls Club made him the honored guest at the annual fundraiser . I attended that event , and fell in love with him . He wasn ' t merely a football star he was a normal guy who refused to forget his roots and gave back to the community . He truly inspired kids to work hard and stay in school .
