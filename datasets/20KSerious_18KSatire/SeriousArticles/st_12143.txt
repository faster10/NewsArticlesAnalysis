When reporters discuss the federal minimum wage the political context is often oversimplified , implying Republicans largely oppose an increase , while Democrats all support one . But don t believe this storyline ! Polling by Oxfam America and GOP pollster John McLaughlin found that most Republicans ( 77 ) in key battleground states support one or more proposals to increase in the federal minimum wage to 9 , 10 , 12 or 15 an hour . While most GOP voters support an increase , unfortunately most GOP candidates and members of Congress have yet to catch up . Thankfully , a few GOP candidates ? ? Gov . John Kasich ? and Sen . Rick Santorum ? have suggested the minimum wage should be increased , highlighting that this issue is not a purely partisan issue .
