A San Francisco sheriff caught up in a national debate on immigration reform lost his bid for re election by a wide margin . Partial returns from Tuesday ' s vote show Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi losing to retired sheriff ' s official Vicki Hennessy . She has the backing of Mayor Ed Lee and the deputies association . The San Francisco sheriff ' s office has been in the spotlight since a Mexican national in the country illegally was charged in the fatal shooting of a San Francisco woman this summer . Prior to the shooting , the man was released from Mirkarimi ' s jail even though federal officials had requested that he be detained . Mirkarimi vigorously defended the city ' s sanctuary policies , which generally prohibit law enforcement from cooperating with immigration officials .
