" There is nothing wrong in our advertisement on beef issue and asking the chief minister to break his silence on controversial remarks made by the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad , his colleague Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Karnataka Chief Minister S Siddaramaiah , " senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi told reporters here . " As far as the timing goes , it is our prerogative as to when we should put out any advertisement , " he said . His defiant stand on the issue came after the grand alliance criticised BJP for putting out the advertisement in vernacular dailies in areas going to polls on Thursday in the last phase , including Seemanchal , and said it will knock the Election Commission ' s doors on the issue .
