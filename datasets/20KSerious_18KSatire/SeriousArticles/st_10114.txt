Van Gundy said this about his team prior to a game against the Utah Jazz , who he was excited to play because of how much they put opposing teams in pick and roll coverage . He wanted his team to be tested to see if they could rise to the challenge of being better against the pick and roll . What Detroit does well on defense can be found in transition , found in closing out on shooters coming off screens or just spotting up , denying scoring opportunities on hand offs , and keeping the other team from getting a lot of offensive putback chances for points .
