" There ' s a reason Tony Stark makes fun of Thor , and mentions Shakespeare in the Park in The Avengers , " said Whedon . " It ' s great to play high drama and comedy alongside a modern story . Shakespeare was shameless about that stuff , pop culture references . Much Ado is very much in the vein of the movies I make , which surprised me . It ' s not that different from The Avengers . It ' s about finding why everyone is in the movie . What makes Ursula the maid shine ? It was oddly similar . "
