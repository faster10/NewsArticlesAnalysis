Bell : I certainly hope so . The way I see it is that Kickstarter is the best example of " power to the people . " If the people want it , the people can make it . That ' s the beauty behind a public funding forum . I hope it opens up a lot of doors for fan bases that don ' t feel heard with the content they would like to see , but I don ' t think it will put the studio system out of business . I don ' t think it ' s the end result for everybody , but I really like the fact that the fans are my boss .
