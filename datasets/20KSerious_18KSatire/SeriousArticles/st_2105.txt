Before I dive in , I do want to give full disclosure : I am a huge fan of Kanye West . Mr West ' s music spoke directly to my experiences of being from the southside of Chicago . He ' s been instrumental in music careers of many of my Chicago favorites ( Common , Twista , Lupe , Do or Die , etc . ) and has paved the way for young acts like Chance the Rapper , Vic Mensa , Saba , Mick Jenkins , and others . Not only does he continually compose amazing music , many of his albums have pushed popular creative bounds ( 808s and Heartbreak arguably changed the sound of contemporary music ) . My iPod houses just about all of his available catalog ( though I ' m not much of a fan Yeezus ) .
