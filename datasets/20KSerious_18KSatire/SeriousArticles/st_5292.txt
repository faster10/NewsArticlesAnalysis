RIDING RIDDICK : Johnson gets a lot of attention . It is time , though , to shift some of the spotlight on Theo Riddick .

The Lions drafted him two years ago in the sixth round , hoping the Notre Dame receiver could become a pass catching running back . The next year , Detroit hired Jim Caldwell and he watched every snap on special teams from the previous season . " I didn ' t even look at the roster to see who it was , and at that time No . 41 kept showing up , " Caldwell said . " He and Tahir ( Whitehead ) kept showing up as guys making tackles all over the place . Then I realized 41 , it ' s probably a defensive back , but I look and it ' s Theo Riddick . I said , ' Wow .
