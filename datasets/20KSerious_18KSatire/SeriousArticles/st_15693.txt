" Look , we ' re not the San Antonio Spurs , " Durant said . " We ' re not going to make 30 passes a possession . We ' re not that . Of course , people want us to be that , and that ' s great basketball , don ' t get me wrong . But we ' ve got guys that can score . We ' ve got two guys on this team that can get a bucket . And there are going to be times when we ' ve got to ISO and there ' s going to be times when we have to be aggressive and look for our shot . But basketball is simple when you ' ve got a guy that can get to the paint . That ' s what San Antonio wants to do .
