Market based measures of inflation compensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low levels earlier in the fall . While the low level of these measures appears to reflect , at least in part , changes in risk and liquidity premiums , we will continue to monitor this development closely . Convincing evidence that longer term inflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation , making the attainment of our 2 inflation goal more difficult .
