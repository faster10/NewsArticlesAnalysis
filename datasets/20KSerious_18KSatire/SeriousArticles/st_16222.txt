' Twas not ever thus . Once upon a time , Republicans were The Party for women . At the request of Susan B . Anthony , it was a Republican , Sen . A . A . Sargent from California , who in 1878 introduced the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote . Almost 20 years later in 1896 , the GOP became the first party to include equal rights for women in its platform . Twenty years after that , Republican suffragette Jeanette Rankin of Montana was the first woman elected to Congress in 1916 exactly a century ago . Republicans elected the first female speaker of a state legislature ( Minnie Davenport Craig of North Dakota , from 1933 1935 ) appointed the first woman to a major ambassadorship ( Clare Booth Luce to Italy in 1953 ) had the first serious female presidential candidate ( Margaret Chase Smith in 1964 ) , and appointed the first female Supreme Court Justice ( Sandra Day O ' Connor in 1981 ) .
