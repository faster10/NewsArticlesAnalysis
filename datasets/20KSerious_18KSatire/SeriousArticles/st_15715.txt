Questions about Tony Pulis such as ' perhaps he thought there was a better job out there ? ' , ' do you feel let down ? ' and then saying ' worth an ask ' before enquiring who would be his replacement , may seem obvious . But in the more comfortable , perhaps sterile atmosphere of Match Of The Day in , say , its thirties and forties , I don ' t think they would have been asked . And luckily for us all , so honestly and interestingly answered . Which in part may just be because people don ' t want to let Gary down ? They want to tell him the truth .
