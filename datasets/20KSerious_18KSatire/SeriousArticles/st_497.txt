YL : The FoG group would like to see tax incentives for private investment in films . It ' s really discouraging that , despite a law requiring private television networks to reinvest 1 . 5 percent of their earnings back into the local film industry , this is hardly ever executed . What ' s really extraordinary about FoG is that it ' s the first time that more than 200 film industryites have joined forces in asking for drastic and immediate change of the filmmaking environment in Greece . The current film industry cannot advance with a law that is 20 years old .
