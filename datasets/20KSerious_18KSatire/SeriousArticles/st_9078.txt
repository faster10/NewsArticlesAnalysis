Tomic would undoubtedly have to be the favourite for the contest , with the World No . 16 representing the only realistic chance at glory for the Aussies now that Nick Kyrgios has been eliminated . He fought right to the end and made it very tough for me . I m try to make me do my best in the match . Anyone can beat anyone now . It was a scrappy match , there wasn t a period where we were both playing our best , it was up and down . I ll go out there believing I can win and focus on my service games . I was about to serve for the set at 5 4 .
