It was Lilly who comforted Aby through the bleak tragedy . After Mark ' s death , Aby decided a puppy would help soothe her grief . It seemed portentous that the cocker Spaniel was born the day before the funeral . ' It was a beacon of hope , ' Aby says . ' The minute I got her she was the strangest thing .
