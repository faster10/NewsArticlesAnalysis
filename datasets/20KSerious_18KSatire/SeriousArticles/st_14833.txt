This week s student protests may be organized on social media , but they re not addressing anything new . The iconic moment of black campus protests was captured way back in 1969 , when students from Cornell University s Afro American Society left Willard Straight Hall carrying rifles and wearing bandoliers , part of a protest against disciplining black students who had advocated for an Africana Studies and Research Center . Forty six years later , students all over the country continue to protest for their right to exist on a college campus free of racial discrimination .
