Unbelievable , right ? It makes no sense but it is what it is , Roethlisberger said . It s on all of us . But Wade ( goes all out ) all the time and makes us stand up , and we do it . The difference between this year and past years is Wade . They took the ball and ran off 6 : 52 of the game clock and scored eight points to take a 20 13 lead and ultimately seal the victory . So the Steelers gave the Patriots a formula to move the ball against one of the NFL s best defenses . So real credit to them . They outscored the winningest team in football , 24 0 , in the second half . Several big plays were made by the Steelers while the Broncos waited until the fourth quarter to make a few of their own .
