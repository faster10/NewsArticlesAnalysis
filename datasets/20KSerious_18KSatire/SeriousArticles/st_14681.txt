Never getting to see those two meet up is a shame . Not just because of their star power and historic greatness individually , but because they represent such different approaches to the game . Bryant , always wanting to be the one to take the shot , always looking to prove he can score , with an indomitable will that borders on abrasive to teammates . And James , always looking to make the right pass , the king of versatility and dynamic play . A guy who loves being a part of a team as much as he loves being a star .
