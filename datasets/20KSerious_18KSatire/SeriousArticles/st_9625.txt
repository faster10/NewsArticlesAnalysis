A handful of airmen assigned to a U . S . Air Force base in the Mideast were on hand as well . I was tracking the jet ' s advance down the runway with my video camera . I pivoted as the plane swept by , and my view was suddenly blocked by one of the airmen . He stood pumping his fist up and down as the jet rose in front of us . I momentarily paused on him and lost the plane . It streaked by with a blast of sound and air displacement that went right through me . I turned my camera in time to catch the afterburners as the aircraft rose at a steep angle into the sky .
