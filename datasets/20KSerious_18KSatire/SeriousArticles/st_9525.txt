We don t know every team that will be selected and that matchups that will take place , but we do have a decent idea of which squads have a realistic chance to make the final four . No . 3 Oklahoma is a virtual lock after beating Big 12 contenders Baylor , TCU and Oklahoma State in consecutive weeks to claim the conference championship . No . 2 Alabama should be safe , too , as long as it doesn t stub its toe against Florida in the SEC championship game the Crimson Tide have won nine straight games since losing to Ole Miss in September . The winner of the Big Ten championship game pitting No . 4 Iowa and No . 5 Michigan State also should earn a bid , as the Hawkeyes have aced a Power Five conference schedule and the Spartans count wins over top 20 foes Ohio State , Michigan and Oregon . Lastly , Clemson , unbeaten with two top 10 victories , can breathe easy on selection day if it beats North Carolina in the ACC title game .
