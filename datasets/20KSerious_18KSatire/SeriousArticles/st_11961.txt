I worry because all around me , even within my extended family , I see religion being manipulated . As a psychologist , I worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world . Now , I ' m a clinical psychologist . I ' m licensed in New York state . I trained at Bellevue Hospital ' s survivors of political torture program . And I heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership , only to end up being tortured by their heroes . And torture ' s a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it ' s done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways .
