Another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate consists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a full time job and cannot find one those classified as part time for economic reasons . The share of such workers jumped from 3 of total employment prior to the Great Recession to around 6 . 5 by 2010 . Since then , however , the share of these part time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 of those employed . While this decline represents considerable progress , particularly given secular trends that over time may have increased the prevalence of part time employment , I think some room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves further .
