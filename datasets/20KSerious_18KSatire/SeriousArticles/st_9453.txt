The first two episodes of the ? X Files ? revival season put a special focus on the series long running serialized storylines , with frequent references to Roswell , conspiracies , and alien adjacent babies . In contrast , Mulder and Scully Meet the Were Monster fits neatly in the tradition of standalone Monster of the Week episodes . It s an hour written and directed by Darin Morgan , who left his mark on ? X Files ? history with episodes like Jose Chung s ? From Outer Space and Clyde Bruckman s Final Repose .
