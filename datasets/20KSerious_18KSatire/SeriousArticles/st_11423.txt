This is not capitalism . This is an anti free market manipulation of our economy to benefit the 1 while hurting the rest of us . The United States economy , as Wall Street has rigged it , violates the principle of capitalism proffered by Adam Smith and the ideal of equal opportunity enshrined by our founders . To " rescue " our economy , we let big banks write down their bad debt . So , to rescue homeowners , banks must write down underwater mortgages , helping homeowners adjust the principle of their loans to reasonable , pre bubble levels , keep families in their homes and stabilize the housing market .
