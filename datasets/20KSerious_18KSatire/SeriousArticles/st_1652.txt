If Ricky Gervais was ousted in favor of Fey and Poehler , it s not because he was too edgy for America s living rooms ? as he constantly insinuated last night ? but that he s simply not very good at his job . Last night , Gervais peddled the exact same jokes he was peddling in 2012 , the last time the HFPA let him host . It was a dash of Mel Gibson there and a Charlie Sheen joke here , everything you might expect from Ricky Gervais and absolutely nothing more . For someone so devoted to taking the piss out of Hollywood by exposing the industry s hypocrisy and self importance , he only does ? the industry ? a favor ? with his approach ? ? he can be surrounded ? by creeps ? and wife beaters ( not to mention Mel Gibson ! ) and still somehow manage to look like the biggest asshole in the room . ?
