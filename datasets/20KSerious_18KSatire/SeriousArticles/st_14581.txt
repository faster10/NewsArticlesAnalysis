The smoothest transition if Van Gaal is sacked would be to simply promote his assistant and Manchester United ' s record appearance holder Ryan Giggs . He took on the job before when Moyes was fired , overseeing two wins in the four Premier League games for which he was in charge . The club could appoint the Welshman on an ' interim basis ' or permanently . The former situation would allow them to bring in someone new in the summer if they felt Giggs wasn ' t ready , but give them the flexibility to appoint him full time if he impressed . The latter would be popular with fans but a risk considering Giggs has never been a manager on a full time basis before .
