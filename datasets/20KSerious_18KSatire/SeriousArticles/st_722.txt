The solution is relatively simple . For the first 140 years of the republic , the House increased in size with the population in varying degrees , going from 65 members originally to 435 . A Republican Congress and president enacted the Reapportionment Act of 1929 , which arbitrarily capped the number at 435 members . Although the U . S . population has more than doubled since 1929 , the individual ' s voice in the federal government has diminished . Now is the time to re establish that voice with a Congress that is closer to the level of representation envisioned by the founders .
