You can ' t easily find most of Jobs ' s original typefaces these days , which may be just as well : they are coarsely pixilated and cumbersome to manipulate ( significantly , the typeface that Apple used in its early promotional advertisements remember ' Think Different ' ? were in a modern version of good old Garamond , a French style from the 16th century . ) But the ability to change fonts on our computers seemed like technology from another planet . Before the Macintosh of 1984 , most primitive word processors offered up one dull face , often on a green screen , and good luck trying to italicize it .
