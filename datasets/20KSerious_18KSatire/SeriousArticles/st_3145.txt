It can be assumed that the reasons for switching to Soares are rooted in a belief that Murray played extremely well in the Wimbledon and US Open final defeats ? both of which were straight set losses in partnership with Peers . I played a good match in the Wimbledon final . I lost six points on my serve the whole match but we didn t have a chance to break serve after the first set . It was a strange match because I was holding my serve easily and their opponents Jean Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau were holding theirs pretty easy . And then we lost John s serve twice and that was it .
