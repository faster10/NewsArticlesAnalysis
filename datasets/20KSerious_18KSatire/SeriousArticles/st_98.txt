Then came , from today s vantage , the key passage : Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I would like in requiring the diplomatic route first I take the president at his word that he will try hard to pass a United Nations resolution and seek to avoid war , if possible . Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the United Nations more likely and war less likely ? and because a good faith effort by the United States , even if it fails , will bring more allies and legitimacy to our cause ? I have concluded , after careful and serious consideration , that a vote for the resolution best serves the security of our nation . If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it with only a few Democrats , I am concerned that those who want to pretend this problem will go away with delay will oppose any United Nations resolution calling for unrestricted inspections .
