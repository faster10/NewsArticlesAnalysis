Now replenish the talent . It was apparent that Coughlin and McAdoo made offensive choices because of how weak the defense was , and it didn t always work out . The short running game and a complimentary WR are the big needs on offense , I d bring in a punter to challenge Wing . Defense needs help at every level ? sign Prince and make him a slot CB , get a cover corner and a ballhawk free safety , Kennard is the only talent at LB , and get more D line help if JPP can play with the glove instead of the big mitten , great , but they need guys as good if not better in the DE rotation .
