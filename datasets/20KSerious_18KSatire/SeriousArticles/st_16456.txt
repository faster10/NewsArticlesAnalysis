at any rate , they both said let s make an LCD record . you see , if they didn t want to , which i d half assumed , then there s no such thing as LCD . imagine this : me making a record , calling it LCD , and then you go to the show and there s just some guy playing drums over there , or some other person playing keyboards . horrifying . then imagine this : i make a james murphy record , or , i don t know , an everteen record , or whatever made up name i come up with , and there s pat playing drums , and nancy . maybe al isn t too busy with hot chip so he comes to play . what the f ? k is that ? here were our choices : 1 . make music with your friends and call it something else , which seems hilarious ( everteen ) or egomaniacal to the point of sociopathic ( james murphy solo record ) . 2 . make music , but WILLFULLY EXCLUDE your friends because of the horrors in option 1 . 3 . make an LCD record with your friends , who want to make said record , and deal with whatever fall out together . 4 . don t make music , to avoid the horrors of all of the above . 5 . make music and , like , hide it somewhere .
