Doctor shortage . There aren ' t nearly enough of us to care for the U . S . population . By some estimates , the country is already short of tens of thousands of doctors , a problem that will only get worse as the demand for care increases with our aging population . That could mean longer wait times for you when you need to make an appointment . But that also means policy makers will have to consider questions like : Is there a way to increase the number of residency training slots ? Are there other health care professionals who can reasonably fill in the gaps ? Will the nation ' s quality of care go down ? How can the country avoid a situation where only the wealthy will be able to afford quality care ?
