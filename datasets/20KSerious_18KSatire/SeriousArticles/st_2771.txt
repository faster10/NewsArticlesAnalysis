Piccard : The 200 square meters of solar cells on the wing of the aircraft will allow the propellers to run during the day and reach an altitude of 27 , 000 feet . At the same time , the excess of energy will charge the 400 kg of batteries . At sunset , the airplane will slowly glide down to 10 000 ft and the energy stored in the batteries during the day , will be released to allow the aircraft to fly during the night . The batteries have to carry the airplane until the next sunrise ! Of course we need sun light during the day , and we have to avoid flying in bad weather , particularly because our gigantic wingspan and very light wing loading don ' t accept big turbulences .
