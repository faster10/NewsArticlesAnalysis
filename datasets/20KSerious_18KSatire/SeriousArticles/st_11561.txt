Higher taxes for the rich are also bundled into Sander s health care plan . The 2016 tax bracket maxes out at a 39 . 6 percent income tax rate based upon a single person making more than 415 , 050 . Sanders would increase the top tax rate to 52 percent , although this tax bracket would only apply to those earning more than 10 million a year . Americans making between 250 , 000 to 500 , 000 a year would also see a tax increase with a 37 percent income tax rate . This tax plan would essentially merge two current tax brackets into a higher level , since earners making 190 , 150 to 413 , 350 are taxed at 33 percent , while 413 , 350 to 415 , 050 is taxed at 35 percent .
