I ' ve been earning a paycheck for 30 years . Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days , I ' ve always found that the people I work with matter to me . Their moods , their opinions , their style influence my life . They ' ve appreciated me , humiliated me , surprised me , and antagonized me . I ' ve gotten flowers and I ' ve gotten fired ( and I ' m pretty sure I didn ' t do anything to deserve either ) , but I ' ve never experienced anything like The Tinkler .
