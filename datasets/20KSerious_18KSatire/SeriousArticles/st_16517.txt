New England responded with a 48 yard drive and 46 yard field goal by Gostkowski . This isn t November 2009 , when Bill Belichick was so spooked by Manning that he went for it on fourth and 2 from his own 28 with a six point lead and 2 : 08 remaining . The running game , or at least a balanced offense , is a better alternative than Peyton Manning winging the ball 45 times . Nobody was surprised . Cornerbacks , even outstanding ones , are as disposable as dish towels in New England . It s like that at pretty much every position ? except one . Known as a fierce pass rusher , Miller fooled Brady by dropping into coverage .
