The problem here , as one Sanders supporter put it , is that there s just more of us on the internet in general so it probably just seems like we re disproportionately trollish . The Sanders campaign is justifiably proud ? of its clear social media dominance , and it makes sense that a larger movement would produce a bigger pool of jerks . This is not Sanders fault , but the Vermont senator s own thoughtful and pleasant conversational stylings don t make the experience of discussing the campaign with his supporters any less annoying .
