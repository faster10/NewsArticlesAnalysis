What hangs some people up is the school administration ' s decision , during the recent pilot phase of the project , to allow parents to opt their children out of it . Parents received letters in the mail describing the program and telling them that their child would be in the program unless a parent disallowed it in writing . Only 1 to 2 of parents denied permission . It ' s a good bet many parents didn ' t read the letters , or if they did , thought their daughter wasn ' t having sex , or weren ' t sure how they felt so they didn ' t do anything .
