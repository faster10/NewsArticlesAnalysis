We have had the same babysitter since Luna was born . Rosanna would step in front of a train for Luna . She is not easily replaced . But when Luna was a baby , we figured we had options . There is a reason God gave us mothers , tias ( aunties ) , abuelitas ( grandmothers ) and the occasional BFF you call " co madre " regardless of whether they are actually your kid ' s godmother and hence your " co mother . " The problem is every Latina in New York works until death . There is no cotton topped Grandma on standby sitting in her house dress feeding chickens .
