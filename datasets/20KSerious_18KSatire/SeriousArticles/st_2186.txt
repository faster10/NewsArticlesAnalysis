Nuclear proponents also argue that nuclear energy production is constant , unlike fickle winds and sunshine . But worldwide , nuclear plants are down 15 percent of the time , and when a plant goes down , so does a large fraction of the grid . Connecting wind farms over large areas through transmission lines smoothes power supply . Combining geothermal with wind ( whose power potential often peaks at night ) and solar ( which peaks by day ) , and using hydroelectricity to fill in gaps , would almost always match demand .
