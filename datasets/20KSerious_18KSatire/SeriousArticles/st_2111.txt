I know I had to do some tricks for my own self to help me stay on point , Quinn says . I interviewed with the first club the Tuesday night after the regular season ended , and I made a decision that night that I m not going to look at the internet again until I m done with our season . So it went from ( Dec . 30 ) until after the Super Bowl that I didn t look at the internet . I just didn t want to know the speculation or where the story was with any of it . And there were some days I left my phone in the console of my car . I didn t want to see it .
