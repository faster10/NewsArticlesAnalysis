TED CRUZ is the giant killer . He was the only candidate to draft The Donald ( our 2015 play of the yea r ) and the only one to successfully pass him . This , despite Trump ' s many red herrings of Canadian citizenship and the endorsement of The Donald by Sarah Palin , the mother of all surrogates . Cruz won ' t fix what ' s not broken . He ' ll double down on the label of courageous conservative , claim Trump as a hunting trophy , and recast his friendless reputation as ferocious . Oh , and he ' ll deflect allegations of having seeded the pre caucus rumor of a suspended Ben Carson campaign .
