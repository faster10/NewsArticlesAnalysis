Bowers didn ' t back down . " It appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS now is just as real and serious as that from our enemies then , " he told WDBJ7 News . " I understand how difficult a decision that FDR made , but in light of what was going on at the time I think he made the right decision and I think the right decision now is not to have Syrian refugees here , now . " He added , " I think people are worried , people are fearful , and this is a scourge upon the earth and we need to stand up against it . " And to be clear , the scourge Bowers thinks Roanoke needs to stand up against is Syrian refugees , not fear itself . Last week , Bowers said he won ' t be running for reelection next year .
