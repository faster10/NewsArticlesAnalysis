Julianna Margulies' "regular" life in New York
The three-time Emmy award-winning Julianna Margulies is a triple threat, achieving success in television, theater and film. She may have earned celebrity status from her work on "The Sopranos," "ER" and CBS' "The Good Wife," but Margulies said she's just a regular New Yorker."I'm not quite centered when I'm in L.A. I love visiting, but I knew I wanted to have a kid or two, and I wouldn't raise them out there," she said. "I'm a New Yorker, you know? I mean, I'm a fourth-generation New Yorker."That's one of the reasons Margulies left "ER" in 2000, turning down a $27 million paycheck. She knew it was time to move on."I never think to do something because of money; I think to do it because I love it, and I had six great years, and I was homesick," she said.Margulies lives in New York with her husband Keith Lieberthal and son, Kieran. He just turned 7 and is starting to learn a little bit more about his mother's job."He knows I'm an actress, and he's starting to understand a little ... he sees me up on posters and on buses and things like that, but, you know, I'm regular," Margulies said. "I ride the subway. I don't do anything fancy, and I try to make sure he knows that that's not what's important. What's important is that I love what I do."Right now, that work involves co-producing and starring in "The Good Wife." Like other political and legal dramas, there's no shortage of court battles, scandals and dirty campaigns. In this season, Margulies' character, Alicia Florrick, is running for office."I love the politics of it, and it's really changing her dynamic with her 'husband,' and I put it in quotes because they're staying married but not romantically," Margulies said. "... I love politics. There's something very horrible and sexy about them at the same time."Watch Margulies talk about new romance in Alicia's life on "The Good Wife" in the player above.
