Biskupic : I was curious about the social and political shifts that affected her life and that led to her appointment . It occurred to me that she was born in 1954 , which was , of course , the year of Brown v . Board of Education . But it was also the year of a case called Hernandez v . Texas , which marked the very first time that the court held that the Constitution protected Hispanics from discrimination , with the same force that it protected blacks . And it seemed that at every point in her youth and early years as an aspiring lawyer , she was in sync with the development of new rights for Latinos . And then she ' s on the scene in the early ' 90s when someone like Sen . Daniel Moynihan Democrat from New York is looking for more diverse candidates to recommend to President George H . W . Bush . And at every point , her trajectory was in sync with the trajectory and rise of Latinos . As I ' m working on this book , she suddenly provides this even more interesting story with her own memoir and the kind of figure she becomes off the bench . It became much more exciting . The very last three chapters of my book are devoted to what kind of groundbreaker she ' s been while she ' s on the bench and what it ' s been like to watch her as she ' s become this huge figure in America , as the people ' s justice .
