Kerry told reporters the Syria Support Group will meet " very shortly " after the first round of Syria talks " because we want to keep the process moving " . The group has devised a plan for a political transition aimed at ending the nearly five year war in Syria that has cost more than 260 , 000 lives and displaced millions . It includes Saudi Arabia , the United States and other countries who say President Bashar al Assad can have no role in Syria ' s future , and Assad ' s allies Iran and Moscow . Kerry spoke of the " urgency " of ending the conflict but said there are no illusions that there are still " obstacles " to finding a political settlement in Syria .
