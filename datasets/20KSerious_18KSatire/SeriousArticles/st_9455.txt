1 ) Dreams give us vision . Our dreams can take us from chaos to clarity , and eventually to concept . Keep a dream journal to start understanding the language of your unconscious . Look for recurring symbols that may offer a meaningful perspective on an issue you may be struggling with . After a night filled with vivid dreams , jot or doodle down as many images or thoughts you can remember . Symbols may emerge as guides in your daily life , as well as creative allies , leading to self realization and fulfillment .
