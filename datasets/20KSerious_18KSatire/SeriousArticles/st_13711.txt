Murray has won each of their three matches : with brisk efficiency in Brisbane in 2012 , similarly in Miami the following year and in a marginally more competitive contest in the semi final of the Davis Cup in Glasgow last year . Tomic pushed Murray hard in the first set of that match before finding the Scot s overwhelming determination to do well in front of his home crowd beyond his capacity to resist . On Monday , that advantage lies with Tomic . If he can tap into it , he could do wondrous things . If Murray has refocused and his father in law has recovered properly , normal service should be resumed .
