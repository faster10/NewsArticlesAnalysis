Tyrod Taylor is a nice quarterback , especially when he stresses defenses by scrambling outside the pocket , but he is below average in the pocket . In Week 2 against the Pats , Taylor was 6 of 7 for 105 yards ( 15 yards per attempt ) , two touchdowns and one interception when moving out of the pocket , and he added five carries for 43 yards and a score . When Taylor remained in the pocket , he was 17 of 23 for 127 yards ( 5 . 5 yards per attempt ) , one touchdown and two interceptions , and he was sacked eight times . Furthermore , when he was in the pocket , he had nine completions for 52 yards on screens and check downs . The Pats know how to neutralize Taylor , and Chandler Jones , Rob Ninkovich , Jabaal Sheard , Dont a Hightower and the rest of the front seven need to play with good gap discipline .
