Fantasy watch : Let ' s all pause and have a moment of quiet reflection for Dalton ' s fantasy owners . This just was not the day for you all . After the Bengals quarterback had posted single game fantasy point totals in the 20s and 30s per ESPN ' s standard scoring system he was comparatively poor Sunday , registering his owners just nine points . Ahead of his drive that gave the Bengals a late lead with 2 : 57 remaining , Dalton had only four fantasy points to his name for the day . Still , he ' s a good fantasy option . Entering Week 8 , he had the fourth highest fantasy production of a quarterback this season .
