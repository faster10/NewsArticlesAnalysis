Even with just one company trading , the exchange generated a lot of interest among local and foreign investors . In the first three days of trading , the share price for the water utility rose 60 above its IPO price , but by the following week , short term investors started selling to take in profits . The stock price came down substantially . " It ' s kind of a typical phenomenon for a new exchange . It happened in the Laos market and Vietnam ' s market . It is no surprise to me , " says KT Han , managing director of Tongyang Securities which was the sole underwriter of the IPO . " Some people made a 50 profit within a few days . They tend to be short sighted by this fluctuation in price and it will take some time for them to understand the market and make long term investments . "
