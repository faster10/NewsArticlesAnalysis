Tiffanie DiDonato , from Swansboro , North Carolina , was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4 ' 10 tall , instead of her previous height of 3 ' 8 , which is how tall her son Titan currently is . But even with the additional inches , parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34 year old mom who has certain physical limitations , and often has to use crutches , or sometimes a wheelchair , in addition to being three months pregnant .
