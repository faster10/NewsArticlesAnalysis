Beyonce Supports Her Backup Singer Battling Cancer with a Special Message
Beyonce is showing her support for a close friend in need. The 33-year-old superstar took to her website to give a shout out to one of her backup singers -- Tiffany Monique Riddick, who's currently battling cancer -- with a sweet message.  "We love you Tiffany, " the  "Drunk In Love " singer wrote, alongside a flawless picture of Tiffany.  "Wishing you a speedy recovery. Love, Beyonce.

She has also sung backup vocals for Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Anita Baker, Stevie Wonder and Kenny Loggins. In 2013, she told New Jersey Monthly that she quit her day job and became fully committed to the  "Single Ladies " singer when she became one of  "the Mamas, " Beyonce's nickname name for her trio of background singers. Beyonce's message comes less than a week after Tiffany's Facebook update this past Sunday, in which the talented singer shared that she was in  "quite a bit of pain. "  "Fevers, a-fib, no food or water since last Tuesday, quite a bit of pain and a lot of fatigue today, " she wrote.  "I'm finally 'comfortable' so I'm gonna get some sleep while the going is good. " Still, she remained upbeat with her hashtags  "‪#‎fckcancer‬ ‪#‎godsgotthis‬ ‪#‎bravethestorm. " Hopefully, Beyonce's message brightened up her day.
