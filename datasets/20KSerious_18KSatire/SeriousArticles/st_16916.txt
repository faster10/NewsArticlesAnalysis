Key players : When all was said and done last season , Chelsea won the title because they could rely on the goal scoring heroics of two world class strikers : Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka . When one was injured or out of sorts , the other would come into the team and do the business . No other side could boast such an embarrassment of riches especially in these financially difficult times . Ferguson will need at least one of Dimitar Berbatov , Michael Owen , Federico Macheda or Javier Martinez to help lessen the burden on Wayne Rooney if United are to wrestle the title back from Chelsea . Meanwhile , if Liverpool are to fire their way back into the Champions league , new boy Milan Jovanovic , who turned down Real Madrid to join the Anfield outfit , will need to offer the kind of goal threat that the side so often lacked in the absence of Fernando Torres .
