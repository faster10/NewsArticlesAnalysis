The February debate in question is still more than three months ? and five debates ? away , so it s way too soon to say if the GOP will actually follow through on its threat of barring NBC News ? which like CNBC is owned by NBC Universal ? from hosting . ( Preibus is promising the Houston show will go on no matter what with the help of the National Review , the conservative magazine that was set to co host with NBC . ) Even if it does , it won t matter in the grand scheme of things as long as the rest of the chosen debate hosts ? running the gamut from ABC to Fox ? are willing to ask the tough questions .
