According to the Flynn briefing , the Taliban have largely re created the command structure they had before the U . S . invasion of Afghanistan in fall 2001 . The new structure consists of the " inner shura " ( inner council ) , an 18 member group headed by Taliban leader Mullah Omar that arrives at decisions based on consensus , but " within Omar ' s guidance . " Those decisions are then communicated to regional shuras of up to 20 members , then to provincial shuras and the Taliban ' s " shadow provincial governors . "
