Tony Hansberry was likely the only 14 year old boy making a difference in gynaecology . Attending a high school with a program geared towards medicine gave Hansberry the chance to intern at the nearby UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville , Florida . There , he was challenged to improve how the vaginal cuff ( the top of the vagina ) is sutured after a hysterectomy . Typically , the cuff is sewn together with a horizontal stitch to decrease the risk of infection after surgery , but Hansberry suggested that a vertical stitch might be faster .
