I have seen China ' s space technology . It is impressive . What the Chinese lack is operational experience . In that , we are still far ahead . But we in the know hear footsteps . It ' s time not for another government space race , but for expanded space cooperation and collaboration an effort the United States would lead , as it does today with the International Space Station program . Bring China into the international fold . This is how we can retain the leadership position . Otherwise , we risk falling behind .
