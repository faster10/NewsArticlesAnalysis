New York Giants : Giants center Weston Richburg ( high ankle sprain ) and guard Justin Pugh ( concussion ) both were able to practice on a limited basis Wednesday . But the way they respond to Wednesday ' s activity will govern their schedules for the rest of the week and help determine whether they can play Sunday against the Jets . The Giants ' offensive line is already without injured guard Geoff Schwartz , and right tackle Marshall Newhouse missed practice Wednesday because of a back injury , so they desperately need Pugh and Richburg back as soon as possible . Otherwise , they ' ll be forced to protect Eli Manning with four backups and a rookie left tackle . Dan Graziano
