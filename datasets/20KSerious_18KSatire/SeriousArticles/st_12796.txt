Sadly , after the Exxon Valdez disastrous oil spill , the United States Supreme Court in Exxon v . Baker ruled that punitive damages may be awarded in maritime cases only on a 1 : 1 ratio with compensatory damages . Of course , that holding defeats the purpose of punitive damages . Punitive damages are assessed against wrongdoers for the same reasons we put criminals in jail : to punish the wrongdoer to teach the wrongdoer not to act that way again , and to set an example for others . The punitive damages as reduced by the Supreme Court in Exxon v . Baker did none of those things .
