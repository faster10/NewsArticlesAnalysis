Those who have closely followed this Clemson program knew those statements were misguided . For the 15th time this season , Clemson proved as much winning the line of scrimmage , moving the ball just fine behind Deshaun Watson , scoring 40 points , holding Henry in check for every carry except a few . The Tigers won nearly every statistical category in the final box score : first downs , total yards , rushing yards , passing yards , sacks , tackles for loss . But they lost 45 40 because they lost on special teams and they gave up way too many busts on defense , starting with an inability to locate tight end O . J . Howard .
