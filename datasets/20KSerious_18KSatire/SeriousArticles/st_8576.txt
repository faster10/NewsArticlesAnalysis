Recently I was walking on busy streets with my 5 year old grandson Jake . He pulled his hand from mine . I asked , " You don ' t want to hold my hand ? " " No , " he said , " I want to walk by myself . " I said , " How about this : On the sidewalk you walk alone and when we cross the street , you hold my hand , because there are so many cars zooming around . " Jake nodded yes and took my hand when we got to the street . This simple example shows a way of being with children , of being on the same side with them , working things out with them something we can do almost all the time . It is a way of being that helps to strengthen children ' s inner security and confidence in their own ideas .
