The pope didn ' t actually travel in a car for state visits until 1930 when Pius XI became the first ever recipient of a Mercedes Benz state car . The Nurburg 460 Pullman was custom built with silk carpets and a dove motif embossed on the roof lining . The pope clearly liked the idea of becoming motorized as he apparently took it for an hour long test drive around the Vatican gardens . Since then he ' s had a string of Mercedes including a 300D in 1960 , a 600 Pullman Landaulet in 1965 and a 300SEL in the 1970s .
