We are living in a particular moment and I am always mindful of being not overrun by it . We have a particular news cycle in the U . S the more you say a crazy thing , the more you are on TV . But the focus of TV is not necessarily the focus of the people . If you got a to town hall of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders , the questions they are getting ? they are Democrats ? is about high costs , wages , drug use , Black Lives Matter no one is coming to these meetings and saying that we need to round up Muslims or such things . They are not even coming and talking about terrorism that much . So I am not willing to concede that because Mr Trump says crazy things , most Americans are being carried away . In fact unlike India or our European friends , we have not been threatened so much in our own territory . In our country there is a lot protection , we have two giant oceans , immigration comes from Canada and Mexico traditionally Terrorism is causing some anxiety , but lot of Democrats are more concerned about the free flow of guns . The truth is Mr Trump came into this elections attacking Mexicans . I don t think we can underestimate the schism that exists between the two parties on the question of whether to embrace or repudiate diversity . Democrats are very open to immigration and recognize the country becoming more diverse , much more accepting of that fact the Republicans are anxious about America not being a white majority country any more . That is the big schism between the two .
