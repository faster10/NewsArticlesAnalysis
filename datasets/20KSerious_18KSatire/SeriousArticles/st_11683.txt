If anything is up for grabs in the Libya of the future , it could be service contracts to help the state oil company improve production from its existing fields and further exploration rights for gas . In the two months since the Gadhafi regime fell , the NTC has brought oil production back up to 300 400 , 000 barrels per day . From now every extra 100 , 000 barrels will be more difficult , costly and time consuming to bring back . Thousands of workers have to return , and a huge amount of investment is required to recapitalize the oil field camps , many of which have been looted over the past six months . Some wells will also need repair as will the main export terminals in the Gulf of Sirte , which suffered the most damage in the conflict .
