The North Korean path was a demanding track , many bikers said , yet stunningly beautiful . Steep serpentine roads took the riders up to high peaks , offering breathtaking views of the scenic countryside with its widespread cornfields , pine trees and small villages . Peasants and villagers stood by the road . Some clapped , while curious children stood watching wide eyed in amazement at the spectacle . Police officers posted alongside the roads occasionally gave a discreet nod as bikers passed .
