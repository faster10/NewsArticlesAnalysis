To date , there are few Republicans who have newly embraced the need for new gun legislation . Rep . Peter King of New York and Sen . Susan Collins of Maine are influential , but among the few returning congressional Republicans who back the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and restrictions on the sale of mass capacity magazines . But the senators who have boasted the backing of the NRA in the past have been notably silent since the slaughter in Newtown . That can fairly be read as a hope that this moment will pass .
