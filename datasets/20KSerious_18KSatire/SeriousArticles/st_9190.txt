Pope Francis begins his first visit to Africa this week . This visit is significant in many ways . First , it shows that Africa matters and is considered by Pope Francis as an important player in the shaping of a new Catholic imagination in the world church . Second , Pope Francis ' message of a poor church and a merciful church that is open to all especially those who suffer and those on the margins resonates with many Africans in their struggles in a challenging and changing social context . African Christians living in a complex and exciting social condition with all its joys and sorrows , pains and hopes are searching for a faith and a Christianity which promotes social transformation , healing , and reconciliation . African Christians in the diverse experiences and manifestations of the Catholic faith desire a Christian religion which is truly good news to the poor in Africa . This is because the Christian faith is very powerful in the continent as Africans hold on strongly to this faith sometimes as the only reality which will never fail them when some of the social , political , economic and cultural bonds and structures in the continent display signs of instability .
