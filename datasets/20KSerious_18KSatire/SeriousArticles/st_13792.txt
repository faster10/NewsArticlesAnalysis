My wife and her family have also developed " game show fever . " My wife , who ' s more of a casual game show fan , joined me at a Game Show Congress in 2006 . She wasn ' t sure what to expect , but my friends welcomed her with open arms . I still remember her being the top player in a game of " Bruce Forsyth ' s Hot Streak " ( a short lived 80s ABC game show hosted by the legendary British emcee ) . She also helped me recruit three members of her family to audition for the Steve Harvey edition of " Family Feud " two years ago . We didn ' t get the call to play , but we had a ton of fun giving it a try .
