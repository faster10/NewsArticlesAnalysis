All this , for a violent , ironic superhero epic that doesn ' t like superheroes in the first place . Directed by " 300 ' s " Zack Snyder , " Watchmen " presents a set of familiar superhero archetypes and then subverts them completely . Rorschach ( Jackie Earl Haley ) is like the Spirit . . . except he ' s a joyless , hard line misanthrope . The Comedian ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) is like Captain America . . . but loyal only to sadistic thrills and a corrupt worldview . Nite Owl ( Patrick Wilson ) is part Batman , part Iron Man . . . except he ' s also a schlubby , impotent coward . Ozymandias ( Matthew Goode ) is the resident genius . . . who ' s built an empire on superhero toys . ( You see what we mean by irony . )
