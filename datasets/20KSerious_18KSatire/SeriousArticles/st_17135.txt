I get it , and I get why she did it . But she has to take note of how pained a lot of women are about this fashion photo . Not just a few women felt hurt looking at the Mayer layout , wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for Mayer , and perhaps for other women , that " making it " and " having it all " needs to include being publicly admired for one ' s allure . That ' s a depressing thought for many talented women who are not beautiful or not sexy . They do not have that card to play and this layout could certainly make them wonder if selection for the top job requires being lovely .
