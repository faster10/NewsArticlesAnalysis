While the Cold war has been over for decades , and the rules which dictated power relations back then do not apply any longer it is important to not ignore the historical relationship between Damascus and Syria which grew even before the start of the Cold war , but became intensified by it . It would be foolish to ignore the connection that Moscow has to the formation of Syria as a modern nation state , as well as ignorant to forget about the political and cultural connections that were developed between these two countries . There is a reason as to why Assad ' s son is learning Russian and it is not because of the current Russian military escalation in the country . To cease to remember decades of personal , family , group and state level relations between both countries would be for an analyst to dictate blind and misperceived forecasts . While there have been many problems in the relations between Damascus and Moscow , and they have been poor at the level of commerce , there has nevertheless remained a sense of an important continuity of friendship and alliance for both countries . Their history gives tremendous weight to the policies being taken at the moment .
