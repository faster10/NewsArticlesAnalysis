Talk about a guy who seemed tranquil I know his on air image was always sort of loud and animated , but I ' d see Madden having a serenely silent and unhurried meal by himself in the restaurant , leisurely flipping through the sports pages I ' d see him in the little sandwich shop deli in the morning , a quiet and amiable fellow standing in line with everyone else , waiting to pay for his breakfast pastries I ' d see him , on departure day , strolling blissfully toward his bus , an overnight bag in his hand , having decided that this was the time that he ' d like to roll out . . . .
