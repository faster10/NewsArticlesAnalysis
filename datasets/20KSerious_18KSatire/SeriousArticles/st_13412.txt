Some connect this particular conservative flavor to John F . Kennedy s mess , the Bay of Pigs invasion , or with Republican support for the embargo . But for the most part , it is incredibly simplistic , and has its roots in the past crimes of one man . Fidel is big government . You are either Fidel , or you are Ronald Reagan . There is no in between . A young and charismatic leader rose up , talking about hope and change . So charisma in politics is suddenly a bad thing ? So we should only trust old , angry white guys ?
