So was it surprising at all that the Giants had so many chances to beat the Pats ( 9 0 ) on Sunday and couldn t close the deal ?

They will agonize over what Coughlin called a very poor series at the start of the fourth quarter when they recovered a Brady fumble and had the ball at the New England 31 and failed to score a single point .
