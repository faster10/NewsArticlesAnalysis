Ben Carson s ideas about things like the pyramids , combined with what he has said about other more immediate topics , suggest not only that his beliefs are impervious to evidence but also an alarming lack of what we might call epistemological modesty . It isn t what he doesn t know that s the problem , it s what he doesn t realize that he doesn t know . He thinks that all the archeologists who have examined the pyramids just don t know what they re talking about , because Joseph had to put all that grain somewhere . He thinks that after reading something about the second law of thermodynamics , he knows more about the solar system than the world s physicists do . He thinks that after hearing a Glenn Beck rant about the evils of Islam , he knows as much about a 1 , 400 year old religion as any theologian and can confidently say why no Muslim who doesn t renounce his faith could be president .
