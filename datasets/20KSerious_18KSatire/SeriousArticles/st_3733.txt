But nationalism comes at a price . Hungary ' s GDP is barely above its 2005 level , even as those of Poland and Slovakia have soared . From 2005 to 2015 , Hungary ' s GDP growth averaged 0 . 8 percent , versus 3 . 4 percent for Slovakia and 3 . 9 percent for Poland . Not all of this is due to the Orb n regime , which took power in 2010 . But the Orb n government has exacerbated a turn inward which had started in the early 2000s . As such , Orb n is both a cause and effect of rising Hungarian nationalism . The resulting policies have knocked nearly 3 percentage points from Hungary ' s GDP growth annually .
