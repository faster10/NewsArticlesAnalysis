Anderson : When you ' re going to cast people this age , you ' re assuming that they ' re not going to be professional . Even if they are , it just means they ' ve been working for eight months or something like that . I had no preconception about what they were supposed to look like , sound like or act like . Even their personalities . I knew what the characters were like and that they had to sort of relate to that . They ' re sort of outsiders . They ' ve got to be convincing in that . But we started really early in the casting process and set aside a long time to do it . Just looked at one audition after another , waiting for someone to appear that we all felt like we could shut down and move on to the next phase of production .
