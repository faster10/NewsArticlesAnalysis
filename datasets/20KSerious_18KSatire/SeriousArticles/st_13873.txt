It s exciting , and I know M will be arriving in app form very soon . I suggest , though , that Facebook go a step further and maybe by the summer or fall introduce a hardware interface for M . Virtual assistants like Facebook M seem to do best when they get to piggyback on a coveted piece of hardware . Siri arrived with the iPhone 4S and Amazon Alexa rolled in on the cylindrical Echo . Google Now has , I think , achieved a little less notoriety because it s not on a singular piece of hardware , but many third party smartphones of varying capability . Some of them highlight Google Now , others seem to want to push it aside for their own smart software .
