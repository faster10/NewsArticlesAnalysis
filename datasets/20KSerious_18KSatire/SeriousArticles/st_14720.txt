Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations . " For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U . S . cities and getting to the point where they can elect African American or Hispanic district attorneys , " he said . " If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white does that really work to answer the call ( for justice ) ? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system . "
