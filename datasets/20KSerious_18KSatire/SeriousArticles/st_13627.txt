The World Health Organisation says as many as four million clinical cases of Zika could affect the Americas . Other experts suspect the figure will be higher . Four million clinical cases may sound a lot but it may well be an underestimate , said Professor Paul Reiter , a consultant on mosquito borne diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris . This view is backed by virologist Jonathan Ball , professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University . The numbers likely to be infected by Zika in the Americas outbreak are immense , he said . The virus has been unleashed in an area where its insect vector is widespread and the human population has never been exposed to it in the past . They don t have any immunity and so the mosquito can pass the virus from person to person unhindered .
