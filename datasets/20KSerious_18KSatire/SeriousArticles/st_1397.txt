Gurira : It was deeply trying for her and a major loss for her . The idea of finally connecting with people that ' s not easy for her at all . She ' s very guarded and really has serious armor on . She ' s slowly letting that armor chip away , opening up to people . She actually spent some time being in this community full time , so to have this happen under her watch , and to see all the trauma it causes , and the things she was trying to avoid , is very traumatic to her . She ' s still just starting to invest again in people .
