San Diego Chargers : The Chargers have failed to get the ground game on track this season with rookie first round selection Melvin Gordon as the centerpiece of the running game . San Diego averages just rushing 82 yards a contest , third worst in the NFL . Coach Mike McCoy said the Chargers will continue to work on having better balance on offense . " We ' re not running the football the way we want to , " McCoy said . " That ' s obvious , right ? We ' ve been talking about that for a long time here . We haven ' t run the ball efficiently or effectively the way we want to here . And we ' ve got to get better at it . There ' s no denying that one bit at all . " Eric D . Williams
