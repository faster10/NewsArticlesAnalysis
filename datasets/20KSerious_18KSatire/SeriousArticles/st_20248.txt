" Putting rates in GST legislation is doable . . . . The GST council will decide it , " said a government official . The government has already awarded the contract to build and operate the IT systems for the GST to Infosys , making it clear that it is keen to push ahead with the reform . The GST seeks to replace excise duty , service tax , value added tax , entry tax and octroi with a single levy , and in the process create a unified national market in the country . The Constitution amendment bill essentially aims to empower states to tax services and the central government to tax goods at retail stage besides creating the GST council that will set the rates . After passage of the Constitution amendment bill , the central government and states have to come out with central and state GST laws . At present , rates are enshrined in the central excise law and can be raised or reduced by notification within the approved cap .
