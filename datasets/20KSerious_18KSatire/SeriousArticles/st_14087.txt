Best coaching move : It wasn t so much what Andy Reid did , but what he didn t do . After the Chiefs started 1 5 , after they lost running back Jamaal Charles for the season in week five , he didn t panic . He didn t make wholesale changes to the starting lineups other than tinkering for the right combination in the offensive line , or even think about playing for the future . He stayed true to his belief in his schemes and system , and it paid off with a second playoff berth in his three years in Kansas City .
