Azealia Banks Goes After Kanye, Pharrell, Lorde and Kendrick Lamar
After her highly-publicized feud with Iggy Azalea, it should come as no surprise that things got heated during Azealia Banks' new interview. The 23-year old hip-hop artist posed for Playboy and also had a lot to say about racism in America. While Iggy Azalea is never mentioned, Banks does call out some of her fellow musicians for not doing enough.  "That's why you have Pharrell or Kendrick Lamar saying, 'How can we expect people to respect us if we don't respect ourselves?' " said Banks.  "He's playing that nonthreatening black man sh*t, and that gets all the white soccer moms going, 'We love him.' Even Kanye West plays a little bit of that game—'Please accept me, white world.' " Banks does give credit to rapper Jay Z however, who, according to her  "hasn't played any of those games.
