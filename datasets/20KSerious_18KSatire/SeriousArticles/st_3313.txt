Meanwhile , Baby Max is impervious to the avalanche of think pieces her birth announcement has triggered . As I recall from my own daughter s birth eight months ago , her biggest concern is eating , sleeping and occasioning the need for a fresh diaper . If they are anything like I was , I suspect that Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are spending a lot of time just gazing at their new baby girl , in awe that she exists and filled with the fierce drive to love and protect her , and to make her world a better place . Lucky for us it s our world too .
