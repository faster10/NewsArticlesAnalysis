Flint is a view into our tomorrows and we cannot fail to fix it and get it right . The population is animated and angry and there has to be collaboration between government entities or we will see the acceleration of a larger national deterioration . Blame , in this case , must be assigned and accounted for . Watch the news on television or the Internet and listen to the citizens and voters and you will believe they are not going to be treated poorly or denied basic services or the truth . The government might not lead us but there are families living along that river that will not compromise over the future of their children . The rest of us need to watch and learn and then act to rebuild our democracy to be representative and prosperous like Michigan when there was nothing over the horizon but another bright and optimistic sunrise .
