But after that bang up opening pre title sequence things slow to a crawl , for two and half hours plus . After Mexico City and faced with the prospect of the shutdown of the 00 program , Bond is off to Rome , Austria , the Moroccan desert , and along the way meets the latest Bond girl , Madeleine Swann played by Lea Seydoux . The love story simply does not work in Spectre ? it s awkward , forced and more implausible than usual . Even the villain , played by Oscar winner Christoph Waltz seems like a caricature ? more Dr Evil than Dr Kananga . This is the most expensive Bond film in history at 250 million plus . It s also the longest ever , clocking in at 148 minutes . In the end it s a poor return on investment .
