Parks scored camera time with Biden in July when the show traveled to Washington , D . C . to film its season 5 premiere , which featured appearances by Senators Barbara Boxer , Olympia Snowe , and John McCain . How big of a casting coup was Biden for NBC ' s small town government comedy ? " Given that Eleanor Roosevelt and Bella Abzug are no longer with us , this is probably no . 1 , " quips executive producer Michael Schur . " Leslie has a lot of female heroes that cross party lines . She has a lot of social figures that she considers heroes , but the funniest hero is Joe Biden . There ' s an episode last season where she says , ' Joe Biden is on my celebrity sex list well , he is my celebrity sex list ' . . . It was amazing to have her meet Olympia Snowe and Barbara Boxer because that meant something to her politically . But this transcends that . She ' s meeting the man that she ' s in love with on some deep level . It was a bigger deal to us in some ways that she meet Joe Biden than it was that she meet Barack Obama . " ( Obama , by the way , has revealed that he watches Parks with his family , by the way . " It ' s a very amazing and weird thing to find out that the President watches your show , " marvels Schur . )
