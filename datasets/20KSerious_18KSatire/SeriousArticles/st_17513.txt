There is only one more debate before the new year and before the voting begins in Iowa . I would suggest Romney take a serious look at changing his approach . Staying the course might feel safe , but it is no longer a winning strategy . Sometimes you risk everything when you refuse to take risks . Does Romney really want to bet the nomination on the hopes that Gingrich will implode ? ( He really needs to stop betting in these debates , by the way . A 10 , 000 bet he offered to Perry , over Perry ' s accusation that he ' d excised one of his positions from a later edition of his book , could not have helped him in the heartland . )
