This would not satisfy Europe s populists : it would formalise rather than end the continent s biggest wave of mass migration since the second world war . But it would enable Europe to screen refugees before they arrive work out who they are and where they re from and decide where they should go , and when they should get there . If such a process can be completed for a large enough group of people , and in a swift enough fashion , it would help deter a majority of refugees from traipsing through Europe in the current chaotic way . It would also give European governments a better chance of weeding out potential bombers ? a fact that some Syrian refugees have acknowledged themselves .
