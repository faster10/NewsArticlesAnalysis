Let me tell you a story about Barry Goldwater . One of the first big things to happen in America , after the Republican convention that nominated Barry Goldwater , in which he of course , famously said , Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice , was the outbreak of a very frightening race riot in Harlem , in New York . As I wrote in my first book , people who were rioting in Harlem were rioting , of course , in response to the shooting of a black young person by a white cop . Barry Goldwater kind of stuck his finger in the air and said , This is really frightening stuff . He actually , in a meeting with Lyndon Johnson , literally said , If my supporters start exploiting these riots and start exploiting racial turmoil in the United States to get me elected , I will withdraw from the presidential campaign .
