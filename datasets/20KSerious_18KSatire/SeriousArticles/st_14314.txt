I believe most Americans ' minds have been made up on Barack Obama for quite some time . Most see what they want to see . Regarding his news conference , his supporters saw a family man , a sensible man , and a man who is looking to make reasonable changes regarding background checks on guns . His detractors saw a man who would capitalize on an event to violate the Constitution to support his own agenda . For the latter group , the words he used or the tears rolling from his eyes did not matter . Altogether , his " moment " will probably be of most significance to those who use it to fundraise ( both for Democrats and Republicans ) in the coming days . The same will likely be true for his final SOTU address .
