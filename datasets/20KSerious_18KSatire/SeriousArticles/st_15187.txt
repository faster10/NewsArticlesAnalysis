OPEN RECORDS LAW OVERHAUL ON TAP Illinois lawmakers are aiming to rewrite state law to speed the release of police dash cam videos and body camera recordings to the public in the wake of stalled transparency with the McDonald video . The new proposal , filed late Friday , already has Democrats and Republicans signed on . It aims to more quickly pry loose police videos for public inspection in incidents involving a police shooting or an officer involved death . The videos would be required to be released through open records requests unless the issuing body can produce a legal protective order . http : bit . ly 1YToCYA
