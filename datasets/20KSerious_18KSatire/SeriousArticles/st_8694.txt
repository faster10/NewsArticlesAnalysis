Once I learned I couldn ' t have the journey , I grew even more set on keeping the destination . Determined to stay Machu Picchu bound and only able to squeeze in a short trek by this point , I opted for an alternate Inca hybrid trek . The two day Inca joins the traditional Inca Trail a short distance from the Sun Gate , the path the Incas took into Machu Picchu . Though it carries the Inca name and the 500 person regulation it arrives at the Sun Gate in the evening , sacrificing the most sought after sunrise view . It also does not include camping or any of that delicious , trek cooked food . My two person group ate bag lunches , spent the one night in Aguas Calientes , the base city to Machu Picchu , and looked on enviously at Inca Trail trekkers sharing beer , some grilled alpaca and a game of cards at the final rest stop where the trails unite .
