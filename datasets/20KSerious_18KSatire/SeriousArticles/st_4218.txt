The diminishing returns may continue for " Revolution , " as the franchise seems to be teetering dangerously close to the quality level of long running direct to video spinoff series like Bring It On and American Pie . Popping and locking into 2 , 567 theaters , Revolution could finish in the same range as 2004 dance flick You Got Served , which started with 16 million . " Step Up " has the benefit of 3 D screens , but those are only major box office boons for blockbusters these days . ( If only the series still starred Channing Tatum ! ) It may earn about 13 million this weekend but the real money will come internationally . " Step Up 3D " grossed 161 million worldwide .
