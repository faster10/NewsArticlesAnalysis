Martin : It is different from where it was when I first started writing . There is more fantasy , more sci fi adventure and vampires , and I think it ' s interesting . I have a feeling in a few years , things will take a turn . The most important thing is , as long as kids are interested and turn into readers , especially avid readers , I think that ' s fabulous . Most kids become eclectic readers , which is great , and that ' s my hope for any reader , to find things that they love and hopefully those will lead them to other things .
