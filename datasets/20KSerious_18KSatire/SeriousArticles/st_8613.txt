Miss Blake , who runs a website called Dreams of Spanking and posts pictures on Twitter of bare bottoms that have been caned until they are bleeding , said : ' Porn is not a genre . It is a medium like film or television . Saying it is degrading is like saying all of TV is degrading just because you have watched Top Gear . I would say don ' t throw the baby out with the bath water . There is a growing number of feminist porn directors making the porn they want to see . It is a huge business and it is happening now .
