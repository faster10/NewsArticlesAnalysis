The second bill is modeled after Minnesota ' s " Safe Harbor " law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex aren ' t prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act ( SETT ) would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . When a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state ' s criminal statutes .
