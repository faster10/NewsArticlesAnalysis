' I remember strolling around in a training game when this little rascal steamed into me . I was angry and asked what he was doing , and he told me to " f ng shut up ! " I asked Jamie Redknapp who this upstart was . " That ' s Stevie G " , he replied . You could tell he wanted it so much and what he ' s done for Liverpool will never be repeated . Now he has to make a decision about his future . If he doesn ' t want to stay , to be in and out of the team , there will be no shame in him going to another club , but hopefully abroad ! I think he ' s got lots to offer . When you ' ve got his experience , even when you don ' t play well , you help your team mates play better . '
