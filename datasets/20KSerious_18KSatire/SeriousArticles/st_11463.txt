Republicans in Congress have pursued a fact free vendetta against women ' s reproductive freedom zeroing in on Planned Parenthood , an organization that provides " sexual and reproductive health care " to millions of women each year . The fact that Planned Parenthood uses zero federal dollars to perform abortions has been ignored by Congressional Republicans . And now , these anti choice crusaders have taken a page from their Benghazi obsessed colleagues and created a select committee to investigate Planned Parenthood ' s support of scientific research involving donated fetal tissue . But because they want tax cuts we should just ignore their assault on women ' s health ?
