Those small stumbles aside , though , both men dominated the stage in ways that they hadn t before . Rubio is unlikely to benefit as much from his performance in Milwaukee as he did from Jeb s performance in Boulder , Colorado , when the former establishment favorite tanked in the last debate , but he survived his first debate as everyone else s favorite target . Cruz , meanwhile , expanded his debate repertoire beyond just bashing the liberal media ? though he did manage to do that too . And both men were able to take big swipes at Hillary Clinton near the end of the debate , billing her as a successor to what they described as the failed policies of Barack Obama . Tuesday s debate , then , likely didn t change the dynamics of the GOP race . But for Rubio and Cruz , that s the best prize they could have asked for .
