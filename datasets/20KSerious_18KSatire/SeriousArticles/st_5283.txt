The best thing about Donald Trump s campaign has simply been the way he has broken all the boring and stifling rules of modern politics . No , he doesn t listen to consultants . No , he doesn t follow focus groups . No , he isn t mealy mouthed . No , he doesn t tailor each message to a micro group . No , he doesn t walk back controversial remarks . No , he doesn t waste time apologizing for gaffes . And , no , he doesn t pretend that every single remark made on the campaign trail needs to be taken literally and analyzed like we re back in high school literature class discussing the metaphysical poets .
