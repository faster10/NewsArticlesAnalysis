What ' s to blame ? Research suggests that a small difference in life expectancy between women and men may be physiological women ' s bodies have some genetic advantages over men ' s . But the vast majority of this life expectancy gap is related to how we are raised and what is expected of us as real men . Often , we ' re taught that a real man is ' hard , ' doesn ' t care too much or seek help , doesn ' t tolerate disrespect and has a lot of sex with a lot of partners . And the impact of this on men ' s lives has disastrous health consequences : violence , alcohol use , unsafe sex , tobacco , other risk taking behaviors and occupational issues can lead to early death and disease . To offer one stark example : in 2010 , 3 . 14 million men ? as opposed to 1 . 72 million women ? died from causes linked to excessive alcohol use .
