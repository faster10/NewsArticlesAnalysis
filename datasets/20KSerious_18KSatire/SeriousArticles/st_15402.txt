I ' m pleased to share exciting news on behalf of our two candidates . As with our previous debates , town halls and forums , voters will have several more opportunities to see them share their vision for how to build on 7 years of progress and keep America moving forward . Our Democratic candidates have asked the DNC to sanction and manage additional debates in our primary schedule , including one this week in New Hampshire ahead of the First in the Nation primary , in conjunction with the New Hampshire Democratic Party . Having our candidates in agreement on their desire to add debates to our sanctioned schedule , the DNC has sanctioned an MSNBC debate on February 4th at the University of New Hampshire in Durham .
