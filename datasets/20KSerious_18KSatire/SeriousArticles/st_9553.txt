Last weekend ' s champ , Identity Thief , dipped only 32 percent to 23 . 4 million in its second weekend . The Melissa McCarthy Jason Bateman laugher has now earned 70 . 7 million against a slim 35 million budget , and , for Universal , it ' s the latest in a hot streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost ( almost ) make up for the fact that the studio spent 209 million on Battleship , which earned only 65 . 4 million , last year . With the exception of The Man with the Iron Fists , every Universal film since the fall has been a profitable venture : Pitch Perfect ( 65 million vs . 17 million budget ) , This is 40 ( 67 . 4 million vs . 35 million budget ) , Les Miserables ( 145 . 5 million vs . 61 million budget ) , Mama ( 68 . 3 million vs . 15 million budget ) , and now Identity Thief . Next up on the studio ' s plate ? The surefire smash Fast Furious 6 .
