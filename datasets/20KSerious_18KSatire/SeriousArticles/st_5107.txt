Such action by MLB is not without precedent . In 1967 in Detroit , the 12th Street riots forced the Tigers to postpone one game and relocate others ( to Baltimore , no less ) . After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr . , MLB postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence . In the wake of the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King beating , the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed several games . The entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of September 11 , 2001 .
