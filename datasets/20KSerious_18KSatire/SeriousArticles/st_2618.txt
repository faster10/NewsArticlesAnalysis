Ironically Fawkes , far from being the anti establishment hero he has come to be seen as in the years since his death , was a monarchist who merely wanted to replace the Protestant king with a Catholic queen . He lived in an age when Europe was split along religious lines , and in England , any sign of allegiance to the pope and Rome could result in imprisonment or even death ( indeed , under the later 1701 Act of Settlement , no Roman Catholic or anyone married to a Catholic could be crowned king or queen , a law whose repeal was announced last week ) .
