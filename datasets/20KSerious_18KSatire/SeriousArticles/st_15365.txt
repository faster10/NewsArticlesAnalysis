Bell : No . This could be my whole life . And by the way , what a lucky life it would be if it were . There ' s no formula for it , because it just has never been done before . Except and I ' m just throwing it out there " Star Trek " did it . They did a TV show and then nine movies . Who knows ? Why can ' t we make a couple films ? Or continue to produce content of " Veronica Mars " ? It gets tricky because television contracts legally only allow you to do one episode of a different show . They purchase you . I am now the face of " House of Lies . " So the only way I would be able to reprise Veronica Mars ( on TV ) is in movie form .
