Mitt Romney vs . Ronald Reagan please hold your laughter because it ' s only getting funnier from here on out . Reagan stepped up as two time governor of California who came within an inch of the nomination in 1976 . He gave the keynote address at the Republican convention of 1964 and was a longtime consistent conservative for years prior to his running for president for the second time in 1980 . Romney is an accomodationist technocrat who is an ideological pretzel of a man . In his four years as governor , Massachusetts ranked 49th in job creation and Katrina saved him from coming in at 50 . But hey Romney has recently released a 59 point economic plan for recovery . Go ahead and name three of those 59 points see , told ya so . I have no idea why that right wing clown in Dallas is attacking his Mormon faith it may be the only thing he really believes in .
