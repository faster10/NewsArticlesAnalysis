The Republican Party was still damaged goods from Watergate and the reaction to Ford ' s pardon of Nixon . Nonetheless the race against a weak Jimmy Carter could have been won . Leftist Carter campaigned as an evangelical Southern Boy and spoke about the " malaise " in America . Republican Beltway consultants close to Ford and Dole were clueless . Ford ran an unimpressive campaign and made a catastrophic blunder in the presidential debate by saying that the Soviet Union did not control its Eastern European satellite countries . In that campaign run partly by Dole cronies ( the " Consultant Class " now derived by Trump supporters ) , Dole added little to the ticket and was not especially impressive in his role as " attack dog . " President Jimmy Carter proved a disaster and brought about the Islamist Revolution in Iran we ' re still paying the consequences .
