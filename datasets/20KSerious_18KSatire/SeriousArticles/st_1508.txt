Life ' s a beach ( during the summer , at least ) . So what if the Seine River that snakes through Paris has no beach ? This city is nothing if not inventive so Mayor Bertrand Delano spearheaded the creation of Paris Plages , man made " beaches " that offer locals and tourists alike a " Seine side holiday " each summer . Starting around July 20 and for four weeks after , the city closes the streets along the river , brings in tons of sand and palm trees and offers a slew of entertaining options from beach volleyball to kayaking to open air concerts on three different " beaches . " Of course , this being France , riverside caf s , restaurants and ice cream vendors are de rigueur . You ' ll have to wait ' til next year to take advantage of the next installment , but what a Parisian way to spend those dog days of summer , from 8 a . m . to midnight .
