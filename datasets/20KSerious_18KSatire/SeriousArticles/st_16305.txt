There are plenty of valid liberal concerns about Clinton , from her decision as Senator to support the Iraq War to her unsettling coziness with Wall Street . While this certainly places her to the right of Sanders , that does not mean that she isn t a liberal herself . During her husband s presidency , Clinton took the lead in pushing for a progressive health care reform plan that was thwarted by many of the same special interest and ideological groups that later coalesced against the Affordable Care Act . Throughout the 00s , Clinton developed a reputation as a staunch legislative progressive , accumulating a record that placed her to the left of 85 percent of her fellow senators . There are even issues like gun control in which Clinton s stance makes Sanders seem conservative by comparison . As Harry Enten recently explained at FiveThirtyEight . com , Clinton rates as a hard core liberal per the ? OnTheIssues . org scale . She is ? as liberal ? as Elizabeth Warren and ? barely more moderate ? than Bernie Sanders . And while Obama ? is also ? a hard core liberal , Clinton again was rated as more liberal than Obama .
