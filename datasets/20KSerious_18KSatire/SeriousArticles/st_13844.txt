Does any of this hurt Trump ? ? or Cruz and Paul ? Paul is already in low single digits , so he does not have far to fall . As for Cruz and Trump , even if their devoted followers ? who are inured to or even supportive of the xenophobic appeals ? are not going to be turned off , these two have capped their appeal . Beyond their core support , they have no sell . Mainstream and somewhat conservative voters outside the Trump crowd ( disproportionately poorer with less than a high school education ) are not going to join up with these two unless Trump and or Cruz can turn out hordes of previously non voting Republicans , their upside in the race is limited .
