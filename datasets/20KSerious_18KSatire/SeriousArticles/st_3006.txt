Younger viewers didn t realize that the film s cinematic techniques ? iris close ups , screen wipes , the now famous opening crawl of narrative back story ? had been out of fashion for decades . Critics noticed , but they loved the movie anyway . Star Wars may have been just a Western in space , complete with barroom brawls , gunslingers and a bad guy in black ( the ever popular Darth Vader ) , yet reviewers showered it with praise . Star Wars is one of the greatest adventure movies ever made , Newsday s Joseph Gelmis wrote at the time . It s a masterpiece of entertainment . I haven t had as much fun at a movie in years .
