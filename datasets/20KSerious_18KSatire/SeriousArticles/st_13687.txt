" During the first part of 2016 , ATF is going to engage in the business of educational initiatives targeting not just gun shows , but flea markets and other places where guns tend to be sold , as well as reaching out to online dealers as well , " said Lynch . " They will continue to look at those dealers who sell to prohibited people , which is already ongoing , and we will be looking to see whether or not people once on notice comply with this regulation or whether there are those who seek to still sort of hide in the shadows or hide behind the exceptions and continue to sell firearms without doing what ' s required . Those cases will be referred to the relevant U . S . attorney ' s office . "
