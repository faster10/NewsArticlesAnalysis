So why all the controversy about President Obama ? There was never any question about his mother ' s American citizenship . So using the logic currently being espoused by Cruz and his other Republican supporters , there should never have been a " birther " issue with Obama . Even if he was born in Kenya , and he wasn ' t Obama was born in Hawaii , according to Cruz it is settled law and Obama ' s legitimacy should never have been questioned . At least that is what Cruz is saying now that he is having the same issue .
