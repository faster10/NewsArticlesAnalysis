" I ' ve said that he was very active in terms of conditioning , " Blatt said . " And obviously , in terms of the rehab , he couldn ' t and didn ' t get involved in contact work until just a few weeks ago . So as far as game rhythm , I think it ' s natural that he ' s a little bit behind as far as that ' s concerned . But you didn ' t see it tonight . He was not only active , but he was very efficient , and he ' s played two pretty good games for us after sitting out for a long , long time . A lot of credit to him . "
