In spite of these misgivings , there is nothing in Einstein ' s theory of space , time and gravitation to forbid journeying into the past , a possibility that Einstein himself hated . Not only wormholes , but several other mechanisms have been found that , according to Einstein ' s theory , can be used to travel back in time . All these proposals suffer from the problem of extreme impracticality , though . Building a human sized wormhole , for example , would require harnessing vast amounts of peculiar quantum field energy and deploying gravitational stabilizing technology that would need the resources of a cosmic super civilization .
