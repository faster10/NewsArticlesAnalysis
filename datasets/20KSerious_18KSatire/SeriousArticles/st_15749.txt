Mr Horowitz obviously did his technical homework , as he generously acknowledges in an admission that he could not have offered such details without the help of genuine experts . He demonstrates his reliance on their aid in quite remarkably detailed chapters on daredevil car racing when Bond is assigned to a Grand Prix to save an English driver and for good measure turns a Russian secret agent to toast . He displays equal skill again as he explains why a space rocket didn t succeed and the reasons for its failure . Then there is the train he blows up . You can t complain about any lack of melodrama .
