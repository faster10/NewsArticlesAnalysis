Polls show that support for a ban on abortion without exceptions is a deeply unpopular stance nationally . A CNN ORC poll from August 2012 found that 83 of voters , including 76 of Republicans , believed women should have the right to have an abortion if her pregnancy is caused by rape or incest . An even higher percentage of Americans supported exceptions when the mother s life was in danger , according to the survey . In a Gallup poll from May 2015 , just 19 of Americans believe abortion should be illegal in all circumstances .
