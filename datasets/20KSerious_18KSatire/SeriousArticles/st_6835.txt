No . 19 MISSISSIPPI 38 , NO . 23 MISSISSIPPI STATE 27 : In Starkville , Mississippi , Chad Kelly threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score to lead Mississippi . Me being a freshman going into this offense , especially an up tempo offense where a lot of people get the ball , I have to have a mindset where I ve got to make plays every time the ball comes my way . The Tigers held a 10 6 lead entering the fourth quarter of that contest . With that in mind , the Gamecocks hope to look back on this year and try to learn from next season . He had 120 yards receiving , three catches , opine touchdown .
