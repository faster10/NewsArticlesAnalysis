" The medical world is also a man ' s world . In the three years of fighting for Robert ' s life I had to unite five big professors from around the world at one table . Each of them had different ideas and different strategies and were used to their decision being followed . So for me , I felt the strength of the woman . Because all of these men , they have big egos and I was kind of there to absorb these egos , give them the feeling of respecting their opinion even if you don ' t take it . Later when I came to the man ' s world of commodities , also with big egos , I was used this experience . Nobody knows everything so the main thing is to work together . "
