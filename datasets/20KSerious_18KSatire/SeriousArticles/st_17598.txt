Luckily for Obama , he is opposed ? as he has been throughout his presidency ? by a Republican Party of eye watering extremism , and so his rhetoric can go a long way merely by offering a contrast to the horrors on the other side . The lies and bigotry on the right , especially in the era of Trump , have become so insane that when Obama said things like food stamp recipients didn t cause the financial crisis ? recklessness on Wall Street did , or forcefully criticized the anti Muslim hysteria sweeping across the country , it was easy to feel a bit of blessed relief .
