It seems silly to say it given that Newton is about to win the league MVP award , but he s not that far removed from a rather ordinary start to the season , when his passer rating was lower than 80 in five of the Panthers first seven games . Those were the days when everyone thought Carolina s fast start was a fluke largely because the Panthers seemed to let even bad opponents hang around . It wasn t until Newton started topping 100 in passer rating regularly as he did in nine of his last 11 games , including the playoffs that Carolina began blowing out opponents and convincing folks they were the real deal . When Newton did struggle in one late season game 17 of 30 passing for 142 yards Atlanta pulled off the Week 16 upset . Denver s top ranked defense has a way of making quarterbacks look bad , so it s at least worth considering that Newton might come back to earth in this game .
