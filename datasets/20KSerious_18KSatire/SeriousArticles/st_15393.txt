With only Chris Leslie on the Labour benches expressing no reservations about taking military action , Dave suddenly realised he might have miscalculated the Commons blood lust . He started anxiously tapping his fingers , trying and failing to count to 326 . Enter James Gray , the unlikeliest saviour in town , showering the whitest of white feathers over the opposition benches . To be honest , he said , I don t think we should hang around and wait for a Commons vote . We should just bomb Syria now . Thank you and goodnight , white knight .
