" I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future . Because the next moment is never promised . Never leave anything unsaid . I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle , no matter how tough it might be . Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams . I always finish what I start and see it through to the end . Never give up on your dreams . Find something to fight for I fight for others . "
