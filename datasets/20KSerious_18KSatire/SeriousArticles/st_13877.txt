He is still playing beautiful tennis , pushing Murray and Djokovic who are in their prime . He doesn ? ? ? t cry now when he loses a final . Actually , he smiles a lot . He seems pretty happy . He has a great family , kids , pretty much everything there is to win in his cabinet . Eighteen won ' t make all that better , 17 seems pretty neat . He ' s playing tennis because it ' s fun , and he ' s still good at it . We , in the process , are still getting those ' Federer moments ' David Foster Wallace talked about . He is a gift that keeps on giving .
