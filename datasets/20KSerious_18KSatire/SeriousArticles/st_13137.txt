The most commonly discussed path involves a scenario in which early states get divided up between three or more candidates . ( For the sake of this hypothetical , let s say Cruz wins Iowa , Rubio wins New Hampshire and Trump wins South Carolina ) . Those three candidates would be well positioned to then split up states that vote in early March , when all delegates are rewarded proportionally and make up more than a third of the total 2016 delegate count , and advance to the winner take all phase of the race with somewhere around 300 to 400 delegates each . ( Rick Santorum won 245 delegates total in 2012 ) .
