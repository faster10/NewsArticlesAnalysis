Because the Patriots can deploy Edelman , tight end Rob Gronkowski and slot receiver Danny Amendola in a variety of ways to exploit weak spots , Brady was able to distribute the ball in rapid fashion with an average time of 2 . 16 seconds from snap to throw on 42 passes . Brady averaged 2 . 0 seconds when targeting Edelman when removing a 5 . 8 second scramble before a first quarter drop . And with Edelman taking some heat off Gronkowski , Brady averaged 1 . 88 seconds per throw to his All Pro tight end .
