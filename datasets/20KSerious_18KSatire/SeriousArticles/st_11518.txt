Ever since 1999 , 2000 , I ' ve been a Colts fan , " Norman said Monday night at Super Bowl 50 media day . " He was their quarterback . He was one of the main reasons I was a Colts fan . The guy was just unbelievable at what he did . He had the weapons , ( former Colts WRs ) Marvin Harrison , Reggie Wayne , Brandon Stokley , ( former Colts TE ) Dallas Clark . Every time I picked up the controller with friends , I ended up putting up 50 points . It was like P freaking M , ' he was going ham . Every time we scored , I would let them know about it .
