Thanks to Da Silva ' s passion , the school is now thriving in her childhood home and more than 200 children , most of whom are AIDS orphans , receive porridge every morning and education , free of charge . It is an effort that Da Silva funds almost entirely herself , sending 1 , 000 , about one third of her monthly paycheck , to pay the salaries of 12 teachers and the headmaster , and purchase whatever supplies she can afford . Several of her fellow nannies have even gotten involved , donating 10 a month to her foundation . Get involved : Jacaranda Foundation
