My thoughts topple over one another . Bowie can ' t be dead . No , he ' s faking his death . Facebook is rife with trending " R . I . P . Famous Person " memes that turn out to be bunk . That ' s all this is . Even better , Bowie probably launched the ruse himself . He ' s orchestrating it as commentary on the social media age and the gullibility of infotainment consumers . He ' s sitting at home with a sly grin , having a gas at the 24 7 media reacting to his latest installment in the meta realm he ' s occupied for his last two albums .
