The Patriots would have locked up the AFC ' s No . 1 seed with a Week 17 win against Miami . However , they ended up pulling Brady late and losing to a foundering team . It didn ' t seem like that big of a deal at the time , but that loss came back to haunt them Sunday . Would the Patriots have failed to convert two fourth quarter fourth downs in their own building ? Would Peyton Manning have played mistake free football in Foxborough the site of so many of his ugliest playoff moments ? Doubtful . Super Bowl winning seasons often come down to a few key moments . That regular season finale is one Bill Belichick and Co . would love to have back , and the Patriots likely will be hungrier this offseason and next season now that they won t be coming off a title .
