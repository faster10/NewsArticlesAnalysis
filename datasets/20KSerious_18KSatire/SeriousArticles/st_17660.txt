Dortmund have more points than last season , have conceded fewer Bundesliga goals , came through the hardest Champions League group ( Arsenal , Napoli , Marseille ) , earned around 25million by reaching the quarter finals , won the German Supercup that they lost to Bayern last term and , if they regain the Cup ( from which the super villains also eliminated them with a back post goal from Ernst Stavro Blofeld and a toe poke from Rosa Klebb last season ) , there will be the double joy of pleasing the 80 , 000 yellow and black clad fanatics who are travelling to the German capital , ticket or no ticket , and ruining Bayern ' s summer .
