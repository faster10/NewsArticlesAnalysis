The Golden State Warriors are not just keeping their heads down . A lot of teams that go on long stretches don ' t want to talk about the possibility of making a run at the ' 72 Lakers ' streak of 33 consecutive victories , or that they could do something historic . As I ' ve written about previously , the Warrior ' s entire approach is one big " why not ? " They ' re driven to not get caught up in the hoopla if it jeopardizes their chances of winning a second title , but if they can do that and break historic records ? Why not ?
