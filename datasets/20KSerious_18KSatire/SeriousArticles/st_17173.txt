It all seems quite silly , considering that the Warriors ' overall streak is officially recognized as 26 games , yet five postseason losses separate their four game winning streak that closed out the 2014 15 regular season and their 22 0 record this year . I guess it just speaks to how rare it is for a team to go this deep into a regular season without losing a game . The Warriors aren ' t only crushing everyone ' s soul , they ' re causing us to wonder whether the record books should be rewritten .
