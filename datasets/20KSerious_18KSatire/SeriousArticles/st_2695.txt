SISTER ACT : Serena will have a chance to exact some family revenge on Kasatkina , who beat Venus Williams in an Australian Open warm up tournament at Auckland last week . " I don ' t think it ' s going to be easy , " Serena Williams said of her night match at Rod Laver . " Any time someone is beating Venus they are more than likely playing really good . " Serena has never played Kasatkina , so will do some advance scouting . " I obviously will ask Venus what she thought of the match , and I ' m sure Patrick ( coach Patrick Mouratoglou ) will know everything about her match and stuff . He ' s really good at studying . "
