Paul George is back with a new number ( 13 ) and a new position ( power forward ) , adding the Pacers to the league s small ball movement . With Roy Hibbert , David West and Lance Stephenson gone , Indiana is no longer the defensive stalwart that can compete for an Eastern Conference title . These Pacers may actually score more behind Monta Ellis and Rodney Stuckey , but that doesn t mean they will win more . Detroit , meantime , has a point guard in place in Reggie Jackson to feed gifted forward Andre Drummond off the pick and roll . But that s about all Stan Van Gundy has to work with by way of proven talent in the Pistons strive back to respectability .
