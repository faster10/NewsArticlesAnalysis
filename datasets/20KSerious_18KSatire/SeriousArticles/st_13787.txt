So how did this all start ? I can ' t pinpoint the exact date I suddenly got interested in game shows , but family members insist it started while I was a crawling toddler . One relative joked ( I hope ) that my first complete sentence was " X gets the square , " a reference to the long running " Hollywood Squares . " When I was 6 , I was barred from watching " Family Feud " after I got caught kissing a first grade female classmate . When my long suffering teacher , Mrs Kaplan , asked me why I did that , I explained that Richard Dawson did it every night , and he didn ' t get punished .
