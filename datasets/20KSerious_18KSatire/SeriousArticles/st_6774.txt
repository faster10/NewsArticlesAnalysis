There are other forces involved in Syria and Iraq . The Syrian Kurds have become the US air force ' s favourite ally over the past year and have maybe 25 , 000 well organised fighters . They have taken half the frontier with Turkey , robbing Isis of entry and exit points . But the Kurds do not want to be used as cannon fodder by the US and Turkey is adamant that it will not allow them to advance west of the Euphrates . The Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga have also recaptured Sinjar in a well publicised attack supported by heavy US air raids , but Isis had decided not to fight to the last man there .
