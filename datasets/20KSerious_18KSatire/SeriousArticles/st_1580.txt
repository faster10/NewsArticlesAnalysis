The Gujarat assembly , during Modi s last five year term as chief minister , met , on an average , 31 days each year . During the same period , the Lok Sabha sat for an average of 66 days each year . The Left parties continue to demand that the Constitution be amended to ensure the mandatory sitting of both Houses of Parliament for at least 100 days every year . Notwithstanding his rhetoric in the public meetings , the PM s parliamentary interventions are the bare minimum . According to the Gujarat social media watch , which studied the functioning of the Gujarat assembly , Modi as chief minister spoke not more than thrice in an assembly session and twice it was to read condolence motions . Such is the democratic practice . Are we staring at the future of the Indian Parliament ?
