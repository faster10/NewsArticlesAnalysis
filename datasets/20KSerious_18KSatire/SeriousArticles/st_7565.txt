The way I expressed in my article was just sadness and exasperation that the familiarity that most people felt when they heard about Paris was not echoed when it happened in Beirut . And in many ways , I do understand it . After all , Paris , for most Westerners at least , is a more familiar city than Beirut . But at the same time , I think it also speaks of the politics and the power structures at play here . . . ? There ' s a certain hierarchy of values , that ? certain people just matter more than others . It has to do with how dispensable some bodies are , so the Arab body being more dispensable than the white body , if we want to call it that . ?
