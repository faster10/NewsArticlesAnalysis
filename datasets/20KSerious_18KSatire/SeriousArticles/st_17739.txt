Goffman : You know , at the very beginning of the season , we told Tom he had a son who we were going to play as somebody before we had been looking to cast John Noble who was older than him because we thought that would be a really interesting way to play it . And we knew this reveal , really , at the beginning of the season . It was part of our initial pitch to network president Kevin Reilly . So we shared as much of the details as we had with the cast . And there are some actors who don ' t like to know where you ' re going they just want to play it in the moment . Others like feeling where the season is going . So , Tom and Nicole , we brought them into the writers room , and they ' ve been incredibly generous with sharing the things they love about the show and their characters with us . And that helps us .
