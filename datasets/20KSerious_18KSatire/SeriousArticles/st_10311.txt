Rubio , though , will have to wait a little longer to see if GOP primary voters follow the lead of Republican politicos , establishment minded powerbrokers , and Washington pundits . The three most recent national polls ? which were conducted mostly before CNBC s Oct . 28th debate ended ? showed Rubio holding relatively steady , and definitely not in the lead . In the latest ? Wall Street Journal NBC poll ? ( conducted Oct . 25 ? 29 ) , the Florida Republican was at 11 percent , down two points from where he was two weeks earlier , the previous time those pollsters asked the question . In the latest ? Investor s Business Daily TPP survey ? ( Oct . 24 ? 29 ) , he was at 11 percent , unchanged from the same poll taken at the end of September . And the latest Ipsos Reuters poll ? ( Oct . 24 ? 28 ) had him at 6 percent , unchanged from the previous week .
