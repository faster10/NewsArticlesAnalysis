I don t think he is thinking that way , Elway said of the retirement buzz . The bottom line is that he s trying to concentrate on winning a world championship because that s what it s all about . That s what he s worked for this whole season and throughout his career and he s getting another opportunity with his fourth appearance here . Anytime we get a chance to compete for a world championship , you want your full concentration on that . Peyton has been through it enough , so that s what he s thinking about is trying to win this game . He ll have plenty of time this offseason to figure out what he wants to do . He doesn t need to be thinking about that now .
