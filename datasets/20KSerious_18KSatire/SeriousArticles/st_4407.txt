Six elections in a row , over and over and over again , California was the bulwark of the Republican vote nationally : 1968 to 1988 . In 86 the amnesty happened . After 1988 , California has never again voted Republican . You all live in Florida . I live in Texas . You want to know what Obama s looking to do ? You want to know what Harry Reid is looking to do ? You want to know what Chuck Schumer is looking to do ? Turn Florida and Texas into California . That does make someone pause for a second and think , what Republican in their right mind would support that ?
