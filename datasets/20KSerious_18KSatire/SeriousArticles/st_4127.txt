You can say that United are different from before , especially at home where opponents are now defending with numbers behind the ball , very compact and very deeply . With this being the case , United cannot play more direct or at a higher tempo because for this you need gaps and space behind or in between the lines of the opponent which are difficult to find . We can call it controlled football , we can call it patient football but so far it is very effective because they are in a good position in the league .
