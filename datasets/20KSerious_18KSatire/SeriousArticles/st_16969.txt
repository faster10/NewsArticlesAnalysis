Opponents of unionism hailed these laws as insuring a " right to work " because they encouraged workers to take a job , even one where the wages and working conditions had been negotiated by a union , without paying the dues necessary to sustain the labor organization .

Then and now they denounced " compulsory unionism " and the " labor bosses " who sought to live high on the hog on member dues . In this imagining , it was the union , not the employer , who oppressed the workers .
