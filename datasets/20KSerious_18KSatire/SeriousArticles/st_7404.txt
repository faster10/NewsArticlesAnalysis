The night proceeded in a loose , wild blur . Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill took to the stage next , with Hill wearing a bear hood and pretending to be the infamous ursine in The Revenant , who apparently has a very filthy mouth . Hill was the first presenter of the night to be bleeped but not the last : Gael Garcia Bernal , Jaimie Alexander , Amy Schumer , and Alejandro Gonz lez I ? rritu would also curse on air before the night was through , as further proof that the Globes are the R rated awards show and no one there takes them that seriously . ( Only a heathen would curse at the Oscars . )
