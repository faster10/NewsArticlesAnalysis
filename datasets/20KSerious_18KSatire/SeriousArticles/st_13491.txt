Alabama QB Jake Coker : In most cases , the quarterback is the most important player on the offense . That s not the case with Alabama , though , not when the Crimson Tide have a Heisman Trophy candidate at running back in Derrick Henry . But Florida is going to put as many it can in the box to try and slow down Henry , which means it will be up to Coker to make plays through the air . It s also on Coker to protect the football . When you have a defense as good as Alabama s , the last thing you want to do is give the other team the ball with a short field .
