Completely controlled by Moscow , the republics ' authorities would be in charge of all elections within their territories . A permanent bloc of seats in the Ukrainian parliament would be set aside for them , giving them ( that is , Russia ) de facto veto power over Ukraine ' s key political , security and foreign policy choices . Finally , there would be no restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over the Russo Ukrainian border and no end to the flow of Russian military and civilian supplies into Ukraine . With these arrangements in place , the Kremlin would be able to re ignite the conflict instantaneously whenever it did not like what Kiev is doing or , more importantly , whenever Russia ' s domestic political situation called for another round of propaganda induced patriotic hysteria and anti West paranoia .
