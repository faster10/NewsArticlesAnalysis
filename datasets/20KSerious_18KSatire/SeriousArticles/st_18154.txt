The ministers will examine new proposals , including a ban on some semi automatic weapons and a guarantee that no private individual can own one , even if it has been permanently deactivated . At least one officially deactivated weapon was put back into service in Belgium and used in the attacks in Paris in January . Also on the list are tighter rules to prevent the purchase of arms or ammunition over the Internet stricter conditions on collectors to limit the risk their guns might be sold to criminals common EU standards for marking weapons so they are easier to trace and better information exchanges so a person banned from buying a firearm in one country can ' t get one by crossing a border .
