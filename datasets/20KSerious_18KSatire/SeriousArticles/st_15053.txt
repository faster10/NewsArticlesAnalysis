There haven t been many surveys measuring public opinion about Cruz s eligibility since Trump entered the discussion into the mainstream last week . But one that came out on Tuesday , from the Huffington Post and YouGov , shows that Cruz is in decent shape to weather the attacks for now . The survey is good for a laugh : 53 percent of Republicans aren t sure whether President Obama , who was born in the United States , is an American citizen , while 70 percent don t have any doubt that Ted Cruz , who was born in Canada , is a citizen and eligible to serve as president . We ll see if those numbers stick or if this becomes a bigger problem for Cruz as the conversation continues .
