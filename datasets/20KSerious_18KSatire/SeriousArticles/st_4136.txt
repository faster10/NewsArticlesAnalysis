Fury goes on the attack and lands the uppercut . The only question , surely , is whether the judges have seen enough point scoring punches ? Klitschko lands a massive right hook in the corner though and Fury is wobbling . Klitschko smells blood and goes on the attack , trying to put his man down . Fury is resolute though and stays up as we enter the final 30 . Twice more Klitschko lands hits an uppercut and a jab . The bell goes and both raise their arms . No doubt that ' s Klitschko ' s round but I reckon it ' s Fury ' s fight .
