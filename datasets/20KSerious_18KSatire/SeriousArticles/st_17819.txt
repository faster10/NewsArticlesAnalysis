The hardest thing to do in sports is to repeat . Repeat a championship run or repeat simply as a champion of a single event . I truly believe that Jordan Spieth is motivated to be even greater . I also think , just like this month , he will play tournaments with money attached which will make scheduling tough . And I have no problem with that . But I think he struggles to adjust and will allow McIlroy to step in and win another major and take the top spot . It won ' t be easy , but Rory will win in a tight race .
