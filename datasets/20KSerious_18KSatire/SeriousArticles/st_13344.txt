Dan Lydiate is heading home to Wales after the November international window a less than startling development which was confirmed by his Parisian club , Racing Metro . It is likely that he will re surface in Swansea with the Ospreys , on a dual contract with the WRU . His return home makes sense , as the move across the Channel has been an ill fated exercise . In his pomp , Lydiate is a Lion and a formidable Test player , but he has been under valued by his French employers . Warren Gatland will welcome the blindside flanker back into the Welsh game with open arms , knowing that there is ample time to repair his confidence and restore his game to its peak before next year ' s World Cup .
