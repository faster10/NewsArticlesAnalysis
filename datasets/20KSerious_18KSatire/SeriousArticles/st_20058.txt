To these people , I say , " Stand Up . And stand up now . " We have been finding cures for diseases since the beginning of time . Polio was decades old before the March of Dimes movement , initially broadcast on radio , galvanized a country to find a cure . To those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living , I say healthy people get cancer , too . And to those conspiracy theorists out there , I am reminded of something Stand Up to Cancer ' s co founder Laura Ziskin used to say : " The people who work at drug companies get cancer , too . So do their mothers , wives , husbands , sons and daughters . They want it to end , like the rest of us . "
