Watson gets most of the praise , and rightfully so , but head coach Dabo Swinney has ? a few standout performers on offense . Gallman is among the nation s best running backs , ranking 15th with 1 , 482 yards on the ground . Wide receiver Artavis Scott s 89 receptions tie him for 14th in the country , and tight end Jordan Leggett could play a key role on Monday , having found his way into the end zone seven times . Leggett could be an important target against Alabama , who has allowed just 11 touchdowns in 25 red zone opportunities .
