The Vikings finished the regular season with the 29th ranked offense based on yardage ? fourth in rushing and 31st in passing . Jerome Bettis then had the original Jeremy Hill moment , fumbling with Pittsburgh trying to run out the clock , and Nick Harper ran the ball back to the Colts 42 before being tripped up by Roethlisberger . That would have been the case had Walsh s 27 yard attempt been good . On the ensuing drive , Steven Hauschka made a field goal from 46 yards out to give the Seahawks the lead .
