Governments are actually already pushing manufacturers to provide this level of detail using their purchasing power rather than their legislative power . Government purchasers across North America , for example , are demanding safer , more environmentally preferable cleaning products , papers , paints , vehicles , building products , office equipment and computers . Government purchasers in New York , Illinois , California , Minnesota , and other places , for example , require cleaning products to meet the Green Seal or EcoLogo cleaning product standards . As a result , those products are becoming more widely available for consumers too .
