' At Alimento , we believe a great meal comes together not from the effort of any single person , but from the successful cooperation of a team of people , from servers and hosts , to cooks and bussers . Nevertheless , traditional tipping has created a very sizeable gap between the earnings of cooks and servers , and current State law prohibits restaurants from sharing servers ' tips with kitchen staff . Rather than imposing a mandatory ' service fee ' or ' kitchen surcharge ' as many are doing , we ' d like to leave the choice in your , the diner ' s , hands . If you ' re perfectly happy with tipping as usual , there ' s no need for you to do anything differently . But , if you ' d like to send a little love to the lads and ladies hustling in the back , we ' d be honored to provide you the means to do so . All such tips will go to line cooks and other kitchen staff no one in management will participate . L . A . has many great restaurants , and we ' re thrilled you ' ve chosen to dine with us today . We will continue to work hard to bring you the best dining experience we possibly can . Thanks for your ongoing support ! '
