But I also want to hasten to add that if Obama had lived up to his instincts to actually do what he s done now , today seven years back instead , he would have lived up to the tradition of the greatest heroes that he admires . Here s the irony . Obama admires people like former President John Kennedy . He admires people like Martin Luther King Jr . Now those are very bold people . If you read the history of these extraordinary American leaders , you will see that they were changing history . They were literally standing up with a flood coming down and saying , I m not going to budge , I m going to stand here . So if he had taken that route , he would have had a major impact , but seven years back . So in that sense , this is too little , too late . But my answer to that is : Better late than never .
