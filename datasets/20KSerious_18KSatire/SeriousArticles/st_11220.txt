It ' s hard to overstate how important Cruz ' s fundraising is to his chances . Cruz is positioned ideologically like lots of social conservative outsider candidates Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum of the recent past . But , unlike those people , Cruz has tens of millions of dollars sitting in a super PAC ready to be spent on him when he starts moving ( or to be spent to get him moving ) . Cruz ' s money should also allow him to stay in the race when the field begins to winnow in earnest . And remember ( per Point ? No . ? 3 above ) that he is the single best articulator of the current mood of the GOP base .
