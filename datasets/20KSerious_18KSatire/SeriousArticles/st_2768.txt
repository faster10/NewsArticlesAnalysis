Protesters marched north on Michigan Avenue in response to the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting dash cam video release . Within seconds he is struck by bullets and crumples to the ground , his body jerking as he is hit by additional rounds of gunfire . McDonald spins around and falls to the pavement as Van Dyke keeps shooting . He also wants a special prosecutor appointed to the case , complaining that Cook County State ' s Attorney Anita Alvarez took too long to file a murder charge in the shooting , which happened 13 months ago .
