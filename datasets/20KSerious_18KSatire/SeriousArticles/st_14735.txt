Katie TePas , a senior policy adviser and Alaska ' s " Choose Respect " coordinator , said Alaska ' s backlog of forensic evidence " has been drastically reduced " in recent years . " I do not think we are in dire straits , unlike some other states , " she said . Orin Dym , the forensic laboratory manager at the Alaska Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory , said his statewide lab currently has 141 " unassigned requests " for sexual assault kit analysis . It ' s possible , he said , law enforcement agencies have additional backlogs they never sent to his lab in Anchorage for analysis . The governor ' s fiscal year 2015 budget would include 115 , 000 to speed up the processing of the evidence , TePas and Dym said .
