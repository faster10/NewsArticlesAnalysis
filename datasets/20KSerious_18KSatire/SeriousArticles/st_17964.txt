We have nine airports that were built with tens of billions of dollars , though courtesy of NATO ISAF . We have moved to a project of creating in every single one of these airports , a special economic zone . The initial estimates are that between 2016 and 2032 , we will be able to earn the revenue of 32 billion dollars from these airports . Afghanistan also , in terms of generation of energy , is finally moving from talking about our immense natural resources to the actual realization . The first hydro dam called India Afghanistan Friendship Dam at Salma is going reach fruition next spring and we thank our partners . Next year , we are going to be able to generate 240 MW of power all from renewable , 42 from hydro , 100 from natural gas , and a 100 from solar . Our highway program will create the possibility in our railways for Herat to become the second city in Afghanistan to be linked to the Iranian system and then on to the Turkmenistan system . And , completion of the ring road will open the way for Iran to Tajikistan direct contact and on to China . These set of possibilities speak of the potential that is there but also , what I d like to respectfully bring and ask for studies is lost opportunities . 36 of our people live below poverty line , 1 . 25 if the line were 2 a day , almost 70 of our people . Poverty elimination is our most significant goal and I m convinced that regional cooperation could allow us to have the types of rates of growth that allow us to tackle the most fundamental weakness , which is the poverty and exclusion of three majorities : women , youth , and the poor . So , I urge the Secretariat of the Istanbul Process to actually document the costs of forgone opportunities in regional cooperation and the advantages that accrue from this .
