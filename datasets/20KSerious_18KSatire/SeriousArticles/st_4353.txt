This team taught all America s children that playing like a girl means you re a badass . Perhaps I shouldn t have used that phrase . Playing like a girl means being the best , Obama said . It means drawing the largest TV audience for a soccer match ? men or women s ? in American history . It means wearing our nation s crest on your jersey , taking yourself and your country to the top of the world . That s what American women do . That s what American girls do . That s why we celebrate this team .
