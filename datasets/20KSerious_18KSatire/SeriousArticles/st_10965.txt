It adopted regulations to limit the majority of families to having one child ? though there were numerous exceptions . For example , minorities , fishermen and some handicapped people were allowed to have more than one child local officials had substantial discretion to allow second births . Families who weren t exempt from the policy had to pay fines if they had a second or third child ? or face other punishments . Many who violated the rules were harassed , lost their jobs or even had their children taken from them . Many critics of the policy have called its implementation inhumane .
