The end result is that Americans pay more . The Obama administration ' s budget will cost every American nearly 2 , 000 next year . The figure rises by hundreds of dollars when one accounts for homeland security , payments to veterans , and the few billion dollars tucked away in the Department of Energy for the nation ' s bloated nuclear arsenal . All told , every American will likely shell out more than 2 , 700 on spending classified as national defense . That is at least 2 times what the British spend , five times more than what the Germans spend , and six times what the Japanese spend .
