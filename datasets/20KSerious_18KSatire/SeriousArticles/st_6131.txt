With the announcement of both Monica Bellucci and L a Seydoux as Bond s latest female companions , speculation was rife over who would be the lead and who might be a villain . Poor Bellucci , initially heralded by many as a refreshing choice given her age , was sorely underused . Bond kills her husband and then sleeps with her after his funeral while she begs him to stay for more . Seydoux initially appears to have more strength but ultimately becomes yet another woman who wants nothing more than to have sex with 007 . Which makes the oddly romantic final act seem a bit surprising , with Bond softening more than ever and the two disappearing into the sunset . . .
