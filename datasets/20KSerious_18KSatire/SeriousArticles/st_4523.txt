Although I ' m not in Nigeria physically right now , the story about these girls has haunted me from day one . Whenever I read headlines about the missing schoolgirls , there ' s always this feeling of guilt that hovers over me . It ' s hugely unfair that I live comfortably in a first world country , in a nation that affords me the freedoms and luxuries that I can ' t imagine living without and those girls , whose only wish is to get an education , have to live in a constant state of fear . That ' s their life every single day , and had my parents not made the sacrifices they did , that could easily have been my life too . My heart bleeds for them .
