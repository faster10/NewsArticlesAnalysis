There is no doubt that Islam is a religion of peace which forbids terrorism causing the loss of the lives of innocent civilians . But as shown by our own experience in Pakistan , this has not prevented a tiny minority among the Muslims to hijack the fair name of Islam to serve its sinister motives through acts of terrorism . It is , therefore , incumbent upon Muslim leaders , religious scholars , opinion makers and people at large to take all possible steps to defeat terrorism , overcome religious extremism , and highlight the teachings of Islam enjoining moderation and tolerance . If we expect foreign countries to look after their Muslim minorities and safeguard their fundamental rights , it is only fair that we should leave no stone unturned in ensuring the security of the non Muslims amongst us . Such an approach would not only be in our best interest but also in accord with the teachings of Islam . Finally , no strategy to combat terrorism would succeed unless it includes steps to remove the root causes of this menace .
