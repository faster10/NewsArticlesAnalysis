As for Shakira ' s approach , she views it as very involved . " Besides being a singer , I ' m also a producer and writer . Once I ' m in the recording studio , I am so hands on , " she said . " While I ' m coaching my team I tend to focus on the detail . I don ' t know if it ' s maybe because of the female condition , but men are more focused on the general aspects , and women tend to sort of focus on details a lot . And so when I ' m giving directions to my contestants I ' m particularly focused on details . "
