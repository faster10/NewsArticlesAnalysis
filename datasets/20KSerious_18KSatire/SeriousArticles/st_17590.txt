I know some cops . You probably do too . We know them , but we don t really know cops . Maybe nobody does . There are infinite variables of their personalities and experiences . Yet depending upon the TV shows or movies we choose , we may think we know more than we do . Do you favor heart of gold cops ? Hard bitten cops ? Laconic cops ? Cops avenging the loss of a partner or wife or girlfriend or child or informer or brother or sister or parent or gun ? Rogue cops ? Loner cops ? New breed cops ? Dramas and departments have them all .
