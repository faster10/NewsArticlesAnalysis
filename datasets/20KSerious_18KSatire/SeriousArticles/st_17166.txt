" Dragon " is a rarity among King ' s early works : A stand alone novel that hasn ' t been previously adapted into a live action feature . In fact , among King ' s pre 1990 books that were first published under his own name , only his fantasy titles ( " Eyes of the Dragon , " " The Talisman " and the " Dark Tower " books ) haven ' t yet been adapted , though all have been in development at one point or another . And given HBO ' s success with its fantasy hit " Game of Thrones , " the timing for " Dragon " couldn ' t be better .
