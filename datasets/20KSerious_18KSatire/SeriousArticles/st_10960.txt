McCarron was serviceable for the Bengals , going 23 for 41 for 212 yards and a touchdown . The former Crimson Tide QB also threw an interception and lost a fumble , but keep in mind that the game was played in a driving rain storm . Halfback Jeremy Hill cannot be considered an elite running back with a very pedestrian 50 yards on 12 carries , including a huge game changing fumble late in the fourth quarter . Hill had 38 rushing yards come on one carry , so he had 12 yards on 11 carries otherwise .
