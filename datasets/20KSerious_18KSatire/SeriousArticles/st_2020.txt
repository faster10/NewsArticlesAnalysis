Because the lines are blurred , we need judges who are educated and aware enough to see through the subterfuge of sexism and racism , who do the right thing whether in Steubenville , Billings , or my hometown . Whatever else is going on in girls ' lives , whatever media messages we all receive about the commodification of their sexuality , we need to send a clear message that rape and sexual assault are crimes for a reason , that justice has nothing to do with how mature a girl looks or acts and everything to do with her suffering and her right to human dignity .
