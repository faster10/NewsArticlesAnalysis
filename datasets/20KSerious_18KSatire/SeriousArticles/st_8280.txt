The point people often miss about diversity is that , in addition to filling sociological ideals , it makes business sense . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences didn ' t just snub deserving candidates with more all white fields for this year ' s Oscars , they hampered their product . Yes , Oscar night is a way to reward good work , but it generates revenue because it ' s a television show . " Straight Outta Compton " sold more than 19 million tickets and featured compelling acting performances from Jason Mitchell ( Eazy E ) and O ' Shea Jackson Jr . ( Ice Cube ) . Why wouldn ' t you want to give those 19 million fans of the movie a reason to watch the Oscars ?
