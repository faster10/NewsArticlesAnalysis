AMERICANS VIEW ISLAM NEGATIVELY HuffPollster : " The recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino , California and Republican front runner Donald Trump ' s subsequent call for a ' total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States ' further stoked worries about rising Islamophobia . Just 17 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of Islam , according to the poll , which was also conducted after the San Bernardino shooting but prior to Trump ' s comments . Fifty eight percent have an unfavorable view of the religion , while 25 percent are unsure . The results are similar to those of a March HuffPost YouGov poll . . . . Underlying the apparent lack of change , however , is an uptick in the number of people who now consider themselves strongly anti Islamic . The shift is especially pronounced among Republicans and political independents . " HuffPost
