" When you ' re 14 , " 15 year old Luci says . " It seems like the rest of the world is against you , especially if , as the judge described Morales , you ' re ' a troubled kid . ' I can get that , and I can see why Cherice found refuge in a relationship with her teacher . When I was her age , there was this one teacher who everyone at my school adored . He saw potential in me that I was too insecure to see in myself . I looked like I could be in college . He treated me like I was grown up , so I thought I was more mature than I really was . But that ' s the thing : Looking older than you are in no way equals being emotionally mature . "
