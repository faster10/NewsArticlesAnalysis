Rubio remains the establishment s best , and perhaps only real hope . Yes , he has been unable to consolidate the establishment vote ? perhaps better defined as the non anti establishment vote given the current mood of the electorate ? despite the early hype , but that is as much his failing as it is the establishment s . A handful of lawmakers endorsed Rubio this fall when he looked to be on the rise , but what was supposed to turn into a flood never grew beyond a trickle . According to FiveThirtyEight s endorsement tracker ? which weights the endorsements of congressmen , senators , and governors ? Rubio still trails Bush in the endorsement race , in large part because a historic number of lawmakers and governors remain on the sidelines at this point in the race . It s pretty difficult to rally establishment minded voters to your cause when your establishment colleagues are sitting on their hands . Meanwhile , Rubio s been left carrying the burden of the establishment tag without enjoying any of the benefits that come with it . The Republican Party could change that tomorrow if a few dozen elected officials called a press conference to endorse Rubio , who is pretty much the Capitol Hill homecoming king of the GOP field .
