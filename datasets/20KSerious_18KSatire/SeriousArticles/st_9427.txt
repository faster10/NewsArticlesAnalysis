The next three years proceeded in the same way : We spent the first half of the year being scared by threats of his being left back , predictions of his never graduating high school if he didn ' t read more , even becoming a " troubled teen . " Then with spring came the state tests , which he passed , literally , by a point or two . I was mystified , considering that he flunked nearly every in class test . I asked how this was possible , and never got a straight answer . We pleaded for him to go to summer school , and the answer was always " He ' s fine ! Summer school is only for the kids who don ' t pass the tests . See you next year . "
