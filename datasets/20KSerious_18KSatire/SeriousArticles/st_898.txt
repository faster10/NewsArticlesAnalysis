This is not the first time the Kruger , as it is popularly known , has been hit by floods . It took 10 months to repair the damage caused by rains in 2000 . Mabunda says this time , disaster management was more prepared and so were the park ' s buildings . " Our tourism facilities stood the test of the floods . The embankments and walls withstood the impact . The only problem we have now is water supply to the camps , which is a problem we are working on . We are also limiting day visitors in order to cope better . "
