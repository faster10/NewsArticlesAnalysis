Biskupic : She has set herself apart she ' s set up chambers on the third floor when most chambers are a floor below . But Sotomayor does have more of a " separate floor " mentality . She ' s out among the people much more vigorously than any of her colleagues . She is more willing to set herself from her more liberal colleagues , in a way that Justice Elena Kagan hasn ' t at all , yet . Just as Sotomayor sees herself as operating as one among nine , Justice Kagan operates trying to build coalition among those nine . Justice Sotomayor has distinguished herself with passionate statements when her fellow justices refuse to take up defendants ' appeals . But she also has been willing to separate herself from the other liberals in cases . Justice Sotomayor , in contrast , is more of a solo operator engrossed in her own determinations on a case . And perhaps less interested in getting others to adopt them . I think that she ' s also been blunt . Her bluntness overall separated her from the others . She talks a lot about how she was different and I think that makes her very approachable and human to the people who come out to greet her when she gives speeches or talks about her book . As much as it makes her very approachable and human beyond the marble walls , it makes her different to the justices because they are a little bit all of the same model . As much as they differ on the law , they have a certain sameness in their personalities .
