Many Americans may not even remember Emmett Till , a precocious 14 year old black teenager from Chicago who went to visit his family in Mississippi . He allegedly flirted with a white woman in a store , and the woman ' s husband and his brother later went to the home where Till was staying , pulled him out of his bed , took him somewhere and beat him to a pulp , gouged out his eye , blew the back of his head away with a gun , attached a cotton gin with barbed wire around his neck and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River .
