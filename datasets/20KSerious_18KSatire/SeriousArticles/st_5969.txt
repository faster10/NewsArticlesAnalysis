Seattle and Kansas City are the NFL s hottest teams right now , and as much as momentum has a funny way of shifting , I think this postseason sees the proverbial teams you don t want to face winning out . Right now , I see them as the two most complete teams in all facets . Carolina could get undone by an uneven run game and inconsistent receivers , and the Patriots are losing the war of attrition . Seahawks vs . Chiefs in Super Bowl 50 is a great matchup in so many ways if it happens , but I know Seattle can t possibly keep this offensive pace going through four road games .
