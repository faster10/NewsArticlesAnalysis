Ganguli : His confidence is at a completely different level now . You have to remember that before that first start , he didn t have the full backing of his coach , Bill O Brien . O Brien made him the starter and then immediately said it could change . Hoyer was constantly looking over his shoulder , which wasn t an ideal situation for him . He was tight in that first start , and it showed , but once he started playing to take back his starting role , he was much more confident . There was sort of a nothing to lose attitude for Hoyer , and he played better with it . It has helped , too , that O Brien has publicly declared full confidence in Hoyer as the starter .
