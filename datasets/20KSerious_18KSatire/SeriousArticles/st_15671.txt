Osweiler ' s superior mobility and agility will open up Kubiak ' s playbook , and sources said to expect more of the moving pockets , bootlegs and waggles that have been a staple of his offense , and much more situations with the quarterback under center in general and not in the pistol or shotgun ( which the Broncos are hoping helps improve a struggling run game ) . They aren ' t looking for Osweiler to excel as much as to limit turnovers , make some plays on third down , sustain some drives and keep the defense in position to secure victory . Should he do that , Manning ' s stint on the sidelines could be prolonged as he still chases the all time regular season victory mark .
