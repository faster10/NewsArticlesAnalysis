Should Glass and the Wilpons get credit for what Dayton Moore and Sandy Alderson were able to do ? Not really . Or at least not any more than any executive should get credit for the accomplishments of the people they hire . But baseball history is rotten with teams that went nowhere due to bad owners making bad decisions and kneecapping their baseball operations department though either meddling or parsimony or both . That ? Glass and the Wilpons have managed to get the heck out of the way and to allow the Mets and Royals to get out of that particular historical pile is worth noting .
