Bring NextGen to New York first : LaGuardia , along with JFK and Newark , is the most delayed airport traffic control system in the country . Every day , our airspace contributes to one half to three quarters of all delays around the country . The solution is NextGen , the new satellite based air traffic control system . Replacing the old 1960s radar technology means fewer delays on the ground and in the air . But the FAA has to step up and make it happen in New York . Right now , the federal government is years behind in developing NextGen , and the FAA wants to roll it out in smaller markets first , despite the tremendous impact the New York airspace has on national delays .
