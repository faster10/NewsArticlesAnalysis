It is . Some of the violence is grindingly slow : rising seas that gradually erase whole nations , and droughts that kill many thousands . Some of the violence is terrifyingly fast : storms with names such as Katrina and Haiyan that steal thousands of lives in a single roiling event . When governments and corporations knowingly fail to act to prevent catastrophic warming , that is an act of violence . It is a violence so large , so global and inflicted against so many temporalities simultaneously ( ancient cultures , present lives , future potential ) that there is not yet a word capable of containing its monstrousness . And using acts of violence to silence the voices of those who are most vulnerable to climate violence is yet more violence . ?
