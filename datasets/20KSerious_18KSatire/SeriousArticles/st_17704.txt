Orman : No . It ' s not a good time to get in with brand new money . I would let these markets kind of wash themselves out . On the other hand , if you ' re investing in a 401k every month with small amounts of money , that ' s OK as long as you don ' t need the money for 10 , 15 , 20 years . If you just got an inheritance and you have 50 , 000 , should you be putting it in the stock market now ? Are you kidding ? These are the markets that you just sit on the sidelines and wait on the sidelines and stay away from them until everything works out . iReport . com : Are you worried about the Wall Street crisis ?
