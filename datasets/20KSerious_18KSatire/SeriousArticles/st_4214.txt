Grease : Live will be on Fox on January 31st between 7 and 10 pm . If Hough has that frothy Newton John ian charm , if Tveit can nail the retro Travolta pelvic thrust ( We made out under the dock ! ) , it will be clear right here . Grease is the way we are feeling , and oh my , are we ever feeling this Grease Is the Word cover by Jessie J for the upcoming Grease : Live special . Oh , my goodness , congratulations . Julianne Hough reveals that she was close to tears when she found out she d be stepping into Olivia s shoes . I started to cry . I didn t even prepare anything , Hough says of the experience .
