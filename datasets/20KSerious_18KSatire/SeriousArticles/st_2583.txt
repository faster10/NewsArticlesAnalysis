Industry and Canadian officials have conceded that rail is not a substitute for Keystone XL in terms of capacity . Not only that , rail is significantly more expensive . The State Department estimates that shipping tar sands by pipeline costs about 8 to 10 per barrel . Make the switch to rail , and the price shoots up to 15 to 17 per barrel , with some estimates as high as 31 . For investors , that means rail is only a short term solution to get the tar sands to market , not a long term economical alternative to new pipelines .
