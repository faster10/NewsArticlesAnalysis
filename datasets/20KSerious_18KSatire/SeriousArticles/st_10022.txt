Due to fear of the Zika virus , the government of El Salvador has asked women to delay pregnancy until 2018 ? almost two years from now . On Thursday , World Health Officials declared that the virus was spreading explosively . Zika symptoms are fairly mild for most people but the disease can be devastating for developing fetuses , resulting in babies born with tiny heads , a condition called microcephaly . ( The connection between Zika and microcephaly hasn t been established conclusively , but the evidence seems strong . ) In a bit of cosmic cruelty , Zika has taken hold in South and Central America , where , thanks to the influence of the Catholic Church , abortion access is highly limited . In fact , El Salvador is known to have the world s strictest abortion laws in some cases , women have been locked up after having a miscarriage . No wonder the government doesn t want women to get pregnant . It doesn t want a generation of microcephalic babies on its hands ? and it doesn t want women demanding increased access to abortion . El Salvador s request may be extreme , but it has some company for instance , Jamaica has also suggested that women wait 6 12 months before getting pregnant .
