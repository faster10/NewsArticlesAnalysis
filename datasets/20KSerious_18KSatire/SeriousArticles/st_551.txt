ABOUT OREGON STATE ( 12 7 , 3 5 Pac 12 ) : Freshman guard Stephen Thompson Jr . scored a team high 14 points against Arizona State , but the Beavers fell into a tie for ninth in the Pac 12 after failing to build on their 15 point win over USC . It s just disappointing , coach Wayne Tinkle told reporters . We had great momentum at home , and then to not have the same focus and intensity ( against Arizona State ) is puzzling . One bright spot has been the recent play of freshmen forwards Drew Eubanks and Tres Tinkle , with the coach ' s son averaging a team high 15 points since moving into the starting lineup three games ago .
