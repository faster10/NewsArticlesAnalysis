Walker , though , doesn t seem willing : Just because a documentary on TV says something doesn t mean that s actually what the evidence shows , Walker told Fox Tuesday .

There is a system in the judicial system by which individuals can petition the courts to get relief like others have done in the past that shows that someone might actually be innocent . But I am not going to override a system that is already put in place .
