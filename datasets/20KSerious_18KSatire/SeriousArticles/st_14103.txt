As the game unfolded yesterday at Valley Parade , we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live . It ' s everything the FA Cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about . We are speaking to the FA about whether we can change this in the future , but understand it ' s tricky for them . Clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing , policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for TV companies to confirm their selections . But we hope there ' s a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday .
