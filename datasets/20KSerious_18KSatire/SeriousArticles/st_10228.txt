Once dubbed the " sack master , " Strahan has transformed himself into such a daytime TV media darling you would think he was born to co host ABC ' s " Live With Kelly Michael . " But even he had to decide when to quit the game before it got the best of him . It took 15 years . I will never forget how hobbled Strahan looked one early morning when an ESPN crew showed up at his door to do a " day in life " story on his off day . Bruised and still bloody that morning , he could barely get out of bed .
