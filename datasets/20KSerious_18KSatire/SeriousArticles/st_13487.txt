The Patriots might get tackle Sebastian Vollmer ( concussion ) , right guard Tre Jackson ( left knee ) and tackle Marcus Cannon ( toe ) back on the field tonight , which will make for some interesting lineup calls . Specifically , what will they do at tackle ? Cameron Fleming has probably outperformed Cannon this season , and though Vollmer is the coaches preferred option on the right side , he has to offer Tom Brady more comfort on his blind side . They ll probably rotate , but the starting group will be noteworthy . It looks like David Andrews will remain at center , so that means Bryan Stork , Josh Kline , Shaq Mason and Jackson will be in the mix at guard . The Pats prefer to dress seven linemen , so Jackson or Cannon could still be inactive even if they re healthy enough to play .
