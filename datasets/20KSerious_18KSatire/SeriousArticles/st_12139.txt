We pass Bonhams Butterfields , where OJ ' s Heisman Trophy was auctioned off for 230 , 000 , and the Laugh Factory , where comedian Michael Richards went off on a racist rant and his career crumbled . We gawk at Cedars Sinai Medical Center , where Julia Roberts gave birth , where Notorious B . I . G . and Elizabeth Taylor died , and where Britney Spears took an involuntary spin through the psych ward . We peer up at the high rise Sierra Towers and learn from our all knowing TMZ guide that resident Elton John shelled out 3 million for an additional condo . . . just for his baby !
