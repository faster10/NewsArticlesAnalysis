Think about when a hospital , school , or office building is erected . There is a construction manager who makes sure things are being done as they should be . You want someone who does the same thing for you . It ' s especially important if you ' re having the house built . Be sure you don ' t hire an inspector your real estate agent recommends . Recent reports show that 70 of people do this . Agents suggest only those inspectors who they know will not kill their deal , and that is not in your best interest . You want someone who will kill the deal if the house is not in good shape .
