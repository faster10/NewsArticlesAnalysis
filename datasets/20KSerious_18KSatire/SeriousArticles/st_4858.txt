" This painting ' The Blue Room ' is very important in ( Picasso ' s ) early work . It ' s considered an early Blue Period painting , " Patricia Favero , associate conservator at the Phillips , said of the period early in the artist ' s career when he produced often melancholy , mostly monochromatic paintings in shades of blue . " To find this painting underneath which we think was painted in the same year , just earlier in the year and it ' s completely different in style it gives us some insight into Picasso ' s development over the course of that year .
