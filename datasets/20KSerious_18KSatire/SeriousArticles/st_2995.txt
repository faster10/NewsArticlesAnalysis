We all have 83 year old Edith Windsor to thank for in pushing the issue of same sex marriage equality on to the national front . Edie and her partner Thea were together for 40 years . How many marriages do you know that have lasted that long ? But when Thea died in 2009 , Edie was hit with a 363 , 000 federal estate tax bill because as a same sex couple they were not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction . Are we really a nation that says it is fair and just to demand Edie pay a 363 , 000 penalty because she is gay ?
