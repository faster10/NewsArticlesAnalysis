The Cardinals also have a very tenacious defense that is known for sacking the QB often ( Rodgers was sacked 8 times in the last regular season matchup ) . Even though the Cardinals are playing on the road and have a 5 9 record against the Panthers over the years , this is the strongest team they have ever had , one with the deepest depth in the NFL this year . Needless to say , they ' ll need to be in perfect form to pull out the win this weekend . But , with Palmer vying for a Super Bowl appearance , and a veteran defense waiting to take Newton to the turf , do not expect this to be a one sided affair . My prediction : Cardinals win 35 32 .
