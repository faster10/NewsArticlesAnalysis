Today , Luna ' s teacher read them " Fireboat " the story of the John J . Harvey , a powerful 1931 retired Fire Department vessel called into action on September 11 to ferry away survivors and fight the fires . I remember that old , sad boat and how it rallied that day , pumping water for 80 hours when the fireplugs went dry . Her teacher said it was the only thing that seemed age appropriate . They wondered why someone would fly planes into buildings if they knew they were going to die . The teacher said that made zero sense to them . Then school ended and it was a beautiful day again .
