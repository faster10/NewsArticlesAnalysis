The state party has so far refused to budge on the issue of further transparency and says that the current results will stand . For its part , Team Bernie is not formally contesting the results , though it says it is doing everything it can to double check the official tallies with its Iowa staff . The campaign has also called for the state party to release the raw vote totals ? something it typically has not done . Unlike the Iowa GOP caucus , which is relatively straightforward , the Democratic version involves caucusgoers physically arranging themselves around a room in order to signal support for a candidate . The process can be time consuming and incredibly chaotic ? and occasionally end in a coin toss . ( Meanwhile , since caucusgoers can shift their votes to a second candidate if their first choice doesn t reach a certain threshold , the raw vote totals might tell us different things depending on during which round they were recorded . ) At the end of the night , each precinct then divvies up a predetermined amount of county delegates between the eligible candidates , and those delegates are then translated into what are known as state delegate equivalents . ( The county delegates go on to select state delegates at a later date , and those delegates ultimately select yet more delegates for the national convention . ) So , uh , yeah , it s confusing .
