Here ' s the disconcerting thing if you ' re a Cardinals fan , though : The Cardinals posted the league ' s best QBR on offense this season , and they were the third best passing attack in the league when Palmer made his way outside the pocket , but he rarely made it out there . The Cards threw just 38 passes from outside the pocket all season . That was 6 . 9 percent of their pass attempts in 2015 , the fourth lowest rate in football . Only the Steelers , Patriots and Chargers got outside less frequently . In a possibly related note , the starting quarterbacks for three of those four teams have undergone ACL surgery during their professional careers ( Ben Roethlisberger is the exception , and he suffered an MCL sprain earlier this season ) . It doesn ' t seem like an easy fix for the Cardinals , given how they play , but it ' s the right way to go after Carolina .
