The question arises : " How did a professionally trained crew manage to screw up so badly ? " The answer is it ' s very easy to do . Take the accidental landing of a C 17 at a small Florida airport in 2012 , for example . The crew ' s intended airport was MacDill Air Force Base , but it instead touched down the giant jet on the much , much shorter , 100 foot wide runway a few miles away . Military personnel had to work for hours after the mix up to lighten the airplane ' s load so it could take off from the short strip .
