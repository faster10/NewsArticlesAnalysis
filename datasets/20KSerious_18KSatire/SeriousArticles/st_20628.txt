Turning to the factors that have been holding down growth , as I already noted , the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar , as well as weak growth in some foreign economies , has restrained the demand for U . S . exports over the past year . In addition , lower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector . I anticipate that the drag on U . S . economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of years as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is completed .
