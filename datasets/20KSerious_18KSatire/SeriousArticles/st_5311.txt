This particular dynamic of the race is similar on the Democratic side . Bernie Sanders supporters have enthusiasm on their side ( obviously ) , but Hillary Clinton has organization on hers . Enthusiasm counts a great deal in the Iowa caucuses , but then so does getting people out to vote . Again , a very high turnout on caucus night will likely favor Sanders , and a blizzard would likely increase Clinton ' s chances . Will Bernie ' s supporters actually turn out to vote , or do they just like going to rallies ? The question is an open one ( as it is for Trump supporters ) .
