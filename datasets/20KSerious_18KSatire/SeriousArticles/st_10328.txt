To sit across from my patient and see her in a state of complete misery and anxiety once again brought into focus so clearly why it is important to be able to distinguish the variation in this disease .

It is heartbreaking to see a woman and I have seen it many times go through this turmoil when the ability to ease her worries , without compromising her health , could be in our grasp .
