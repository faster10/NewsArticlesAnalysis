Real time Twitter questions : I ' ve been very critical of the sponsorship of these debates by Facebook and Twitter ( among other social media giants ) since the key element of social media ? ? its immediacy to channel public sentiment and raise important questions ? ? never gets included in the debate . No more ! Or at least not this time ! Using real time questions ? ? particularly to Clinton on her odd ( and bad ) use of 9 11 to defend her Wall Street donations ( more on that below ) ? ? was Twitter for a debate done right .
