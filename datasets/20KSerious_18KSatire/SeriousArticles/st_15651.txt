And I mean poor . The average SNAP household has a gross income of just 744 per month . I ' ll bet House Speaker John Boehner spends more than that each month just on cigs and merlot . Requirements to receive food stamps have become so tight that Feeding America , the nation ' s leading domestic hunger relief charity , estimates that only 57 of food insecure Americans are even eligible for food stamps . Can you imagine being too poor to afford food , but too " rich " to qualify for food stamps ?
