Most of the other candidates did fine , too . No one was smacked down the way Jeb Bush was ( by Rubio ) in the last debate , or the way Donald Trump was ( by Carly Fiorina ) in the second debate . To my ears , neither Bush nor John Kasich is especially strong at this , but they each had their moments this time . Ben Carson almost disappeared for the first two hours ? but had ( again , to my ears ) by far the strongest closing statement , reinforcing the reasons why Christian conservatives like them . Even on the undercard event , most candidates did well .
