Fisher doesn ' t deserve all the credit for these enhancements , but he was the agent of change who got the ball rolling . Would it be absolutely incredible if it did ? A program where you lose two games in a rebuilding year . Of course , while most believe he is destined to either end up at USC ( if he chooses to return to college football ) or remain in Philly ( please don ' t let this happen ) , it ' s not as if coaching at LSU is a second rate opportunity . Where the facilities are as impressive as the best funded programs and a cut above the rest . If he leaves for another job , he has to buy out the contracts of any assistant coaches that do not stay with the new staff . So if he leaves he would owe FSU approximately 5 . 4 million . You know , at some point in time , there is a " me " in this . In Baton Rouge or Tuscaloosa .
