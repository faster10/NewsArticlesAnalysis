It will be a little weird if Manning wins a Super Bowl . He ' s clearly not the same guy who won five MVPs . But John Elway wasn ' t the same guy at the end of the 1997 season , he threw for 123 yards in Super Bowl XXXII , and nobody cared because he won . If you talk about Elway today , nobody will mention that Terrell Davis was the most valuable player on those two Broncos title teams in 1997 and 1998 . So maybe it doesn ' t matter for Manning . All many people see with quarterbacks are rings , and that ' s it .
