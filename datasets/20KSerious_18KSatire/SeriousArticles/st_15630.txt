Ted Cruz Cruz is getting good at this . His skills as a courtroom lawyer and college debater are coming to bear in this very different format . Cruz s killer line about illegal immigration and the demonization of those who take a harder line was his only extra base hit for the night , but it was a good one . And , like Rubio , Cruz doesn t need a change in the trajectory of the race right now . Cruz will have to start drawing sharper contrasts with his rivals , but for now , being an attractive second choice for most conservatives is a great place to be .
