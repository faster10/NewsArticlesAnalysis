The difference in the strategies has been that while Iran focused on Shiite communities which were not already politically empowered , Saudis were investing in the societies and governments where Sunni regimes were already in power . Now while those communities which received Iranian support are bursting at seams for political empowerment , at the cost of Sunni status quo political order , while those supported by Saudi Arabia ? sub sects of Sunni school of thought ? are either struggling to retain the Sunni status quo political order or claim their pound of flesh out of the same pie ? hence becoming pariahs like al Qaida or Daish . Some Sunni regimes have already lost power to Shiite dispensations ? say Iraq ? others managed to survive from the brink ? say Bahrain .
