We ' ve all had those days when we ' ve needed to vent to a fellow co worker . But doing so continuously , and over company email , may not be the best move . Three Iowa employees learned that lesson the hard way after their boss discovered thousands of their gossipy interoffice emails . Within these emails , the employees in question trashed their co workers and expressed their general disgust for their jobs . After the disparaging emails were exposed , the employees were fired for " excessive use of the commission ' s computer system for emails of a personal nature . " So the next time you need to let off steam about your workplace , stick to doing so via your personal email account . Source : MoxieBird
