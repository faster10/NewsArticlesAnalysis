Republicans supported President Obama ' s decision to order airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria this summer . And incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he is open to a Senate floor debate on a new authorization for the use of military force ( AUMF ) . Discussion is likely to intensify over what the GOP considers a tentative and ineffective campaign against the terrorist group . Republicans charge that President Obama , by not acting sooner , contributed to ISIS growth . They have argued that defeating the group now will require more boots and Special Forces on the ground , increased airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and a no fly zone and buffer zone in Syria . Republicans also want to more forcefully confront Syrian President Bashar al Assad . There is also sure to be scrutiny of the administration ' s plan train moderate rebels . The White House has asked Congress to train 5 , 000 voted Syrian rebel troops to take on ISIS , and the current authorization for that program expires at the end of the year . Incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday the Republicans want to revisit the discussion with the president on his strategy . That strategy could include cooperation with Iran , which would create a new sideline debate on Captiol Hill . President Obama wrote a letter to Iran ' s Supreme Leader pointing out the two countries both oppose ISIS . But the ongoing and troubled nuclear talks between Iran and the West stand in the way .
