in other , more pedantic news : we re not just playing coachella . we re playing all over . we re not just having some reunion tour . we re releasing a record ( sometime this year ? still working on it , actually ) , so this isn t a victory lap or anything , which wouldn t be of much interest to us . this is just the bus full of substitute teachers back from their coffee break with new music and the same weird gear ? or as much of it as we still have ( it s very interesting to re buy the same gear , and in some cases buy gear BACK from people you sold it to ) , and rambling around trying to be louder than everyone else . thank fuck we were never skinny and young . or at least i wasn t . that always happens with bands they aren t fat when they come back , typically , just , i don t know , thicker . i was lucky to start this band kind of fat and old , so there s no , like look how YOUNG they were ! shit to even find on the internet . i mean , we were younger and everything , but we weren t young , if you know what i mean .
