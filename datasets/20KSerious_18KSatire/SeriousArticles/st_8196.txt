Analysts said the incident risks derailing efforts to bring peace to Syria that were gaining tentative momentum following the November 13 Paris terror attacks , claimed by Islamic State militants who control swathes of northern Syria . The Turkish army said the fighter was shot down by two of its F 16s after it violated Turkish airspace 10 times within a five minute period . A US military spokesman in Baghdad confirmed that 10 warnings had been issued , but said it was not immediately clear on which side of the border the jet had been flying , and it would take some time to analyse data before knowing for sure . Moscow insisted that the jet had stayed inside Syrian territory , and Damascus denounced the incident as " flagrant aggression " against Syrian sovereignty .
