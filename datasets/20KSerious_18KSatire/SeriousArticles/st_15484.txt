WARNER : Well , homosexuality is illegal in most African countries . And I ' ll tell you , when politicians want to spout hate speech or when they are doing bad in the polls , they want to find a scapegoat , they go to the church pulpit . And we ' ve seen that in Kenya . We ' ve seen that in Uganda . I don ' t know if it will come up directly on this tour . But another hot button issue here is the question of celibacy . African priests , just demographically , they ' re often the best and brightest of their communities . You know , they ' re that kid that won the scholarship to seminary school . Maybe they ' re the first in their family to go to college . They want to get married . They want to have kids . Or they say they ' ll leave the church . That ' s also an issue for the future of the Catholic Church here in Africa . It may not be mentioned here on this tour .
