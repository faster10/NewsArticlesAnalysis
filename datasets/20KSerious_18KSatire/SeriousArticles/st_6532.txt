Last week s execution of Sheikh Nimr al Nimr , a leading Shiite cleric , along with dozens of other people , made worldwide news because it further inflamed Saudi Arabia s not so cold war with the Shiite rulers of Iran , which is playing out on the ground in Yemen with devastating civilian consequences . But that kind of dubious judicial proceeding and brutal punishment is far more the Saudi rule than the exception . All non Islamic religious practice is forbidden , and that fatwa is frequently used to persecute or suppress Shiites , Ismailis and other Muslim minority sects . The Saudis have beheaded at least as many people as ISIS has , says Jennifer Loewenstein , a journalist , activist and scholar who has followed the Saudi American relationship for many years . But people don t know anything about it . It doesn t make the news .
