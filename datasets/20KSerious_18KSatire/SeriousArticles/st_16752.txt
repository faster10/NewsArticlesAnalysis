Thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act , to claim disability is to ask for reasonable accommodation accessible buildings , more time on tests , audible formats for books , Social Security disability payments , and more . Too many people seem to regard the request to accommodate as a burden and meet such requests with suspicion . The not disabled exercise their privilege by demanding that people prove their disabilities then , all too often , proof just generates pity , not understanding or inclusion .
