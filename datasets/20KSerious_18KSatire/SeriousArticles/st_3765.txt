While the BJP will find it easy to concede the Congress party s demand to scrap the 1 interstate tax since it has already promised to compensate states fully for the next five years , conceding the other demands will not be easy , or even desirable . The Congress wants the government to , for instance , insert a clause in the GST Bill saying the revenue neutral rate will not be over 18 . No statute , like the Income Tax Act for instance , ever puts in a ceiling floor rate of tax ? the tax is always determined by the government each year ? since this binds the government s hands .
