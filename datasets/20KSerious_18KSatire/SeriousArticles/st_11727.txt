What we learned : The Giants are not only the worst football team in New York a title earned courtesy of their 23 20 loss to the Jets on Sunday but they might just have the worst defense that the New York area has ever seen . They were up 20 10 at halftime and then barely provided a speed bump in the fourth quarter and overtime as the Jets ' methodically ran over them . Their offense isn ' t exactly a prize , either . They had a few opportunities to put this game away ( including one taken away from them by a curious decision by Tom Coughlin ) . They are now 5 7 and it doesn ' t even matter that they could still be in first place at the end of the weekend . They don ' t deserve the playoff berth that they ' re still fighting for with four games to go .
