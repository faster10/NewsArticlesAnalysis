States in general , and big powers in particular , are not known for resorting to self criticism in order to avoid repeating the mistakes committed in the past . Had it not been so the world would have been a better place to live in as US and other western powers would have learnt a lesson from supporting religious extremism in Afghanistan and would have desisted from doing the similar things in Iraq , Libya , Syria and Somalia . But on the positive side the world seems to have a learnt a lesson from another one of its mistake , and that was putting its back on Afghanistan once the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 . Not only a small contingent of ISAF forces was left behind in Afghanistan in 2015 , to refrain terrorist forces from overwhelming the nascent Republic of Afghanistan but a number of bilateral , multilateral , regional and international process were also launched to support peace and democracy in Afghanistan .
