" Unfortunately , you still have to have a job to have relief from the tax burden , and a lot of these people are behind in house payments and , quite frankly , it ' s a vicious cycle : You don ' t have a job , you can ' t make your house payment , you ' re not out buying anything . Even if you reduce the tax burden to those people , they still need to have some sort of income . When that occurs , they start buying things , which creates more jobs , which then starts the cycle back up again . "
