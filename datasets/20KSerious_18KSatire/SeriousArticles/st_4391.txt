Take Glenn Beck . I really don t know what genius at National Review thought he would be a good representative for impeaching an opportunistic huckster prone to wild populist confabulation . Sending Beck to stop Trump is like trying to get a gravy stain out of a carpet by steamrolling a prime rib into it . This guy so regularly leaks torrents of crocodile tears that if you d sent him back to Bronze Age Egypt , the denizens along the Nile would have invented the calendar to chart how often Glenn Beck flooded their banks .
