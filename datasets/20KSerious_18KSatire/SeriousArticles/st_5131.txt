Kansas was up 106 ? 105 on Oklahoma , but the Soomers had possession when Mason essentially grabbed the ball out of Hield s hands . Inbounds passers are supposed to have a window to work with , and Hield clearly didn t .

After the turnover , Woodard fouled out and Kansas retook the lead and never relinquished it .
