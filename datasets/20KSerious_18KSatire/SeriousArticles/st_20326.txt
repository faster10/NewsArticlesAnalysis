It ' s revealed an issue that I ' m surprised about , which is the new preciousness that ' s been brought to literature for children now . There is an abject fear of instilling any sort of dramatic trauma , of sadness , on the children who are receiving a story . . . . And of course that was never a great concern in the past . The great children ' s stories that we all grew up with , there are always moments of great tragedy and moving moments of loss in the book that we weren ' t afraid of as long as you bring them young readers back by the end and bring them to where a reader should be , a child should be .
