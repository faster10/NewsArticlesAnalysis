The fight against Daesh cannot be seen as just a counterterrorism action . It is important for the coalition to recognise that Daesh now controls and governs a territory as large as Great Britain with a population of more than six million people , which it has administered with some success for over a year . This means that any successful action cannot just be about defeating a relatively small terrorist group , but has to focus on post war reconstruction , winning back the hearts and minds of the population and rebuilding institutions .
