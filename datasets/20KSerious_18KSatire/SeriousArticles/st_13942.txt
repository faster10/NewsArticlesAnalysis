Sure , conservatives will trot out all manner of dated and discriminatory arguments to say the legislation isn ' t needed or will cause unwanted problems . They ' ll say , " This is less about tolerance and equality and more about oppressing the freedoms of others . " When they do so , they ' ll sound to most Americans to the 70 or more of us who support this legislation like they ' re parodying themselves in a " Daily Show " segment . Whose freedoms , exactly , are being oppressed if a person can ' t be fired for being gay ? And on what planet is freedom increased if someone can be fired , legally , just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity ?
