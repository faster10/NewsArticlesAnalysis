Weird thing is , he was among the few overtly happy people here . Davis was angry at times and Spanos seemed dazed and crestfallen and Kroenke was downright morose for a man who had just been granted the keys to the NFL ' s ultimate kingdom ( think Mr Burns , only with less energy ) . When Kroenke called today ' s developments " bittersweet " in full monotone , one had to wonder if this was deadpan or performance art , as this was totally sweet for him and bitter only for Rams fans who happen to reside in St . Louis .
