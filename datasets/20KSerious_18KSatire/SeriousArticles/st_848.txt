In Tuesday ' s news release , Vance said , " As prosecutors , we don ' t work in a world where we expect or require perfect witnesses . The tens of thousands of victims who come to our office each year come from varied and often difficult circumstances , and sometimes with imperfect pasts . If we are convinced they are truthful about the crimes committed against them , and will tell the truth at trial , we will ask a jury to consider their testimony to prove a crime . If we are not convinced , we cannot , should not and do not take the case to a jury . "
