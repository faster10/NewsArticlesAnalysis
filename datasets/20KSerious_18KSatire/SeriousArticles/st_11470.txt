The Bears didn t really make the Vikings one dimensional as Adrian Peterson went for 103 yards on 20 carries , the fifth straight time he s reached triple digits against the Bears . The bigger issue , as I see it , is the opposite outside linebacker position simply isn t getting to the quarterback . Sam Acho , who has started since the Jared Allen trade , entered the game with one quarterback pressure , a statistic tallied by Bears coaches after film review . Lamarr Houston came in with one sack and three pressures and Willie Young has one sack and two pressures .
