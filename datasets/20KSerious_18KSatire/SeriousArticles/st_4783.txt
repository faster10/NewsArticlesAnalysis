I ' ve lost count of the number of times I have covered Arsenal games and wondered how Per Mertesacker does it . It always amazes me that teams don ' t try and get pacey players in and around him more often . He ' s never been blessed with speed and playing a high line can cause him problems , but he has a World Cup medal to his name , so he must be doing something right . His partner Laurent Koscielny is much more mobile , so a fit again Daniel Sturridge as well as Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho will hope to exploit Mertesacker ' s side of the defence .
