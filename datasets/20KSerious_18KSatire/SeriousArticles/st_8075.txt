Unlike Ride , the names of the women pilots and would be astronauts are not widely known today : Jerrie Cobb , Bernice Steadman , Janey Hart , Jerri Truhill , Rhea Woltman , Sarah Ratley , Jan and Marion Dietrich , Myrtle Cagle , Irene Leverton , Gene Nora Jessen , Jean Hixson and Wally Funk . Some 40 years later , happily , they have been celebrated as pioneers and recognized with awards such as the Adler Planetarium ' s Women in Space Science award in 2005 . I suspect these women appreciate the recognition but would rather have done what Ride did . They would rather have flown in space .
