" So this just happened , Simon Cowell just announced that he ' s leaving ' Idol . ' This will be his last season . He announced he ' s leaving on my first day . I ' m trying not to take it personally , " she said . " But seriously , I am going to be very , very sad to see him go , because I think he ' s made the show what it is . He ' s a huge part of that show but he wanted a change . I wish him all the luck in the world hosting ' The Tonight Show , ' " said DeGeneres , referring to widespread speculation about how NBC will resolve its issues with its late night talk shows . In reality , of course , Simon Cowell has not been part of that speculation .
