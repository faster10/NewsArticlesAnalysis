( On being close to a playoff spot , after everything that s happened so far ) ? ? I don t know about that . All I know is that we have a huge game next week , and we have to get going . We need to find the consistency that gives you a chance to make some noise later on . We re OK about starting right now . We like to start right now , if that s what it is . There s a lot of football to be played . We like what we re seeing right now , so we ll see if we can build on it . We have a chance to have a good team , we still do . We have always had that opportunity to play real well . We ve seen enough good play throughout the season to know that . It s the consistency that needs to come to the front , and the ability to close out the wins . It was a really good job of closing out today , it was exactly like we wanted to do it . We ll take this to next week , and see what happens .
