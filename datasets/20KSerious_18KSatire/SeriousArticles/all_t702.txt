It's hoped that Tatum will also star as one of the Ghostbusters in the film, Deadline reports. Sony is also forming a production company called Ghostcorps with original "Ghostbusters" director Ivan Reitman and star Dan Aykroyd, among others, to expand the "Ghostbusters" universe and find new branding opportunities based on the 1984 classic."We want to expand the 'Ghostbusters' universe in ways that will include different films, TV shows, merchandise, all things that are part of modern filmed entertainment," Reitman told Deadline. "Paul Feig's film will be the first version of that, shooting in June to come out in July 2016. He's got four of the funniest women in the world. The second film has a wonderful idea that builds on that. Drew will start writing and the hope is to be ready for the Russo Brothers' next window next summer to shoot, with the movie coming out the following year. It's just the beginning of what I hope will be a lot of wonderful movies."
