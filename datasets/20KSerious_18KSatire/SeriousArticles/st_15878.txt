There was lots of speculation that Alabama s Nick Saban could be headed to the Colts until Jimmy Irsay decided to retain Chuck Pagano . The Giants wanted Saban in 1997 and thought they had him before he changed his mind and stayed at Michigan State . He was high on their list in 2004 after he had just won the national championship at LSU . But when Giants GM Ernie Accorsi called to speak with Saban a couple of days after the championship game at a predetermined time , Saban was not home and Accorsi moved on . Saban took the Dolphins job the next year , was just 15 17 in two years and went to Alabama . His game management skills were exposed in the NFL . After Alabama plays Clemson for the national title Monday night , I don t think the Giants will put themselves in position to get burned by Saban a third time .
