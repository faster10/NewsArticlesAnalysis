Luckily for us all , the stars seem to be aligning for just such a substantive debate to take place . With only two viable candidates on stage ( and with only one not really viable candidate ) , both Hillary and Bernie should have lots of time to explain their positions . They won ' t be competing with seven others , as we just saw in the Republican debate , so the competition for airtime won ' t be nearly as fierce . With a wonky moderator , hopefully the Democrats ( also unlike the Republicans ) will be challenged on facts and details , and the weakest parts of their respective platform ideas . Democratic candidates ( for the most part , and certainly this year ) don ' t whine and try to " work the refs " when challenged in this fashion , they just tend to get wonkier than the questioner .
