Like the girlfriend with whom you always knew you were punching above your weight , sometimes you just have to hold your hands up . Yet should Fabregas return to the Premier League , and to Chelsea , one can ' t help but imagine what it would be like to see your first love arm in arm with a someone so at odds with what you thought made them great an older , uglier , more unpopular partner , in whom a bulge can only be found in his wallet and his gut , the one he ' s stuffed with goodies thanks to the irritatingly successful pursuit of paid for popularity . It ' s not exactly very ' Barcelona ' just ask Hughes .
