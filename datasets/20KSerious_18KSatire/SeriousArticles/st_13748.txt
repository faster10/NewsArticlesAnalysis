While I commend the Legislature for attempting to devise measures to stabilize the city s budget and finances , I am concerned that the bills , in their present form , fail to recognize the true path to economic revitalization and fiscal stability in the city , said ? Christie , a presidential candidate . While these bills represent the bipartisan efforts of many to provide important , near term support to the city s immediate challenges , I do not believe they meet the goal of setting a course toward renewed , long term prosperity and economic growth . To achieve these goals , we must continue our work and go further to ensure that the next step leads to that economically vibrant future for Atlantic City .
