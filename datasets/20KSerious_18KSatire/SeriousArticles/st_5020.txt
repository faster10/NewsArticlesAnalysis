On top of that , the fertility treatments that many older women use to get pregnant lead to more twins , triplets , etc . and multiples often demand a surgical delivery . " It ' s very hard to predict how the second baby will come out , " says Owen Montgomery , M . D . , assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Drexel University College of Medicine , noting that complicated positions are more common among multiples . Plus , after a trial published in The Lancet in 2002 found that delivering a breech baby ( one whose head is up high and feet or butt are positioned to come out first ) by C section is safer for the fetus , the surgery became the default method for delivering multiples , regardless of the position of the babies .
