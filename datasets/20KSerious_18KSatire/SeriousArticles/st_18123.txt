Fearmongering and propaganda are where Trump and Rubio come in , for sure . What came out of Rubio s mouth after the Obama mosque visit was , as usual , entirely baffling but calibrated to appeal to the hateful right wing zeitgeist while somehow sounding sunny and upbeat . I m tired of being divided against each other for political reasons like this president s done , said the 11 year old senator from Florida . Always pitting people against each other . Always . Look at today ? he gave a speech at a mosque . ( This in a tone of doesn t that just figure ? ) Oh , you know , basically implying that America is discriminating against Muslims .
