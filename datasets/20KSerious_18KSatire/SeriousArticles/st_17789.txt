The NFL moved the draft back . I wish they ' d move the declare date back . I wish they ' d make a rule that says you can ' t even tell a player what his draft status is through the NFL committee until they ' ve finished their competition as college players . So that you don ' t put them and their family in this situation where there ' s a big timing issue relative to competition . Now if you finish your season on Dec . 6 , you can make a decision . If you finished it on Jan . 11 , then you get your ( feedback ) information after that , but you have a significant amount of time to make that decision when you finish playing so you can stay focused on what you need to do to play well , because it benefits all those players to play well in the game .
