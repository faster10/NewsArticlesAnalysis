Current state : The performance of the offensive line has been alarming . Granted , it has been a patchwork outfit given the absence of both starting tackles , with Nate Solder gone for the year , and Sebastian Vollmer nursing a sprained ankle . But that doesn t excuse all of the breakdowns across the board with the line losing battles in the trenches on a weekly basis to the point where Brady was nearly a casualty . Sure , they have rookies playing , but you can point a finger in any direction from veterans to first year players and there s been trouble .
