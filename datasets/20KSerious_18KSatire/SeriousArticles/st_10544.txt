" This was not just about winning a Championship . It was about a group of regular guys that believed in themselves and this city , and this country , and through their unbelievable efforts it helped relieve the pain of the Boston Marathon bombing in April , " wrote Dave Hornoff on the same social media page . " They dedicated their season to the victims and the entire country embraced them , and they embraced Boston and the entire country . What we witnessed was a real life movie in the making and for me this was more than just sports . More championships will be won every year but the story of the 2013 Boston Red Sox will never be repeated . "
