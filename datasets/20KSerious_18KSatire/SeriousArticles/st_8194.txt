If we are to end the HIV pandemic , we need strategies that target all the actors . We have to understand how HIV spreads , and Aids kills , in a broader field of gendered power and inequality , and unequal access to health services . This means that we must continue to implement strategies to empower women and advance their human rights . It also means that we must engage men and boys to increase their proactive support for gender equality , and we must do a better job of reaching men with critical HIV services .
