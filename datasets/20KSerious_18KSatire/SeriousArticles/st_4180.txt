Bogdanovich : I guess I didn ' t give a s . I had purposely made " What ' s Up , Doc ? " as a G rated comedy , and that was in ' 72 , and they asked me when we were making it are you sure you don ' t want to make it a PG ? I said no , I want to make it for the whole family a G rated comedy with no socially redeeming value . And they all laughed and left me alone , and that was the biggest success of my career . So I thought a musical with a similar light touch would be welcome , but I didn ' t realize how difficult it is to find the right balance between singing and talking , which is the key to it . And Jim Blakely found it .
