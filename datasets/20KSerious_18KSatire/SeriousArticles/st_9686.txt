Here things get legally weird . While the attempt to recover damages was pending , the families lobbied Congress , which passed a special law , 22 U . S . C . 8772 , as part of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 . That law specified that " the financial assets that are identified in and the subject of proceedings in Peterson et al . v . Islamic Republic of Iran " should be used " in order to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages awarded against Iran for terrorism .
