Still , that doesn t keep Sia from becoming an occasional victim of her own success . She s been so adept at churning out big , swooping power ballads that some of This Is Acting feels all too familiar . The simple metaphors she often structures songs around ( a barrage of bullets , a relationship s burning flame ) start to feel redundant , and the hallmarks of a Sia song ( sturdy piano chords , half mumbled verses , rushing choruses ) approach formulaic . Sia herself has credited her success not to the quality of her songwriting but to her curation ? she s constantly writing songs , but only the finest fraction are ever heard by anyone else . An album like this is economical given her output , but it also threatens the supply and demand that s worked in her favor .
