While Clinton can t take her path to the presidency for granted , there s no one in the race with the kind of magnetic appeal Barack Obama demonstrated back in 2008 ? which is to say there s no Clinton slayer . In 2008 , Obama drew huge crowds with charisma and a knack for public speaking , something Clinton will never do . But she s self aware enough to play to her strengths . Clinton shines in the grinding work of government , a grit and determination that was on display as she soldiered through the Benghazi hearing . And it was on display in an interview with MSNBC s Rachel Maddow , when Clinton talked about how her mother might have felt seeing her subjected to 11 ? hours of questioning at the Benghazi hearing : She was someone who lived a really tough life , and she knows that everybody gets knocked down in life , and the question is whether you get back up , or whether you allow yourself to be ? you know , not only knocked down , but knocked out . And that s the way she raised me .
