Economists say the IMF decision could encourage Chinese leaders to further relax controls on the yuan . The ruling Communist Party ' s latest five year development plan says the yuan will be " freely tradable and freely usable " by 2020 . The surprise August introduction of a new mechanism for setting the government controlled exchange rate led to a 3 . 5 percent devaluation . But the country ' s top economic official , Premier Li Keqiang , said in September that there were no plans for further declines . Some traders worry Beijing might devalue once it achieved its goal of being added to the IMF basket . But others say Chinese leaders want to be seen as reliable . The yuan ' s addition is " an endorsement as an international currency , " said Chen Kang , chief bond analyst for SWS Research Co . in Shanghai . " That will encourage China to adopt more measures toward accelerating the process of the opening of its foreign exchange markets and capital markets . "
