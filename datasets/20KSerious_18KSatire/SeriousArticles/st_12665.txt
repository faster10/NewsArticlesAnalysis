As well as systematically ignoring war crimes committed by the Assad regime , StWC often misrepresents the opposition to Assad as being largely composed of jihadi extremists and agents of imperialism marginalising the non violent , secular , democratic , local community and non aligned opposition to his tyranny . It also misrepresents the call by Syrian civil society organisations for civilian safe havens and humanitarian corridors claiming they are calls for western bombing , when they are actually bids to stop Assad s bombs and save lives . We urge StWC to take on board these constructive criticisms and change its stance to support the Syrian people s struggle against the war being inflicted on them by both Isis and Assad .
