This all started with John Smoltz . A year ago , the Atlanta Braves ( and briefly a Cardinal ) pitcher was a first timer on the Hall of Fame ballot and seemed to be a favorite for election . I knew the general outline of his candidacy by heart ? the success as a starter , the dominance as a closer , the October moments ? but recognized that was mostly anecdotally . I plunged into the numbers and so , so often found Smoltz seated beside two other pitchers , Curt Schilling and Mussina . It became impossible for me to extricate one from the trio . Last year s ballot had two pitchers that stood out above their peers , one from the left ( Randy Johnson ) and the other from the right ( Pedro Martinez ) .
