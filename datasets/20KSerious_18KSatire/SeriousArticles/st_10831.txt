Well , it s hard to know how to answer to that . Will this year s Golden Globe winners be remembered forever ? That s up for debate . Personally , I find it hard to imagine future historians deconstructing Mozart in the Jungle . As for the pain of watching this year s awards , let s hope it s only temporary . Next year , maybe the HFPA can get the night s best presenters , Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence , to host . Until then , Ricky Gervais , go ahead and chug that beer that s been resting on your mic stand . You owe a round to the rest of us .
