Man City s rapid ascent into the sport s rarified atmosphere is unprecedented . You might argue that Lazio did it in the late ' 90s and early ' 00s , and the Chelsea of the last decade replicated it , a model that was then copied by Paris Saint Germain . But those were already big clubs that just got bigger ? until the bottom fell out at Lazio , anyway . You could even point to Malaga as a mediocre top tier club similar to City that quickly rose the ranks ? under Pellegrini , no less ? but that team has since fallen off as the money has dried up .
