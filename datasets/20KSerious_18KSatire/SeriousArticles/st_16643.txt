Rabbi Wolbe , the famed spiritual guide and author of Alei Shor , answers both of these questions with one important idea . Hashem wants the greatness of man . Just like a coach pushes his players for athletic success , the Master of the Universe guides nations and individuals to achieve and unlock their potential . It is precisely that greatness that expresses God himself , and hence his desire to have a Messianic figure lead the redemption of humanity . It is through this very means , that the Messiah will be such an exalted , refined , admirable individual , that the entire world will be hanging on his every word eager to follow the leadership of a man than towers humanity in comparison .
