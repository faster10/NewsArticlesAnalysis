PIERCE : Right now in New Orleans , it ' s worse than the week of the storm . We ' re talking about people who own their property and who didn ' t receive any insurance . My parents had Allstate insurance , and they got 400 after paying premiums for 50 years . It was criminal , a criminal action . So you have people who own their property , like my parents did , whose insurance policies were not recognized . And there ' s 3 billion to assist them to get back in their homes , and the state is not doing anything to help them out . Why hasn ' t it been used ? Because it ' s a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out .
