While Bowie s lithe figure and pretty face gave him an androgynous aura from the start , he didn t use that role in so focused , and shocking , a way until the U . K . cover of his 1970 album The Man Who Sold the World . It found him draped over a chaise longue wearing a dress and sporting long tresses that seemed less like the hippie casual norm of the day than like something out of old Hollywood . When he appeared in a similar fashion for an interview with Rolling Stone , its writer described him as ravishing and almost disconcertingly reminiscent of Lauren Bacall . Even so , Bowie s U . S . label of the era , RCA , reissued the album in a less provocative cover , depicting Bowie in a more common rockstar pose : a macho kick . The music inside led Bowie in a harder rocking direction than its folk and pop leaning predecessors . The title track proved enduring enough to inspire an aching cover version by Nirvana on their 1994 concert album , MTV Unplugged in New York .
