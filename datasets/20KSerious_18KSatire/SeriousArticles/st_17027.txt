But the West s supremacy clearly remains . The teams with the three best records are in the West . As are the teams with the three best point differentials . As are the four best offenses . And the two best defenses . Overall , the West is 341 325 ( . 512 ) overall through Sunday s action , which easily tops the East s 320 336 record ( . 488 ) . The West has also surpassed the East to settle in at 133 117 ( . 532 ) in head to head games between the conferences . Nine of the top 11 players by Real Plus Minus and eight of the top nine players by Player Efficiency play in the West . So while the East might deserve a blue ribbon for its progress , the trophy for conference supremacy isn t going to change hands this year . ?
