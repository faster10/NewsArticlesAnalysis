The format of " The X Factor " is similar to " Idol , " but there are several key differences . On " The X Factor , " each of the four judges ' mentor ' a category of contestant : Males younger than 30 females younger than 30 groups and 30s and older . The show therefore becomes a contest between the judges as much as the contestants , often resulting in plenty of judges ' bickering ( " X Factor " judges Sharon Osbourne and Dannii Minogue were reportedly barely on speaking terms by the end of their run on the show ) . At the same time , the diversity of the contestants also makes the show rather different from " Idol , " which these days only seems to crown white male guitar players .
