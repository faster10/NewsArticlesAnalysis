It is the single most important domestic issue , is for people to once again believe that the government will enforce the law without prejudice and without bias , that we will enforce the law and that justice will matter again in this country . We have had the most politicized Justice Department I ve seen in my lifetime who picks and chooses when they want to enforce the law , emboldened by a president who does the same thing . As a candidate for president of the United States , you have to say very clearly , am I going to be a law enforcer or am I not ? And you know , Laura , you know , seven years as the United States attorney in New Jersey , that s been what my career has been about . It s been about enforcing the law and whether it s Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or John Kasich or anybody else , they need to say where they stand on these things . I have been very clear about it . I ve been campaigning on it long before it became stylish to talk about it because I believe it is an underpinning of credibility as a president .
