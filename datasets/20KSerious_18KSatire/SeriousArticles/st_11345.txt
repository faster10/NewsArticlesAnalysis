Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out , scientists have warned . Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts , which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets , including Earth , through the Milky Way . But some orbits might be more upset than we know , and there is evidence of recent activity , which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower . Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is , as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud , which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system . They happen on a 26 million year cycle , scientists have said , which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260 million years
