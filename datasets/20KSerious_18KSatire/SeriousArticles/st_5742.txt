Uber has added a lift sharing feature to its app in London , allowing people to share their taxi with a stranger in return for a reduced fair . Users will be given 25 per cent off their journey if they say they will let up to two other passengers share their car . Drivers will then receive a message telling them that they ll be picking up more than one fare , and can plan their route accordingly . London is the second European country to get the feature , after Paris . It was first launched in San Francisco and now most people who use the app do so with the feature
