To quote from the 1964 Dylan song that gives this comp its name , Bob has always been a champion of ' ' the countless confused , accused , misused , strung out ones , an ' worse . ' ' So it makes sense that the best covers here come from the misfits ( Ke ha ) , the punks ( check out Rise Against ' s raging ' ' Ballad of Hollis Brown ' ' ) , the outsiders ( Mexican pop star Ximena Sari ana ' s excellent ' ' I Want You ' ' ) , and the radicals ( ' ' With God on Our Side ' ' finds Somali born Toronto rapper K ' naan challenging American hawkishness as only a Canadian can ) .
