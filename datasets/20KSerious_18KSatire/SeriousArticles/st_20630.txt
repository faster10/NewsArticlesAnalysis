A final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal policy . This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly neutral , in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on growth . 4 Also , the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments , allowing them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of the Great Recession . Looking ahead , I anticipate that total real government purchases of goods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the next few years .
