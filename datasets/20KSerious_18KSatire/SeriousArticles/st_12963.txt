" I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that ' s not very common , " Roderick said . " . . . And I wonder if it would have been different if ( it dealt ) with someone with a less horrific story something that happens to more people . I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through . Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through . Now it ' s like , ' If I wasn ' t assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention . ' It ' s frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm . "
