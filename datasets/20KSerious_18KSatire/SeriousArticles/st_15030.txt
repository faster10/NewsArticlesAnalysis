Why shouldn ' t gay people be allowed to serve openly in the military ? The answer , they say , isn ' t because gay soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines won ' t do their jobs well . It ' s because the straight ones will feel uncomfortable if they have to be in close quarters with gay comrades . It ' s not about gay service members ' performance , it ' s about the feelings of straight service members ( and if you ' re wondering why we haven ' t heard too much about the end of " don ' t ask , don ' t tell , " it ' s because it turned out that straight military personnel could handle it just fine ) .
