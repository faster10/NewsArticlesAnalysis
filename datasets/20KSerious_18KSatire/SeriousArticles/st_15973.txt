If it were possible to separate all of these stories into a box and call Iran a country with bad human rights but improving foreign policy , then maybe there would be a case for ignoring them . But ? as we ve learned to our cost , in Russia among other places ? regimes that need violence to repress their citizens do not make reliable diplomatic partners : Any ruling clique that fears popular revolt will always , at the end of the day , tailor its foreign policy to the goal of keeping itself in power . Right now , Rouhani and his foreign minister , Javad Zarif , think that lifting sanctions will help improve Iran s economy and create popular support . But if it doesn t , then they or their successors will immediately direct public anger and emotion at the Great Satan once again .
