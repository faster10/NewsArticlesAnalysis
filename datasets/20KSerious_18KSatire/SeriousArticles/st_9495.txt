I am particularly disturbed by stories of bullied youth who feel powerless to change their situation and who choose not to seek help from adults . A recent report from a newspaper in my home state of Pennsylvania told the story of a 12 year old boy who regularly asks his parents not to report when he has been bullied because he fears possible retaliation . Rather than speak up about the threatening environment at school , he felt that his only option was to keep quiet or risk making things worse .
