WARNER : Well , as we all know , this pope is famously humble . But even Kenyans were shocked when he drove in from the airport in a little gray Honda . And Kenyon editorial writers noted what a far cry this vehicle was from the polished Mercedes and the tinted 4x4s favored by politicians here . And the timing for this visit , I think , is particularly interesting because corruption I mean , that ' s long been an issue in this region . But the pope ' s arrival in Kenya coincides with major government corruption allegations coming to light . And it ' s no coincidence that just days before the pope ' s visit , the Kenyon president , Uhuru Kenyatta , sacked five ministers accused of stealing public money . So there ' s a hope that the pope can really accomplish something on this trip .
