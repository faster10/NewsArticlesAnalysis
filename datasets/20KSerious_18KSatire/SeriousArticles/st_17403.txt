It seems French intelligence knew something big was about to happen , they just didn t know what , when and where . On the morning of November 13 , the Hotel Molitor where the German football team was staying before their match with France was evacuated by French security forces . At lunch time , the Gare de Lyon , the underground and main railway station in central Paris , was also evacuated . That evening , the Boulevard de Sebastopol , the main artery in the middle of Paris , was closed . But when the attacks finally came , it was chaos .
