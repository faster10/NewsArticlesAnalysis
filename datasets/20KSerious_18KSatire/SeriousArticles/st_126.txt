I loved Mulder and ? Scully Meet the Were Monster , but I wouldn t be surprised if some of you didn t . The premise of Mulder questioning his faith in all things freaky and his career as a paranormal muckraker seemed as bogus as a jackalope ? coming one week after Founder s Mutation depicted him fully engaged in old crusades . Since the episode was mostly about Mulder beating back his ? version of mid life identity ? crisis ( alt title : How Spooky Got His Groove Back ) , Scully got short shrift despite a handful of small , fun ? beats . ( I m immortal , she quipped to Mulder , ? winking at a fan theory . ) She served as ? midwife to Mulder s spiritual rebirth , flipping the one female stereotype she often ? plays , the wet blanket scold , with another . Scully s most memorable moment came when she appeared in the sex fantasy of our ? Monster of the Week , an ancient horny reptilian infected with an ugly masculinity , ? existential crisis ? and ? the life sapping banality of seersucker suited modernity . I imagined a nation of shippers beholding the spectacle of Scully getting her freak on with that ? piece of strange and fuming : ? That should be Mulder , dammit !
