In the last few days , two Ukrainian warplanes were brought down over Eastern Ukraine ( one allegedly by a Russian jet ) and on Thursday a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane crashed in the area , apparently with the loss of all 298 souls on board . If it turns out that the unfortunate civilian airliner was also shot down , Russia and its local allies could again be implicated . Understandably , the international community will wonder whether this portends an escalation in the Kremlin ambitions there .
