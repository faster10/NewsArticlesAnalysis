I wanted to talk about all of it . The Dallas Cowboys . America s Team . Feel bad , feel good story of the year . I wanted to talk about how remarkably easy they could have been to root for , and how surprisingly hopeful we should be about maybe seeing them in the playoffs once Romo and Dez return . They ve already dinged up their main competition , the Giants and Eagles , once a piece , and in the NFC East potato sack race where the Giants are currently alone in first at 4 ? 3 , nine wins might be enough to get them there .
