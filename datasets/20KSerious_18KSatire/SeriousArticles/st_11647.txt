Just having Kennedy on the same stage as an experienced vice president made a difference for JFK because he could hold his own with Nixon . But then , of course , when it was listened to on the radio , it made it seem like it was pretty equal , and even some people giving an edge to Nixon . But he looked so terrible . His makeup was bad . He wasn ' t feeling well . He looked sallow , He looked scornful . And people just reacted to that image of a vigorous , young Kennedy , and an almost sick looking Nixon . And from then on , somehow JFK became a figure .
