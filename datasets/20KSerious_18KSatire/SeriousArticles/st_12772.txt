JKM prices , a maker for delivery in Asia , have fallen by two thirds since the 2014 peak . February 2016 delivery cargoes are going for 7 per million Btu ( MMBtu ) . But more global liquefaction and export capacity is set to hit the market in 2016 , exacerbating the glut . The first export facility in the U . S . Cheniere Energy ' s Sabine Pass will start up soon .
