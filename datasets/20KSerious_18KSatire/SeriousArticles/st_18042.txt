We will go through different cycles of security issues and anxieties , but the single issue that is driving this is . if middle class Americans were moving up the ladder and they were more able to afford a middle class life , the Republicans would not be as anti immigration . They were not , actually , eight years ago , when George Bush tried to pass an immigration bill . I just don t think you would have so much violent anxiety about these issues , as we do today . So now the Democrats think immigration helps the economy , the Republicans thinks it ruins the economy .
