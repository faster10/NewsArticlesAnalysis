The Bosphorus separates the city of Istanbul into a European side and an Asian side . Galatasaray , on the European side , have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs , while Fenerbahce , on the Asian side , have a largely working class following . However , in recent years , Fenerbahce have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club , thus unbalancing the equilibrium . Nowadays , there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch . The last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 Turkish championships .
