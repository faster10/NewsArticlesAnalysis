The potential difficulty is that , as Drummond says , he already practices free throws a lot . While he may not currently have specific and immediate feedback like the Solidshot device can provide , his shooting is a big enough issue for the Pistons that it ' s safe to assume they have specially assigned coaches and video coordinator types focused on noticing and correcting mechanical flaws in his form . For that matter , poor in game shooters like Dwight Howard have consistently shot 80 percent in practice , so it ' s possible that whatever causes Drummond problems cannot be replicated in this environment .
