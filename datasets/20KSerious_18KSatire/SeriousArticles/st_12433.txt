Big break : The Young Driver of The Year award is a very prestigious award in Great Britain and I was the first ever female to make the final six . That got me noticed by Mercedes Benz . I joined their German touring car ( DTM ) program as a factory driver . ( Team founder ) Frank Williams was always very interested in the fact that one of his board members ( Wolff ' s husband , Toto Wolff ) had a wife who raced . Two years ago he visited and was interested to see what I could do . I ' d had opportunities to be in a Formula One car but only as a publicity stunt three laps , end of story . Now , they are giving me the chance to be a development driver not just a one year deal , a proper chance to show what I can do .
