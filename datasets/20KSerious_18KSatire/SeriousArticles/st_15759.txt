Much of the opposition to fetal tissue research is rooted in objections to abortion . But even some who support a legal right to abortion were discomfited by the casual , even callous , way Planned Parenthood officials in the videos referred to the organs of aborted fetuses . Interestingly , though , as a result of publicity about the videos , Planned Parenthood officials say there has been an increase in the number of abortion patients wanting to donate tissue . These women know better than anyone that their abortions would have happened no matter where the fetal tissue ended up , and they want it put to use saving lives rather than consign it to the trash .
