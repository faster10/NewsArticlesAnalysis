In short , there are practical as well as ideological reasons why I think Sanders is a better candidate than Clinton ( albeit not necessarily the best Democratic candidate in the race ) . That said , I also recognize that Clinton has impressive credentials for the job of the presidency , from her pioneering years as First Lady to her careers as Senator from New York and a consistently popular Secretary of State . During that time she has accumulated reasonably left leaning record ? one can fairly hesitate to call it solidly liberal ? and is running for president this year on a range of ideas that we can get behind , often because they first came from our side .
