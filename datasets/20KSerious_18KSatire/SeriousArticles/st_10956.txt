We want to be a program that is competing at this level on a consistent basis , Swinney said . I think to do that you ve got to be a top 10 , top 15 type program year in and year out . That s the thing that I m most proud of with our program because only us and Alabama have had five 10 plus win seasons in a row . That s the type of consistency that you have to have and the type of culture that you have to establish in your program to have this opportunity . This is the culmination of seven years of a lot of consistency . Hopefully , this won t be our only time . Hopefully , we can be back . I don t know if we can make it four out of the next seven years . But it won t be for a lack of effort .
