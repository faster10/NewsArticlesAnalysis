Last May when the IMF made the last loan to Ukraine , Lagarde said : I hope Ukraine uses that to build up its industry and doesn t go to war . The next day President Petro Poroshenko said : Now that we have the loan . . . we re going to spend all the money we have militarily supporting the oligarchs in the East that are fighting against the Russian speakers . So basically the IMF loan is to finance the civil war , . . . the ethnic war of Ukrainian speakers against the Russian speakers , and the West against the East . ? ?
