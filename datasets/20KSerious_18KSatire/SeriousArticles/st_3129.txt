Providing this level of environmental information is the foundation of market based environmentalism . Government purchasers , other large purchasers such as colleges and universities or Fortune 1000 companies , and individual consumers can use the publicly available information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions along with traditional factors like price and quality to determine how they will spend their hard earned money . This approach allows the greenest products to be identified and to compete with other products for market share .
