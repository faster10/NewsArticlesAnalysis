Izmaylov : My first book was " The Pocket Watch . " The reason I wrote it is kind of an interesting story . My sister Nicole was 6 at the time , and I was reading " Harry Potter . " Nicole tried to read it , but she couldn ' t because of the vocabulary . She got pretty upset . I didn ' t like seeing her upset all the time , so I decided : " OK , I can ' t do anything with ' Harry Potter ' but what if I wrote another story for her , something that she will understand ? " And that ' s where " The Pocket Watch " came from .
