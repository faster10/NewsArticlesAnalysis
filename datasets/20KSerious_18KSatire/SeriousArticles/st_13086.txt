Russell Wilson got called out by his coaches this week and responded by throwing three touchdown passes against the 49ers . Let ' s forget about Wilson though because Thomas Rawls was the star of the game . Marshawn Lynch ' s backup ran for 209 yards , which is the second highest total in team history . Rawls ' emergence will definitely make the Seahawks coaching staff feel better about benching Beast Mode in the future if he ' s dealing with any nagging injuries . The Seahawks 508 offensive yards marks the third highest total of the Pete Carroll era .
