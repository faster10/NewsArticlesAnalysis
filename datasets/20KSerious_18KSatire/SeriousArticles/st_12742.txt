Thanks to all too frequent polling of the early states ( and we admit it , we ' re addicted to them ) , we have a decent idea of who has a shot at winning in Iowa ( Trump or Cruz ? Clinton ) ? and New Hampshire ( Trump ? Sanders ) . What candidates , voters and the media will be watching early is how well candidates do against their expectations ? ? i . e . , a pair of fourth place finishes might revitalize a Rick Santorum campaign while it might sink Marco ? Rubio . The Des Moines Register just raised expectations for both Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton in Iowa , endorsing the candidates in their respective caucuses . Rubio says the endorsement means he might have a shot in Iowa Hillary , for her part , is courting the same Iowa voters who helped Barack Obama defeat her ? in 2008 . Within a week , we ' ll know if the endorsements helped at all , or if the eventual winners will be holding up copies of the endorsements , " Dewey Defeats Truman " style .
