If only it were that simple . I hate to be awful and rain on this resurrection . But the last thing that the center right , the establishment , the responsible right , the business Republicans ? whatever you d like to call Republicans who are terrified of Trump winning the presidential nomination ? needs right now is a suddenly competitive Christie . Unless he really does catch fire and unify the center right in a way that no other candidate has thus far been able to do , he s just another warm body earning enough support to divide the anti Trump vote and deliver New Hampshire into Trump s short fingered hands . The establishment doesn t need new candidates jumping into the mix it needs them dropping out .
