Many birds found in the heart of the United States started their journeys in the great boreal forests of Canada and Alaska . Some , such as the golden eagle , emerge from the rocky cliffs bordering the free flowing rivers in the Arctic tundra .

Strikingly , fully 80 of the waterfowl species found in North America breed in Canada ' s wild forests .
