Chelsea are the team to stop , but they will be nervous . With their firepower and their quality , they are ripe for this title but they haven ' t got away from Manchester City , who have had to deal with poor form and injuries to key players . They will want to get an early trophy back at Stamford Bridge to ease the pressure , so I expect them to take the Capital One Cup . Jose Mourinho did his business early in the window and all three players Cesc Fabregas , Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois have been terrific . Courtois is the best goalkeeper in the Barclays Premier League . I wish they would stop calling it on about diving . You usually get the reputation you deserve .
