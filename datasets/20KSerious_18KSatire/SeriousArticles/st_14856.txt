Jeremy Hill emerged as a stud Fantasy back late last season , after an injury to Giovani Bernard opened up a starring role in the offense for him . He has had that starring role all season long this time around , and was one of the bigger busts in Fantasy for the first 11 weeks of the season , failing to rush for even 70 yards in any game , while averaging just 3 . 3 yards per carry and generally looking like the much less effective back next to Bernard . However , Bernard has now totaled 184 yards on the ground over his last two games , and has at least 15 carries in four of his last six games he had just two such games in the first half dozen games . Hill ' s overall track remains lackluster , and Bernard ' s presence means game script could leave Hill on the wrong side of the snap and touch distribution from time to time . However , the Cincinnati Bengals are making a concerted effort to ride Hill more in the second half of the season , and he is starting to respond well enough that it ' s nearly impossible to sit him . Of course , that could end up burning countless Fantasy owners , as Week 14 ' s matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers could be exactly the kind of game that pushes Hill to the margins of the game plan if the passing game has to take over .
