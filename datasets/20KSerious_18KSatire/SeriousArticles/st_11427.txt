Kentucky continues being a land of false hope for Democrats . Last year there was some guarded enthusiasm that Alison Lundergan Grimes might knock down ( or at least convincingly challenge ) high ranking Senate fossil Mitch McConnell in his bid for re election , but she ended up getting blown out by the ascendant majority leader on Election Day . And last night , heading into the Kentucky gubernatorial election , Democrat Jack Conway was viewed as a slight favorite over Republican Matt Bevin , but it was Bevin who came out comfortably on top once the votes were tallied , making him just the sixth GOP governor of Kentucky in the last century . The Bluegrass State seems to be busily putting the last touches on the broader disintegration of the Democratic Party in the old Confederacy .
