Prior to their 30 6 win over the Jaguars on Sunday , Hoyer missed the Texans previous two games because of a concussion . He fared well enough in his return , completing 25 of 40 passes for 249 yards , a touchdown and an interception . It s worth noting that the concussion was Hoyer s second of the season , so if he is forced to come out for any reason on Saturday , the Texans will likely turn to Brandon Weeden , who completed 26 of 42 passes for 305 yards , three touchdowns and zero interceptions during Hoyer s late season absence .
