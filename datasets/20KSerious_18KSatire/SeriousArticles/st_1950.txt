This basically is just how the WHO musters resources and tries to put forward a uniform message to all countries to respond to a health crisis . They did the same thing with Ebola . They ' ve done it with polio . Unfortunately , the WHO , ultimately , is a fairly weak institution . It ' s constantly begging for money . It doesn ' t have any real authority to sort of enforce the recommendations . It ' s just trying to point countries in the right direction and then leave it to the local countries to carry out those policies on the ground .
