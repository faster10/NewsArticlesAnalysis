Bashar al Assad is not a charismatic figure . Nor does he maintain legitimacy through the exercise of policymaking brilliance . He ' s a 3F kind of guy : he rules by force , fealty , and fear . In many ways , the Assad clan has reproduced a medieval system of authority . His father Hafez al Assad started out embracing a version of Baathism an amalgam of Syrian nationalism , pan Arabism , and quasi socialism but gradually boiled down this ideology into the " Assadism " of an unquestioned leader , a personality cult , and a hereditary dynasty . The remnants of Assadism command the loyalties of three overlapping constituencies : tribe ( around 2 million Alawites ) , party ( the 1 . 2 million members of the Baath party ) , and patronage ( government officials plus 250 , 000 in the Syrian army , including reservists ) .
