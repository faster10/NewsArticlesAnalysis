Defending Australian Open champion Jordan Spieth made one of the toughest courses in the country look almost defenceless during his course record final round , but it hasn ' t been the catalyst for some tinkering this year . The 14th and 16th holes have been lengthened , yet tournament director Trevor Herden said Spieth ' s Stonehaven Cup romp wasn ' t the trigger . " The fairways have got a lot tighter , " Herden said . ? " Errant shots will keep running and bounce off . We ' ve lengthened a couple of holes with the 16th going back 30 metres , which will put a little bit more teeth into those back four holes when you ' re trying to win a major championship . " Spieth will be paired with former world No . 1 Lee Westwood and Geoff Ogilvy in a marquee pairing at 7 . 05am for Thursday ' s first round .
