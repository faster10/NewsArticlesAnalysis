Agencies add : Most flights by Pakistan ' s ailing national airline were grounded on Wednesday , a company spokesman said , as striking employees disrupted operations to protest against a government privatisation plan . The strike is the latest in a months long series of protests against the plan to sell off part of Pakistan International Airlines ( PIA ) , among companies the government has pledged to privatise under an International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) deal . " Most of the PIA flights are not being allowed to take off from any of the airports , domestic or international , " said airline spokesman Danyal Gilani , although some returning international flights were being allowed to land .
