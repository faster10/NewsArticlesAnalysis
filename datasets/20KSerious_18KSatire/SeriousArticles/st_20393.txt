An improved running game aided him greatly . Both Ronnie Hillman , who finished with a game high 102 yards , and C . J . Anderson were able to break off several long runs of 10 yards or more , something that has been frustratingly absent in many of the previous games . The offensive line is still a concern , as Osweiler was sacked five times . But with nearly 400 yards of offense and a good balance between run and pass ( the Broncos actually finished with more rush attempts than throws for the first time this year ) this was one of Denver s best offensive performances of the season .
