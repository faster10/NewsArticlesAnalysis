Jackson , of course , is Cousins ' primary deep threat . Despite playing in only 10 games ( and I don ' t think he even got in the field for the 10th game he was active ) , he led Washington ' s receivers in targets thrown 20 plus yards down the field with 17 , per Pro Football Focus . He hauled in 10 of those passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns . His 58 . 8 percent catch rate on those passes was third best in the league . He ' s dangerous . If you let him get behind you , you ' re toast , so long as Cousins can put the ball on target .
