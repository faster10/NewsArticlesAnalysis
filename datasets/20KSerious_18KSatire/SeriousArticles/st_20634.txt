Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is uncertain , and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our projections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy . In particular , recent monetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that , with the federal funds rate near zero , we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation , economic growth , and employment than to downside shocks . This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate to be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case if short term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero . Reflecting these concerns , we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has improved appreciably .
