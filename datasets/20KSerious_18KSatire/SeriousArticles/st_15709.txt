But the truth of the matter is , Ben and his boys are going to put up points . They are . In the 12 games he ' s played this season , Pittsburgh ' s averaged 28 . 4 points per game . In his seven games since returning from his second injury , they ' ve averaged 31 . 0 points a week . They hung 30 on the Seahawks , 34 on the Broncos , and 33 on these Bengals . Barring something strange happening ( like Pittsburgh getting Bad Ben and not Big Ben ) , they seem like a damn good bet for 25 plus this Saturday , even if the Cincy defense plays well which it likely will , since it has all year .
