Mrs McCluskey ( Kathryn Joosten ) : She was the real heart of the finale . Though she ' d wanted to die at home , her doctor told her taking care of her would be too physically demanding for Roy . Just as she was about to move into hospice care , Susan , Bree , Lynette , and Gaby offered to take shifts helping Roy so she could stay . It was Gaby ' s turn the night she and Carlos were arguing over who would confess to the murder , and Mrs McCluskey overheard them . She went to court that next morning and told Trip he should call her as a witness so she could discredit Renee ' s testimony because she ' d seen her drinking the night she claimed to have seen Bree with a shovel . Instead , Mrs McCluskey confessed to the murder .
