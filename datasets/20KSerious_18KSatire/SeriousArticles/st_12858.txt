The capital Montevideo tends to divide opinion among travellers . Some blast the city for its high rise buildings and lack of colonial charm ( at least when compared to nearby Colonia ) . But the quirky capital does have some of the buzz of its rival across the water Buenos Aires , with a beautiful 19th century market near the port crammed with restaurants serving asado ( barbecue beef ) and endless bottles of wine . The city has a necklace of beaches which come alive in the summer time with events and eateries and there is a faded beauty in the crumbling towers and Art Deco buildings of the city . Tango bars and theatres have combined to give the city a reputation as a true cultural hub in Uruguay .
