Arizona at Carolina : I ' ve loved watching both these teams all season and believe this is the Game of the Year to this point , with the winner going on to win the Super Bowl . Now that that ' s out of the way I have to pick one team . And I feel like we saw the worst of both teams at different points of last weekend ' s games . I ' m confident that both teams have gotten those low moments out of them ( Carolina in the second half last Sunday Arizona ' s start and go offense at points on Saturday ) , and Arizona is too fast and too agile on the outside for Carolina . Yes , the weather may be bad , and sure , this game could be determined in the trenches . But watching both of the divisional round games back this week , ? I just don ' t see how the back of Carolina ' s defense can handle Arizona ' s wide receivers and the Cardinals ' deep game . Furthermore , I like Arizona ' s defense against Carolina ' s power offense . This will be a game for the ages and a true classic . But this Arizona dream season isn ' t ending Sunday . Arizona wins on a game winning field goal as the clock expires . On to the Super Bowl .
