Rubio is an attractive candidate . He s just the sort of person the Republican establishment would like to nominate . He fits what pundits expect in a successful politician , and on caucus night , he proved that he can get a lot of votes . But he didn t win . And when you look at polls of actual Republican voters , as opposed to party insiders or talking heads , it s far from clear that he can beat Cruz or Trump for the nomination . If Rubio fails , it won t be because he isn t the best candidate . He is . It ll be because the Republican electorate has lost its ability to choose wisely .
