Any allegations on the part of Indian state should be based on concrete evidence . It is very interesting to note that the Indian ( print ) media showed caution and moderation with respect to Pakistan s ( direct ) involvement in the incident . So has acted the Indian government led by Modi . It is healthy to observe hot lines are duly utilised by the two states to exchange views and information and to avoid any misreading of the provided evidence . The Indian side has , the other day , provided its counterpart with actionable evidences . If this is the case , Pakistan should be forthcoming and continue to engage its counterpart meaningfully . The Pathankot attack will serve as a catalyst either for cooperation or conflict between India and Pakistan . Since the two states are already meeting up , it is prudent to cooperate in letter and spirit . Let the cooperation over Pathakot attack serve as a confidence building measure . Remember , India and Pakistan will both lose if they fight another war . Both , and the region , will benefit if they cooperate , argues Professor Subrata Kumar Mitra , a world renowned political scientist . China , and even the US , should play a bridge role in this respect . Certainly , there is life post Pathankot . Let it be lived .
