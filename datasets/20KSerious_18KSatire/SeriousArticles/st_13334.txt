To explain this , let ' s go back to that tried and true analogy of the economy as a giant pie . Every worker ' s income represents some tiny slice of that pie . Add all those worker slices up into one giant slice , and you have the overall share of national income going to labor . The goal is to keep the overall size of the pie growing every year . Maybe we can get it to grow faster , maybe not . But as long as the pie grows , and as long as everyone ' s slice stays the same size relative to all the other slices , then everyone ' s income and living standards grow in real terms .
