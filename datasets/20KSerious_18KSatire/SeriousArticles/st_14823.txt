The judge ' s choice between those characterizations could be critical . Basic contract law which , subject to some exceptions , generally governs agreements in criminal cases draws a major distinction between unilateral promises and exchanges of promises . The default rule ( again subject to exceptions aren ' t lawyers great ? ) is that a unilateral promise isn ' t legally binding , but if two people exchange promises , either one can enforce the deal against the other . So if I tell you I ' m going to give you my watch , I can change my mind , and if I do you can ' t force me to follow through with my promise . But if you and I agree that I ' ll give you my watch and in turn you ' ll give me 10 , that ' s an exchange of promises in contract terms , there ' s " consideration " on both sides and either of us can enforce the deal .
