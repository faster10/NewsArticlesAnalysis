Oakland Raiders : Wide receiver Amari Cooper had two more drops in Week 11 . He is among the league leaders in that area . It has been a consistent problem all season . It hasn ' t been a big issue , however , because Cooper , the No . 4 overall pick in the draft , has been so productive this season . But in the loss to the Lions , Cooper had two drops compared to one catch . It ' s an issue that he needs to work through . Cooper is self aware and a hard worker . I think this will be a manageable problem for him to overcome . Bill Williamson
