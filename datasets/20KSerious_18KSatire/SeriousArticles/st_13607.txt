I just hope that in addition to weight loss and workout techniques , the trainers and doctors on the show have equipped her to deal with the addictive behaviors that can result from successfully getting in shape . I hope they ' ve warned her about a mental anguish that can be just as dark as the one she felt as a heavier woman , and maybe even more dangerous . And I hope they ' ve told her that despite the thrill of losing the most weight , she will not become a " loser " if she gains some back .
