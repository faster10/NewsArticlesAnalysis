Unlike the electoral college , however , the caucuses are not winner take all , so delegates will be awarded even for second and third place finishers . Delegates are awarded to candidates based on a complicated process , but how many delegates can be won at each precinct or county is fixed . It ' s assigned by the party based on history , and does not change no matter how many people show up . That means that Sanders could double , triple or even quintuple support in a precinct , but can only win so many delegates there .
