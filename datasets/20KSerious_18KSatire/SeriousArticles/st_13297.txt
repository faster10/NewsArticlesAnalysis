This was not governmental edict or bureaucratic imposition it was more in the nature of a conversation among friends . It was the kind of conversation one would have with a friend visiting our home town or state for the first time . It was a highly personal way to express our admiration for the heroism of their journey , but most importantly , through our own words and deeds convey a sense of optimism and pride in the country that was welcoming these new members and to instill a sense of continuing interest in their success . Not surprisingly , emails would typically be exchanged and telephone numbers as well and there have been occasions where I or my staff has stayed in contact , and while this is not planned human intelligence , I can tell you it yields some of the best . You see sometimes being an authentic person and not a posturing politician , pays unexpected dividends even as I ' m certain that Mrs Clinton shares the philosophical belief that virtue is its own reward . ( I recount this effort at some length in the book , Lift Up Your Hearts . ) The Clinton approach succeeded because it was premised upon the very personal and by respecting human rights it built up the image of the United States across the globe . Take that ISIS you can ' t lay a glove on genuine empathy .
