Draymond Green ' s stats represent a caricature of well roundedness : 13 . 3 points , 8 . 5 rebounds , 7 . 2 assists , 1 . 4 blocks , 38 . 8 percent from 3 point range . He has always been an ace defensive player , but now he ' s progressing quickly on the offensive end . Last season saw the advent of " Drailbreak " possessions , instances where Green grabbed a rebound and pushed it himself in transition . He has expanded on that , while directing more offense when Curry gets double teamed . He does everything on the court , save generating contested isolation jumpers . In this era , that ' s more than OK .
