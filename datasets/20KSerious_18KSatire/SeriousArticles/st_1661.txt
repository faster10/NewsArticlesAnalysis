There ' s mainly three branches , he explained . There ' s the Bob Cousy John Stockton branch , where the point guard is not necessarily a scorer but is more of a facilitator . And then there ' s the Magic Johnson Oscar Robertson tree , which is reserved for players 6 6 and above playing that position in terms of points , rebounds , and assists . LeBron James would be under that tree . And then , and I don ' t mean to pat myself on the back or anything like that , but when I came into the league you ( either ) play like Bob Cousy or you play like Magic Johnson . But I couldn ' t play like either one of them .
