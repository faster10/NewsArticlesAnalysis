What To Watch For : Panthers have played with so much emotion and focus to get to this point , and going into this environment is going to feel like the preseason to them . Look for the Titans to jump out early , and if so , that might bring out the kind of fire that has carried Carolina to this point Expect plenty of targets for Delanie Walker here who has flourished with Mariota and the Titans seemed to have more of a vertical element in their first game under interim coach Mike Mularkey Only two players in the NFL have more than Newton ' s five rushing touchdowns Titans topped 100 rushing yards as a team Sunday for the first time since Week 2 , but that was against a soft Saints front . It ' s a much different challenge here and a lack of balance will cripple Mariota against this defense Titans have caused nine sacks and picked off five passes in their last four games . Dick LeBeau ' s principles are sinking in Would like to see Dexter McCluster sprinkled in a little bit more for Tennessee A win here and we would be legitimately talking about the Titans playoff hopes given the despair of the AFC South .
