Republicans are currently in a frenzy over Syria . This frenzy spread quickly across the entire party governors , members of Congress and ( of course ) presidential candidates . But for all their noise , I notice there is not a single voice crying out to actually change anything in the most concrete way they have at their disposal . Republicans hold both houses of Congress . They are fully able ( but , obviously , not fully capable ) to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) bill which would direct President Obama on how to wage war with the Islamic State in Syria , Iraq and elsewhere . So the answer to any wild plan any Republican proposes ( and , already , there are too many of these to list ) on what to do about the Islamic State or Syria has to be : " Well then , why don ' t you write up an AUMF with that idea and put it on the president ' s desk ?
