While Hispanic immigrants are accused of driving down wages , economic studies have found the opposite to be true . Conducting research on the effects of immigration on wages over the span of a decade for the National Bureau of Economic Research , Gianmarco Ottaviano , of the University of Bologna , and Giovanni Peri , of the University of California , Davis , found that nearly 90 of native born American workers actually enjoy higher wages because of immigration . They found that immigrants have a positive impact on the U . S . economy because they differ in their educational and skill levels from U . S . natives , and because more workers in the labor force increases productivity and stimulates the creation of businesses .
