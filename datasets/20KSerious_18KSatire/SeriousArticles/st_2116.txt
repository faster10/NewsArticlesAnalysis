SVG can ' t help himself : Remember this video last week of Van Gundy ' s rant against the Cleveland Cavaliers for firing coach David Blatt ? Well , he wasn ' t done . Before Friday ' s game against the Cavs , Van Gundy was asked about expectations when a new coach takes over . Typically , of course , they ' re low as most firings happen when a team is struggling . But Tyronn Lue inherited a Cleveland team in first place in the East . " If you go back to the NBA Finals , it was a neutral move , " Van Gundy said . " If you win it all , it was a good move . If you don ' t get to the Finals , it was a bad move . That ' s on ( general manager ) David Griffin not Ty Lue . "
