The host French have attempted to , some officials say , get a joint statement out of the heads of states on November 30 to guide the negotiations through the trickiest bits , including how the world will deliver the finance to fight climate over next decade and a half , at least . That is a big ticket issue at Paris but certainly not the only minefield the negotiators have to navigate through in the 19 days of negotiations .
