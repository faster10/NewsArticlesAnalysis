I landed Saturday evening from Montevideo . It was about a 12 hour flight . It takes a few days normally to get over the time difference , which is just three hours . Not too much of an issue . Throughout the year we re having to deal with jet lag and travel . We find ways to deal with that . I know what I need to do to get my body in the best shape if I m going to play . I feel fine . It s obviously helped me physically to go to South America and play on the clay . It s not like I m coming from a 12 hour flight and changing surface .
