Team Paul has certainly made some big errors this year , such as exclusively focusing on Iowa and New Hampshire . Although he did well in both , only a first in either would have really justified the expense . Thereafter , the campaign unwisely ignored South Carolina and Florida , reasoning that their expensive media markets weren ' t worth the effort . As a consequence , Paul was ignored for weeks until Nevada . I am informed by Paul sources that their campaign was counting on Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum to drop out after they realized they couldn ' t win , which would have allowed Ron Paul to emerge as the only conservative challenger to Romney .
