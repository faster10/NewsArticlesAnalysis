A February 2015 email to Snyder contained background on Flint ' s water situation from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality , the state ' s top water regulator , mostly addressing advisories related to bacteria and chemical treatment byproducts that popped up in Flint ' s water . Flint residents had been complaining about the taste and color of their water since the city , which was under the control of a Snyder appointed emergency manager , switched from Detroit ' s water system to the Flint River as its water source in April 2014 . ?
