Franca Melis , who owns a small enoteca called La Galera in Castello on the top of the island ' s hill and a dive shop down in the port , says it is hypocritical for islanders to complain that the Concordia has ruined their livelihood especially in the port . The economic slump surely has as much to do with a drop in tourists , and anyway , even in good years people were never able to rent their properties year round like they do now to the salvage workers . She even sees a silver lining . She is lobbying other islanders to push to keep the massive platforms Titan Micoperi installed to stabilize the ship even after the Concordia is towed away .
