The caller was disturbed about those in the inner circle of her husband driving their racial stereotypes and as making racial comments in front of her . When I keep hearing folks talk about the need for a national conversation about race , it ' s not all about Obama leading it . If we are to conquer our racial demons , it ' s necessary for the caller ' s white husband to be as willing to look his friends and family members in the eye and say , " your comments are insulting to my wife and I want you to stop . Now ! "
