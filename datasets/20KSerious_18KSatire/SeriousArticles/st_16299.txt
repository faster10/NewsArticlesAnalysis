There s a certain poignancy to the sight of Zuckerberg redeeming the figure of the Silicon Valley philanthropist with a heartfelt missive to his young daughter , because over the last decade , no one has done more to tarnish that figure s reputation . His best known philanthropic intervention to date remains his gift of 100 million to the Newark public school system in 2010 ? announced with great fanfare on Oprah . Though there is some debate over the extent to which the gift improved educational outcomes in the city , what is indisputable is how quickly public opinion soured on the gesture . Zuckerberg hoped to make Newark a model for education reform , but it became a cautionary tale of another sort . His gift came to represent for many the worst of philanthropic hubris ? an impatient , big footed effort to parachute into a city he knew little about , with a team of high priced consultants and scheming politicians , and with little consultation with the families and teachers he purported to be saving from rotten schools .
