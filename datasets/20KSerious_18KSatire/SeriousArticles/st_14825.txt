The fact that this decision was non binding has a number of consequences . First , it would have been a highly questionable decision for Cosby to testify in the civil deposition based solely on a non binding nonprosecution announcement . I ' ve encountered this situation in my own practice , and when I hear from a prosecutor that she ' s decided not to bring charges , I of course pass that good news on to my client but I always remind him that that ' s not a binding decision , and that all of the cautionary advice I ' ve given ( such as not talking about the case ) still applies .
