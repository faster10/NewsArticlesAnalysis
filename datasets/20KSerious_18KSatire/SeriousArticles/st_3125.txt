What are BP ' s offshore operations ? BP took over two big American oil companies in the 1990 ' s , ARCO and AMOCO which gives BP access to many U . S . oil fields and refineries . There has been a slew of new oil and gas finds in the Gulf of Mexico in deep water . BP , like many of its competitors , is drilling exploration wells there to gauge the oil and gas potential . The well , known as Mississippi Canyon ( MC ) Block 252 , is in the ' Macondo prospect ' . The well in question is 65 percent owned by BP and has other oil companies as minority partners . It ' s the norm these days for competitors to invest in these speculative wells .
