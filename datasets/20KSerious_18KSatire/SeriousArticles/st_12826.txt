Day Lewis ' performance has a beautiful gravitas , yet there ' s nothing too severe about it . He gives Lincoln a surprisingly plainspoken , reedy high voice that retains the courtly cadences of the South . That voice from everything we know , it ' s quite accurate makes Lincoln sound like Will Rogers as a professor of human nature . This Lincoln lives deep inside his own unruly haired head , yet he loves the people around him , even the ignorant ( and racist ) common folk , who repay the favor by loving him back . And that ' s where he draws his political force .
