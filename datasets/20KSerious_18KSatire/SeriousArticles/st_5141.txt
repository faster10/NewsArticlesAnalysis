His able Syrian envoy Robert Ford quit in disgust . The pattern continues . I recall back in 2011 that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton developed a thoughtful , articulate , coherent Syria policy with Ford ' s team only to be thwarted by the NSC jayvee squad that could not bear having Mrs Clinton lead a Syria policy forward ) . She had carefully orchestrated a strategic coalition of Syrian moderates , Turkey , and Arabs to lay the groundwork for a systematic campaign of dual political and military support for what was then a worthy block of Syrian moderates at a time when the Assad regime was at its most vulnerable politically and militarily . On the eve of her departure to Istanbul for a carefully crafted " Friends of Syria " meeting Rhodes and Rice pulled the rug out from underneath her . Shameful . The alibi : Hillary wants boots on the grounds . Now look what has happened promises thrown to the winds for what appears to be nothing more than political expediency when you scratch the surface .
