Being president of the United States is a serious job . Are there " Ted for President " signs in our future ? Unlikely . Were we encouraged to " Vote for Mitt " ? Nope . The U . S . Army , meanwhile , is one of the most regimented organizations in the world , whose values put dignity and respect at top priority . Cadets don ' t call their commanding officers by their first names , even maybe especially if they ' re women . So why are we all referring to the possible next commander in chief as if we ' re part of her circle of close pals ?
