The Primetime Emmys have found their next host!  Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Andy Samberg will take the reins of the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, Fox announced on Thursday. Samberg, an Emmy winner for Saturday Night Live viral sensation “D*** in a Box” and a Golden Globe winner, promised an entertaining ride at the live telecast, airing live coast-to-coast Sunday, Sept. 20 from 8-11 p.m. ET/5-8 p.m. PT on Fox. WATCH: Andy Samberg Returns to 'Saturday Night Live'! “Buckle your seat belts, Emmy viewers!” Samberg said in an enthusiastic statement. “Like, in general you should buckle your seat belts in your car. In fact, even if you’re not an Emmy viewer, you should buckle your seat belt. It can be dangerous on the road. Also, if you’re not an Emmy viewer, you should strongly consider becoming one this year, because I’m hosting, and it’s gonna be a wild ride. So buckle your seat belts.” Will his Lonely Island friends, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer, join in on the action? We’d like to think so! That way, we can get some awesome musical interludes, such as this. WATCH: Kyra Sedgwick Pays a Visit to 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Or memorable spoofs of big TV moments, such as this O.C. parody.
