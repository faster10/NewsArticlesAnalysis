This is part of why Belichick is so great . He doesn t underestimate anyone . He treats every opponent with the respect that professional athletes and teams deserve . for being , you know , professionals . It s why the Patriots routinely blow the doors off of inferior opponents and sometimes make talented opponents look downright silly . He doesn t scoff at opponents the way the media and fans ( myself included ) tend to do . ( Not sure what happened with that Philly game , but that s an exception to the rule . ) Manning may be reduced to a million dollar brain with a ten cent arm , but Belichick s defense will approach this game as if he s the Manning of old sort of .
