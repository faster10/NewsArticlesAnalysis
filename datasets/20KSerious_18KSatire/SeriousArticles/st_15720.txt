As Logan and his charge hit the road , sparks fly , ninjas attack , and Wolverine begins to experience something he never has before " the actual fear of death . He ' s been sapped of his eternal life force and now , when he gets into one of his signature slice and dice brawls , the wounds he suffers no longer cauterize and heal . He ' s both physically and emotionally vulnerable . In other words , human . All of this makes for a Wolverine tale that ' s more loaded with psychological questions ( his immortality is seen as a curse ) and makes the haunted character more interesting . Still , that ' s no excuse for the film ' s gauzy dream sequences with Famke Janssen ' s Jean Grey and its overall bloat , which leads up to a preposterous ( and endless ) final half hour .
