The trilogy ' s finale , Allegiant , is scheduled for March 18 , 2016 , showing Hollywood ' s continued faith in spring as a box office launchpad after the success of recent March hits like The Hunger Games ( 408 million total ) and Oz the Great and Powerful ( 234 million ) . ( However , after the first Hunger Games installment ' s release , Lionsgate did bump the remainder of the trilogy into the more competitive Thanksgiving time frame . )
