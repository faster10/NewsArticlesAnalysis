" One of the biggest variables in a woman not wearing a bra is that she is thinner and has smaller breasts and may not need the support of a bra . We know that having a leaner body mass does not put a woman at an increased risk of breast cancer , " Dr Therese Bevers , Medical Director of the Cancer Prevention Center at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , told CBS News . " Conversely , a woman who is overweight or obese is much more likely to have larger breasts that are heavy and she needs the support of a bra . But it ' s not the bra that ' s increasing her risk of breast cancer , it ' s the weight . "
