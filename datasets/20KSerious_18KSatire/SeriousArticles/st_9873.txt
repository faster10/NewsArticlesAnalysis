" I think the biggest thing for me is getting over the mental hump of being able to go out there and still compete , " Irving said Thursday afternoon . " I ' ve kind of been itching for the last few weeks , but finally getting my trainers ' clearance as well as our organization to go out there and practice with the guys , have 5 on 5 , going up and down , finally being able to hit guys a little bit and have guys hit me , as a competitor , I ' ve been itching for that . There ' s no better place to be than escaping here with guys that I call my brothers . We ' re part of a big family . We definitely have a little ways to go before I get back on the court with the guys , but this week has been great . "
