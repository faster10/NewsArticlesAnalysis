ABOUT THE REDSKINS ( 4 5 ) : Washington is looking for its first back to back wins of the season after an impressive showing against the Saints in which it racked up 510 total yards . Kirk Cousins went 20 of 25 for 324 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions , and the Redskins rolled up a season high 209 rushing yards in their highest scoring output of the season . The offense will spend a lot of time on the sideline Sunday , though , if Washington s 30th ranked rush defense ( 135 . 3 yards per game ) can t find a way to slow down Carolina s powerful ground game .
