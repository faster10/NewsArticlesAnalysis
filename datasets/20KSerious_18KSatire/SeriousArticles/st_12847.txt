Most people ( up to 80 percent ) who get infected don t have any symptoms at all . Otherwise , the initial signs are banal , chikungunya esque ailments including mild fever , fatigue , headache , joint pain , and bloodshot eyes . Those are actually symptoms of a dengue infection as well , so lab tests are needed to discriminate between Zika , dengue , and chikungunya ( or to detect co infections ) . Something called a maculopapular rash ? red circles covered with little bumps ? might also be a telltale symptom of Zika . Symptoms last about a week , and by all accounts fatalities are very rare .
