St . Louis Rams : This has the feeling of a dangerous game for the Rams , who are coming off a disappointing overtime loss and will see a huge amount of Bears fans in the Edward Jones Dome . But Chicago ' s No . 9 defensive ranking is a little misleading . Chicago ' s offense has the fourth highest time of possession in the NFL , which is effective at limiting how much the defense is on the field . It ' s a fine formula , except the Bears haven ' t beaten a defense as good as the one they will see Sunday . The Bears are 27th in the NFL in run defense , giving up 4 . 63 yards per carry , which should allow Rams running back Todd Gurley to break a big one or two . That , combined with a Rams defense that dominated a more talented Adam Gase run offense with the Broncos a year ago , should be enough to get St . Louis back in the win column . Rams 23 , Bears 10 .
