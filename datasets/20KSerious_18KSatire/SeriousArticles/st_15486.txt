Two concerns have driven considerable opposition to the Politico account . First is Politico s assertion that Carson had actually applied to West Point , a contention that he doesn t appear to have made . As noted by The Post s David Weigel , the campaign vehemently denied an application to West Point : He was introduced to folks from West Point by his ROTC Supervisors , Weigel quotes Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett as saying . They told him they could help him get an appointment based on his grades and performance in ROTC . He considered it but in the end did not seek admission .
