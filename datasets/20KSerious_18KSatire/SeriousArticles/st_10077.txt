State courts are not bound by the federal standards and have heard challenges from such voters . But these claims often fail because states are not required to look at a candidate ' s qualifications . New Hampshire is an outlier : Many states don ' t look at whether a candidate is eligible to be president before placing him or her on the ballot . They accept the paperwork and happily accept the filing fee then list the candidate on the ballot . Socialist Workers Party candidate R ger Calero , for example , appeared on several ballots around the country in 2004 and again in 2008 despite being a Nicaraguan citizen .
