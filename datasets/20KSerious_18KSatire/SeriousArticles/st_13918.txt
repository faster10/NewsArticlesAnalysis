SF : Tennis is a huge betting sport . It runs virtually all year round , ? all over the world with a range of levels from amateurs living a dream ? through to super rich superstars , it ' s relatively simple to follow , and the TV and online coverage is second to none . It ' s the perfect sport for corruption because it is one on one . One player intent on losing the match can do it in such a way that the other knows nothing about it , he just thinks that the other player is slightly off his game got out of bed the wrong way affected by the wind or sun etc . Anyone who has played the game at an amateur level can understand these issues . A top level player with bad morals can control his game so well that lines are being missed consistently by a few inches . ? Nobody is stupid enough to put them into the next or back fence every ? time .
