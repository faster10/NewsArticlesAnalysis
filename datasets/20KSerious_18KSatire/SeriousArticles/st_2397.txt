But as left wing critics of the Democratic consensus have long argued , there s a problem with analogizing the ACA and Social Security . One of the programs is universal ? everyone puts in everyone takes out ? and the other isn t . And this isn t incidental . It s the reason why so many Tea Party types will rail against handouts but cherish their Medicare . It s because they believe they re simply receiving what they re owed ( they aren t ) and that the benefits go to them instead of good for nothing moochers .
