One is that democracy starts to unravel if a few people become wildly , ethereally successful , while the rest of a country struggles . That was the best argument I heard on a recent phone call with Cedric Wermuth , a Swiss politician who has been one of the earliest proponents of the 1 : 12 initiative . Wermuth is not arguing for the enforced pay ratio on practical or economic grounds . His is a moral position that it is fundamentally unfair for the pay gap to be so wide , and that it allows a few uber rich people to wield undo influence over society , economics and politics .
