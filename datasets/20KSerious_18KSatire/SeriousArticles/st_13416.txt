Under our Constitution , massive overnight change is impossible unless you win elections . If the tea party wants results , it needs to elect candidates who can win and deliver votes in the House and Senate . In many ways , the tea party ' s fight is not with President Obama or with Speaker John Boehner . It ' s with James Madison . The tea party can ' t be President Obama ' s check and balance without realizing that under our Constitution the President also gets to be the tea party ' s check and balance .
