For what it ' s worth , I liked " Chinese Democracy . " Yes , it was a bit over produced . And even with layers upon layers of guitar sounds , Axl simply couldn ' t match what Izzy and Slash used to accomplish together . Still , Axl ' s ability to write solid rock songs was present on tracks like " Better " and " Shackler ' s Revenger . " Given that Slash and Duff McKagan have remained active , and assuming they can get along with Slash , the band could produce some solid new music for fans over the next few years .
