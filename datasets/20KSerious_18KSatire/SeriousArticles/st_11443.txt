The Cardinals are an effective running game in most situations , in part because defenses are terrified of John Brown and Larry Fitzgerald beating them deep . So they position their safeties somewhere near the tunnel . In short yardage situations , that isn ' t the case . The Cards have converted just 51 percent of their power runs this season when the league average is a robust 65 percent . That ' s the fourth worst rate in football , and it ' s a stark contrast to the Cam Newton led Panthers . Carolina ' s offense picks up 76 percent of power situations , the second best rate in football .
