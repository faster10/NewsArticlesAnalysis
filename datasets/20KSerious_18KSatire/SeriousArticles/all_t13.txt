Obama Administration: Netanyahu win won't affect Iran talks

In the video above, CBS News correspondent Major Garrett explains that the administration did say it will reevaluate how to pursue a two-state solution in light of Netanyahu's reversal from his 2009 endorsement of a separate Palestinian state.
