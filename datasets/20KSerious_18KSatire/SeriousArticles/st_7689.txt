So as you listen to the politicians shouting at each other in Washington , they are drawing a very bright line and letting you know what really matters to them . Ask yourself , " Who has my and my family ' s best interests in mind ? " The folks looking out for public health or the folks representing polluters who don ' t want to invest in America , or in their employees " not to mention the facilities that are now finally being forced to live up to the law ? The folks who see opportunities to bring manufacturing back to America as we shift to cleaner energy or those working to keep things just the way they are " no matter the price ? The answer is pretty clear . And that is what we need right now .
