As strange as this may sound , I do not doubt the faith that lies behind the right wing distaste for democracy , or at least no more than I doubt the conflicted zealotry that lies behind militant Islam . Both sides correctly observe that the various strains of post Jeffersonian democracy in the Western world have been plagued with problems from the beginning , and now face a dire crisis . Both the Western right and fundamentalist Islam yearn to pull their societies back toward a purer distillation of faith and a collective sense of purpose , and what could serve that purpose better than an apocalyptic clash of civilizations ? They see the salvation of their respective societies in the rejection of the flabby ideal of democracy , explicitly or otherwise , and its replacement with a more virile , more godly and more effective system .
