As usual at this time of the year , I have been at many social gatherings yet nobody was talking about the game at Murrayfield which is a shame . Aim for 60 , 000 and if you only get 40 , 000 on first attempt , make sure the experience is such that we fill it the following year . There is an element of a feel good factor within Scottish Rugby with Glasgow doing so well and Scotland having a promising Autumn Series so this was the time to try something different . None of this is ground breaking , it is what many clubs have done with success for a number of years and I hope we have a crack at this next year .
