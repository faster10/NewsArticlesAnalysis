This impression is driven home by actually reading the issue . The ? editors can t quite seem to decide what their exact objections to Trump are .

They ll throw everything they ve got , even contradictory stuff , at the reader and hope the sheer volume of words impresses them enough to vote for Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush .
