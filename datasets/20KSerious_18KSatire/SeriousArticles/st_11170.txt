Do wormholes exist ? Black holes certainly do , but nobody has yet glimpsed any sign of its cousin , the wormhole . Furthermore , some physicists are so uneasy about their potential for being portals to the past that they flat out reject the very idea . The problem concerns those familiar time travel paradoxes , like going back in time and murdering your mother before you were born . Physicists call these causal loop paradoxes , and they affront our desire for the universe to be a rational and ordered system . If cause and effect get muddled up in time , what does that do for our notions of reality ?
