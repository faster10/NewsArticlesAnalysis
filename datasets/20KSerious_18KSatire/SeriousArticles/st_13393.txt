That scene in 601 where she ' s walking around with drinks and Morgan ' s like " you always seem like you ' re ready for something , " and she doesn ' t know what to say , so she goes " aren ' t you sweet ? " It ' s that classic Southern moment of " I ' m going to be a gentlewoman here , but I really want to tell you to go f k yourself I just don ' t know how to do it and still be civil , so I ' m just gonna tell you ' aren ' t you sweet ? ' " It was that moment of , forgive the expression , game recognizing game . They looked at each other in that moment , and Morgan knew who she is , and Carol knew that he knew , so there was that moment of " okay , we ' ll see how this thing ' s gonna go . "
