In the Republican race , the Iowa state polling currently shows that Ted Cruz might have peaked just a bit too early . For the past few weeks , the storyline has been that Cruz might just beat Trump when the voters finally get to have their say , but since then the polling has shifted back in Trump ' s direction . This may be due to Trump pointing out that Cruz was born in Canada which , beyond the simplistic " birther " line the media gobbled up , is a much more subtle dig at Cruz . After all , both candidates have made being anti immigrant a centerpiece of their campaigns , so Trump is essentially asking Iowa GOP voters if a Canadian born Cruz is really the best man to make that argument . Before Trump brought the issue up , many Republican voters in Iowa were unaware of where Cruz was born . Now that they have been informed of the fact , Cruz has slipped in the polls and Trump has regained his lead . Perhaps other factors are at work ( Sarah Palin ' s endorsement may also be helping Trump , to name just one ) , but Trump playing the birther card seems to have succeeded , for now .
