We love our fans the main thing is , we don ' t listen to everything they tell us . We think that giving everybody what they want all the time isn ' t the way to actually give them what they want . I have two children and if I loved them , they would eat cookies for breakfast and cookies for lunch and cookies for dinner , and that wouldn ' t actually be what they ' d want , because they would get stomach aches . You watch " The Walking Dead " because people you love die . . . whether you admit it , that is part of the reason you watch the show , so if we stopped killing characters you loved , you wouldn ' t like the show anymore ! So we embrace the outrage and the hostility as just another expression of love .
