Well my phone has been blowing up . I talked to Nelsan and his phone was blowing up . He was like , " People are about to start a riot over you . " I think that ' s so sweet to know that people out there are really upset and some people are like , " I ' m not watching the show anymore ! " I ' m like , C ' mon guys . But it ' s not over . It ain ' t over til the fat lady sings . I ' m just gonna take it one day at a time . As I said , I haven ' t seen any scripts from next season , but I know that I ' m involved I just don ' t know in what way .
