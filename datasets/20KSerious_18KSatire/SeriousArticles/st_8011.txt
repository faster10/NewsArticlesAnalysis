Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is a great businessman who is not used to losing , but it is difficult to put together a football team that can play well and win . He assumes that , when you do not win , you can arrogantly dismiss one coach and appoint another without explaining why . Zinedine Zidane is there only to reverse Rafa Benitez ? ? ? s shortage of wins . I do not think Perez has the vision to seek a representative style , which other teams do have . Just like , as a businessman , his goal was to earn money , his current objective is to get points .
