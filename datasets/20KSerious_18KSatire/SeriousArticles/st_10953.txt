Along with producers Rik Simpson and StarGate , Coldplay has enlisted a few friends to help get its groove back each makes a choice contribution but never obscures . Whether it s Noel Gallagher s guitar and Merry Clayton s testifying shouts infusing the appropriately titled Up Up with bristling energy and soul , or Tove Lo s sugary vocals bringing sweetness to the willowy Fun , this remains identifiably a group effort . ( A sample of President Obama singing Amazing Grace ? sadly , from a mass shooting victim s funeral ? lends poignance to Kaleidoscope . )
