Shaun Draughn at Browns : Running backs against the Browns is the mantra this season . Cleveland is 29th in run defense DVOA . No team has allowed more rushing yards . Running backs average over 4 . 79 YPC against the Browns , while Cleveland is allowing the sixth most fantasy points to the position . Draughn will put this one to test . He s by no means a splashy play as more of a get what s blocked runner , but Draughn has been drowning in touches since joining the 49ers . He s averaging 19 . 5 touches per game in his four weeks with the team and scored his first touchdown last Sunday against the Bears . The ceiling isn t high , but there s a safe floor here , and that s just as good sometimes . Draughn is a borderline RB2 in standard formats , and must start in PPR leagues .
