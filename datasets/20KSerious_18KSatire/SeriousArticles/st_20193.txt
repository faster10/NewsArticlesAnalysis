Consider : Research by Sonja Lyubomirsky , a leading happiness researcher , has consistently found that people report feeling happier after doing nice things for others . Several neuroscience studies have found that giving to others activates pleasure regions of the brain . Research by psychologists Lara Aknin and Elizabeth Dunn has even suggested that spending money on others makes you happier than spending on yourself . And a Canadian study published last year , led by Myriam Mongrain , found that after people supported others compassionately for just five to 15 minutes every day for a week , the compassionate people reported significant gains in happiness and self esteem six months later .
