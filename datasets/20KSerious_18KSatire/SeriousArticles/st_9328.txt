But that s not all . Some Bernie supporters may have turned to Bernie because they had opted to turn away from Hillary . The first woman aspiring to be president has run a campaign that emphasised her accomplishments over the last two decades . The end result was not just a me me message , but a message that threw a furtive glance over her shoulder to the past . The first socialist aspiring to be president , on the other hand , has run a campaign that eschewed the me me factor ? Bernie , for example , never gloated over or ever reminded his audiences , not once , of his days as a young idealist and activist in the 1960s who was out there in August 1963 , joining The March on Washington , when Martin Luther King delivered his iconic I Have a Dream speech ? but rather focused on the future .
