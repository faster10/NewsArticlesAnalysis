" God bless my father because he did some wonderful things and he was brilliant , he was a genius , but one day he said , ' If you guys ever stop singing I will drop you like a hot potato . ' It hurt me . You would think he would think , ' These kids have a heart and feelings . ' Wouldn ' t he think that would hurt us ? If I said something like that to Prince and Paris , that would hurt . You don ' t say something like that to children and I never forgot it . It affects my relationship with him today . "
