Biskupic : You have that scene on the afternoon of May 26 , 2009 , after he President Barack Obama had announced it . He was somewhat ambivalent it went down to the wire with Sotomayor and at least two other candidates , and he announces she ' s his choice , and suddenly , the nation is electrified . He sees it suddenly everyone wants to be a " wise Latina . " He realizes that he ' s played into this wonderful national moment of diversity and he tells his aide that he ' s really glad he ' s done what he ' s done . And then just a few weeks later , we have Republican Sen . Lindsey Graham with a nod toward that sort of enthusiasm , saying , " Unless you have a complete meltdown , Judge Sotomayor , you ' re going to be confirmed . " He captured it . This was a nomination that really did capture the attention of people out in America of all ethnicities and races .
