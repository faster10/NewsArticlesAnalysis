I think I understand why they did that . As a new parent of a wonderful baby girl ( now eight months old ) , I immediately saw the world differently ? that is to say , as a terrifying hellscape of dangers lurking in wait for my tiny , vulnerable child . I remember weeping as we left the hospital , my tiny baby buckled safely into her new carseat , oblivious as we pulled out into the New York City traffic , suddenly filled with hazards literally at every turn . I body blocked as much as I could on that ride home , draped over her as she snoozed calmly , looking out the windows at the cars and trucks and buses and pedestrians and bikes and seeing them with new menace .
