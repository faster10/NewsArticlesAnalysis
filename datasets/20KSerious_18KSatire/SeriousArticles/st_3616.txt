I don t suspect I need to lay out here all the ways that the American right , faced with an evident demographic disadvantage , has sought to disenfranchise its opponents , poison the political and legislative process and transfer power to the super rich . As I and others have repeatedly observed , the great victory of the Koch brothers and the Republican brain trust in the 2014 midterm election lay not just in the GOP s huge congressional majority but in the shocking 36 . 6 percent turnout , the lowest in any national election since World War II . The American right cannot return to a system where only property owning white men are allowed to vote , at least not without visibly ripping up the Constitution . But it has gone a long way toward creating an environment that discourages and disheartens everyone else , and where the Angry White Male vote is coddled and inflamed and privileged in numerous ways .
