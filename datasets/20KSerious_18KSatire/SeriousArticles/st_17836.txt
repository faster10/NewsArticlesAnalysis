The times they are a changing on the entire political issue of marijuana . It used to be treated as a joke any politician could use some form of : " Why are you asking me that , what have you been smoking ? Hyuck yuck yuck ! " to skate away from even discussing the issue in any sort of serious way . Now , every Republican candidate for president supports medical marijuana in one form or another .

Which is one of the reasons we ' re looking forward to tomorrow night ' s debate .
