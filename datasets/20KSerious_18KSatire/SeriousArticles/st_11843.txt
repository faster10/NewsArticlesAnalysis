After Never Let Me Down , Bowie embarked on his first tour in five years , hanging a 60 foot spider from the rafters above his elaborately choreographed dancers ( including one , Melissa Hurley , who was his girlfriend for a time ) . When he performed in West Berlin in June 1987 , in a city where he and Iggy Pop had once decamped to retreat from drugs and fame , he pulled out his 10 year old masterpiece Heroes , which deals with a couple kissing just for one day before the Berlin Wall permanently separates them . Bowie knew East Berliners were listening too : We send our wishes to all our friends who are on the other side of the wall . A week later , President Reagan delivered his Mr Gorbachev , tear down this wall speech . Two years later , the wall finally fell . We kind of heard that some East Berliners might actually get the chance to hear the thing , but we didn t realize in what numbers they would , he told interviewer Bill DeMain . And there were thousands on the other side that had come close to the wall . And we would hear them cheering and singing along from the other side . God , even now I get choked up . Bowie may have been foundering artistically ? he would soon try to right himself by forming the quartet Tin Machine ? but his cultural influence remained intact .
