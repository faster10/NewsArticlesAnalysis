For a while on Sunday , it looked like the New York Giants were about to pull off yet another fourth quarter comeback to defeat the New England Patriots , but the Patriots were able to flip the script and earn a 27 26 victory at MetLife Stadium . The Patriots remain undefeated with a 9 0 record , one half game ahead of the 8 0 Cincinnati Bengals , who host the Houston Texans Monday night . With the Denver Broncos dropping to 7 2 after losing 29 13 to the Kansas City Chiefs this week , it now appears to be a two team race for the No . 1 playoff seed in the AFC .
