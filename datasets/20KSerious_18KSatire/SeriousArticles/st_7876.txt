Gooding : Partly a lack of role models , partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family , in work . But also I think there is still I don ' t like to call it a glass ceiling , but I think there is still an unseen barrier for women , which is that , if you ask most business people , would they like to promote more women , they would all say yes , they ' d love to : " Where are these women , I want to promote them , " will be the answer . But often they don ' t really automatically think of a woman first for a top job .
