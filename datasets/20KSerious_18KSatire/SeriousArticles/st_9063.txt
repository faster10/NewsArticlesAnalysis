I ' m not going to weigh in the relative merits of the Occupy Wall Street protests . Suffice it to say I ' m sympathetic with their critique that our economy and political system is too beholden to the interests of Wall Street , overlooking or even abusing the middle class and the poor . In fact , polls show that more than two thirds of Americans think major corporations , banks and financial institutions have too much power in our society . Yet I imagine there are some fed up Americans nonetheless scratching their heads as to why a bunch of their fellow citizens are camped out in our nation ' s financial headquarters in New York .
