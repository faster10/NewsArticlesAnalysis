Over the past year and a half , authorities have arrested at least 66 Muslims ( including refugees ) in the United States ? on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks ? or supporting ISIS , ? so clearly , our much touted vetting procedures leave something to be desired . ( Not all were from immigrant communities four out of 10 ? were converts to Islam . ) If we accept Muslim Syrian asylum seekers , what sort of margin of error would be acceptable ? What if , say , 13 percent ( per the poll mentioned above ) of the 10 , 000 Syrians President Obama hopes to admit prove to be ISIS sympathizers ? That would be 1 , 300 people . Earlier in the year , FBI director James Comey ? warned of the possibly thousands ? of ISIS supporters already in the United States , which means that increasingly the needles in the haystack are invisible to us . We ve already got these folks ? on the potential warpath . ? Is it prudent to add more to their ranks ? If we do , we should not delude ourselves about the risks .
