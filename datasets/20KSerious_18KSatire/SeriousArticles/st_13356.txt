Following the new guidelines announcement , Dr Judy Salerno , President and CEO of Susan G . Komen ( best known for its Race for the Cure events all over the world ) responded , " Although guidelines may differ regarding the age at which routine screening should begin , there is agreement that mammography is the best available tool for detecting breast cancer and that women and their health care providers should decide when those screenings should begin for individuals . " Salerno further pointed out that the timing of mammography fails to take into consideration that " women must have better and more accurate information about their individual risk for breast cancer so that they and their providers can make informed decisions about the screening schedule that is right for them . " As I wrote in my previous post , there is grave risk that the new guidelines will create the perfect storm for a slippery slope whereby insurance companies will have an open door to deny coverage for screening mammography . As Dr Salerno also noted , while the new guidelines aren ' t binding on health care providers or payers , " we are concerned that they have the potential to lead to reduced accessibility to and coverage for health screenings from both private and public insurers .
