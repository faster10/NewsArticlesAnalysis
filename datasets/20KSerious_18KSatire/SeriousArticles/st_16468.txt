The February forum scheduled for Feb . 26 , at the University of Houston was the only Republican primary debate set to be co hosted by a Hispanic news organization , with National Review as the conservative media partner . Priebus said a debate will still occur on that date , and National Review will still be a part of it , but he did not say whether another Spanish language media organization will be involved . The relationship between the two organizations is not necessarily dead , and NBC News said in a statement they plan to work with the RNC to resolve their issues .
