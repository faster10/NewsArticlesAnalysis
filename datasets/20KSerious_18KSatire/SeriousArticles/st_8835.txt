All but Syndergaard from that group already has undergone Tommy John surgery . Matz and Syndergaard never have gone through a full major league season . ? The history of the game suggests not everyone stays healthy together . ? And all four just endured the heaviest workloads of their pro careers . So if you trade one , lose one to injury and have one regress , suddenly there is no depth . That is why ? unless there is an ideal trade ? the Mets should keep Jonathon Niese and see if they can re sign Bartolo Colon . There is strength in these numbers .
