Also : The chemistry between Willis and Rickman is truly magical . First of all , it was a stroke of genius to pit Gruber ? such an imperious , arrogant ( and well , European ) character ( " Benefits of a classical education , " he muses at one point ) ? against Willis ' s blue collar McClane . Gruber identifies tailor made suits on sight McClane spends the film shoeless and clad in an ever filthier undershirt . I ' m just spit balling here , but that juxtaposition must have had some real life allegory : After all , Willis was fresh off Moonlighting at the time and Rickman was discovered doing Dangerous Liaisons .
