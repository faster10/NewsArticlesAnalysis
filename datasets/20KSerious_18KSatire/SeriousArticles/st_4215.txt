The Jim Jacobs Warren Casey score for the 1971 premiere Kingston Mines Theatre production in Chicago was more of an ensemble piece , and included solos for Patty Simcox ( Yeeughh ! ) and Miss Lynch ( In My Day ) . I was Sandy and then , during the dance scene , I turned into Cha Cha , and then I went back to Sandy . Also I learned that something called an Eskimo pie exists and that boys look very nice in shorts . Vanessa Hudgens is the sexpot Rizzo , Keke Palmer plays the flirty Marty , and Carly Rae Jepsen is beloved beauty school dropout Frenchy . The production will include iconic Coca Cola signage and performers will taste the feeling of Coca Cola on stage during the show . She played the part for twelve weeks .
