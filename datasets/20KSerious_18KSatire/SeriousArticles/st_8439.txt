Out of breath ? Take a good , deep one . We haven ' t even begun to discuss the year ' s end of the world movies . The apocalypse was nigh not only in action movies like " Pacific Rim " and " Oblivion " but in comedies like " This is the End " and " The World ' s End . " On screen the U . S . and British capitals were under terrorist attack in what seemed like an infinite loop of destruction : " Olympus Has Fallen , " " White House Down , " " G . I . Joe : Retaliation , " " Star Trek : Into Darkness , " " Thor : The Dark World . " Los Angeles and New York also endured attacks and were defended respectively by the mettle of Robert Downey in " Iron Man 3 " and Henry Cavill in " Man of Steel . "
