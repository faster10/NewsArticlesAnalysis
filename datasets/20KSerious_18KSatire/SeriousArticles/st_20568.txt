I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show , and he said , " That ' s Ronnie Montrose , and that was his last show . He lives in Sausalito . " I lived in San Francisco , and I said , " Do you have his address ? " because I didn ' t even have a phone . He gave it to me , and I went and knocked on his door , dressed like David Bowie big old high heel platform shoes , satin pants , probably had make up on , with a Les Paul and a notebook pad with all kinds of lyrics in it . I said , " I ' m Sammy Hagar . I heard you ' re looking for a singer . " He said , " Come on in . You got any songs ? " I played him my four songs , we shook hands , and he said , " Let ' s start a band . Do you know any drummers ? I ' ve got a bass player , Bill Church . " I had a drummer , Denny Carmassi wasn ' t in my band , but he was my favorite drummer around town .
