Detailing their final phone call , Tony told Rolling Stone magazine : " At that late stage , he was planning the follow up to ' Blackstar ' . And I was thrilled , and I thought , and he thought , that he ' d have a few months , at least . Obviously , if he ' s excited about doing his next album , he must ' ve thought he had a few more months . So the end must ' ve been very rapid . I ' m not privy to it . I don ' t know exactly , but he must ' ve taken ill very quickly after that phone call . "
