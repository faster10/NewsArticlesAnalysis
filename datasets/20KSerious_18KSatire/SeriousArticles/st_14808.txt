It left Collins , the man who gave him the ball , and it left an empty stadium and a bunch of strangers dancing on the field outside and no more games . They ' d been that close to learning what Jacob deGrom might do in Game 6 , then Noah Syndergaard in Game 7 . A wonderful story died , a decent team was eliminated finally , in part because Collins strayed from his plan , in part because Collins wanted to believe at least as much as Harvey did . Maybe it was an emotional decision . Maybe it wasn ' t even the wrong decision . Maybe it just played out wrong , and maybe it just happened to be him on the top step .
