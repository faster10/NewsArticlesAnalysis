Rubio ' s trouble here comes in two parts : He supported comprehensive immigration reform when it seemed like a good idea politically . Since then , his party has grown increasingly hostile to the idea , and hard core reform opponents are unlikely ever to trust him . In general , blatant flip flops on core values and issues invite attacks on his character . ( Bush has a more acute problem being crosswise with the GOP base on immigration , but he ' s been relatively steadfast in his support so he doesn ' t come off as a double crosser . )
