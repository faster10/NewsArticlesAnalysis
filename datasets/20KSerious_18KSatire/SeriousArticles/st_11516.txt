Similar to Paul , Blake Griffin enjoyed an impressive outing 27 points on 11 of 20 shooting against one of the league ' s best defenses . But Griffin also struggled in the second half , scoring only 9 points ( 3 of 8 shooting ) , despite resting for only four minutes . The Warriors ' ability to defend Griffin with Green in single coverage , and have capable defenders like Andre Iguodala or Harrison Barnes switch onto him at a moment ' s notice , made it tough for the Clippers to go to him late in the fourth . Still , the Clips need to stop ignoring Griffin at the end of games he ' s their best player , and should be involved on every possession .
