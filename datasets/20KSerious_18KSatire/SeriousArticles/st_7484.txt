The exact amount is a little tricky to determine because a lot depends on how honest a person is about how many cigarettes he or she smoked per day . Additionally , the type of cigarette and how deeply a person inhales could affect the amount of carcinogens in the body . Researchers say a person with high levels of NNAL and high levels of nicotine ( equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day ) is 8 . 5 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with a smoker with lower levels . While the researchers point out that not everyone who has a high level of NNAL is going to develop lung cancer , it does help assign a number to a risk that was hard to quantify before .
