I ' m not one to get perturbed by celebrity deaths . Typically , it disgusts me to see the pseudo " look at me being so sad " fawning that is popular on social media whenever a famous person dies . I find such declarations of how you ' re affected insulting to the deceased person ' s actual loved ones . Personally , it ' s not sadness I ' m feeling about Bowie ' s death rather , a sense of disbelief . His death hasn ' t affected my daily doings in any observable way . I ' m not caught in some pool of doldrums . But neither has his death been far from my mind these past few days . It ' s like a state of highly functioning shock , in that he was a larger than life figure I unconsciously assumed would always be out there . He was an institution , a force of nature , that suddenly ceased to exist , and that leaves a gap on an intellectual level if not on a sentimental or emotional one .
