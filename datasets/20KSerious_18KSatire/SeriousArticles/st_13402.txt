Well , my very first foray back there was probably a few minutes because I was very , I don ' t know , I just thought , " I have to hurry up . I have to do this fast . What if there ' s someone waiting to get in here ? " But there never was . I maybe made five or six forays to the bathroom and I think by the end I was spending 15 minutes in there comfortably without worrying about it so much . And that series , that happened on that one flight . That series is complete . I have not added to it . It ' s done . I consider that kind of a finished project .
