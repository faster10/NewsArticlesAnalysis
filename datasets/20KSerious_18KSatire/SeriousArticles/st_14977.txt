It was an accident scene . The small silver car was piled up against a palm tree , the engine revving at top speed . The only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree the car was wedged between the two . Racing over , Ash could see that the driver had his eyes closed and seemed to be unconscious . The driver ' s foot was wedged against the accelerator . Ignoring the chance that the car might break free and crush him , Ash reached across the slumped body and turned off the ignition . He dragged Mertz out of the car and laid him on the ground . After dialing 911 , Ash started CPR the way he ' d learned during an Air National Guard training exercise just two months before .
