Rubio , the son of immigrants , spoke up . He says , Pardon me , Senator , but I have to say that the children of those illegal immigrants will be doctors and lawyers , one lobbyist recalled .

And that would be it , one Democratic staffer recalled . If Rubio said that conservatives wouldn t go for a particular idea , the group believed him .
