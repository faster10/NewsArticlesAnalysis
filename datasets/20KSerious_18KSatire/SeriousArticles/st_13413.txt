Its second pillar , perhaps shakier than the first , is the myth that Cuban migr s rose to prosperity in the U . S . with zero help from the government . Government is always bad government can never equalize things . Government intervention is satanic , unless , of course , it is passing the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 , which , in addition to making the path to citizenship ( amnesty ! ) for Cubans easier , provided 1 . 3 billion in direct financial assistance , including Medicare , free English courses , scholarships , and low interest college loans . Many banks offered start up loans to Cuban businesses that had no collateral . Imagine if the families fleeing violence in Mexico and Central America were given that kind of reception . Maybe they , too , would have a chance to become as successful ( and as staunchly pro American ) as Cubans in Miami . But they weren t lucky to come from a major pawn in a Cold War chess game .
