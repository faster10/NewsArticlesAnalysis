First : He presumed that the word stripper is a pejorative , spitting out Rose s former occupation as if it somehow is an insult to call a former stripper a stripper . ( It is not . ) Second : He suggested ? that Rose somehow trapped Khalifa , because they have a child together . Third , and frankly this one s the worst : West went after the guy s toddler , narcissistically quoting his own Gold Digger in the process , suggesting that when he looks at his young son he feels not , say , parental pride , but the weary resignation of a man stuck with the boy s stripper mom . It s quite the trifecta of classic sexist BS . There s the trying to shame a man by pointing at his woman , because , right , this is really about the boys and the ladies are just there as symbols of their status in the world . There s the assumption that ? a man would have to have been trapped to love and have a child with a former stripper , and of course , there s the continued straight up attempting to humiliate a woman for ? ever having ? a job that involved her body .
