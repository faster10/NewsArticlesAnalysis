The Mets play the Royals now , who went all the way to the bottom of the 9th of the last Series before finally losing to the Giants with the tying run in a 1 0 game on third base . So you know the Royals will come into Game 1 on Tuesday night thinking that this is every bit their time in baseball , as they try to win their first World Series since 1985 the way the Mets try to win their first since 86 , especially after the way the Royals won Game 6 against the Blue Jays on Friday night , Lorenzo Cain running the bases the way Junior Griffey ran the bases against the Yankees in another October .
