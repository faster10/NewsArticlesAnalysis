( YBG ) : We are deeply concerned about those in Egyptian society that are not touched by the reform directly , and as you say there are people who are below the poverty line , reaching almost 20 percent . These reform programs will trickle down , but they will not trickle down overnight . We have complaints in Egypt . A lot of those who are less privileged are complaining . They are complaining very loudly . What makes it worse is that we feel for them . We know that they are right to complain , and we know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform .
