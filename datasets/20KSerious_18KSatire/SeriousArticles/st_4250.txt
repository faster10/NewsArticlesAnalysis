One reason to wonder : Mettenberger has a big arm and good skills . Maybe on a better team he ' d have fared better these past two weeks . Wins and losses are not quarterback stats , but the Titans are 0 8 when he starts . I was firm in my stance that dealing him would have been a mistake when that was a popular stance by a lot of national pundits after the preseason . He ' s been really bad subbing for Mariota . Routes were long developing and protection was poor , but he ' s got to find ways to at least throw it away . Tennessee certainly needs a functional backup as bad as the circumstances have been , Mettenberger hasn ' t looked like one . His value may have been higher after the preseason than it will be again in some time .
