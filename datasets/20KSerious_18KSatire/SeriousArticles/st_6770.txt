There is a further point to keep in mind about the American led air campaign against Isis : it has demonstrably failed in terms of its original intention , which was to contain and if possible eliminate Isis . There have been 8 , 289 air strikes by the US led coalition in Iraq and Syria in what is officially called Operation Inherent Resolve , of which 6 , 471 have been conducted by the US . Regional allies such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE , whose participation was much publicised when strikes on Syria started , have almost entirely disappeared from the scene and their planes are largely engaged in bombing Yemen . There have been 57 , 301 sorties in Iraq and Syria , indicating that most of the time pilots do not find a target and return without using their weapons . ?
