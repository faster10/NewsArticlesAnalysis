In a healthy ecosystem , fish are superior competitors and predators over jellyfish . But the things we humans do we fish , we pollute , we dam , we build , we translocate are making life harder for fish and better for jellyfish . And so , as we look around the world , we see that many of the most heavily disturbed ecosystems have " flipped " to being dominated by jellyfish instead of fish . Moon jellies and comb jellies in the Inland Sea of Japan . Sea nettles in the Chesapeake and the Benguela current off Namibia . Comb jellies in the seas of Europe . Santa ' s hat jellies in the fjords of Norway . Refrigerator sized jellies growing in the seas of China and drifting into Japanese and Korean waters .
