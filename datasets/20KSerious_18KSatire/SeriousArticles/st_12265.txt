Despite the bonhomie in Islamabad , Ms . Swaraj is likely to face a barrage of questions when she returns to Delhi and briefs parliament on Thursday , as the commitments by Pakistan on the Mumbai trial seem to be the same as in the past and gave no specific commitments on the prosecution of the masterminds Hafiz Saeed and Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi .

We are happy for any development that promotes peace , but the government must explain what has changed for this resumption of dialogue now , said Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan on Wednesday evening .
