Chan stated that " as of today cases have been reported in twenty three countries and territories " across the Americas , adding that " the level of alarm is extremely high . " The WHO Director General continued , saying that in many places , the arrival of the Zika virus was " associated with a steep increase in the birth of babies with abnormally small heads . " Chan also noted that " the possible links only recently suspected " between the virus and birth malformations " have rapidly changed the risk profile of Zika from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions , " therefore the " WHO is deeply concerned about this rapidly evolving situation . " The Zika virus is a disease transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito , which is also responsible for the transmission of chikungunya , dengue and yellow fever . The WHO press briefing is being held after 21 countries and territories in the Americas reported an increase of the local transmission of the Zika virus , since the beginning of 2016 .
