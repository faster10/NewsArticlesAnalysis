Denver s offense was run by backup Brock Osweiler when they visited Pittsburgh . Dealing with several injuries , the offense got off to a hot start and then fizzled . Osweiler exposed areas of the Steelers pass defense that has been suspect during the entire 2015 NFL regular season . Manning may not be 100 percent , but head coach Gary Kubiak said that his quarterback looks fresh and has been throwing the ball well in practices . Manning s biggest concern will likely be his offensive line riddled with injuries that forced offensive coordinator Rick Dennison to continue moving players in and out as they were assaulted nearly non stop by opposing defenses . This line watched Khalil Mack of the Oakland Raiders burn them for a five sack game and the Steelers are likely to key in on soft spots to harry Manning . Denver gave up the 13th most sacks in the league ( 39 ) , with 26 of those occurring in the past eight games ( 3 . 25 per game ) of the regular season .
