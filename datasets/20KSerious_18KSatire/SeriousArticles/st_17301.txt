According to an article in the Wall Street Journal , the United States intercepted a message sent from Tehran to militants in neighboring Iraq , ordering them to target the American embassy in Baghdad and other U . S . interests if American forces strike Syria . Assuming that the information is correct and not meant by Iran to get into U . S . hands to send a threat it would seem that Iran will resort to its long standing practice of using proxy militias and assorted terrorist groups to do its dirty work . This is as an alternative to stepping into the conflict with its own forces , which would escalate the war in Syria much more dangerously .
