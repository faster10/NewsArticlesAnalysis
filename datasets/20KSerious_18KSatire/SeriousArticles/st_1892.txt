QB Teddy Bridgewater : We ' ll start by giving the second year QB credit for being at his best when he had to be . Bridgewater hit 7 of 10 passes in the fourth quarter for 114 yards and the game tying touchdown , and started the Vikings ' game tying drive with a 19 yard run on second and 17 . But things could have been easier for the Vikings if not for a 14 point swing in the game ' s middle quarters . The Bears scored a game tying touchdown after Bridgewater forced a pass to Diggs and was intercepted before halftime . And in the third quarter , Bridgewater overthrew what should ' ve been an easy touchdown to Wallace . He finished 17 for 30 for 182 yards , a touchdown and an interception .
