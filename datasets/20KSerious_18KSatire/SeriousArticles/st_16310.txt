When the dust has settled , we need to remember that , in an election as important as this one , all Democrats are ultimately on the same side ? from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to the millions of moderate , staunch , and or radical liberals who support them . If we want to prevent the rise of a devastatingly extreme right wing government , as well as have a foothold to push for a more liberal agenda with the future Democratic president , then we should do the smart and right thing by supporting Clinton in the event of her nomination . The stakes are too high ? and the opportunity is too great ? for us to stay home .
