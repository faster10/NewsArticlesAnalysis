We set off down a less treacherous slope in the direction of Castleton . It might not be up to Ski Sunday standards but it ' s a lot better than the conditions I found in several resorts while driving through the French Alps shortly before Christmas . Then , the pistes in places like Morzine and chi chi Meg ve at more than twice the altitude of Mam Tor were little more than grass and mud ( they have enjoyed plenty of snow since then ) . They would have been thrilled to have snow like this at the start of their season .
