' Everything in life has become far too liberal , my good Lord . Anything goes in England now . Try telling your son to go to bed at 12 o ' clock . The son will slap your face . You can ' t do anything , if my son is sitting there , I ' m even scared of him . " Come on son , let ' s go " . " I don ' t want to go " . " OK , stay there then " . I don ' t want to touch him it ' s ridiculous , rubbish . I am from the old school . If he does something wrong , I ' ll give him a clip and off we go . That ' s how you become a man .
