Unfortunately for Mutu , his career will forever be tarnished by his dismissal by Chelsea for testing positive for cocaine in 2004 and his subsequent ban from the game . Up to that point , he was a star on the ascent . Prolific for Dinamo Bucharest , Mutu was snapped up by Internazionale in 2000 , but it took moves to Verona and then Parma for him to begin to shine .
