But in the spirit of the project , you kind of try everything , and I try not to talk myself out of anything . So if something comes to mind , I give it a shot . And then I kept thinking about that one photograph , and I thought I ' d really like to make a few more of those . And on a 14 hour leg from San Francisco to Auckland I was pretty sure that there would be long stretches of time when people would be asleep and when the bathrooms wouldn ' t be occupied . And so I kind of banked on that and got an aisle seat so that I would be able to get in and out of my seat easily without disturbing anyone . And sure enough there was never a line , people were asleep for hours upon hours of that long flight and I had plenty of opportunity to go back there and make a few more of these portraits .
