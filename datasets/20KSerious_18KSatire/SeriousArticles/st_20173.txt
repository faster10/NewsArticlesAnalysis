I feel good when people think that I can do it , but I ' m like , ' yeah , we ' ll see ' , " smiles the Venezuelan born Spaniard . ? " For sure everybody has a lot of expectations , but I think it ' s good , I think it ' s a great position to be where people believe that you can actually do it . It ' s also difficult to deal with it , but it ' s part of the game , it ' s part of the job , so I would not change it , for sure . "
