3 . Collins left Saturday s game in the third quarter with a back injury , never returned , and then wasn t spotted in the locker room afterwards . Given his value to the team , this is obviously a concern for the Patriots . After initially leaving the game and heading to the locker room following a tackle on receiver Chris Conley , Collins watched the remainder of the game from the bench area , which could be viewed as a sign that the ailment wasn t severe enough to keep him in the locker room . Linebacker Jerod Mayo ( shoulder ) and defensive end Chandler Jones ( unknown ) also didn t finish , as they are now added to the list of banged up Patriots ( 17 players on the most recent injury report ) . Perhaps Belichick will Xerox us a copy of the injury report before Wednesday .
