The Saints have allowed three running backs ? Shane Vereen , Matt Jones and Mike Tolbert ? to score through the air in their last five games . Sims isn t going to steal away too many carries from Martin , but he is a legitimate weapon in the passing game . You d still need to be in a bad spot to turn to him , but he is at least a viable flex starter for those in need this week . Snead is expected to return from his calf injury this week , and that would place him firmly on the WR3 radar . If he s out again , Coleman would take his place , both in real life and fantasy terms . He got seven targets last week , catching four for 73 yards and a touchdown .
