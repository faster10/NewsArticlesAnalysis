It was four years ago on the VMAs stage that Taylor Swift was interrupted by Kanye West during her big moment . After vowing to keep a stronger grip on the mic this time , Swift proudly claimed her award for Best Female Video for " I Knew You Were Trouble . " But it wouldn ' t really be the VMAs without an awkward Taylor run in . During her speech , she said , " I want to thank the person that inspired this song and he knows exactly who he is because I got one of these ! " Cut to Swift ' s ex Harry Styles of One Direction in the audience . But it was an earlier moment caught on camera that got the Twitterverse buzzing . When One Direction presented Selena Gomez with " Best Pop Video " for " Come and Get It , " cameras caught a glimpse of Swift allegedly mouthing the words , " Shut the f up " . It may not have been as scandalous as Kanye ' s " I ' mma let you finish but . . . " moment but it was enough to get the Taylor GIFs started .
