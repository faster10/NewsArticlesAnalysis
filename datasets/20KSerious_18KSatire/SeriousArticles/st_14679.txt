A real killer was 2009 , though . That Cavaliers team was stacked and that was , statistically , LeBron James ' best season of all time . The 2009 Cavs rolled through everyone , and with Kevin Garnett suffering an injury , it should have been the year that James and Bryant met up in the Finals . Unfortunately for those wanting that matchup , the Orlando Magic , behind a 3 point blitzkrieg that seems oddly like foreshadowing now , crashed the party . James ' numbers vs . Orlando were incredible , but that Magic team was too good defensively and too well balanced .
