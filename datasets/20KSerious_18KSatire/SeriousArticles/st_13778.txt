" The league is very good , " Dawkins said . " Everyone is good in this league . You ' re not going to run away from anybody . Look at who Arizona State played before . No one has run away from them . They ' re playing everybody well . That ' s how it ' s going to be with every team that you play . With the league as balanced as it is , on any given night , any team can beat any team . You have to be prepared , focus and ready to go for 40 minutes . No one is going away . You have to play 40 minutes of really good basketball to get a win in this league . "
