Of course , because the Democrats only have three candidates running right now ( they started out with six , but three dropped out ) , one might assume that each would receive considerable attention simply by virtue of the small size of the field . To an extent this has been the case with Sanders , who as a staunchly left wing alternative to Clinton has managed to break fundraising records and emerge as her chief rival in the polls for the nomination . At the same time , Sanders only received this boost because his grassroots campaign forced his poll numbers up and thus compelled the media to take him seriously . Since O Malley has not benefited from a similar grassroots boom , he has been left in the proverbial dust by the Beltway class . Indeed , the fact that he is widely regarded as irrelevant has become the central feature of his public image , with Saturday Night Live ? lampooning the casual way he is routinely dismissed as a serious contender .
