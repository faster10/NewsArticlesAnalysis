Ann M . Martin : I would say that it ' s been a long time in the making . The character of Rose has been percolating for a while , but the very beginnings of this story go back decades to the 1970s when I was in high school and college . I was fascinated with autism , and I began working the summers at a school in Princeton , New Jersey , for kids with autism . The interest has never left me . I minored in special education when I was in college . I wrote twice before about kids with autism but never from the point of view of the person with autism . Rose was the first one , and I just could almost hear her voice in my head , and her obsessions and idiosyncrasies were becoming clearer and clearer to me .
