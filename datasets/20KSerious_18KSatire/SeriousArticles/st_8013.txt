JR has a response : " I see this project as a social experimentation . . . how people see themselves . . . . And you see that sometimes they ' re like yeah , I want to paste it there ! to show part of the community or people from different parts of the world . Or someone comes out and says Oh hey , I want to be at Times Square ! I want my face up there and they have no message . Some people ask me if I like that or not . I can ' t like it or not . For me , it ' s a reflection . I have to observe it and study it . "
