Copenhagen celebrates Jul ( as in " yuletide " ) in high style , with its famed Christmas market the centerpiece . Stalls stocked with fine handmade crafts , including traditional figurines of clog clad elves in pointy red caps , compete for space with vendors selling iced doughnuts slathered with black currant jam and hefty cups of gl gg , a steaming hot mulled red wine laden with raisins , almonds , cinnamon sticks and cloves all of which , for good measure , are steeped in aquavit or schnapps .
