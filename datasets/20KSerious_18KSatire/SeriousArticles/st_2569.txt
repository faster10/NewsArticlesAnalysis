Speaking this week in response to Palin s words , Paul Rieckhoff , head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , said , It s not President Obama s fault that Sarah Palin s son has PTSD . PTSD is a very serious problem , a complicated mental health injury and I would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular . He added , Now that she has endorsed Mr Trump , I would encourage her to talk with him about it . Mr Trump s campaign is pretty light on specifics about what he would do for veterans . And if Palin is so concerned about her son s well being , maybe instead of complaining about what s happening in Washington , she could keep an eye on the assault weapons ? and alcohol situation under her own roof .
