Regarding the Syrian nationals who have entered Kuwait through visit visas , but were not able to leave on time , we will grant them long time visas within the confines of the law , Abdullah Al Hajiri , the acting head of the General Directorate for Residency Affairs , was quoted as saying . As for Syrian expatriates whose contracts have ended , but who have not been able to renew their residency permits because they could not renew their expired passports or because they could not present the required documents , we facilitate the administrative procedures for them and grant them special residencies .
