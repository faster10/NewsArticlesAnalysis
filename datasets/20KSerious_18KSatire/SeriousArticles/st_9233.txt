Herbicides ( weed killers ) are mixtures of chemicals designed to spray on weeds , where they get inside the plants and inhibit enzymes required for the plant to live . The active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide is glyphosate , while some herbicides contain 2 , 4D . 2 , 4D is best known as a component of Agent Orange , a defoliant widely employed during the Vietnam War . Until the introduction of GM crops about 20 years ago , herbicides were sprayed on fields before planting , and then only sparingly used around crops . The food that we ate from the plants was free of these chemicals .
