He s a great quarterback , no doubt , but he s still susceptible to throwing interceptions and making mistakes , " Boykin said of Manning , who had 17 interceptions through nine starts , a career worst pace . " That happens when he s uncomfortable . When the pass rush is getting to him pretty fast , you ll see him kind of not getting his footwork right . We ve got to get him to that point in order to get those turnovers . He s Peyton Manning . He s not just gonna throw you a direct interception . You ve got to work for it and be in the right place .
