Not saying it s right or in good sportsmanship , but there are 11 guys out in the field , coached and watch video to exploit even the smallest flaw in their opponent as a team and individuals in the other team as far as thier tendencies . One guy goes rouge and says I ll hit Brady or Manning late , and then twist hard on their knee and ankle while on the ground so it causes damage for them to leave the game , that takes care of those concerns about the QB beating them , since they are on the sideline .
