Orman : I personally think it was bad . Listen , the banks in the United States of America are in trouble . Anything we can do , in my opinion , to help the banking system so they can make a little bit more money , I think , would have been a good idea . If we had lowered interest rates , the Fed funds rate , the banks would have been making more money on the money that they lent out , which would be helping everybody in the long run . So I think they should have lowered , but they left the same .
