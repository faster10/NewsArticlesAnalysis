" When I started my current job , it was just months after someone I knew was convicted of sexually molesting a child . . . . It left me with a really unforgiving attitude about those convicted of sex crimes against children . In the course of my work , I was demonstrating something to my co worker and randomly selected a co worker to Google . Lo and behold , the man had similar charges ( and a guilty verdict ) a dozen years ago , just before coming to work here . I immediately swore the other co worker to secrecy , having NO IDEA this was even a possibility when entering the name . Unfortunately , the man I searched is my immediate supervisor , and it makes me kind of sick to have to deal with him daily . The job is great , the pay is good , but I just wish he ' d hurry up and retire . I can ' t ask to be transferred , as even asking would spread this information further .
