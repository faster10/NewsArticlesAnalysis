It s business as usual at the academy , Gil Robertson , president of the African American Film Critics Association , said Thursday . We ll have to try again . After the whole debacle with Selma and Ava DuVernay , you would have thought some lessons would have been learned . Nothing for Will Smith . Nothing for Idris Elba . Irony of ironies , the only actor who received a nomination for Creed is white . ( He was referring to Sylvester Stallone , who got a supporting actor nod for reprising his role as Rocky Balboa . Co star Michael B . Jordan was not nominated , nor was director Ryan Coogler . )
