EXCEPT . . . " One difference is Courteney did declare this year the year of her cleavage , " he says . Adds Cox : " You will not see one scene where I don ' t show my boobs . " Lawrence also joked , " the big difference is we ' ve shifted from Brian Van Holt not wearing his shirt all the time to Josh Hopkins not wearing his shirt all the time . I think that was probably TBS ' only big note . "
