Any public official willing to air grievances on the record , whether those grievances are legitimate or not , should be thought of as a whistleblower . And if a whistleblower is willing to risk his career and reputation to share information he thinks the public needs to have , a news outlet needs to have an awfully good reason not to run his story . On the other hand , we never asked him not to talk to other outlets or to take his concerns public on his own , which was always an option , but one he didn ' t take . And had he known the talks were once again going on , that may have changed his calculus about going public , which in turn was something we had to keep in mind . And it wasn ' t something we could share with him .
