As a candidate , Trump appears uncontainable . His ? risk tolerance is unmatched , and that gives him a freedom no other candidate enjoys . He can offend anyone , promise anything , and circumnavigate the entire process without ever having to apologize . Not apologizing , as the Politico writers note , only bolsters a candidate who appeals to voters fed up with political correctness and establishment niceties . It also forces the other candidates to play his game , to react to the tone he sets and the issues he raises .
