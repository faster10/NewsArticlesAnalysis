The Giants interviewed former Bills coach Doug Marrone on Saturday . He appears to be a strong candidate , possibly even a front runner , as there are some involved with the search who seem focused on finding a coach with previous NFL head coaching experience . The Giants consider Marrone a program builder based on his work in the college ranks at Syracuse and their belief that he had the Bills on the right track before taking a 4 million buyout last year after the team was sold . Buffalo was 9 7 in 2014 , Marrone ' s second season there . That is the only winning season the Bills have had since 2004 and just their second since the turn of the century .
