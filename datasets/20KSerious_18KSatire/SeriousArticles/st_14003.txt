Thirdly , the exchange rate will be on its side . In March , the exchange rate hardly moved . This time around , as the ECB steps up QE , the Federal Reserve will most probably be raising interest rates , while the Bank of Japan will be on hold . Unless everything we know about the currency markets is wrong , that should push the euro down , probably to parity with the dollar , and perhaps significantly below . Since so much of the European economy depends on exports , a much cheaper exchange rate can only make it grow faster .
