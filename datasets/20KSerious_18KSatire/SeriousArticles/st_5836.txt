" We started looking into the schools for the children in Lodwar ( Rebecca Ikiru , Monty Esibitar and Gershom Eurpe ) that we thought would be good candidates , and about that time we met two other children ( Ann Njoki and Cyrus Kirwa ) who were extremely gifted . We just overnight had five children enrolled in Greensteads International School , which is in Nakuru . That was two years ago , and all five of the children are either competing ( with ) or exceeding the children of privilege who have been in this school for their entire education . "
