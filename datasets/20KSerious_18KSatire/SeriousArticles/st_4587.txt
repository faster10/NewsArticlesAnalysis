Mahdi Bray , executive director of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation , said the incident is a " wake up call " to the many negative influences youth face and touched on what he said were harmful messages sweeping across cyberspace . " We are determined not to let religious extremists exploit the vulnerability of the emotions of our children through slick , seductive and destructive propaganda on the Internet . We are sending a message loud and clear that those days are over where we will not respond in kind on the Internet to vile propaganda that misrepresents the Islamic faith , " Bray said .
