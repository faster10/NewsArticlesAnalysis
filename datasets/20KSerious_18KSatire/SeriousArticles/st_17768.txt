This genetic approach and others for instance , those that render insects infertile or disease resistant represent a new spin on the classical Sterile Insect Technique ( SIT ) . During the 1930s and 1940s , the idea of SIT was conceived as a method of " birth control " for unwanted insect species . Males would be rendered sterile by exposing them to massive amounts of radiation , then released to mate with females . SIT was used to eradicate the screwworm , a deadly parasite of livestock , from the United States in the 1950s , and to tame pink bollworm moth populations in California ' s cotton fields since 1967 .
