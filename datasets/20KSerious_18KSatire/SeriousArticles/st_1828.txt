Stores pay out more pennies than they receive , so the order goes down the line to make more pennies , which are often lost and ignored repeating this vicious cycle . Unfortunately , the U . S . Mint won ' t find a miracle metal that will make pennies worthwhile . The bottom line is that even if pennies could be created out of thin air , the cost of our time would outweigh the gains from using the penny . For nickels , the math works out better , so I ' ll second the president ' s call to begin making nickels out of less costly metal , rather than consigning them to the history books .
