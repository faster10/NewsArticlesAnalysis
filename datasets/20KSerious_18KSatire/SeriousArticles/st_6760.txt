This sometimes feeds into people thinking their kids are too young or too old . Or maybe they are the age that they " should be " getting married and be responsible . There ' s all kinds of excuses we make for ourselves . What people forget is that your life goes on while you are on the road . . . you can still meet people , your kids can still learn , you may even fall in love and get married . For some reason we think that our possibilities end or our lives stop if we take off and do long term traveling !
