Just a few blocks away ? across the river that divides downtown Des Moines ? Sanders held his event . Smaller than Clinton s gathering ? and much smaller than the usual Sanders rally , which draws thousands and thousands of people ? it was almost low key compared to Clinton s quasi festival atmosphere . Still , it was lively . Outside the main space , volunteers collected signatures and information from attendees ? to contact them later ? while small vendors set up tables to sell assorted swag , including tracts on socialism . A plane flew over the crowd flying a Feel the Bern sign . A preacher revved up the crowd , while a drum line and step team of young black Americans practiced in preparation for the march to the dinner itself . When Sanders finally arrived , he gave a shortened and modified version of his stump speech , calling for a country where billionaires couldn t buy elections .
