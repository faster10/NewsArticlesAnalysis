The first " Underworld " earned 2 . 5 times its opening weekend ( that ' s known as a mulitplier of 2 . 5 ) and finished with 51 . 8 million . The second notched a 2 . 4 multiplier and earned 62 . 3 million . The third only managed a 2 . 3 multiplier , a sure sign of sequel fatigue and frontloadedness , and grossed 45 . 8 million . With Kate Beckinsale back in the picture , " Awakening " may find a larger total than " Lycans , " but with a very young audience ( only 7 percent were 50 or older ) , it should continue the frontloaded trend and finish with about 56 million .
