However , conservative elites are still pretty suspicious of Trump . Barring a recession ( gulp ) , he probably would not do well in a general election , and so most conservative elites seem to be hoping that Marco Rubio will eventually consolidate the anti Trump Republican vote to challenge Hillary Clinton . But should Trump win , and I see absolutely no reason at this point to think he is not the tentative favorite , things could change quickly . Should Clinton win the nomination , her milquetoast , status quo platform will be quickly internalized on the right as a devious plot to destroy ( white ) America . I would thus wager that most of the elite conservative power structure would back Trump versus Clinton if they each secure the nomination .
