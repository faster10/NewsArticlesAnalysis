Of course , as always , the U . S . mainstream media , which is in the most sorry state I have ever witnessed it , has been ready to lend a hand to Obama ' s crimes by ( 1 ) barely reporting on Yemen and ( 2 ) reporting Yemen as a more or less equal battle between Houthi rebels and the Saudi led coalition . To be clear , this is not a an equal fight , for it is the Saudis who are inflicting the disproportionate share of civilian casualties through a U . S . backed air campaign against a country with no air defenses .
