A Foreign Office spokeswoman said : " This document is a general policy guide from 2011 , rather than a case by case list of countries where the death penalty is applied . A full list of countries of concerns was published in March 2015 in the Annual Human Rights Report , that includes Saudi Arabia and its use of the death penalty . The Government opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle and continues to raise concerns with the Saudi authorities at the highest levels . "
