If the Cardinals make it past the Panthers , which I ' m not convinced they can do , and Julian Edelman is 100 healthy , this should be a great Super Bowl against two evenly matched teams . But in the final result , I think the loss of DB Tyrann Mathieu is the difference ? the Cardinals really could have used him to vary the looks against Tom Brady and send quick pressure . Carson Palmer and Co . has the magic mix of a deep passing game and daring playcaller that could knock off the Patriots , but without Honey Badger in the game , the Patriots will get a few more stops and lock up back to back titles .
