Daddy also used to take us fishing when we were little up on the Shiawassee and Flint Rivers but he did not like the Flint because he said the water was dirty . There were hardly regulations of any sort no one wanted to get in the way of progress , and the river was brown with poison long before Michigan ' s current governor abandoned the city ' s residents . There has never been any one living around Flint who would have considered taking a drink of that water even at gun point so there is no surprise that a switch was made from Lake Huron to the Flint River as a water supply without informing the citizens .
