One of the Russian president s less endearing features is that , when confronted with clear evidence of Russian wrong doing , he simply reverts to bare faced lies . He lied ? when there was clear evidence to the contrary ? that there were no Russian troops in Crimea when Moscow orchestrated its illegal annexation . And he continues to lie that Russia had nothing to do with the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 , even though all the evidence points to it having been hit by a Russian built Buk surface to air missile .
