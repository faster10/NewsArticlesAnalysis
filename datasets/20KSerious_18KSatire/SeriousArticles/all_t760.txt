â€‹Chrissie Hynde memoir coming this fall
Chrissie Hynde will tell the story of her life, with all its ups and downs.Penguin Random House announced Tuesday that the Pretenders singer was working on an "an incredibly frank" memoir that will come out Sept. 8. The book is currently untitled.According to Doubleday, Hynde will write about her childhood in Akron, Ohio, offer a "strikingly intimate portrayal" of the punk rock scene of the 1970s and a "bittersweet" look back at the Pretenders, who had such hits as "Brass in Pocket" and "Talk of the Town," but lost two original band members to drug-related deaths. Hynde, 63, said in a statement issued through her publisher that she hoped her book would make people dance, have fun, possibly cry and maybe reach for a guitar.
