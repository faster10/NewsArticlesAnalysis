Palmer set career highs this season with 4 , 671 passing yards , 35 touchdowns and a quarterback rating of 104 . 6 . Palmer was intercepted 11 times in the regular season , but had two last week against Green Bay in the divisional round and could have had a third pick . The Panthers led the NFL in turnovers caused , interceptions , turnover margin and points off turnovers . Luke Kuechly s pick six of Russell Wilson on Seattle s second offensive play last week put the Seahawks in a 14 point hole and changed the complexion of the game . The Panthers can set the tone again by coming up with an early takeaway in Arizona territory . And if they happen to get a defensive score , it would send the crowd into a frenzy .
