For example , when people are ill , you can say something to them , or when people did something for you , you say thank you to them . For those kinds of occasions , you send a small present rather than an expensive gift . It is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way . This idea has formed as a business . As a result , Hello Kitty was created . Hello Kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends . I am pleased with this phenomenon .
