Bowie s description of the music may have advertised its inauthenticity , but that only enhanced his consistent outsider stance . In 1976 he varied his new dance funk sound on Station to Station , adding elements of avant garde German rock , an interest he would elaborate exponentially on in his next three releases , together known as the Berlin trilogy . Collaborating with Brian Eno on the albums Low , Heroes and Lodger , Bowie nudged the avant garde a little closer to the mainstream . The albums also produced pop mainstays , from the track Heroes to the bisexual ode Boys Keep Swinging . After the equally creative Scary Monsters in 1980 , Bowie would head off into a far slicker direction while , in future decades , he swung back to darker and more challenging sounds , keeping him new to the end . Yet for all the vividness and daring of his subsequent recordings , the 70s remains Bowie s most visionary era , the time when he established himself as the Nostradamus of modern pop .
