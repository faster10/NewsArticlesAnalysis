The distaste for Cruz goes far beyond just his divisive political strategy , or the perception that he says nothing , true or untrue , unless it is maximally self serving . It goes to his oleaginous , hyper moralizing personality , even the repulsively sentimentalized way he talks about the " Children of Reagan " who are taking over the Republican Party . Frank Bruni related in a column that veterans of the 2000 George W . Bush campaign learned to loathe Cruz , and that many of them would , under truth serum , admit to preferring Trump to him . Cruz ' s college roommate Craig Mazin is dragged before media to give amusingly nasty assessments of Cruz ' s character . " I did not like him at all in college , " Mazin said , " . . . And , you know , I want to be clear , because Ted Cruz is a nightmare of a human being . I have plenty of problems with his politics , but truthfully his personality is so awful that 99 percent of why I hate him is just his personality . "
