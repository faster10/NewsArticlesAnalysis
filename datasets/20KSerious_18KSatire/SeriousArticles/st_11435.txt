Slowing down Brady by winning up front and getting pressure ( preferably up the middle ) has been the classic trope for how to beat the Patriots in the playoffs . It ' s how the Giants pulled off their upset of Brady and the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII , how the Jets and Mark Sanchez upset the Pats in Foxborough , Massachusetts , during the 2010 postseason , and how the Seahawks got out to their early lead in last year ' s Super Bowl . Michael Bennett spent most of the first three quarters terrorizing Brady , but once the Seahawks lost Cliff Avril and Bennett subsequently slowed down , Brady kicked it into high gear and won his fourth ring ( yes , with a little help ) .
