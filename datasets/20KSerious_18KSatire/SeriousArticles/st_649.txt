And then , of course , there is the cherished Severus Snape in Harry Potter . However well intentioned or made , the movies simply can ' t capture the intricate details and backstories provided in the books , and so we rely on the performances to fill in the blanks . In the early films Snape always seems to be a character very much on the periphery , vacillating between heroics and villainy , and , atypically for Rickman , rather understated . In a few of the early movies you almost forget Snape is there , so minimal are his contributions to the plot . In the first film Rickman ' s presence serves as an efficient red herring , so focused are you on the notion of this blatant bad guy that he distracts you completely from the true puppet master . From then onward , he lurks about in the background , and yet , because it ' s Alan Rickman , you know there will end up being a deeper story to this man than the one you ' re seeing on the surface . You can ' t ignore what ' s going on behind those dark eyes , and in that basso as it intones " Mis . . . tah Pottah . " The stage is carefully set over the course of eight films for the revelation of Snape ' s complicated yet ultimately noble soul , and one doubts whether or not an actor other than Alan Rickman could have pulled it off , with the patience and the skill to weave together a character one tiny , almost unnoticeable thread at a time . Millions of children ( and children at heart ) will forevermore read those books and picture Rickman speaking the lines , a special kind of immortality after which many can long and few will ever achieve .
