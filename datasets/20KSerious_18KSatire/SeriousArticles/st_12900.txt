Our country has a long history of sheltering the persecuted . Many of the colonies that eventually became the United States were founded by people who were fleeing religious persecution in Europe . In the late 1970s , we gave refuge to Vietnamese people who fled war in Southeast Asia . In 1980s , we gave refuge to thousands of Cubans who arrived in the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift . In the late 1990s , we gave refuge to those fleeing the Kosovo war . These refugees , and their children , have become Americans . On the whole , this is a history we should be proud of .
