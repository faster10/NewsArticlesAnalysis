Thus , if a person is young but has a terminal disease , say , advanced pancreatic cancer , and physicians determine that he has but a few months , maybe weeks , to live ( a determination doctors often make ) , he may be spared aggressive interventions and be provided with mainly palliative care . In contrast , an 80 year old with , say , pneumonia who can return to his family and friends to be loved and give love , contribute to the community through his volunteering and enjoy his retirement he earned with decades of work should be given all the treatments needed to return him to his life ( which in my case includes a full time job and some work on the side ) .
