One widely used indicator of a candidate ' s prospects in a general election is " favorability " ( i . e . the proportion of respondents who report " favorable " as opposed to " unfavorable " views of the candidate ) . In an average of different polls on this question compiled by Real Clear Politics , voters reported unfavorable views of Hillary Clinton by a margin of over 8 percent ( 42 . 8 favorable v . 51 . 0 percent unfavorable ) . Sanders , in contrast , had a very narrow positive rating ( 38 . 4 percent v . 38 . 2 percent ) . In general , social scientists believe that going into an election with over 50 percent " unfavorable " places the candidates in a precarious position .
