Jeremy Corbyn had been twitching in his seat while the prime minister was sabre rattling , but his response was both measured and short . It might even have been an unexpected highlight of his time as Labour party leader . He didn t say he was ruling out airstrikes in any circumstances , he just wanted some answers to a few more questions . Could Dave be sure he wasn t making a bad situation worse ? What could we add that the US , Russia and the French weren t already doing ? Why had Canada and Australia stopped bombing Syria ?
