Britain currently enjoys the best of both worlds . We got an opt out so we could keep our border controls , staying out of the borderless Schengen area . The Paris attackers were able to cross from their Belgian base into France without showing their passports . That would have been impossible had they tried to travel to Britain with the same intent . The EU s so called Dublin regulation means asylum seekers in Britain whose applications are rejected are deported to the European country they first entered . And we have a unique deal with France whereby UK border controls are based in Calais , not Dover , so making it harder for illegal immigrants to enter our country .
