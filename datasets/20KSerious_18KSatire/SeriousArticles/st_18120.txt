Marco Rubio and Donald Trump ? who , if you squint at them sideways while super high on Rand Paul s bluegrass grown private stash , are the two most plausible Republican presidential nominees of the moment ? joined forces this week to attack Barack Obama for going to a Baltimore mosque and giving a thoroughly uncontroversial speech . That part was a slam dunk , although it s dispiriting to realize how far our country , or at least the Republican base , has fallen into the bottomless pit of Know Nothingism over the last 15 years . What startled me was that Obama has been president for seven years , attending services in any number of churches , cathedrals and synagogues , without once setting foot inside a Muslim house of worship . That says a lot , and none of it is good .
