Wrecks were all too common on early American rails , mainly because the tracks were constructed so badly . The merchant barons of Baltimore and Philadelphia were in a rush to get their lines over the Appalachians and into the fertile grain country of the Middle West during the 1830s . Crews grew accustomed to laying warped wooden ties and low quality iron , and breakneck curves were common in the mountains . Signaling was also primitive , which meant that collisions euphemistically called " cornfield meets " were another cost of doing business .
