Many MLK streets and boulevards are , or once were , important centers of African American communities . Daniel D ' Oca , ? a Harvard Graduate School of Design professor , addressed the contrast in a course last fall called ? " The MLK Way : Building on Black America ' s Main Street . " ? He led 13 students to St . Louis and Washington , D . C . so they could create a design intervention for one of the cities . ? Their proposals , which range from adding new storefronts , job training and repurposing vacant lots , point to how America might turn MLK streets into what D ' Oca calls " monuments worthy of Dr King . " ?
