QB Eli Manning ? ? ? This was Manning ' s best game of the year , maybe even his career . If you rate it solely on touchdown passes , it was the top performance of Manning ' s illustrious career . He completed 30 of 41 passes for 350 yards with six touchdown passes . He didn ' t throw an interception . He finished with a 138 . 2 QB rating . He picked apart the Saints defense , was in total control and put the Giants in position to win . Heck , the offense produced 42 points . That should be enough . That almost always is enough . Manning couldn ' t do much more on Sunday . ?
