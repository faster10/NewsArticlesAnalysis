A key option might be similar to what happened when the housing market crashed in 2009 ? simply walk out and move elsewhere other than Flint , or Michigan . It s not that the government would win . The people of Flint would win because they d still be alive , when the government seemingly didn t care one way or the other . The water bill issues will probably get resolved since agencies outside of Michigan are getting involved . Governor Synder will possibly be held to the full extent of the law for his negligent crimes against Flint .
