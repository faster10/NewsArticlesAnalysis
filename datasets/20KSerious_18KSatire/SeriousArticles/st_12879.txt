Also on New Year ' s Day , Swansea boss Garry Monk said officials should suffer for bad performances following the 1 1 draw at QPR . Rangers keeper Rob Green somehow escaped dismissal despite clearly handling the ball outside his area , while Wayne Routledge was sent off for his reaction to Karl Henry ' s late tackle . Taylor was the official once more and Swansea ' s Routledge had his red card rescinded . Gabriel Agbonlahor and Paul Konchesky had red card decisions overturned in December , after confusing calls by Lee Mason and Craig Pawson respectively .
