" We are very much looking forward to having Chad join the No . 42 team , and excited for the fresh perspective that he brings , " said team owner Chip Ganassi . " We fully expect the combination of Chad and Kyle to be the foundation of the No . 42 team for years to come . Chad is a race winning crew chief and has helped steer a team into the Chase , two goals we have each season for our teams . I think his background and experience with veteran drivers will help as we look to continue to build on Kyle and the team ' s success in the Sprint Cup Series . "
