To consolidate the conservative vote in New Hampshire ? and elsewhere ? Cruz needs to draw support from the pools of potential votes he shares with Trump and Rubio . Trump s base of support is usually described alternately as white working class or sub college educated , but the real prevailing ideological belief among Trump supporters is a belief in Trump himself . That includes many conservatives that Cruz is suddenly , and aggressively , trying to poach . Rubio straddles the party s conservative moderate divide , a position that s won him so many fans among assorted Republican operatives , pundits , and other poobahs with an eye on the general election . But Rubio s crossover appeal to conservatives and moderates so far has translated into few first choice commitments from either conservative or moderate voters . Cruz wants Rubio s conservative votes , and he ll try to get them by pointing out the plays Rubio has made for moderate votes .
