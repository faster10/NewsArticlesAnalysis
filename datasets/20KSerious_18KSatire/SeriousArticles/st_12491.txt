ISIS promises to avenge all the injuries of colonialism , the Iraq wars all the injures of the past . ISIS is a myth , but it s one that they stick to versus other myth ? the French dream , as it were ? that they see as unfair and oppressive , says Benraad , who wrote her dissertation on the imam who radicalized the Kouachi brothers , who helped carry out the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January .

It s an injury that the children of immigrants have been living with their whole life , while also facing discrimination .
