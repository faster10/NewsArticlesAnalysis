Over the past decade , the Marvel brand has become a virtual guarantee of box office bang . But someone over at the company ' s Quality Control Department really needs to look into tightening up these films . They just don ' t know when to end . That said , it ' s worth pointing out two things that The Wolverine gets right ( aside from Jackman ' s always excellent , strong and silent type performance as Logan ) . The first is an action sequence that occurs mid way in the film , when Wolverine is being pursued on top of a bullet train . By now , we ' ve all seen so many beat downs atop locomotives that they ' ve become numbingly similar . But the one in The Wolverine is so frantic and adrenalized ( not to mention the only part of the film that takes advantage of 3 D ) that the familiar becomes new again . The film also sticks the landing on a brief teaser scene after the end credits that hints at future developments in the X Men universe . I won ' t spoil the pleasure of what happens . But you have to hand it to Marvel for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling . Grade : B
