Today , we can project indomitability by rolling back all the fear based post 9 11 security measures . Our leaders have lost credibility getting it back requires a decrease in hyperbole . Ditch the invasive mass surveillance systems and new police state like powers . Return airport security to pre 9 11 levels . Remove swagger from our foreign policies . Show the world that our legal system is up to the challenge of terrorism . Stop telling people to report all suspicious activity it does little but make us suspicious of each other , increasing both fear and helplessness .
