Is it because Americans cannot accept the loss of unchallenged global supremacy ? because they can no longer dash their enemies to the ground with a sweep of their mighty hand ? Perhaps America is more like Russia than Americans would care to think ? furious and frustrated that the world doesn t cower before the US as it once did . Is it the violent echo chamber of the internet and social media and the shock jocks of radio and TV ? That , too , is part of it . The idea of a rational centre , emotionally detached and ideologically neutral ? the old image of the mainstream media ? now seems quaint beyond measure . Our emotional reaction to everything is hyperbolic .
