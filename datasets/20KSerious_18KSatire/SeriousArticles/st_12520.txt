Israel says its offensive is aimed at ending rocket attacks from Gaza once and for all . Hamas wants to see an end to the five year Gaza blockade and the reopening of its borders . In reality , neither Israel nor Hamas is likely to get what it wants because neither side appears to have a clear endgame . There is no way to eliminate Hamas . And even if its rocket launching capabilities are destroyed , which seems unlikely , this war will only fuel its drive to rearm , just as it did after Cast Lead . Until the underlying grievances of both sides can be addressed , we should only expect the cycle of violence to continue .
