Stafford s season long numbers don t look that bad , and they appear even better when you remember how terrible the Lions were over the first five games . Stafford ranks 13th among quarterbacks in total points and 19th in points per game , a mini miracle given the way the season began . A look into his game logs , however , will show that 40 . 1 of his touchdowns ( nine out of 22 ) and a ridiculous 23 . 5 of his yards ( 742 out of 3 , 164 ) came in wins over the Bears and Eagles . Outside those two games , Stafford has one top 12 weekly performance this season . He s barely inside the top 20 at quarterback this week . Abdullah had arguably his best rushing game of the season last week , running for 67 yards on 13 carries . He continues to hold down the feature role in the backfield , and the Rams have proven a bit better against the pass than the run this year . He s on the flex radar for Week 14 . Riddick has turned into a PPR , but only PPR , machine . In full PPR leagues , he s an RB2 . In anything else , he should be on your bench .
