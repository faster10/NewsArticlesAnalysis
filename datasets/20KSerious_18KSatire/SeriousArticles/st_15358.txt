' Bed blocking ' describes when elderly patients remain in hospital despite being fit for discharge because care at home has not been set up for them , or they do not have a place in a nursing home . The problem has reached record levels across the NHS and is causing A E units to become overcrowded because patients cannot be moved up to wards . In addition , A E admissions are rising as patients find it increasingly hard to get an appointment with their GPs . The increase is also being driven by an ageing population .
