John Boehner: House had a 'right' to invite Benjamin Netanyahu
House Speaker John Boehner dismissed widespread criticism about his invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to come to Washington, saying Congress has a “right” to hear from foreign leaders. “The House of Representatives is a equal branch of the government, and we have a right to do it, and we did it,” the Ohio Republican said Tuesday morning after a closed meeting of House Republicans. “And I’m frankly proud of the fact the prime minister has accepted our invitation, and will be here on March 3 to talk to the members of Congress about the serious threat that Iran poses, and the serious threat of radical Islam.” Story Continued Below Boehner’s invitation has faced withering criticism from everyone from the Obama administration to pro-Israel groups.

Netanyahu, who had originally been set to speak to Congress in mid-February, will also appear in March at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference in Washington.
