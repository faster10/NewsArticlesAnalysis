2 . Patriots receiver Danny Amendola ' s hit on Chiefs cornerback Jamell Fleming , which resulted in a 23 , 152 fine from the NFL , has drawn extreme reactions . Fleming , for one , essentially called for Amendola to be suspended . Patriots coach Bill Belichick , on the other hand , pointed out that it was a legal play because Fleming didn t call for a fair catch , while also noting it is difficult to see where the hit occurred on the coaching film ( if it s to the head neck area , a player is subject to a fine ) . I was hard on Amendola after the game , and incorrectly assumed that Fleming is granted the same protection as a defenseless receiver in that situation . I was wrong , as Fleming bears responsibility as well for putting himself in a compromising position . As for the hit itself , Amendola appears to make some minor contact with the head neck , but it s far from a clear cut hit where a suspension should even be part of the discussion .
