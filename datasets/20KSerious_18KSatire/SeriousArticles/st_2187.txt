Unlike Gingrich , Santorum is more than just an anti Romney vote . People actually seem to like him , and it might have something to do with those nostalgic sweater vests that he wears .

While Romney ' s victory speeches are polished tedium , Santorum ' s sound like they ' re being shouted angrily at a terrified prom date running for his life down the asphalt drive .
