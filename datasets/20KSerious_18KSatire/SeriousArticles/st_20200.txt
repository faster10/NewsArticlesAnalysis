Still , think about how ridiculous the narrative is with just under 90 ? days before the voting begins in Iowa . Sanders has set up expectations that he ll run a clean campaign . Which means the political press is just waiting for any hint of deviation like a pack of hyenas waiting for a lion to toss aside a piece of unwanted zebra meat . So one tiny comment that can be construed as a personal attack will be set upon , leading to a round of criticism that Sanders is going negative . Then he ll have to walk it back so it stops being a story . Then the press , having processed his apologies , will be on pins and needles waiting to see if he does it again .
