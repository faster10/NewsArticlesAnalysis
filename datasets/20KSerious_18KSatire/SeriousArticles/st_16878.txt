Suu Kyi ' s opposition National League for Democracy ( NLD ) has won over 90 of the seats declared so far in the lower house and is well ahead in the upper house and regional assemblies . If the final results confirm the trend , Suu Kyi ' s triumph will sweep out an old guard of former generals that has run Myanmar since the junta handed over power to President Thein Sein ' s semi civilian government in 2011 . But the army retains formidable power in Myanmar ' s political institutions after nearly 50 years of running the country and it is unclear how Suu Kyi and the generals will work together .
