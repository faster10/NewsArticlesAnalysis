There are lots of arguments to be made all day and night , on the radio and on Twitter . But I have said it before and I will say it again : It is hard to get 75 ? percent ? of people to agree on anything . So it s a real special honor when you can get that many people to say you are the greatest of the greats . And not voting for a player for the Hall isn t the same as saying that player stinks . Voters have to draw a line . As long as they can explain their thinking with some sort of straight line logic , that s all you can ask .
