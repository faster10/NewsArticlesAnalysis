The Panthers are too athletic and too well coached to beat on a regular basis . The one way you can really stretch them , though , is to get them out of their comfort zone and force them to improvise . You do that by getting out of the pocket . When the Panthers kept opposing passers in the pocket this season , they were dominant , posting a league best opposing QBR of 38 . 2 . Outside the pocket ? Not so good . Their QBR nearly doubled , going up to 71 . 1 . The league ' s best unit inside the pocket fell all the way to 27th once passers got outside .
