Overeating may also be diminished for another reason : less stress at the dinner table . In contrast to the imagined scenes of happy families sitting around the table oohing and aahing over a perfectly roasted turkey brought into the dining room ( why don ' t my turkeys look like that ? ) , the family members may be already in verbal combat mode . Ancient quarrels , nasty remarks , boredom , too many invasive questions about someone ' s weight , or grilling about a boy or girl friend , or failure to find a job and other unfortunate conversations can cause stress . And that is often the trigger to overeating .
