It was the Stasi , the " shield and sword " of the Communist party , that was charged with ensuring the power of the party . And it did that mostly by monitoring of people and their behavior . Because even in a regime as repressive as East Germany , people wanted to express who they really were . Many found the courage to follow their hearts and thus became a danger to the existing power structure . That is why the Stasi became an all encompassing entity in East Germany . It had to have its eyes and ears everywhere possible to make sure " enemies " of the party were uncovered early and disrupted in their activity .
