Lauder : This is not meant for everywhere . Its best use is for where you have a high level of traffic on the major road and only a minor level of traffic coming in on the minor road . . . all the cars all day long on the major road today have to stop for those phantom cars that aren ' t there . This is meant for situations where you have a three or four way intersection that has three or four way stop signs . So it ' s meant to be placed on the major roads , not the minor road . The minor road will still have a stop sign .
