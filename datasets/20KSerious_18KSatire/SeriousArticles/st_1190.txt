Of course , it s possible that this could all come to naught on Grammy night . Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth s Furious Seven anthem See You Again could win Song of the Year , Ed Sheeran s relatively snoozey Thinking Out Loud could win Record of the Year , and the Shakes Sound Color , like Beck s similarly backward looking Morning Phase last year , could run off with Album of the Year . If that happens , I won t mind if Grammy hating music critic Kanye West does more than just feint toward the stage , and Kendrick Lamar will be owed a lot more than another round of text messages . ? ?
