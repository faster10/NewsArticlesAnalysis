The charter school ' s board decided Monday night to change its dress code , but when I first learned about the story , and saw Tiana in tears , it reminded me of a time in my life when I yearned to have long , straight flowing hair . Hair that looked nothing like the hair that grew naturally out of my head . Hair that my mother would have to pay someone else to create through chemical processing . Hair that , when it was " done , " still didn ' t look " did " at least not like the tresses that garnished the heads of all the little girls that other children and adults named " pretty . " Hair that forever escaped me . Hair that , in its absence , made me cry .
