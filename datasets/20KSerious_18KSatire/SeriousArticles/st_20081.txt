Florida ' s deadly force law , also called " stand your ground " , was passed in 2005 . It allows people to meet " force with force " if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant . Under the law , a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity , is being attacked in a place he has a right to be , and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else .
