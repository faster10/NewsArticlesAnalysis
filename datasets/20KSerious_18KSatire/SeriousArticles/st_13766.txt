The kids are looking for something else , some different moral value because they know they ' re gonna get all the things that were thought impossible 50 years ago . A whole sort of basis of society and values which were accepted could be changed , but it ' s up to them to carry on those ideals that they have instead of just falling into the same old routine that their parents have fallen into . So it ' s not until the people of 21 now reach the age of 75 those kids actually have to be grandfathers before the whole thing is changed . "
