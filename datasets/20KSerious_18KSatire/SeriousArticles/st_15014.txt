JUDGMENT CALL : The New York Times : TED CRUZ raised questions on Wednesday at a private fund raiser about whether DONALD TRUMP , his bombastic rival for the Republican presidential nomination , has the judgment to be president and mused about strength , according to two people who attended the event in Manhattan . The remarks from Mr Cruz came as he has studiously avoided public criticism of Mr Trump , who is handily beating the rest of the Republican field in opinion polls . http : nyti . ms 21SALQ6
