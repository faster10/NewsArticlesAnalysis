" I respect the rank , but the man has to earn respect from me , " Lierle said . " I don ' t give respect . They have to earn it . And so far , I haven ' t seen a whole lot that anybody ' s earned . . . . I ' m not going to judge the man yet . I ' ll see what he does . Give him the benefit of the doubt . See what he comes up with . The way he ' s talking , he ' s made a lot of promises . It ' s gonna be hard to fulfill all those promises . And he ' s sure not gonna do it in the first six months .
