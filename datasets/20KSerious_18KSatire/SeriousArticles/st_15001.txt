The problem with Washington right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology . When you have both parties who will not find ways to compromise , who won ' t meet in the middle , you have paralysis . It ' s the perversion of idealism . I think what Francis has done is liberate himself from belief systems altogether . He says , I ' ve got people over here who think this , and people over there who think that . I ' m going to find ways whether it ' s through persuasion or seduction or intimidation or blackmail , whatever my tactics are to make sure everyone moves forward .
