I ' ve been eagerly anticipating the U . S . launch of " The X Factor " for a long time now and have been frequently posting updates on my site Remote Patrolled . As a reality TV producer , originally from the UK but now living here in the United States , I ' m very familiar with " The X Factor " format and its influence on British culture . For the past eight years , " The X Factor " has been the No . 1 entertainment show in British television , launching the career of several British pop stars and one international singing sensation , Leona Lewis . So can lightning strike twice ?
