I do not know Morsi to pre judge how women will be treated under his rule . Yet , I know the history of the Muslim Brothers that our new president came from . I know that they show respect to women rights only to hunt a political gain and then go back to mistreating them . If this happened this time , they will not be abusing the group ' s women , they will be abusing Egypt ' s women . I hope and pray every day that Morsi will prove me wrong and does his best despite the Muslim Brotherhood attitude toward women to empower Egypt through empowering its women in their non biological roles .
