Despite this , it s heartening to see so many young women eagerly turn out for Clinton s feminism heavy campaign . Not surprising , of course ? feminism , which has grown tremendously due to the internet in recent years , is hip these days ? but still heartening . It s easy to grow cynical and dismissive of what it would mean to have the first female president , especially since so many other countries have already had female heads of state . But standing in a crowd of mothers who brought their daughters out to see the woman who could do it here ( as well as Katy Perry ) , I felt my heart soften a bit . How much it would mean is debatable , but it still means something to be able to finally give this to the little girls in that crowd .
