Gansa : You know , we existed in this anonymous little bubble last year for the majority of the season and the show gained an audience and critical acclaim as we went forward . We were just all so shocked and surprised that we won the Emmy so I think there was a bit of a target on our back this year . People were worried whether we were going to live up to the first season . There are some people who don ' t think the second season is as good as the first . I , frankly , don ' t agree with them . I ' m in the middle of it right now and it ' s hard to be objective so when this season is over we are going to take a long look at what we did and decide for ourselves .
