People who call themselves leaders of the Republican Party ? politicians , donors , strategists , elders ? are panicking over an impending disaster . Donald Trump and Sen . Ted Cruz are about to roll through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary , crushing the establishment Republican presidential candidates . Trump and Cruz are also running first and second , respectively , in South Carolina . They even lead in Florida , the home state of Sen . Marco Rubio and former Gov . Jeb Bush . It s hard to see where Trump or Cruz could be stopped ? and how either of them , if nominated , would win a general election .
