What were they thinking ? Corner Chris Culliver appeared to make the play of the game , popping tight end Greg Olsen , then grabbing the ball in the air en route to a long touchdown and 21 14 lead . But officials flagged Culliver for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for his hit on Olsen , who was ruled a defenseless receiver . It was an unfortunate call and it s become very , very tough for defensive backs to tackle on bang bang plays . According to the rule , the onus is on Culliver to stay low , even if the receiver lowers his shoulder first .
