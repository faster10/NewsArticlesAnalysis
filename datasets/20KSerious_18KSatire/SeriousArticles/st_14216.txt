Fallon : I don ' t believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran . The situation with Iran is very complex . People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms we ' re against Iran , we want to go to war with Iran , we want to be close to them . . . . The reality is in international politics that there are many aspects to many of these situations , and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based . At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common .
