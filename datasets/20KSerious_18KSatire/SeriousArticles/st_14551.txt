The stand off began on January 2nd , when a rancher from Nevada , Ammon Bundy , led an armed militia to seize control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge , in protest at federal control of land in the American west . Since then , federal authorities have taken a cautious approach to the occupation , until making their move as Bundy and other militia leaders drove to a nearby town for a community meeting . After his arrest , Bundy told the rest of the occupiers still at the refuge to stand down , though some remain in place .
