Newfield : When my producer Tony Brown and I first sat down to talk about making this album , one of the first things that came out of his mouth was , " We have to show people who you really are . We need to cut songs , and you need to explore parts of your vocals that you never got a change to showcase . " All the ACM nominations are validation that we are on the path to doing just that and being taken seriously as an artist as a singer , as a songwriter and as a musician . We made a record that made people say , " Hey , this girl can sing . " And that ' s what I had always hoped .
