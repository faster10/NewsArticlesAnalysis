My mother found herself in a group of 21 Jews whom the sewer workers had agreed to hide . Originally for money , but later even after the money ran out , the sewer workers brought them food , washed their clothes , moved them when their safety was in danger and visited them every day except Sunday . Some decided to leave as the ordeal wore on and were killed above ground , and one older woman died of natural causes . A baby was born and had to be suffocated lest its cries give away the group . My mother was among 10 who survived the entire 14 months , and this experience guided her life .
