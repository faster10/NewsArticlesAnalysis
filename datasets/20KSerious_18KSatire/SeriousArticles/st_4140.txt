Fury , who walked into a right hander at the end of that last round , is almost certainly ahead on points here but the number of missed punches he ' s throwing could leave him exposed against the more experienced man . Fury opens up a cut on Klitschko ' s cheek as they clash heads accidentally , but the Ukranian comes in and lands an immediate response . There ' s a greater intensity to Klitschko ' s game now , but Fury will be aiming to draw this out and tire his opponent . Ooh and then a big right hand bursts through Klitschko ' s defence !
