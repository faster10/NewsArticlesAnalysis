The primary safeties are former Chief Quintin Demps ( 5 11 , 208 ) and second year pro Andre Hal , a pair of athletic players with ball skills . Hal has replaced veteran Rahim Moore ( 6 1 , 195 ) , who started the first game against the Chiefs but was benched following a bad loss to the Miami Dolphins in October . When Demps was a Chief , he made a lot of plays in coverage but was susceptible to certain route combinations . The Chiefs ran one at him in the season opener , and Travis Kelce ended up catching a touchdown pass .
