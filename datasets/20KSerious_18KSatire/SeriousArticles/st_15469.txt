Aaron Alexis , a former reservist turned civilian contractor , passed state and federal background checks and legally purchased the pump action shotgun used in the Washington Navy Yard shooting despite a history of violent outbursts and recent mental health treatment . Alexis was accused of firing a gun in anger in Texas in 2004 and Seattle in 2010 , but was not prosecuted in either case . In 2011 , he received an honorable discharge despite bouts of insubordination , disorderly conduct and unauthorized absences . None of that would have disqualified him from purchasing a weapon .
