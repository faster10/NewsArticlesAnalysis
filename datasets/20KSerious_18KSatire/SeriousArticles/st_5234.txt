" He was beloved by so many , especially the Hall of Fame family , for his kindness , graciousness and passion for the game , " Jane Forbes Clark , chairman of the board of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , said in a statement . " Tony was one of baseball history ' s most consistent hitters and most affable personalities . He was an icon for San Diego Padres fans , never more evident than on Induction Day of 2007 , when tens of thousands of Tony ' s most appreciative fans filled Cooperstown for his Hall of Fame speech . We extend our deepest sympathies to Alicia and the entire Gwynn family . "
