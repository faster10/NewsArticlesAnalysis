LC : Absolutely . First of all , we will have well over the minimum , a thousand delegates . Because in every state it s proportional , they are not winner take all , so you have 50 nominating states actually more , because you have groups that are not states , like Puerto Rico , and they re all proportional . We will get , in my opinion , at least a third if not a majority in everyone of these states , and so we will go to that nominating convention with more than enough delegates to demand real change in the platform of this party , to pass resolutions saying no more Super PACs , which is big money funding , to pass resolutions saying no more trade deals that don t favor American people instead of corporations , to say we support medicare for all , we want a simple system of medicare for all . I m confident we can go to that convention , we will have enough delegates to change the Democratic party and how it operates around this country , and to end the domination of the corporations in the Democratic party . It s not to say there s no room for their voice , but they re not going to dominate , and that s another reason we call it a political revolution , and it s why I m confident about the future .
