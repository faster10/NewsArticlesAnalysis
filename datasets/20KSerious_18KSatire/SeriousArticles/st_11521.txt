As appealing as that may be , however , there are drawbacks to the proposal ( which no one in law enforcement has been clamoring for ) . The bill doesn ' t define terrorist activity , and tech workers aren ' t trained to identify it or the people who should be scrutinized after all , extremists are hardly the only ones tweeting about Islamic State videos . So if a company tries to police its network , chances are good that it will report far too much to avoid overlooking something important . That would only pile more hay onto the stack that investigators have to pick through , rather than helping to uncover more needles . Meanwhile , because the bill would require tech companies to report only what they ' re aware of , it would create a perverse incentive for them not to monitor their networks at all .
