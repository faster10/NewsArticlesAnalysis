Trump , in running as a Washington outsider who would completely upend business as usual , misread the religious right ' s willingness to forego its own influence in the halls of power . While some of his supporters ( like some of Ron Paul ' s evangelical supporters in 2012 ) believe the religious right leadership to be just as corrupted as the rest of Washington , it seems a majority of evangelicals , in Iowa , at least , are not ready to give up on their pursuit of a government based on " biblical " values . Trumpifying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue apparently is not the path to godly government .
