But what happens now ? Even as the sixth man , Noah was averaging nearly 22 minutes a game , and those minutes aren t going to replace themselves . With Noah done for the season , the Bulls can t trade him , and they ll have to rely on the roster they already have to pick up the slack . Luckily , they ve got plenty of big men , and they ve been here before . Noah has already missed eleven games this season , including a nine game stretch where the Bulls went 7 ? 2 and averaged 107 . 6 points per game , 5 . 5 points above their season average . It s a small sample size , but that stretch included games against Oklahoma City , Indiana , Atlanta and two games against Toronto .
