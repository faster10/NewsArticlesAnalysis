Mavis is a ghostwriter for a successful young adult book series , and even that minor claim to fame is soon to be extinguished : The series is played out and the novel she is working on will be the last of them . Perhaps that ' s why she feels compelled to head back home when she receives an e mail from an ex boyfriend , Buddy Slade ( Patrick Wilson ) , announcing the birth of his first child . Figuring , very , very , wrongly , that this message must be some kind of coded cry for help , Mavis hops into her Mini and heads straight to Mercury , Minnesota , where she grew up , and where she means to reconnect with Buddy and free him from his domesticated servitude .
