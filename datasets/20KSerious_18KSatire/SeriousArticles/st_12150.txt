Indian television channels have been blocked in Nepal since yesterday . Whether the government has strong armed the cable operators or the cable operators have become ultra patriotic and stopped them by popular demand , as Kathmandu claims , is of course the big question . Whatever the answer , the unfolding saga is bound to be quite nail biting . Will the people of Nepal , already suffering from shortages of cooking medium and heating fuel and life saving medicine , be ready to do without their daily soaps , their daily fixes of saas bahu serials too ? If yes , then India has reason to worry . The tide will have turned , Nepal ? ? ? s fury against India will become inflexible , implacable . The jokes about Narendra Modi will get louder and more raucous and Beijing will have the last laugh .
