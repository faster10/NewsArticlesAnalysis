Gooding : No , I don ' t . In fact , I sometimes find these gender differences , when sort of represented in the business environment , are actually just not very useful . I think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and I don ' t think it goes down to straightforward gender divide . Because I have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial , and I ' ve equally seen men who are very consultative . So , I don ' t just think it divides that way .
