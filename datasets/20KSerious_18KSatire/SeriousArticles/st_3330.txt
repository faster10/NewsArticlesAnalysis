The Patriots had to watch Sunday ' s Broncos Steelers game and feel pretty good . Neither of those teams looked very sharp , and the Broncos survived . It seems simple : The more points scored in this game , the bigger edge the Patriots will have . It ' s tough to see the Broncos offense ? ? which was 16th in total yards , 19th in yards per play and 19th in points per game in the regular season ? ? keeping up with the Patriots if this becomes a high scoring game . But the Broncos have a great defense and seem to enjoy the pressure of playing in close games . The Patriots look like the better team coming in , and it would take a great effort by Denver ' s defense to advance to the Super Bowl . The good news for Denver is it has the best defense in the NFL .
