I d like to acknowledge the wonderful work of this year s nominees . While we celebrate their extraordinary achievements , I am both heartbroken and frustrated about the lack of inclusion . This is a difficult but important conversation , and it s time for big changes . The Academy is taking dramatic steps to alter the makeup of our membership . In the coming days and weeks we will conduct a review of our membership recruitment in order to bring about much needed diversity in our 2016 class and beyond .
