There is no real reason to believe in the Knicks , other than the Nets and Sixers are so bad that New York could scrape together enough wins to scare up a playoff spot . Well , maybe there s one other reason : Carmelo Anthony . The perennial All Star is back in the lineup after missing most of last season following knee surgery , rejoining a team that was laughable at times but , ? under the watching eye of Phil Jackson , has a smidge of promise with draft picks Kristaps Porzingis and Jerian Grant .
