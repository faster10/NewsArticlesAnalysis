What we confront in Syria and Iraq is simultaneously 1 ) a multi layered civil war where we can barely locate the faction we want to boost , let alone have any confidence they might win 2 ) the rise of a powerful and radical terrorist group 3 ) a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia 4 ) tense maneuvering between the U . S . and Russia and 5 ) the worst refugee crisis in decades . Whatever you might think about the way forward , anyone who tells you there s a simple solution to all that either doesn t know what they re talking about or is lying to you ( or maybe to himself or herself ) .
