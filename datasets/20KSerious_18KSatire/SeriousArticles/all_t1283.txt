â€‹Curt Schilling takes action against daughter's online bullies
Former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling is considering taking legal action against people who tweeted vulgar comments about his daughter.It started last week when Schilling, a proud father, sent a tweet congratulating his daughter on being accepted to Salve Regina University where she'll play softball."I was excited," said Schilling. Schilling and his wife Shonda say the tweet was inexplicably met with multiple responses. First mild, then vulgar and sexually explicit.Schilling says some of the tweets were more than just offensive -- they were against the law. He says he has been contacted by the FBI and two local police departments, and is discussing filing possible criminal charges."You attacked my child, the rules kind of go out the window when you attack family," said Schilling. "This wasn't harmless, this wasn't a joke, this wasn't some guys having some beers and making fun. These were people who were malicious, who don't like me, who tried to destroy my daughter." Schilling says two people have already been fired from jobs as a result of their tweets; one is a disc jockey at a local community college in New Jersey and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees.
