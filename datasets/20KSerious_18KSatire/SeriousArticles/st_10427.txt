None of this huggermugger generates much excitement . What drew me into the film most was the depiction of Poe ' s life as an impoverished poet , trying to make a few bucks by composing detective fiction while fiercely criticizing the work of other writers . In one scene , the anguished Poe wagers that at least one person in a pub will recognize him as an author , best known for " The Raven . " Cusack captures that desperation vividly enough to make you wish this was the real Poe story , which " The Raven " onscreen leaves buried alive .
