I concur with the American gun lobby that gun control amounts to an obvious restriction of individual liberties . Like most French or European citizens , I would add a point : So what ? Who even cares that , barring some ( even more restrictive ) amendments added since the 1980s , most of our gun laws date back to the decrees of April 18 , 1939 . It was a time of official mobilization against Hitler ' s imminent offensive , a time when a derelict French government cared less about its citizens killing each other than about the populace , or political factions , turning their weapons against the state for an insurrection .
