The Blazers looked like they had the game in the bag with a hot start , but lost it . Still , we saw some good outings from Damian Lillard with 33 points , six rebounds , six assists and four 3 pointers , and C . J . McCollum had 24 points , three rebounds , five dimes , two steals and four 3 pointers . Both players were over 50 percent from the field and are trending up after a slump from like two weeks ago . McCollum is putting up fourth round value on the year while Lillard is back up to top 20 . They re rock solid .
