She s offered bouncy , relaxed Dancehall tracks that suit her natural Barbadian rhythm down to a T like the surefire Drake collaboration Work released earlier this week , ( she s had a No1 with him before with What s My Name ? , so it s a safe bet to collaborate again , and boy does it work ) , but what s exciting is she s tested her own limits .
