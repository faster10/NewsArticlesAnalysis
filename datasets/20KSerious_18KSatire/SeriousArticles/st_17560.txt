FOLKENFLIK : Well , it ' s hard not to look at this as a stunt . I mean , certainly , it ' s the publication that posts that you know , publishes Matt Taibbi and Hunter S . Thompson and people who have done a lot of funny pieces . It was a purple story , singularly unedifying , and they had to make a real compromise . I mean , they acknowledged they made an understanding with Guzman that the piece would be , as they put it , submitted for the subject ' s approval before publication . That is , he could , in a sense edit , censor , excise information . They said he did nothing to the article , but that at least they acknowledged that agreement . But that agreement means they are in league with him . Now let ' s also say Rolling Stone right now is reeling from this rape story they had to retract about the University of Virginia . It ' s a nice way to change the subject for them .
