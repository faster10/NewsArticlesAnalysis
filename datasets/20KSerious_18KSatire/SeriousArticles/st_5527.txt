Jackson , Jordan , Smith and Elba gave incredible performances but again , none of the people who were nominated instead of them were indefensible selections . It ' s a tough pill to swallow , but it was just a terrific year for actors , lead and supporting . Additionally , even the distributor of Jordan ' s film didn ' t realize it was an awards contender until it was perhaps too late to mobilize a fully effective campaign . The distributor of Elba ' s film released it through a model never before tested with the Academy ( in just a few theaters simultaneous to its debut on Netflix ) . And the Academy wasn t crazy about anything to do with Jackson s or Smith s films , including the contributions of the white people who wrote and directed them .
