" I was 10 pages into script before that moment came to me , " Levin said . " I e mailed the director , told him that ' s what I wanted to do , and he loved it . And I said , ' OK , don ' t tell anyone . ' I wanted everyone else to read it as it naturally developed in the script . So for a month or so I had producers and directors breathing down my neck wanting to know what this moment will be , but I fended them off until I sent off the script . And luckily they loved it . I think the audience will like it , too . "
