After the gathering ended , one of the women approached me . She told me that while she was growing up , she had been told to shut up so often she just did it automatically . It felt good to hear someone give voice to how she felt inside , she said . We talked about all the things that kept us silent and shut down . She promised to speak out more from that day on . As she walked away , something came over me : I felt ignited , energized . . . yes , beautiful . Real Simple : 34 low cost , make you smile ideas
