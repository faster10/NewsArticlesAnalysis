Everybody in the league s talking about Golden State . And there s a lot of times where you get a tweet , it ll go , ' Hey Sully , good luck on Friday , ' " said Jared Sullinger . " I m like , we play on Wednesday . In this league if you overlook anybody , you re going to come up short . And I m not talking about a four or five point loss . I m talking about a 25 point loss if you re looking ahead . I thought we did a tremendous job of focusing on the game in front of us . We ve been doing that all year .
