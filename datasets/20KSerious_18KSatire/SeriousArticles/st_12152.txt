" We appreciate ( the streak ) because we know that this hasn ' t been done in history before , so every game we win from here on out is adding to that record , " Curry said , adding , " I think the beauty of our team is when we get out there , nobody ' s thinking about if we lose , the streak ' s over , or we ' ve got to go out here and throw a huge home run play out in the first quarter to win the game or what have you to keep the streak going . That ' s not on our minds , and I think that ' s why we are where we are . "
