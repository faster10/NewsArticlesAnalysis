The Packers are dangerous because they are led by arguably the NFL s best quarterback of the last ? few seasons . ? Aaron Rodgers has a chance to lead the Packers on a deep postseason run , but Green Bay probably won t get past the first round if he continues to play like he has in recent weeks . His 92 . 7 passer rating is his lowest since he became Green Bay s starter in 2008 , and he hasn t thrown for 300 yards since Nov . 15 . The Packers rank 23rd in total offense and 15th in total defense , though they do have wins against the Seahawks , Chiefs and Vikings .
