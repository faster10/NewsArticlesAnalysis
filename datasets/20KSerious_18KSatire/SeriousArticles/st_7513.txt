JEB BUSH S AD PUSH IN NH FEATURES BARBARA BUSH . With the New Hampshire primaries only three weeks away , Jeb Bush is trying to revive an ailing campaign with a new advertisement push in the state featuring a very special guest . . . his mother . Former First Lady Barbara Bush , in a web video entitled " A Message From Barbara Bush " attempts to sway voters , as only she can , praising him as " a wonderful son " whose " heart is big . " When push comes to shove , people are going to realize Jeb has real solutions . Rather than talking about how popular they are , how great they are , he ' s doing it because he sees a huge need and it ' s not being filled by anybody , " she says in the video , seemingly taking a dig at frontrunner Donald Trump . Though the video , for now , is planned for the internet only , Bush accidentally announced it at his town hall Thursday night before his campaign had officially released it , ABC s CANDACE SMITH reports . http : abcn . ws 1P9zcaZ
