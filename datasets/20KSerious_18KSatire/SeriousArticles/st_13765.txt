" It was a meticulous , painstaking process of looking for clues , " said Klein . " An on camera word , a gesture , the tempo , guitar chords . The amazing thing is and every fan should appreciate this we sometimes had three versions of a song and every version would drop in against picture and could be matched up . That is a testament to the lockstep nature of Charlie and Bill . And also Mick , particularly the spoken word sections . The cadence is nearly always the same . He breaks the line up in the same way every time he breathes at the same place . Many of his gestures remain to this day . He still hits his knee when he sings ' Time Is on My Side ' and slaps the air during ' Satisfaction ' . "
