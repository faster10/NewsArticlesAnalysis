I ' ve been thinking a lot about that time in my life growing up in Mexico , especially as the country is getting ready to inaugurate a new president Saturday . Much has changed since then . Electoral reforms brought about during the 1990s opened up democracy in Mexico . Clouthier ' s party , the PAN , finally came to power in 2000 when Vicente Fox won the elections . It was the first time in 71 years that Mexico was going to be governed by a party that was not the PRI . Fox was succeeded by the PAN ' s Felipe Calderon , who finished his six year term Saturday .
