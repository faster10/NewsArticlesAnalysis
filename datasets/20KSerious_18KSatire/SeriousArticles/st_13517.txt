At the same time , Cruz has to bet that Trump s legions simply won t show up on caucus day . It s not the most far fetched hope , given that no one really seems to know the specifics of Trump s on the ground operation in the state , and what information exists suggests that it s not especially robust . The Trump campaign in Iowa ( and presumably elsewhere ) relies primarily on Trump s celebrity , his knack for earned media , and the massive rallies he puts together . But when it comes to actually getting people to the caucuses , the Trump strategy is dependent on supporters motivating themselves to turn out . As Monmouth University s polling director put it , Trump s victory hinges on having a high number of self motivated , lone wolf caucusgoers show up Monday night . If his supporters don t know when and where to caucus , or simply can t be bothered to go , then he ll be in a much weaker position than the polls suggest .
