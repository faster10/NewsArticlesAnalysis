These names had the added advantage of reflecting the typographical character of the cities in question , so London had an old fashioned serif " blackletter " feel that Dickens might have favored , Venice had an artisanal script feel , and Geneva had a cleaner Swiss sans serif look . For some reason yet to be fully justified , the San Francisco font appeared to be made up of odd letters torn from a newspaper , a digital ransom note . Soon there would be more familiar names added to the mix , including Times New Roman and Helvetica .
