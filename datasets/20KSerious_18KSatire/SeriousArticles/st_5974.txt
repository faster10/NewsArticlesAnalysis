The biggest question hanging over these playoffs : Which Patriots team will we see ? For the first 10 weeks , they were the league ' s best team . For much of the last six , they didn ' t even look like a playoff team , mostly because of injuries . If the Patriots are healthy , they can repeat . But their depleted offensive line may have to battle the Kansas City and Denver defensive fronts , and those are tough matchups for an injured unit . So the Super Bowl pick here is Arizona , the league s most complete team right now , over Denver , which has the league s best defense .
