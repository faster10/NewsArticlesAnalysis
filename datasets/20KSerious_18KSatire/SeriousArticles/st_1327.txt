Minnesota Vikings : The two teams that have beaten the Vikings this season have been the ones that were able to run the ball the most effectively the Denver Broncos averaged 6 . 0 yards per carry on the way to 144 rushing yards , and the San Francisco 49ers got 5 . 9 yards per carry on a 230 yard night . But even in two games where they allowed roughly 4 . 5 yards per carry , the Vikings won . They ' ve been able to keep teams from hitting big plays against them because of their pass rush , and unless the Raiders are able to control the game on the ground , the Vikings ' defense will do enough to make this trip to the Bay Area more successful than the clunker against San Francisco .
