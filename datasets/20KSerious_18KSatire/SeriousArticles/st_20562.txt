Pros : Bezos actually has a host of traits that mirror Jobs . Like Jobs was with Apple , he ' s the founder of Amazon as well as its CEO . Being a part of a company ' s life story helps . As much as anyone , Bezos also captures a bit of Jobs ' panache at live events . At last year ' s rollout of the Kindle Fire , he got high marks for introducing a game changing product in a stylized fashion , then getting off the stage . ( Tech giants Google and Microsoft have been accused of being rambling and unfocused at similar unveilings . ) Reports say Bezos shares Jobs ' penchant for attention to detail ( some would say micromanaging ) and , like Jobs , he ' s been willing to take the company into new and unexpected directions .
