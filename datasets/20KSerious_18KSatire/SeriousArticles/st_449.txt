There are a lot of things to love about Galaxy Quest , not the least of which because it s simply hysterical . For sci fi nerds , it was a smart cultural satire that had remarkable affection . It wasn t condescending , uninspired , nor did it pander , basically everything The Big Bang Theory does to wreak havoc . And this was years before the superhero media boom that morphed Comic Con from a civic center gathering into the densely populated , commercialized disease party it is today . And Alan Rickman is fantastic .
