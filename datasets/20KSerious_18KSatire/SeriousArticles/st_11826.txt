There have been several lawsuits filed over the price that Flint has been charging for water over the past few years , and one of these lawsuits was successful last summer . A Genesee County judge ordered Flint to refund a portion of the price paid by its water customers and he issued a moratorium on water shutoffs till the city straightened out its issue of overcharging residents . However , this lawsuit was filed because the city had illegally raised its rate for water to an amount that was greater than what the law allows . In the United States , cities can only charge customers what the actual cost of a service is . In this case , the plaintiff was able to prove that Flint had raised its rate to a price greater than what the cost of the service was . This caused the city to slightly lower the water rates and issue refunds to customers along with not shutting off service to customers who were delinquent . Recently , a different judge ruled that in 90 days the city could reinstate its shutoff policy if bills were not current by then .
