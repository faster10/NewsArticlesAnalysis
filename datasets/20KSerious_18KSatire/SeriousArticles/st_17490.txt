What a long , strange trip his has been . Phillips first coached in the NFL in 1976 , 40 years ago , and he s held head coaching jobs with six clubs ( three full time gigs and three interim tenures ) and been the defensive coordinator with a whopping eight organizations . This is his second go around as Denver s DC , and his second shot at a Super Bowl ring , with his first opportunity producing the worst blowout in Super Bowl history : that 55 ? 10 San Francisco drubbing of the Broncos in January 1990 . Phillips has waited 26 years to get back to this stage , and it s why I couldn t wait to check in on Wade s World on Monday night at SAP Center , and to take in the wit and wisdom of the one and only Sonofbum , as he goes by on Twitter in an homage to his coaching father , the late , great Bum Phillips .
