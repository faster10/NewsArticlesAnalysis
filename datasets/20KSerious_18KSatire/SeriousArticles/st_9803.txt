Roberto Cavalli : Florence is such a special city . I travel a lot , today I am here , tomorrow maybe in London or Paris or New York . New York is a city where I feel more excited , sometimes I say New York is like a drug it gives you so much energy , but afterwards I need Florence , I live to come back here . I need to continue to breathe art , the air that is in Florence , to walk in my city , to walk in my streets . It ' s so charming Pitti Palace , the Ponte Vecchio , Michelangelo ' s David . That is Florence . I love it .
