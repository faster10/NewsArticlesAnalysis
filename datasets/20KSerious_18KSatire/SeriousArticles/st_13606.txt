Growing up as a student of classical ballet , I floated in and out of all kinds of unhealthy eating disorders . I experimented with bulimia , starvation , laxatives and diet pills . Dancers knew plenty of terrible tricks . We ' d eat carrots and use the bright orange to mark when to stop throwing up before all the nutrients and energy we needed to dance were expended . We ate tissue paper to feel full . We were caffeine addicts some even snorted it . Many smoked cigarettes and a few did drugs .
