It wasn ' t until he got laid off and our COBRA coverage expired that I discovered how difficult it would be to buy a health plan on my own . I shopped around , but as soon as I revealed my pre existing condition , I was denied coverage no further questions asked . My appeals were unsuccessful , and insurers wouldn ' t even sell me a plan at some sky high price . I went to California ' s high risk pool for uninsured people with pre existing conditions , but the option to pay 1 , 800 a month for flimsy coverage that would have left my three young children uninsured was not really an option at all .
