But Phelps needs a life . If I ' m Debbie , Michael ' s mother , I cease with all the Rio jabber ( really , the woman needs to stop ) and say the following : " Son , I ' m proud of you . You ' ve done amazing things . But you ' re 27 , and life is short . You ' ve made lots of money in endorsements . Use some of it . Here ' s a backpack , a Fodor ' s and a one way ticket to Prague . Go see the world . Eat anything you want . Sleep in hostels , drink lots of beers , hit up Amsterdam and Barcelona and Geelong and Venice and Wolverhampton and Valletta . Tell the ladies you ' re Michael Phelps if it helps , or just pull your cap down low and call yourself Biff Stevens . Just make sure and live ! "
