Since the Snowden documents became public , I have been receiving e mails from people seeking advice on whom to trust . As a security and privacy expert , I ' m expected to know which companies protect their users ' privacy and which encryption programs the NSA can ' t break . The truth is , I have no idea . No one outside the classified government world does . I tell people that they have no choice but to decide whom they trust and to then trust them as a matter of faith . It ' s a lousy answer , but until our government starts down the path of regaining our trust , it ' s the only thing we can do .
