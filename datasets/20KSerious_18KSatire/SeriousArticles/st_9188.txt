" What ' s really interesting to me about the surge of women in television and film comedies is that a large part of it is really driven by ' Saturday Night Live , ' " said Gallagher . " Lorne Michaels is directly responsible for Tina Fey being able to do ' 30 Rock , ' which really kicked off the whole movement by showing that women can be the driving force of comedy on a show , instead of just the beleaguered wife reacting to her husband ' s jokes . Michaels also produces ' Up All Night , ' which does a great job of letting both Christina Applegate and Maya Rudolph shine , even in a more traditional sitcom setting . "
