In " The Canyons , " the new film written by Bret Easton Ellis ( " American Psycho " ) and directed by Paul Schrader ( " Taxi Driver , " " Raging Bull " ) , Lohan plays Tara , a woman who has a lot going on not least of which is that her boyfriend ( played by porn star James Deen ) likes to invite other men and women home to have sex with them . The low budget film had difficulties finding a distributor , and The New York Times documented Lohan ' s on set antics , which nearly got her fired from the film before shooting even began .
