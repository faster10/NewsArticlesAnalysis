" I was 14 and my mom and I were in a really bad place . We had just gone through a messy divorce from an abusive marriage . She had also been diagnosed with breast and skin cancer and we were very worried about how we would pay for the medical costs without her job . Our faith was slipping . We were standing in line at a pharmacy , we both had pneumonia . This really nice elderly women was in line behind us and my mom let her go in front of us and the woman introduced herself , and put her hands over us and started praying , right in the middle of the Pharmacy . My mom got a check from the insurance company a few weeks later . A few months after that she was hired at a new job . She is currently in her 8th year of breast cancer remission and her 3rd year of skin cancer remission . My faith has been renewed and we could not be in a better place . My mother is my hero . "
