Not only is he far younger ( Osweiler will turn 25 this week ) , but he s seems to be a far better fit athletically for Kubiak s offense . Though Osweiler was sacked three times on Sunday , he displayed his mobility multiple times , throwing on the run or scrambling and sliding . The naked bootleg , a longtime staple of the Kubiak offense , should be a strength for Osweiler , where it was a weakness for Manning , and Osweiler s arm strength far exceeds Manning s at this point , which could open up a different range of down field pass options .
