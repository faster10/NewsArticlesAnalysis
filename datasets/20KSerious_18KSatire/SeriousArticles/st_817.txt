Most " extra solar planets " ( or " exoplanets " ) have been found by measuring tiny Doppler shifts ( wavelength shifts ) in the light of the host star . With this method it is easier to find heavy planets than light ones , and easier to find planets in close rather than distant orbits . So most of the planets found so far are big ones , similar to Jupiter or Neptune in our solar system , only orbiting much , much closer than the Earth to their host star . This is kind of like surveying your neighborhood for sumo wrestlers : You find far fewer than the number of other people who live there , and way fewer than the population of the world . So the 716 known exoplanets are just the tip of the iceberg .
