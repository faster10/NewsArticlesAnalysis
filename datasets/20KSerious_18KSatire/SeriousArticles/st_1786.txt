Clark : I would expect now what ' s going to happen is this is going to go away for quite some time . If I ' m a defense attorney what I want is for everybody to calm down , go away and forget about the case and let tempers cool . Because right now it ' s still very hot , there ' s a lot of hard feelings and emotion in the air . That ' s the last thing the defense wants if you go to trial under these circumstances . So , I would expect the defense to do everything they can to delay the trial and it wouldn ' t surprise me if it took at least a year to get into court .
