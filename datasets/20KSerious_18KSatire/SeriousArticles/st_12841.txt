Alarmingly , Greece s Citizen Protection Minister Nikos Toskas has said that the owner of the Syrian passport entered the EU through the Greek island of Leros on October 3 . If confirmed that this is the bomber in question , it will be a source of grave concern for security and counter terrorism officials and will be raised at the G20 too given that the migration crisis is also on the agenda . Turkey , the host of the G20 , is occupying centrestage in the migration crisis having already taken in some two million refugees from the Middle East , mainly from Syria and Iraq . For the European Union too , which has also seen half a million refugees this year cross its borders , including from sub Saharan Africa and states such as Afghanistan , the scale of the challenge is one of the biggest for decades , threatening the integrity of the 28 member bloc s open border Schengen scheme .
