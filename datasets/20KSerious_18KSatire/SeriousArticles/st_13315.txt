His career mirrors uncannily that of another , even more crumbling American athletic monument , Tiger Woods . He is 37 , Woods is 39 . Both have adorned their sport for two decades , but at a high physical price . Woods is in a far worse state than Bryant : after yet more back surgery , the 14 times major winner cannot even bend to pick up a ball . When will he be able to play ? I ve no idea , he said this week . There s nothing I can look forward to , nothing I can build towards . Bryant can still play , just about , but making his retirement official came as not the slightest surprise . A Woods statement that his PGA tour days were done would be even less of one .
