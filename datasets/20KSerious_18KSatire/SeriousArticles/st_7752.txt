Diamond : Well , it ' s a wonderful honor any time the Grammys extend an honor to you . Diamond has received 12 nominations over his career , but has only won one award . But the real satisfaction I get from that benefit that big dinner is that the money will be going to musicians who are facing very difficult times . It ' s not the most secure job in the world , and there are musicians who are facing medical emergencies and financial difficulties who will benefit from the money that is being generated . It ' s a cause that ' s very close to my heart . I have been very fortunate , and I have been successful .
