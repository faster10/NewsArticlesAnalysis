In fact , I d like to take this opportunity to formally state for the record that this year s SEC is the worst I ve seen since pre 2006 ( the first of the seven straight BCS title seasons ) . Seemingly half the teams are in some state of dysfunction . There may be more SEC fan bases that want their coach and or at least one coordinator fired than don t . The quarterback play is worse than I ever imagined it could be . And while Alabama and Florida have legit dominant defenses , it s hard to play the but we play great defense card when the next best after that belong to sub . 500 Vanderbilt and Missouri teams .
