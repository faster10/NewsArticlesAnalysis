There are reasonable things we could do to reduce gun violence while respecting the rights of law abiding citizens to own guns . For example , better and more consistent background checks and required reporting by mental health professionals when patients make violent threats ( requiring the removal of firearm licenses from those individuals ) would go a long way . We can also put out public health campaigns to warn people of the risks of gun ownership so they could make informed decisions of their own without their constitutional rights being violated .
