One young woman I heard about gets up at 4 a . m . for her first job and ends her day at 10 p . m . at her second job . The average allotment of food stamps is 133 a person a month . Let me tell you something I can pretty much bet my house on that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar . She ' s quietly going to the food pantry , checking the sales in the grocery store , spending some time at the kitchen table clipping coupons and making a serious plan to turn that box of pasta , pound of beef , and if she ' s lucky , some fresh fruits and vegetables , into a meal plan truly worthy of a Gucci belt .
