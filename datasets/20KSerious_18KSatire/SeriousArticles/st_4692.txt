Hart : No sleep ! Right now I ' m probably going on 27 hours awake . So my days are hectic . Once I ' m done with this today I go to Conan O ' Brien . After that I go to the premiere . I got to introduce the premiere . Then I get on a plane and I fly to Vegas . I land and I go straight to the set and I ' m shooting until 4 a . m . It ' s ridiculously crazy . At some point I ' m just going to shut down . I don ' t know when it ' s going to happen today , but someone ' s going to stop talking to me and I ' m going to be asleep . Once I stop talking it ' s all over .
