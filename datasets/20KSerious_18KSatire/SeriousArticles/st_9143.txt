When I watch the games today , the awe is gone . Instead , I thank God that my son never wanted to play football , that it was basketball that stole his heart . And I find it ironic and a bit disingenuous that the NFL , in an effort to make the game more attractive to its 44 female audience , adorns the players and the field in Breast Cancer pink . Imagine where breast cancer research would be today if the science around the cause of the disease was rejected , or covered up . Imagine if women were told to ignore the warning signs of this killer disease , or if we were denied access to lifesaving treatment .
