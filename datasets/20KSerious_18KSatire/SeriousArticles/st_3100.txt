The Shahbag protests , named after a Dhaka neighborhood , center on that brutal nine month war in which Ahmed and other Bangladeshis fought for independence from Pakistan . When one of the top officials in the opposition Jamaat e Islami party , Abdul Quader Mollah , was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes on February 5 , protesters demanded a death sentence . ( Since then , violence has escalated as other war criminals received death sentences , and Jamaat supporters launched counterprotests . )
