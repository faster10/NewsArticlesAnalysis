The history of Oscar ignoring , snubbing or leaving out actors , directors and films focused on people of color is long and painful . The most glaring example in my lifetime was the total shut out of the Color Purple , one of the most exquisite and powerful films ever made . While nominated for 11 academy awards in 1986 , it failed to win a single one and lost Best Picture that year to the decidedly mediocre Out of Africa ( with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in the leads ) . Even then , the calls of bias among Academy voters was loud yet little changed .
