While the site has stringent guidelines ( " reviews should contain only original content and no quoted material from other sources . . . we do not allow quoted material from personal email correspondence with a property manager " ) and even has moderators to flag posts that seem fishy ( like a hotelier giving his property rave reviews , for example ) , there ' s no way to catch every questionable review . Even with the caveat , peer reviews can be helpful , as they ' re often more detailed ( " the room smelled of moldy hotel carpeting " ) and straightforward ( " the check in staff was great , but the hotel was on a yucky street " ) than those from third party organizations or tourism boards .
