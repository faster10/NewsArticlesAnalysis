Between 1982 and 2007 , college tuition and fees rose more than 400 ( about four times the rate of inflation ) Today , the average student loan debt exceeds 25 , 000 and total student loan debt exceeds 1 trillion . Less than 60 of college students finish college in six years or less . One out of every two college graduates today are unemployed or underemployed . The system overspends and underperforms .
