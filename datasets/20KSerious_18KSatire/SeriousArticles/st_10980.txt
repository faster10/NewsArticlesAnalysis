Abrams : About 15 years ago I was at LAX and I saw a Robert Ludlum novel sitting on a bench . I went over and picked it up . Inside someone had written in pen on the title page of the book , " to whomever finds this book please read it and take it somewhere and leave it for someone else to read . " I just loved this idea that someone would use a book as a means of communication . What happens if you read the notes in it , what if you responded to those notes ? Could there be a story or maybe even a romance that begins between two people over a book ?
