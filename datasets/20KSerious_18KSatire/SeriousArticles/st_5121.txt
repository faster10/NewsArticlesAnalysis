" You might take a close game , where Alabama could make a couple mistakes and Florida could steal this game and turn it into a rout by trying to do too much . I cannot conceive Florida going out and being anything other than what we ' ve seen . They ' re going to be a little bit of a bootleg team , they ' re going to roll their quarterback , they ' re going to run Taylor , try and keep the game close . Punt it , kick it , and hopefully the pressure will shift or Alabama will make a couple mistakes or Vernon Hargreaves or Jalen Tabor or Quincy Wilson or Keanu Neal can produce a turnover . I think they want to win this game even uglier than how Auburn tried to win it , and Auburn stayed in there the best way they could . "
