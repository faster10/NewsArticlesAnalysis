For many liberals I know , the free speech objection to campaign finance law is just a smokescreen for enabling corporate villainy . I mean , Mitch McConnell cares about the First Amendment ? I used to think that way , too . But try this exercise : Check out the free speech objections by people who don ' t want Goldman Sachs to take over the West Wing , or Wal Mart to bulldoze private residences . I ' m talking about anti corporatist crusaders like Tim Carney , anti eminent domain abuse litigators like the Institute of Justice , or even former Federal Elections Commission chief Brad Smith .
