James is 19th on the all time scoring list and should pass Reggie Miller for 18th place Wednesday night at Toronto . While he didn t quite catch Miller , he moved into the company of Robertson , a do it all guard who is sometimes overlooked when some fans debate the game s top players . Steve Young is great . ( Terry ) Bradshaw , all those great quarterbacks they never compare them as much , but when it comes to our sport we re so eager to say , Who is better , Oscar or ( Michael ) Jordan ? or , Jordan or LeBron or Kobe ( Bryant ) or these guys ? instead of just accepting greatness .
