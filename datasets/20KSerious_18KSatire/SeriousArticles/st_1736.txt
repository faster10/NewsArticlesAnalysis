We will retrain our work force for the jobs of tomorrow and ensure that every child receives a quality education no matter where they live , including especially our inner cities . Parents and students , not administrators and unions , need to have greater choice . Our current worker retraining system is a labyrinth of federal programs that sprawls across 47 programs and nine agencies . We will eliminate this redundancy and empower the 50 states and the private sector to develop effective programs of their own .
