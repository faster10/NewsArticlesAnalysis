" One thing that I can control is do what I can do as far as on my end , and that s going back home , donating , having something around for the city as far as people having free water , stuff like that . Because it s kind of hard when you can t even shower in your own shower , when you can t drink your own water .

But just to add that on your plate , it s kind of tough .
