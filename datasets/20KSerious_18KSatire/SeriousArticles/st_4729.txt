You can even find people who postulate that artificially sweetened beverages trick the brain into wanting more calories . There ' s really no proof of that . Finally , some will claim that diet drinks will cause the brain to release insulin , which can change your metabolism and make you hungry . That ' s a bit hard to swallow . That ' s like saying if you ate sugar dense food that tasted terrible , it would trick your brain into not releasing insulin . It ' s the pancreas that releases insulin anyway , not the brain .
