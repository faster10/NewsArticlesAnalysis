Real Michael Bolton plays "Office Space" Michael Bolton in sketch
Michael Bolton steps into the role of the Michael Bolton character from the 1999 movie "Office Space" in a new Funny or Die video -- and it's pretty chuckle-worthy. "At least your name isn't Michael Bolton!" he says in the clip. "There was nothing wrong with that [name] until I was about 12 years old and that extremely talented ass clown started winning all those Grammys."The parody comes complete with a printer-throwing Bolton. And seeing the 62-year-old crooner lip-syncing a rap is...well, priceless.Office Space with Michael Bolton from Funny Or Die
