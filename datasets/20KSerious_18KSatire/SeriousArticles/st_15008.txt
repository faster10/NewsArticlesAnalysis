Georgia : The current Republican senator , Saxby Chambliss , is retiring , leaving his seat vulnerable . Michelle Nunn comes from a family steeped in Georgia politics and is proving to be a viable Democratic candidate in this red state . Over on the GOP side , the candidates are beating each other up in a contentious primary and pushing each other further to the right , which could leave the primary winner bruised and too extreme for a general election electorate . Additionally , primary candidates must win more than 50 of the vote to avoid a runoff . With the crowded field , a runoff is possible , adding another challenging element to Republican efforts to keep this seat .
