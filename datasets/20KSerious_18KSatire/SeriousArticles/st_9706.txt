Planned Parenthood cannot rebut the incriminating statements of its own leadership on these tapes , and so it has resorted to an awkward shuffle of blind denials and stagy distractions in their wake . The truth will continue to come out through the congressional probe , through the ongoing state investigations ? and through the frivolous lawsuit Planned Parenthood now brings in retaliation for its exposure . The accounting gimmicks I believe Planned Parenthood uses to hide its baby parts sales may pass unnoticed in 24 hour news cycle sound bites , but the quality based specimen payments from fetal tissue vendors who already do all the work of collection and transport are impossible to defend under closer scrutiny . In order to avoid such scrutiny , Planned Parenthood has announced a dubious policy change to end these payments . After months of defending them as perfectly legal and appropriate , this seems like an admission of guilt .
