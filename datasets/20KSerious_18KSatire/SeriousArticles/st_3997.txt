There have been dual threat quarterbacks before , and some with gaudier stats , but none who have been this effective perhaps since the mid to late 90s and Hall of Famer Steve Young . And that was a different era , when Young had more talent around him . Remember , Newton s best receiver ? Kelvin Benjamin ? has missed the entire season with a knee injury . Outside of his all pro tight end ? Greg Olsen , who had 77 catches for 1 , 104 yards ? Newton didn t have a single receiver with 45 catches or 750 yards .
