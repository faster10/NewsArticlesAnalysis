Harvey talked Mets manager Terry Collins into staying in the game . It was a mistake . Cain drew a walk and stole second . Hosmer doubled to left and Cain scored . That was it for Harvey as Jeurys Familia relieved . Moustakas grounded to first and Hosmer took third . Perez grounded softly toward short , and Wright cut off the ball . He looked at Hosmer , then threw to first for the out . With no one near third base , Hosmer held his ground and then broke for home and scored easily . Duda threw wild from first base , but Hosmer likely would have been safe anyway . Herrera set the Mets down in order .
