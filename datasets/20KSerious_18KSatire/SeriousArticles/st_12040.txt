The Transportation Security Administration ' s Trusted Traveler PreCheck Program is a model of risk based screening that is increasing our security and facilitating commerce . The TSA approach allows approved , prescreened travelers to establish they are not security threats and move more nimbly to transact international business . This allows TSA officers to focus their attention on more consequential threats to aviation security . This risk based approach is better for the traveling public and provides more security at less cost . We can adopt a similar approach to our land border with Mexico , if the Congress acts .
