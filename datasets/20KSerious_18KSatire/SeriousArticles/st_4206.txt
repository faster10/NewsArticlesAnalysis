You know , Ted is not a person that s liked . I mean , he s a nasty guy , and people don t like him , and I was really surprised to see that , Trump mused . And the people of Iowa love Branstad , and he cares for them . And he s not your politician where they talk , what he says is the right thing . So I think that s going to have a huge impact , if he really does not want Ted Cruz to win . And I was surprised to see . . . I mean think everybody because it s just not him , he doesn t do that . So I think it was a very bad hit .
