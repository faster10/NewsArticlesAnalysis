The bad news for Cruz was that because Trump wasn ' t present to take incoming from all the challengers , Cruz became the target of attacks from most of the other candidates . Cruz found himself in a defensive posture , which is a position he clearly hates to be in . That may explain his Trump like whining answer directed at Fox News anchor Chris Wallace . " Chris , I would note that that the last four questions have been , ' Rand , please attack Ted . Marco , please attack Ted . Chris , please attack Ted . Jeb , please attack Ted , ' " he complained . " Gosh , if you guys ask one more mean question I may have to leave the stage . " Cruz ' s feeble attempt at humor seemed more like an unforced error .
