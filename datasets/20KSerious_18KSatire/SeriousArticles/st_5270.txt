Schools aren ' t failing because the teachers don ' t care or aren ' t trying . It ' s not because teachers fail to follow the curriculum . It isn ' t because they are poorly paid . Teachers go into teaching because they want to make a difference and help kids . They certainly don ' t go into teaching to get rich . They don ' t want to do a bad job , either no one likes to fail . A recent survey of 40 , 000 teachers by the Gates Foundation shows that teachers are more interested in reform than money .
