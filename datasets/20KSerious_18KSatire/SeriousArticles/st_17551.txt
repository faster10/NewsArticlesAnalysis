Bender : We have been working on exoskeletons for the last 10 years . It started as a project with the military and it was funded by DARPA , the same people who funded the Internet and GPS systems . So it was groundbreaking technology , and in the year 2005 we had a breakthrough in terms of making sure that the weight of the exoskeleton transfers all the way down to the ground . So the user who is wearing it it usually weighs up to 50 pounds doesn ' t feel the weight at all . And that ' s so important because obviously you are trying to make their lives easier , not more difficult .
