NEW DELHI : Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said financial inclusion in the country is set to make a quantum leap with the coming together of several initiatives such as the opening of bank accounts for the poor and the payment of subsidies through them by harnessing technology appropriately . " We are on the verge of a cashless , paperless , presenceless economy and that would be extremely important to the poor who have to travel large distances ( and ) don ' t have a lot of ability to carry paper , " Rajan said at the 6th Delhi Economics Conclave on Friday . " There are enormous opportunities we can take advantage of , enormous profitable opportunities which will help both the consumer as well as the provider . "
