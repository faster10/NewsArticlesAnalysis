Other pleasant surprises : Kendrick Lamar s Alright ? anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement and all around one of the best jams of 2015 ? somehow managed to dance and protest its way into Song of the Year . The witty indie singer songwriter Courtney Barnett , whose album Sometimes I Sit and Think , and Sometimes I Just Sit is another fixture on critics Top 10 lists , managed to snag a nomination for Best New Artist . She ll go up against the Drake of country , singer and occasional mopey rapper Sam Hunt , whose nominations were more expected but are no less deserved . Tame Impala , Jamie XX , Little Big Town , and Fetty Wap all got duly recognized for career highs ( though the latter could reasonably complain about getting passed over for Best New Artist ) , and artists like Bj ? rk , Kanye West , Nicki Minaj , Miguel , Drake , and Jeremih all earned the minor nominations they deserved for minor works in their own discographies . Small corners of the Internet may throw tempests in their teapots about the lack of nominations for great albums from Sufjan Stevens , Carly Rae Jepsen , Sleater Kinney , and Kamasi Washington , in those artists respective categories , but these are fairly niche concerns .
