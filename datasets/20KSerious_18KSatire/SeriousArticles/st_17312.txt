CARLY FIORINA SAYS SHE WAS WRONG ON ' 92 ' CLAIM . Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina acknowledged that she was incorrect during last week ' s primary debate when she claimed " 92 percent of the jobs lost during President Barack Obama ' s first term belonged to women . " After the debate , fact checkers pointed out Fiorina had recycled the statistic from former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , who first made the claim in the 2012 election . It rated " Mostly False " by Politifact four years ago . " I misspoke on that particular fact , " Fiorina said on ABC ' s " This Week , " ABC ' s JORDYN PHELPS notes . Fiorina then criticized the " liberal media " for picking apart the statistic rather than her broader argument , which was that liberal policies are bad for women economically . http : abcn . ws 1KQ93XX
