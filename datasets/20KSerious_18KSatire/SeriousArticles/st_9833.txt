Many of the other requests discussed at the meeting were smaller bore in nature , including that the networks give campaigns final say over on screen biographical graphics displayed while the candidates are speaking ( Jeb Bush s campaign was particularly unhappy when one CNBC graphic listed his work as a banker but not his time as governor ) do not ask candidates to raise their hands to answer a question ( as Fox News did when it opened the first debate with a Donald Trump ? targeted question about potential third party runs ) do not ask a yes or no question without also offering time to provide a substantive answer and promise to keep the temperature in the debate hall below 67 degrees .
