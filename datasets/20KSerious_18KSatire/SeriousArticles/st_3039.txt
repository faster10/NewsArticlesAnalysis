Koryta : What I like about writing a stand alone novel is you ' re starting with a fresh world and fresh characters . Part of what I love about writing is that journey of discovery where it ' s all new to me as well . This is my fourth stand alone in a row and I am beginning to get a little bit of an itch now to take a longer ride with a character , to get to know them a little better . In " The Prophet " I really fell in love with those characters , there was an emotional connection there that I don ' t think I ' ve had in a while . It made me think it would be nice to stick with the characters for a little bit and see what happens . My next book will be a stand alone but after that I ' m thinking about trying to take a little bit longer ride .
