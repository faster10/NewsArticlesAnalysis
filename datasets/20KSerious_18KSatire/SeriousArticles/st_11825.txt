Over the past year , I have learned more about the details of treating drinking water than I had ever expected . Don ' t worry though , I ' m not writing to lecture about why hydrogen is the loneliest element , or even to explain the grim details of how the poison actually got into the water in the first place . However , I am writing to tell you that many Flint residents stopped paying their water bills in protest to the fact that it was undrinkable , and I will tell you the horrible penalty that they may face from doing so .
