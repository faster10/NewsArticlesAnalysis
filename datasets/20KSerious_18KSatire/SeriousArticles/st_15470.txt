Why did it happen ? With single weather events , as with single stock market fluctuations or single football scores , we can find proximate causes things that happened just before that seemed to cause the event . We often can ' t go beyond that , and not just because our abilities are limited . The atmosphere is inherently chaotic and unpredictable , to the point that larger causes for single events really can ' t be ascribed meaningfully . And , of course , the weather will change again quickly .
