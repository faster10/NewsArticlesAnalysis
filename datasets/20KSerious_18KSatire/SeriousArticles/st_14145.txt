That love wasn ' t just because it was a great stadium . It was because it may be the league ' s greatest stadium . That ' s what the NFL has been waiting for over the past 21 years in Los Angeles . For a guy who could step in and build something better than Kraft , better than the York family in the Bay Area , even better than the mecca Jones constructed in Dallas . It wanted a project that raised the stakes and the bottom lines for all , not just some nice stadium that happened to be nestled between some highways ( sorry , Dean Spanos ) .
