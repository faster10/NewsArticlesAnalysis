Bad week for COVENTRY . Coventry ' s performances have plummeted this season along with their attendances . On their return to the Ricoh Arena in September the Sky Blues drew in a crowd of 27 , 306 , beat Gillingham 1 0 and moved up to eighth place in League One . On Saturday , just 11 , 888 were in attendance as Steven Pressley ' s side lost to unbeaten league leaders Bristol City , a result which was compounded by Tuesday night ' s 4 1 thrashing at Oldham . Pressley ' s side are now just one point off the bottom of the table in 20th place .
