Labor , too , has come out to stop the job killing over regulation . Cecil Roberts , president of the United Mine Workers , one of the biggest labor unions in the country , recently sent a letter to several senators asking them to support my resolution because of " the threat that the EPA MATS rule poses to United Mine Workers Association members ' jobs , the economies of coal field communities , and the future direction of our national energy policy . " In addition , we ' ve also secured the support of the Chamber of Commerce , the National Federation of Independent Business , the Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers , all of which represent major groups who are apparently not " doing fine " in the face of EPA ' s regulations .
