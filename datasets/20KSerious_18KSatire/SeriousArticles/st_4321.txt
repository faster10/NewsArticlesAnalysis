Trump , Oct . 26 : I m going to renegotiate our trade deals . I m going to bring our jobs back . I m going to bring our manufacturing back . I ll give you an example . Look , Mexico took a Ford plant . I ve been very tough on the Ford , you ve heard me talking about Ford . I heard last night that Ford is moving back to the United States . They may not do that deal . I get credit for that . I should get credit for that . Somebody wrote last night , Can you imagine what he could do if he was president ? Ford was going to build this massive plant . I brought it up at so many speeches , and frankly , I think I embarrassed them . But Ford now is going to build a big , massive plant in the United States . And every single person , even my harshest critics , gave me credit for that . I m going to do that times a thousand .
