Last year , the Bengals appeared to be headed toward the AFC North title before losing twice to the Steelers , including the regular season finale that cost them the division . Pittsburgh is also coming off a 23 13 road loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last week and has gone 8 1 SU and 7 1 1 ATS in its last nine games following a setback . Look for the Steelers to hand Cincinnati its first loss as a small home favorite in this divisional game .
