" Roman Reloaded " opens with Minaj a biracial woman from Queens via Trinidad ranting in the voice of her ( Polish ? ) homosexual " twin brother " alter ego . In the same song , she takes on the voice of Martha Zolanski , Roman ' s mother , singing in a cartoon Cockney accent . " Take your medication , Roman , " counsels Minaj Martha . " Quack , quack to a duck and a chicken , too Put the hyena in a freakin ' zoo , " answers Minaj Roman . Later , she bursts into " O Come , All Ye Faithful . "
