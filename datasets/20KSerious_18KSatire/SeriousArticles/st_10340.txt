" Imerman Angels is incredible in the sense that they ' re able to pair you up with someone that looks just like you and that gets it and that can tell you it ' s going to be OK , " said Jenna Benn , who was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma when she was 29 . " All of a sudden , your reality doesn ' t seem so strange . It seems sort of normal . As much as I didn ' t want to be a part of this club and I didn ' t ask to be here , I ' m really happy that I have this community that Jonny has built . "
