I prefer a different tack . To my mind , of course , no part of religion is true in the sense of being God given . It seems clear that there is no holy ghost , spirit , geist or divine emanation . The real issue is not whether God exists or not , but where one takes the argument to if one concludes he doesn ' t . I believe it must be possible to remain a committed atheist and nevertheless to find religions sporadically useful , interesting and consoling and be curious as to the possibilities of importing certain of their ideas and practices into the secular realm .
