" I told them , ' I ' ll never touch anything , ' " says Mellen . And for a long time , she kept her word . But Mellen ' s creativity , it turns out , is not just a contemplative or reactive practice . She creates . Constantly .

She planted a garden and , because she longed for a new porch , got out a shovel and dug the foundation for it herself , then used the rocks she ' d unearthed to make a stone wall .
