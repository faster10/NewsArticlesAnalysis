" I ' m watching a lot of the buzz on this , and it seems to me that the people who complain the most , and the complaint is , ' Why am I giving money to a studio to make a movie ? ' as though there ' s no return on that money . I think that before people look at it , their sense is , ' Hey , I ' m just throwing money at something . ' They ' re not understanding that they ' re getting a product in return . That ' s where the disconnect is . Those people who are complaining about that , I want to say , ' If you ' re a Veronica Mars fan , you ' re getting cool stuff . ' You ' re getting stuff I think you would pay for anyway you ' re just pre buying it , and by pre buying it , you ' re showing the studio that there is enough market interested in making this movie worthwhile .
