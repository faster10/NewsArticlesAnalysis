Well I mean , I knew ahead of time that it was coming . It ' s always a scary place as an actor to go there . I don ' t know what their plans are for next season . I know that Alan has said there are " big plans , " but I don ' t know what that really means , and things can always change . I ' m not for sure , but I trust him completely . At the end of the day , it ' s hard to see how I ' m coming back , seeing as half of my head was just blown off . I don ' t know . They may figure something out . I mean it ' s True Blood . There ' s always flashbacks . There ' s phantasms . There ' s all this crazy stuff . It ' s very possible . But I ' m excited either way . If it does all end , I ' ve had the most amazing time of my life . It ' s really great .
