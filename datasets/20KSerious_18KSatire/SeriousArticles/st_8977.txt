Falwell , the president of Virginia s Liberty University , likened his support of Trump to his father s decision to back Ronald Reagan in 1980 , which was controversial at the time . He was criticized because Ronald Reagan was a Hollywood actor , he d been divorced and remarried and my father was a pastor and Jimmy Carter was a Sunday school teacher , Falwell recalled . And he said you choose the candidate who s most qualified ? like when you have a sick child , you choose the doctor who s most qualified to treat them you don t choose the one who shares your values . Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher , but look how he did as president .
