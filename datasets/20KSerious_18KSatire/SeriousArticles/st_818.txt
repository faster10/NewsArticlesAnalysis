The Kepler satellite uses a different method , based on transits of planets across the face of their host star . Visible light from the star dims very slightly , typically by 0 . 01 or less for an Earth sized planet passing in front . Thus Kepler finds planets regardless of mass , although it more easily sees large planets ( which cover more of the star ' s surface and thus diminish the light more ) and it only sees planets that cross the star as seen from the Earth ( which most planets don ' t ) .
