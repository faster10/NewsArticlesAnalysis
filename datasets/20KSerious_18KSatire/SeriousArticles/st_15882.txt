No team looks dumber than the 49ers . They fired Jim Harbaugh last year after four seasons because he was overbearing and rubbed people the wrong way . They overlooked that he s a great coach who knows how to win : NFC title game , Super Bowl , NFC title game , 8 8 , in his four years . They promoted defensive line coach Jim Tomsula , who was just as clueless as Handley . He was fired last week after a 5 11 season . Harbaugh quickly resurrected the program at Michigan , his alma mater , going 10 3 with a New Year s Day bowl victory . After the 49ers fired Tomsula , it didn t take long for Harbaugh to check in on Twitter : Do not be deceived . You will reap what you sow . The NFL will honor all the Super Bowl MVPs as part of the Super Bowl 50 celebration next month . If the Patriots are not playing , will Tom Brady accept Roger Goodell s invitation or blow him off as pay back for Deflategate ? Brady s family lives in San Mateo , just 28 miles from where the game will be played in Santa Clara .
