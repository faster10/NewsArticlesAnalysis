The pop music station in my new home , a small Ohio town , couldn ' t match the " talents " of John , Dave , Bubba and Shelly ( although it was not like I was awake at 7 a . m . to listen ) . While I was slinking into my late teens , the playlist of that low budget station felt like it was stuck in my middle school years . By then , I was also hooked to my family ' s satellite radio account , which was like terrestrial radio without all of those terrible commercials for car dealerships or rug outlets .
