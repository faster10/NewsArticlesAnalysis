Earlier this week I laid out my predictions for the first round of the National Football League playoffs and can be seen here . He was injured , then benched , then hit by performance enhancing drug allegations ( which he vehemently denies ) . Weather tends to be an equalizer in any case and in this case , anything that favors the running game favors the team who has Adrian Peterson . Neither the Broncos nor Patriots are playing well , and the play offs are all about momentum . Add in that starting quarterback Andy Dalton has been ruled out for the Bengals Wild Card game against the Pittsburgh Steelers with a thumb injury , it seems like the Bengals will be challenged to make it out of the first round yet again . If Big Ben and the Steelers offense gets rolling , an AFC filled with backup quarterbacks ( Cincinnati ) , game managing quarterbacks ( Kansas City ) , bad quarterbacks ( Houston ) , aging quarterbacks ( Denver ) and quarterbacks without weapons ( New England ) , won ' t be able to keep up .
