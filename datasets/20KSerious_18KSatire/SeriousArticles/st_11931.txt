The Fed introduced quantitative easing buying large quantities of long term bonds and promising to keep short term interest rates low for a prolonged period after it concluded that the US economy was not responding adequately to traditional monetary policy and to the fiscal stimulus package enacted in 2009 .

This would drive up the value of those assets , increasing household wealth and therefore consumer spending .
