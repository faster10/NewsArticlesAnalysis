Some would argue that health care is a service that is unlike any other in our economy . We purchase health care often unwillingly , or at times of great stress and medical concern . There is a huge gap in knowledge and power between doctors and nurses and patients . There is an almost total lack of transparency about cost , quality and outcomes among various insurance providers for different kinds of procedures or between health care facilities . And to add insult to injury , there is no restaurant B at which we can dine . Unless we move to Switzerland .
