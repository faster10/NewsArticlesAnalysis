Eagles of Death Metal are among the nominees for international group , which seems likely to be recognition for the dignified way they responded to fans following the attack at the Bataclan concert hall , which left 89 people dead . The band s lead singer Jesse Hughes spoke movingly following the tragedy about wanting to connect with his fans , and remained defiant that the terrorists would not prevent the group from continuing to perform live . The band have never previously been nominated for either a Brit or a Grammy , and their most recent album , Zipper Down , reached only No 32 in the UK charts .
