Barbara Jones , director of the ALA ' s Office for Intellectual Freedom , told the Associated Press that many of the complaints leveled against " The Hunger Games " books focused on the film version directed by Gary Ross . " There was complaining about the choice of actors for the film , " she said . " You had people saying someone was dark skinned in the book , but not in the film , or dark skinned in the film and not in the book . In general , a lot more people were aware of the books and that led to more kinds of complaints . "
