The Institution of Engineering and Technology ' s deputy president , Professor William Webb , said : ' The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles . ' ' The difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost . As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook ' s intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area . '
