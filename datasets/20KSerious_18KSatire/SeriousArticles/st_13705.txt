The two great transitional films of their periods , " The Jazz Singer " in 1927 and " Avatar " in 2009 , are linked by more than actors in face paint . Conceived during economic booms , both films ushered in new technologies that only fully emerged during economic crises . By setting " The Artist " in the Hollywood of the late 1920s and early 1930s , during a transition that was artistic , technological , and societal all at once , the film ' s director , Michel Hazanavicius , connects the film to our time .
