" I knew it was a one shot deal , " Downer said of coaching a generational talent . " I wanted to make him the best player I could . We came up with a plan . As a freshman I told him , there are 100 people nationally that he was competing with . We ' ve got to slice that to 50 . We ' ve got to slice that to 25 . We ' ve got to slice that to 10 . And there ' s ways we can do that . And we did . I wanted him to be great . And the second half of that package is , he wanted it . That ' s half the battle . When your best player is winning all the sprints , coming in during snow storms , lifting weights , five , six days a week . Wanting to stay after practice and work on things . That ' s contagious . And that made my job easier . There ' s a lot of guys with talent that don ' t have the work ethic . He had one of the best work ethics of anybody in any sport ever . "
