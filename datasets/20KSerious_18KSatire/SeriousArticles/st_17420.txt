Scripted by Reid Carolin and inspired by Channing Tatum ' s own experiences as a Tampa stripper in the 1990s , " Magic Mike " is honest about the attractions of the job ( money , girls , fun ) without pretending it ' s a smart choice in the long run ( too much fun , too many girls , not enough money ) . I liked the brightly lit , casual camaraderie of the dressing room scenes , while on stage the routines here are sexy , playful and ( I ' m guessing ) much better choreographed than you ' re likely to see downtown on a Saturday night .
