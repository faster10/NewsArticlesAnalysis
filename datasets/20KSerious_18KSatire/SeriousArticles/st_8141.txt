While Goffin is a singles player of some international standing , ranked No . 16 in the world , and with a record of having reached the fourth round at both Roland Garros and Wimbledon during his career , he isn ' t exactly known for his skill on a doubles court . Before this rubber , he had won just two of the 15 doubles matches he had played at tour level . This was also the first time he had played Davis Cup doubles for three years , having not played since the last encounter between these two countries , which was a Euro African zonal tie in Glasgow .
