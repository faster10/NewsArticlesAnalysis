This game is truly a tossup . The Packers offensive line has struggled to protect Rodgers all season and is ? enduring more changes heading into Sunday s game . That s not ? a good situation against the Redskins , who can really get after the passer . I expect the Packers to ? lean on Eddie Lacy to move the football and set up some play action shots , as Green Bay receivers have struggled to gain separation on their own . But in the end , the Redskins offense has been humming down the stretch and should be able to consistently move the ball and score against the Packers .
