Rodgers repeats that often , this idea of playing for each other . And while it ' s believable , it hasn ' t addressed reality in Green Bay for most of the home stretch this season . The Packers may have been playing for each other , but they weren ' t always doing it in a fashion that has made them a formidable NFC playoff team . If anything , they looked more uneven coming into this playoff than in many previous seasons . Part of that could be explained away by injuries or an offense that was out of rhythm . But it was also that Rodgers simply wasn ' t able to produce some of the hallmarks that have made him great . Most specifically , his ability to adjust on the fly with his skill position players , especially wideouts Randall Cobb , James Jones and Davante Adams .
