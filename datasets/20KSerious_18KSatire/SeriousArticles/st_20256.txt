This is patronizing , but it also it misreads Sanders and his campaign . He did not enter the race , and he did not hire top tier consultants like Tad Devine , just to get his issues out there and push Clinton to the left . He read the mood of the Democratic electorate this cycle as one that could break toward a Sanders nomination . He really does want to win , and he should be expected to exhaust all of his resources and strategic opportunities to do so . He s made a lot of progress so far . Don t expect him to cash out .
