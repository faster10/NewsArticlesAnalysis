For a seller , a short sale is one in which you work with a lender to market your home and sell it for less than the mortgage balance . While short sales were once considered more favorable than foreclosures , now both harm your credit to the same degree , lowering your score by roughly 140 to 150 points . As a mark on your credit file , they ' ll each stay with you for seven years . For a buyer , a short sale can mean getting a home at a great price if you ' re willing to play what can be a long waiting game . About two years ago , lenders agreed to guidelines in which they were supposed to acknowledge an offer on a short sale in four days and answer back in 45 . But that never happened in practice , and typical wait times on an offer are substantially longer .
