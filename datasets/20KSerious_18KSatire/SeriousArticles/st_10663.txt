A few Hall of Fame quarterbacks never reached the Super Bowl , although Sonny Jurgensen picked up a championship ring as Van Brocklin s backup with the 1960 Eagles . Vince Lombardi , Jurgensen s coach on the 69 Washington Redskins , said no one could throw the ball like Sonny , who led the NFL in passing yards five times . But by 1974 , Jurgensen was a 40 year old part time starter . Called on to rally Washington in a divisional playoff against the Rams , Jurgensen completed only six of 12 passes and was intercepted three times , including a 59 yard pick six by Rams linebacker Isiah Robinson , a cloudy finish to a sunlit career .
