The Prime Minister can afford to be tough , and to take as long as he needs to get a strong deal that he thinks will satisfy voters . As for the Europeans , they need to contemplate the possibility of a future without us ? then draw up all the concessions that they imagine would convince us to stay . And if they do this in too high handed a manner , or try to bounce Mr Cameron into compromise , they risk offending the electorate . The British are a patient nation . But we are not to be taken for granted .
