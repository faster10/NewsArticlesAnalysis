Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on the assumption that he would be the president who got the United States out of the wars in the greater Middle East that had cause so much dissent during the Bush presidency . But Obama subsequently chose to increase the U . S . troop presence in Afghanistan . He serially violated national borders with special operations missions , drones and cyber attacks . He changed U . S . doctrine but seemed to continue to embrace a " we ' ll do what we choose " American exceptionalism . The notion that the Middle East is itself somehow more peaceful today than it was when he received that prize is ludicrous .
