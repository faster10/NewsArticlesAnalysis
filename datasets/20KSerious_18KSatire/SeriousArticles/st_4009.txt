Playing Manchester United as our first game back was the best possible start to the season . Its true they had a bit of an off day , but we played well , and we ' ve played teams who are better on paper but we ' ve beaten them on merit . Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile , we ' ve got a small stadium , we ' ve got the smallest squad and we ' re the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club , so with all that it ' s quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will , and by playing good football .
