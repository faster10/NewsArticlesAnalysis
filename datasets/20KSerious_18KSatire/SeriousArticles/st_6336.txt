I m a longtime critic of the personality coverage that takes up so much of the campaign , not because we don t want to know who the real person is behind the persona of a presidential candidate , but because we in the media so often ask the wrong questions when we take on this task . The problem is that the moment we set out on this voyage of discovery , we forget the whole point of the exercise , which is to get the best understanding we can of what this person would be like if they were to become president .
