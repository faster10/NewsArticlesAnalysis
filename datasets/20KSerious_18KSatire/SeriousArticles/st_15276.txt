GS : I think as the quarterback started to get near the sideline and press the line judge , who was the official right near the quarterback , Gary Arthur . ? I think as Tom Brady released the football , the line judge lost track of maybe where the ball was at that point and almost by its own definition , inadvertently blew the whistle . What we do from that point onward is find out where the football was at the time the whistle was blown . We deemed it to be , in our judgment , received by the receiver , as we stated , at the 45 yard line , I believe . And then by rule , what you do with that , or once you determine in your judgment where the ball was at the time of the whistle , if it s in a possession of a player , which we deemed it to be , you take all fouls then , that would have been on that play and you enforce them from that spot of where the ball would be declared dead by the inadvertent whistle . We had a bench area obstruction foul then , that we actually tacked on to the spot of , I believe we went from the 45 to the 40 yard line , because we tacked on the 15 yard foul from that spot . So that s what you do with the play , as it goes by rule .
