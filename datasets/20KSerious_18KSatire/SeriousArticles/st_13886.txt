Yeah , you read that correctly a bill that would bring relief to millions of undocumented immigrant families just in time for the holidays , a bill that a strong majority of voters in both parties support , a bill that everyone from community groups to business groups resoundingly supports , a bill that would actually pass both Houses of Congress and become law despite our historic levels of gridlock that bill isn ' t even being brought up for a vote because John Boehner just doesn ' t want to do it . Such is the sad state of so called leadership in the Republican Party today .
