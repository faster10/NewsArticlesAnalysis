" I see a team that s , more than anything , just all on the same page and that s what s really evident , " Lee said of the squad that he helped win a title last season . " And of course No . 30 Stephen Curry is doing what he s doing and that s propelling the whole situation . But even when guys like Andrew Bogut or Harrison Barnes or whoever has been out , the other guys fill in and really play well . And , more than anything , I just feel like the confidence level is high and they re all on the same pulling in the same direction . I think that s something every team can learn from . "
