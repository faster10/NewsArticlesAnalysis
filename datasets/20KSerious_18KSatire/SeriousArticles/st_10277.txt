Manning isn ' t going to be benched , now , and I ' m not going to call for it , either . I understand why he ' s going to face Tom Brady one more time with the season on the line at Mile High on Sunday , with a trip to Super Bowl 50 in the balance . Though I also can ' t help but wonder if the Broncos might actually be better equipped to beat the Patriots if Brock Osweiler was under center , and I can ' t help but wonder as well if Bill Belichick might secretly prefer to face the legend over the kid on this particular Sunday .
