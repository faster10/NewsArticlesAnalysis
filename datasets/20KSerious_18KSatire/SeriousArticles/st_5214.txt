That said , some of the thin blue line rhetoric is less about public and personal safety than political ideology ( and contract negotiations ) . Of course , many police hate Mayor Bill de Blasio ( just as they hate President Barack Obama ) . Police tend to be conservative . The last time New York had both a liberal mayor and contract negotiations , police actually rioted . Drunken officers rushed the steps of City Hall , damaged cars and slandered Mayor David Dinkins with racial epithets . Reporters were attacked . Police even took over the Brooklyn Bridge .
