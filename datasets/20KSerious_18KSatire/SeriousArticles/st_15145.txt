Kafka ultimately proved his point , and so did I . Over and over again , I pushed Joanna away and pulled her back , drawing her into an abusive four step dance . First , I would grow increasingly uncertain . " Was I truly in love with Joanna ? " I would ask myself . How could I be when we didn ' t appreciate all the same books , the same music , the same movies ? Was it possible that what I called love had been merely infatuation , lust , desire ? Second , torn by my doubts , I would grow withdrawn and sullen , even openly hostile . I would ignore Joanna , make nasty little remarks , put her down in front of her friends . Third , Joanna would start to fight back . Neglected and mistreated , she would respond with anger and sadness . Why was I being so cruel ? What had she done to deserve this ? Fourth , horrified by my behavior , I would try urgently and with great remorse to repair the damage . I ' d buy her flowers , send her cute messages during the day , hang on her every word . Then , after a short respite , the dance would begin again .
