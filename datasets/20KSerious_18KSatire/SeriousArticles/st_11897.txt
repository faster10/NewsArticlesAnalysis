The release of Anti was preceded by a sloppy campaign . While not as big a promotional and marketing car crash as Madonna s disastrous Rebel Heart , the tedious teasing on the album s website failed to compel . When it comes to making album deals with phone companies , Jay Z learned the hard way with Magna Carta Holy Grail , hooking up with Samsung to release the record first for fans with Samsung phone hardware . Anti was released through the streaming service Tidal ( although anyone can download it ) , with Samsung footing the bill for free downloads , as part of a reported 25 million contract Rihanna has signed with the company to promote both their products and her upcoming tour .
