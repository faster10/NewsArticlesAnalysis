We found impressive discounts on booze elsewhere , too . One liter of Absolut sells for 17 . 50 ( 13 . 50 ) at duty free shops at Rome ' s and Brussels ' s main international airports , and for a bit more elsewhere , such as in Prague ( 18 . 50 , or 399 Czech koruna ) and Munich ( 21 , or 16 ) . Those prices offer substantial savings off the 30 benchmark price at a typical U . S . retail store . But be aware that American states may restrict how much alcohol you may import duty free . There ' s a typical one liter limit for all types of alcohol per person , though the rule depends on your state of residence and the country you ' ve visited . ( One exception : You can return from a visit to a Caribbean country with up to two liters of alcohol duty free . )
