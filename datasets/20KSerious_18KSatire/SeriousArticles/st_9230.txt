The Monica Lewinsky affair , culminating in impeachment , was the apotheosis of this pattern , the ne plus ultra Clinton scandal . Republicans were sure they had him ? for Pete ' s sake , he had an affair with a 20 something intern right there in the White House ! Surely the public would finally see the true nature of his villainy and turn away from him in disgust once and for all . But even then , Clinton escaped ? and not only that , Republicans were the ones who ended up condemned by the public , and Clinton left office two years later with boffo approval ratings . It was enough to make you lose your mind .
