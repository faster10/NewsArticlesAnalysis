" I don ' t know who ' s going to win between Bernie and Hillary . I don ' t know what ' s going to happen with Hillary she has other problems , maybe bigger than the problems she ' s got , in terms of nominations . But we ' ve had so many different indications and polls that we beat her and we beat her easily . And we will go on to get the Republican nomination , and we will go on to easily beat Hillary Clinton or Bernie or whoever the hell they throw up there Iowa , we love you we thank you . You ' re special . We will be back many , many times , in fact , I think I might come here and buy a farm , I love it . Okay ?
