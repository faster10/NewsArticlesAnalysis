Getting into one of these wars is very easy . It ' s very , very difficult for a White House to walk away from this , especially when the same people that attacked us on 9 11 are going to come back . For a politician to say , ' Hey , let ' s forget about it , let ' s hope for the best , let ' s leave ' this is a problem for the White House . They cannot be seen to be losing a war . It doesn ' t really matter that we never really won the war . It ' s just morphed into something else , into a quagmire , guerrilla warfare .
