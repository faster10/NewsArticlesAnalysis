Eick : Once you call it " Battlestar Galactica " in any way , shape or form , you ' re quite deliberately attempting to attract fans of the show . One of the regrets that we had about " Caprica " is that we were so intent on carving it out for a new audience that in the marketing of it , we strayed too far away from its lineage . Had we done it over again , I would call it " Battlestar Galactica : Caprica . " At the same time , I firmly believe that if you never saw an episode of " Battlestar , " you could plop right into this thing and completely get it and enjoy it .
