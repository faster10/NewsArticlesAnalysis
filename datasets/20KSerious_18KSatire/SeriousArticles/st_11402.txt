WATCH OUT FOR SURPRISES IN IOWA Leonid Bershidsky : J . Ann Selzer , who has conducted polling on the Iowa caucuses since 1988 , says the contests almost always yield surprises . Iowa governor Terry Branstad predicts that this time , 150 , 000 Republicans are likely to turn out , energized by Donald Trump ' s candidacy . On the other hand , if the commitment of these political neophytes doesn ' t extend to actually journeying out in the cold night and spending several hours caucusing in a classroom or barn , it will be Ted Cruz who will get a boost . Bernie Sanders ' ability to beat Hillary Clinton also hinges on how organized and civic minded his young supporters turn out to be . That , however , doesn ' t mean that Trump and Sanders will triumph . A surge of voters from the center that lifts Clinton and Marco Rubio , the front runner among mainstream Republicans , may be the biggest surprise for the pollsters this year . Bloomberg
