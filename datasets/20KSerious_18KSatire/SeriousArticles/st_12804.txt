Moxie : I believe in the high five . Everyone has a context , a history that no one can know like you know your own . I look for the opportunity every day to celebrate , in a spontaneous and deliberate way , to laugh with someone in a grocery line about something funny that happens or to give someone change for a dollar . I ' ll offer to high five you . I ' m not a special ed kid or anything . I just believe in the potential of people . My day will only be what I make it , and I look for ways to feel human every day . One way is to connect to you . I encourage everyone to try it .
