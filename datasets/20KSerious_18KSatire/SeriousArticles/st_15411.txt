It is entirely possible that accelerating computer power coupled with advances in brain science may eventually result in a true thinking machine . Many researchers believe that such a truly advanced A . I . would be driven to turn its intellectual energies inward , repeatedly improving its own design and making itself even smarter . The result could be an " intelligence explosion " culminating in a silicon based mind hundreds or even thousands of times more intelligent than any human being . And there is , of course , no guarantee that this new alien intelligence would be especially concerned about the welfare of humanity .
