Something he said at that moment caused center Patrick Lewis to snap him the ball . Wilson didn ' t see it coming , as he was looking to the side and still mouthing the audible . The snapped ball flew past him and Wilson chased the ball and instead of falling on it , he felt he had enough time to pick it up and scramble . What he didn ' t know was that Vikings coach Mike Zimmer blitzed a cornerback and a linebacker . Five defenders surrounded him , but somehow Wilson escaped and threw downfield to a wide open Tyler Lockett , who ran to the Vikings 4 yard line . Two plays later , Wilson hit Doug Baldwin with a 3 yard touchdown pass to make it 9 7 .
