The long term replacements for Ferdinand and Vidic were supposed to be Chris Smalling and Phil Jones . But they were still second choice to the veteran defenders last season and they have not trained on . They perform like bit part players , which is what they have been for a few years . They need to get a proper run in the team and be trusted because they can still be very good players . Indeed Van Gaal needs to choose his first choice defence , and give the players time to develop together . Does he rate Luke Shaw ? Is Rojo a left back or a centre back for him ? These questions need answering .
