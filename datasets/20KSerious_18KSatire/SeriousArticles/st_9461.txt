" Sometimes , he ' d say , ' Barney , do me a favor , see if I can sleep , I ' m going to get under the covers on that rollout couch , ' and he said , ' Just read me out of a book , ' " Van Valin testified . " I ' d find a book that looked interesting and I ' d just start reading or I ' d tell him stories . That didn ' t work because often times he got excited about the story and say , ' That really happened ? ' or something . Anyway , I ' d read to him and when it seemed like he was asleep I ' d slip out , you know , kind of hard because the door made a little noise . If I thought he was asleep I ' d leave , and once in awhile he ' d say , ' Good night , Barney , ' and when I got to the door , he wasn ' t asleep at all . "
