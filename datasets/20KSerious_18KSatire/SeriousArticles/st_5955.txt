In the managerial stakes , change is all around . Now is the time for United to catch this renewal bug . Guardiola is 45 , Liverpool s J rgen Klopp 48 , and Tottenham Hotspur s Mauricio Pochettino 43 . They head a band of young guns who are moving in on an established Premier League order which is ruled by Ars ne Wenger ( 66 ) at Arsenal , Manuel Pellegrini ( 62 ) at City , and Van Gaal ( 64 ) . Of this trio only Wenger is sure to remain in place next season to try to keep the new wave at bay , as Pellegrini will be the fall guy for Guardiola , whatever the Chilean achieves in the four competitions City can still win .
