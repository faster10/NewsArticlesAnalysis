Jose Bautista homered in his final at bat of 2015 , tying ALCS Game 6 with his second of the game in the eighth inning , but he still may spend the first day of his offseason kicking himself for his role in Toronto s 4 3 loss . The right fielder chased down Eric Hosmer s single in the eighth inning with Lorenzo Cain sprinting around the bases . Instead of throwing the ball toward home plate , Bautista spun and fired to second base . Third base coach Mike Jirschele anticipated that and waved Cain home , and Cain beat Troy Tulowitzki s relay throw easily for the winning run .
