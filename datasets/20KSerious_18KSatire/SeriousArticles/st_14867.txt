" You think there ' d be an appetite for Blink 182 , and some stations are playing it , don ' t get me wrong . But on a national level , it ' s hard . . . to get these stations to get these songs on the chart , " he says . " It ' s just not in the lexicon of Top 40 now . Top 40 has moved on away from those acts . And it ' s going to be a challenge to get it back . "
