But the legacy of our " selfie generation " must be more than just photobombing a friend ' s picture or gloating when one of our tweets is retweeted to infinity . Our generation has an opportunity with these social media platforms to raise awareness about issues we personally believe need to be addressed . It can be as simple as taking a selfie as you walk past a soup kitchen " or better yet , help out in one and sharing it on social media . Maybe that will inspire others to volunteer at one or at least make a donation .
