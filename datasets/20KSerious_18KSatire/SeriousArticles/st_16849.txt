The " Monty Python Live ( Mostly ) " show has gotten decent reviews ( mostly ) during its three week run , many praising the group for its contribution to comedy if lamenting the casualness of the live production . The final show was apparently little changed from the debut , with its many musical numbers and occasional hesitations . There were a couple special guests for the final show Eddie Izzard and Mike Myers and physicist Stephen Hawking , who joined a videotaped skit , was in the live audience .
