A : I will say that I want all these characters to be able to stand on their own . We just had an episode last week that didn ' t feature Rick or Michonne or Daryl or Glenn , and people seemed to dig it . In the second half of Season 4 , I was very proud to have a structure that focused just on a few characters and we didn ' t see all the characters all the time . I want all these characters to be strong enough to tell a story about them , on their own . I think that has much more to do with storytelling and making our ensemble as strong as it can be . But that ensemble being as strong as it can be does make it that we can tell stories without the bigger , more main characters .
