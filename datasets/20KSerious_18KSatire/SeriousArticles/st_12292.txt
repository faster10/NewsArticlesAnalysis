For partying , Piccolo Mondo is one of island ' s most frequented clubs , a pit stop for students and tourists as well as celebrities . Though the city has acquired the nickname La Serenissima ( in English , The Most Serene ) for its ordinarily quiet nightlife , it becomes a party hotspot during the film festival and biennales . Events take place in grand palazzos , on yachts moored near the Giardini and even in an art deco aircraft hangar out on the Lido if you can bag an invite , these are the places to see and be seen .
