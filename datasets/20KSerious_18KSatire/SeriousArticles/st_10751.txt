What To Watch For : Peyton Manning is going to face some heat here . No way that coordinator Bob Sutton won ' t try to attack him early and often . Justin Houston will be a handful especially coming off a bye and the KC line ate up Denver ' s offensive line in the first meeting Will that Sunday night massacre of the Packers be a mirage for the Broncos ' running game ? If so , they ' ll have huge problems come January The return of Jeremy Maclin should buoy the Chiefs ' middling passing attack , and all of a sudden injuries starting to mount with Denver ' s defense . Expect a constant double of Von Miller with DeMarcus Ware out again Sigh of relief for Chiefs offensive players who won ' t have to worry about trying to get a waiver to wear a visor , medically needed or not , given Aqib Talib ' s penchant for poking people in the eye . Talib ' s suspension and back injury to DeMarcus Ware could make this defense a lot more vulnerable this week The Broncos rank dead last in first down efficiency the percentage of first down plays gaining 4 yards or more and they are 26th in third down conversions . So if you don ' t allow them to pick up chunk yards on second down , they aren ' t scoring much . They rank 32nd in passing and 28th in rushing . The lack of explosion in the run game Denver is 31st in percentage of rushes that go for 4 yards or more could even further stifle them as the weather turns Only three INTs from Alex Smith all season and two came in the first meeting with Denver . If he protects the football here , I like the Chiefs ' chances . Smith hasn ' t thrown a pick in his last five games .
