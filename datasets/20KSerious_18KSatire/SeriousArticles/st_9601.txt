Stopped short : On the Bears penultimate play of the third quarter , Matt Forte took a shotgun handoff and had nowhere to go , one of three no gain carries by the running back . In that specific instance , center Hroniss Grasu was pushed back by defensive tackle Mike Pennel . Zach Miller also failed to generate any push on Julius Peppers . And , well , the play had no chance . Forte s return to action was far from stellar , a 15 carry , 44 yard performance that marked his second lowest output this season . The Bears failure to establish the run is becoming problematic . In games against the Packers and Broncos , their running backs have averaged 3 . 9 yards per rush . And on 39 carries by backs , 23 have gone for 2 yards or less . With an offense that wants to chew clock and win up front , the Bears are going to need to find catalysts for the running game soon . Martellus Bennett missed the game in Green Bay , pushing Jermon Bushrod into action in a tight end type role for 11 snaps . But without a reliable running game , the margin for error for both Cutler and the Bears defense will become smaller . ?
