" I think every year is different , just like every game is different " . A season ending knee injury in Week 1 of the 2008 season represents the only games he ' s missed since the start of the 2002 campaign . In addition to Edelman , the offense was without left tackle Sebastian Vollmer ( ankle ) . The Pats were up 14 on the Broncos , getting the ball back about to put the game away and along with it homefield advantage , and suddenly the entire season took a disgusting turn . While never being challenged very much for the division this season , the New York Jets finished with a record of 10 6 , just missing out on the playoffs . Fans of this great league , Enjoy the NFL playoffs ! ! !
