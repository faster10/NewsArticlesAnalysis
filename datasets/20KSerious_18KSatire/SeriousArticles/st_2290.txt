The expected rise of 4 . 5 C is based on almost 10 , 000 gigatons ( Gt , or billion tons ) of CO2 emitted during this century , with all other greenhouse gasses converted to CO2 equivalents . But nobody actually believes this figure ? even the UN Environment Programme estimates that with absolutely no climate policies , we would emit 7 , 750Gt , which might lead to a 3 . 8 C rise . So , the extra 0 . 7 C rise is simply made up : climate policies can t take credit for reducing it , because it was never going to happen in the first place .
