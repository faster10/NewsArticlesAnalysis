Inequality in America is enormous . For the first time since the ' 60s , at least a majority of Americans are not in the middle class . This is another way of saying that society has largely ceased to function for great swathes of the population . That , I believe , is a big root cause behind the rise of Trumpism . Anger and hatred ? powerful political motivators indeed ? fester under such conditions . To beat Trump , we can ' t just call him a fascist . We have to build the movement and institutions that will eradicate the inequality and anger in which fascism thrives .
