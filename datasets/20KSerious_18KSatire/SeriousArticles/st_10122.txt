Last year , all 20 acting nominees were white , and it sparked a firestorm of criticism ( and spawned the hashtag OscarsSoWhite ) . Host Neil Patrick Harris even kicked off the 2015 show by welcoming Hollywood s best and whitest . And after all that outrage , it happened again this year . Not a single person of color earned an acting nomination , and films like Straight Outta Compton and Creed were mostly ignored . The only nominations they did receive ? Best Original Screenplay for Compton and Best Supporting Actor for Creed s Sylvester Stallone ? went to white people . Do you think Oscar host Chris Rock might have something to say about this ?
