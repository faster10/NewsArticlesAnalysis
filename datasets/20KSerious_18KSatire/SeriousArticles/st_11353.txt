" Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe , " he said . " No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character , or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for . Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America . We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act . And make no mistake , justice will be done . "
