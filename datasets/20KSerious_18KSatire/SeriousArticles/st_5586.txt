There are three genuine legal issues the U . S . may have been trying to pursue . One is the right of " innocent passage " through acknowledged territorial sea , which America asserts and China perhaps disputes . Another is the legitimacy of claiming a 12 nautical mile territorial sea zone based on a feature which is submerged at high tide , which America denies and China may be trying to assert . Third , America may be contesting China ' s claim to the feature itself , and hence to any territorial sea around it .
