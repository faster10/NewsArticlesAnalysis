The goal is prevention , rather than punishment , said Harris , adding that he s never played daily fantasy games , which let participants assemble rosters of real life players with prizes awarded on how well that combination performs on the field . If we have large numbers of violations and penalties , then we haven t set the system up right . The goal is instead to prevent and preempt violations that will put players money at risk , put the integrity of the games at risk , and also put the reputation of the industry at risk . "
