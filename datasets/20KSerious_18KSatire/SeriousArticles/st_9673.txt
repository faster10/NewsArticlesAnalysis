Runner up : Vienna was one of only two European cities to make the top ten . Like Melbourne , it scored maximum marks in terms of healthcare , education and infrastructure , and matched the city in terms of stability . But surprisingly , given that the Austrian capital is steeped in history , it fell short in the culture and environment category with a score of 94 . 4 . As well as its history Vienna has a colourful contemporary arts and culture scene , a bustling nightlife , picturesque vineyards on the outskirts and an innovative performing arts scene .
