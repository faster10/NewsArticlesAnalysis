Following the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok , a special initiative for children was launched the safe schools plan . It was in response to the news that children , fearful of further terrorist attacks , had been staying away from school . The idea behind this is admirable the notion of safe schools and a universal call for every child to have the right to education , free of fear and intimidation . This plan is being put into place , and steps are being taken to fortify and guard schools , to improve security and to create a line of communication between schools and police and army .
