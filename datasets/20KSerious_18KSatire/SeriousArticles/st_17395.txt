Extremist groups have existed in the country since its independence from the Netherlands in 1949 . Under Suharto , the dictator who ran the country for 32 years , militant Islamic groups like Darul Islam ( DI ) , which declared an Islamic state in West Java , were brutally quashed . This repression under Suharto was a bit like Egypt under Hosni Mubarak or Iraq under Saddam Hussein . Extremism was kept in its place ruthlessly , says Michael Williams , an expert on Indonesia from London based global policy think tank Chatham House .
