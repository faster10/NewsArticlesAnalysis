TRUMP CALLS HEROIN ADDICTION A VERY TOUGH THING . Donald Trump alternated between empathy and hardline tactics Monday night as he described his plan to deal with New Hampshire s growing heroin problem . Speaking to a capacity crowd of 1 , 000 at Farmington High School , Trump said his signature proposal , to build a wall across the country s border with Mexico , would stem the flow of illicit drugs into the state . The question I get just about number one when I come up to New Hampshire : the drugs that are pouring in , Trump said . They re coming across the Southern border and we are going to stop it . But the normally bombastic Trump showed his empathetic side as he stressed treatment and prevention , ABC s BRAD MIELKE notes . We are gonna try and help the young people , and the old people , and the middle age people , and everybody that got addicted , he said to the capacity crowd . http : abcn . ws 1SHCrc6
