Last week , we happened upon a unit nestled in a green orange grove , just a few hundred meters from the Gaza border . They had just pulled out of Gaza . Our cameraman shot video of the tanks returning from the border and the troops relaxing in the setting sun . It was strangely peaceful . Overhead , planes and helicopters dropped flares and we counted the booming pattern of artillery fire and wondered where the shells were falling on the other side . The soldiers next to us did not look victorious in any way . They just looked exhausted and dusty .
