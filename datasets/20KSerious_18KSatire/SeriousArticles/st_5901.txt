New Orleans Saints : At some point , I expect the Saints to end their four game losing streak . They showed their potential in a 41 38 loss to the Panthers last week . But they also showed all of their warts . It s especially hard to pick the Saints on the road , where they are 1 5 this season with the NFL s second worst scoring margin ( minus 84 ) , according to ESPN Stats Information research . New Orleans might catch a break with Tampa Bay s two sensational defensive players , Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David , both nursing injuries . But the Saints aren t faring any better in the health department , having just lost running back Mark Ingram to a season ending shoulder injury . Buccaneers 27 , Saints 23 . Mike Triplett
