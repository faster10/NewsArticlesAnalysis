A few liberals say there is a scenario that could essentially yield two winners : Clinton , as the party s nominee , and a greatly enhanced Sanders , who would return to the Senate with a celebrity and grass roots following that might even eclipse Warren s own . Sanders has gained stature and ability to be more effective in the Senate , says Jeff Hauser , who runs the Revolving Door Project , a group focused on getting regulators appointed who are skeptical of the industries they oversee . His ability to get journalists to write about his senatorial agenda in 2017 will be a lot higher because he s run . So he s actually become a lot like Warren herself , with big sway in the Senate . If he isn t the nominee , he ll be an even more effective ally for her in the future .
