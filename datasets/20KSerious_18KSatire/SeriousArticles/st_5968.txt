This is how wide open the playoffs could be : I ? nearly took the Chiefs over the Patriots . . . but I also gave much consideration to Houston taking them down in the wild card round . In the end , I went with the Patriots because they ' re still so adept at adjusting for their opponent . They also should be about as healthy on offense as they have been in awhile , too . As for the NFC , a Carolina Arizona showdown would be sensational , but it ' s a lot to ask the Panthers to take down the Seahawks and Cardinals on back to back weekends .
