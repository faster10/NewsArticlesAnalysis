5 ) Dreams remind us who we are . Our dreams are the seeds that God plans for us , where our intuition whispers to us , and where we can find an anchor to our place in the world even if we are " displaced " from it .

They are my Velcro to the universe and an ever flowing fountain of faith , replenishing my trust in life whenever circumstances may make me afraid . Dreams dreamed me back into life .
