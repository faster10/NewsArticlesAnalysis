No more crying : Bulboli , 25 , says ' there are no tears left now ' . ' I ' m all alone . I don ' t go anywhere and I can ' t go back to my parents . ' When Bulboli was ten , a man picked her off the street and sold her into a brothel . She eventually ran away and picked up clients independently , but went back to the brothel for safety . She used to make up to 1 , 000 taka ( around 13 ) a day in the brothel , but now makes 1 , 000 taka ( around 13 ) every two weeks . ' It ' s very hard to survive on 500 taka a week . Sometimes I only eat one meal a day '
