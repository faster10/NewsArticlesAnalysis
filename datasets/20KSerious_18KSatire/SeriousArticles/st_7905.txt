The pen is mostly made of magnesium and rubber . Microsoft says that in the latest pen it has increased the sensitivity of the nib and that it feels just like a regular pen when you are using it to type or draw something on the Surface . We agree on the sensitivity part but don ' t get your hopes high on the typing part . Using the pen on surface still strictly feels like writing on glass , which is fine for occasional use but won ' t do if you are writing a memo . For a memo , use the excellent keyboard to type your material . The pen also integrates well with the surface tablet . One click on its top button opens OneNote on the Surface . Double click , meanwhile , captures the screenshot while click and hold activates Cortana , the smart personal assistant part of Windows 10 .
