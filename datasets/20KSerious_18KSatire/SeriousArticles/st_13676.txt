Sanders is 74 years old . He ' s an unabashed socialist in a notoriously red phobic Democratic Party ? which he did not even join until this campaign . He ' s from Vermont , the second smallest state in the nation , and as a result was barely known at all outside New England . The state is also extremely white , and so Sanders had almost no base among minority groups , particularly African Americans , perhaps the core constituency of the party . He ' s not a particularly great orator his speeches tend towards the laundry list , not the soaring rhetoric of Obama .
