According to the latest information from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) released 10 days ago , there are just under 4 . 6 million Syrian refugees registered with the agency . That s a staggering number ? meaning that one in five of the Syrian population is now dependent on aid from the UNHCR or other associated agencies . Consider too that this figure includes only the registered . Imagine how many more have fled the conflict in Syria to live with relatives , either internally or externally displaced from their homes , and are unregistered ?
