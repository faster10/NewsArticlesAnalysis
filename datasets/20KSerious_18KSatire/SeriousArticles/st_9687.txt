Iran ' s argument before the Supreme Court rests on an 1871 case called U . S . v . Klein , which involved a federal law passed during Reconstruction . Southerners were attempting to use the federal courts to recover property seized by the Union during the Civil War if the person was shown to have been disloyal during the war , he wasn ' t supposed to recover . Congress passed a law saying that if a Southerner had received a pardon after the war , the courts should treat that fact as conclusive evidence that he was disloyal and therefore couldn ' t recover .
