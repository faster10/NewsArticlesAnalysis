You always got to plan for the worst and hope for the best . If the GPS isn ' t going to work , if the lifeboat isn ' t going to work , you still got to know how to navigate across the mountains , across the bridges . Skills like that are very natural and basic to learn . It ' ll surprise you . I ' ve taken people out who have more money than the world and they start smiling when they make their own fire . It ' s deep inside thousands and thousands of years in our psyche . It ' s the best free entertainment you can get . It ' s the natural world . Technology is great but it ' s never going to be as much fun as creating something out of nothing .
