Poor old Peter Senior . Australian Masters champion one day , Australian Open disaster the next . The 56 year old , who brought Australian golf firmly into the spotlight with his record breaking win at Huntingdale last week , had a stinker at The Australian Golf Club on Thursday and is long odds to make the weekend . He signed for a deflating nine over 80 at least a shot better than fellow golden oldie Craig Parry , starved of tournament golf of late . " My short game was just horrendous , " Senior said . " I can ' t remember the last time I had a double bogey and I had three of them today . " Think it stopped the kids queuing up for an autograph afterwards ? Not a chance . The nicest man on tour obliged all .
