Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade ( including one semester at Columbia ) , I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone ' s lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom . I ' ve told students for years : You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond . And you should never take a source ' s word about important facts without verifying the truth . ( There ' s a reason we call it reporting and not dictation . )
