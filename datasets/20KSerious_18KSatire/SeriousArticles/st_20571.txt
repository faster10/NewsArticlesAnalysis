Eddie had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing , but as far as the chording goes not his soloing as much as the chording yeah , he took some of that big open chord thing from Montrose . The big open A , the big open D , the big open E . Everything as open as you could make it , to make it as heavy as possible with one guitar . And that was pretty much Ronnie ' s style , too . And of course the fire , too Van Halen came out with all that fire , which is Ronnie . Ronnie was full of fire , man .
