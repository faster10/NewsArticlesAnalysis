Ronald Reagan himself once said , " Unfortunately , Congress consistently brings the government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility . This brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and veterans benefits . Interest rates would skyrocket , instability would occur in financial markets , and the federal deficit would soar . The United States has a special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations . It means we have a well earned reputation for reliability and credibility , two things that set us apart from much of the world . "
