I ve watched and seen people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave our senior citizens out in the cold , he said in a response to a question about his own biggest weaknesses . I ve heard them talk about deporting 10 or 11 people here from this country out of this country , splitting families . I ve heard about tax schemes that don t add up , that put our kids in a deeper hole than they re in today . We need somebody who can lead , we need someone who can balance budgets , cut taxes . Frankly , I did it in Washington and Ohio and I ll do it again in Washington if I m president to get this country moving again .
