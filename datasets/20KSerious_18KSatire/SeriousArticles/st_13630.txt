Good week for SHREWSBURY . The last four days could not have gone any better for Micky Mellon ' s side . Two wins , six points , six goals scored , zero conceded . Pre season promotion favourites in League Two , Shrewsbury started strongly but a run of just one win in six games had seen them slip some way off the automatic places . Tuesday night ' s 5 0 thrashing of pace setters Bury bodes well though it ' s now three wins on the spin for Mellon ' s men , who are back up to fifth and just four points off Wycombe at the top of the table .
