Trotter argued that women need to have the biggest , baddest weapons they can get their hands on . Why ? For " the peace of mind that a woman has as she ' s facing three , four , five violent attackers , intruders in her home , with her children screaming in the background , the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary looking gun gives her more courage when she ' s fighting hardened , violent criminals . If we ban these types of assault weapons , you are putting women at a great disadvantage . "
