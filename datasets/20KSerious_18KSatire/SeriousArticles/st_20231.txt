Physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered . The legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so called Tarasoff case , in which a young patient told his psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley that he wanted to kill his girlfriend , Tatiana Tarasoff . The psychologist alerted the campus police , though not the city police or Tarasoff . Unfortunately , the patient then killed Tarasoff . A court found the psychologist liable .
