Statistically , quarterback Brian Hoyer ( 6 2 , 215 ) has had a nice season in only 11 games . He s a smart player with adequate arm strength who generally takes care of the football and does little things well ? like drawing defensive linemen offsides . But like most quarterbacks , his accuracy wanes under pressure , and he s prone to mistakes when the pocket collapses . In the first game against the Chiefs , he only completed 18 of 34 passes for 236 yards and was replaced in the second half by Ryan Mallett , who has since been released .
