But I do care that Mr Thicke ( who I also think is an awesome artist ) seems to have abdicated his responsibility ( as a man not a celebrity ) to model respectable behavior towards women . He ' s 36 . He ' s a dad . And I ' m guessing he ' s a pretty dandy dad and husband . I mean , come on , his own father was Jason Seaver of " Growing Pains " ! I ' m not an MTV producer , but I ' m pretty confident Mr Thicke knew exactly how that performance was going to go down . Foam fingers , package grabbing , twerking , Miley backing herself into his hips like he was an open garage door , and the rest of the mess .
