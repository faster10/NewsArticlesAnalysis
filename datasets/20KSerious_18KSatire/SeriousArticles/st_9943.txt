So , in my coverage on Sunday and on Tuesday I will be taking all this on board as I bring you the majesty of the day , the fun of the moments and the celebration of the times . I know most of you are not subjects of the crown and so I ask you the indulgence of remembering I am British and this is the celebration of 60 years of my head of state . I promise my coverage will be fair , but it won ' t be neutral . Listen carefully when she goes past and you may just hear me joining in as the crowd sing " God Save The Queen . "
