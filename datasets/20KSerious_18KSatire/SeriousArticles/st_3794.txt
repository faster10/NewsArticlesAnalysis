Jacki Johansen , a 54 year old office manager and single mother from Bedford , New Hampshire , said her current job doesn t offer health insurance and she hasn t made enough to pay for an Obamacare policy in the past . I think he really makes a good point in saying that it s a right , and when you do compare it to other countries , it really does seem insane that we don t have coverage when everybody else does , she said . Even if we just make a move in the right direction , then that s a good thing . ? ?
