The difference between the two cities is not money it ' s governance . New York City may control its streets , but it doesn ' t control its power system or its transit system . Unlike England , where investment decisions are made by the city in conjunction with the national government , when it comes to infrastructure we ' ve got a bundle of intermediary state agencies and regulators deciding what ' s best for the city and how much investment it deserves and a bunch of state politicians circumscribing their ability to do so at every turn .
