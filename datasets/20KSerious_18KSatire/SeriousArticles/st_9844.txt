This category is comparable to what I was saying in the Comedy Actor segment : There aren ' t as many first rate showcases for lead women as there are for men in dramas . That stipulated , I believe Anna Torv ' s various shadings of the multiple universe Olivia Dunhams in " Fringe " was highly Emmy worthy work . I also think that Elizabeth McGovern has been somewhat overlooked in all the praise for " Downton Abbey " her lovely approach to her character is a model of restrained yet highly effective acting . Whether or not this proved to be Elisabeth Moss ' swan song on " Mad Men , " her performance was remarkable , as she moved Peggy from dutiful , imaginative agency cog to a wise verging on cynical woman who you can bet deserved that kiss of fealty Don Draper bestowed upon her hand . And all that said , Claire Danes is the one to beat , I ' d wager .
