Noah will be back in the locker room as soon as he recovers , hopefully by the upcoming weekend , according to Hoiberg . And he will no doubt bring that personality with him when he returns , but he will not be back on the court , at least not this season , and maybe never again in a Bulls uniform . Time will tell where the Bulls go from here . If they play like they did against Detroit , they have a chance to be an elite team . But if they play like they did against Golden State , you can forget about it .
