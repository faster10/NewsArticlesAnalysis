White ' s time is now , and though he , too , isn ' t a household name , there ' s a lot to like about what he brings to the table . I recall being in Foxboro for training camp before last year ' s Super Bowl campaign , and four names continuously coming up in conversations with Patriots coaches and front office staff : Brady ( in better shape than ever before ) , Revis ( new to the team and spectacular ) , Gronkowski ( coming off an ACL injury and looking better than prior to the injury ) , and James White . Buried on the depth chart , White ended up seeing very little action during the team ' s Super Bowl run , but becoming one of the key members of the scout team and mid week preparation game to game .
