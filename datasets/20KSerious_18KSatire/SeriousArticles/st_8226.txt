Outwardly , the marriages made sense . Two cherub cheeked country music darlings gazing lovingly at each other at awards shows . On the other end , two edgy rockers with so much style that seeing them being outwardly affectionate towards one another somehow how seemed more endearing than other examples of PDA . Their professional genres fit , and it s easy to see why we might root for the marriages because of it . Compartmentalizing the relationship with the same ease we search their music on Spotify is more convenient than considering that , you know , the parties in these relationships are a lot more than chart topping performers . They re actual people ( yes , I know ) in relationships , and with that comes the associated complexities of dating someone outside your professional industry . We don t pause when a writer dates a musician , or an engineer gets with a journalist . We assume they have interests outside of their respective occupations . But when celebrity couples date outside of their craft or genre , it s treated like a mismatched outfit .
