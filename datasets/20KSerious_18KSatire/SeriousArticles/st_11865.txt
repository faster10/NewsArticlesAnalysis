Mayor Rahm Emanuel ? ? I do not see how the manner in which Mr Coleman was physically treated could possibly be acceptable . While the Medical Examiner ruled that Mr Coleman died accidentally as a result of treatment he received in the hospital , it does not excuse the way he was treated when he was in custody , said Mayor Rahm Emanuel . Something is wrong here ? either the actions of the officers who dragged Mr Coleman , or the policies of the department . I have not received a sufficient answer on either from IPRA s former leadership , and as a result I do not consider this case to be closed or the investigation into what happened that night to be over .
