The poisoning of the majority black population of the city is a product of a system failing the people of Flint on many levels over a long period of time . To really start unpacking the historical roots of the crisis , you have to go back to slavery itself , which debased the humanity and devalued the lives of black people from well before our nation ' s founding followed by the Jim Crow era of legal segregation , discrimination , and violence against black Americans , which resulted in early 20th century migrations of black people from the segregated south to urban manufacturing centers of the northern United States . When they got there , they found cities without legal segregation , yet with de facto segregation and discrimination alive and well in both white attitudes and systems . The arrival and growth of black populations in northern cities was followed shortly thereafter by white flight to the suburbs , aided by discriminatory housing policies that effectively prevented the vast majority of black people from joining them and blocked the financing of black homes even in the cities .
