As a viewer , I don t mind . I watch probably as much as everybody else does , the continuing story stuff . That s all great . As a writer , I honestly don t want to work on those kind of shows . I ve done it before , and I find them unfulfilling , to be honest with you . Just because there s just too many people . You re not really expressing your own taste , or viewpoint , or anything . It s a different skill . I m probably not very good at it . Another reason why I don t like doing it as a writer .
