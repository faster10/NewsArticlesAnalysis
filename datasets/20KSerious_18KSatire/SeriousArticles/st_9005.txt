There was a time when this manner of standby travel was open to anyone . If you weren ' t in a hurry , you could show up at the airport or call the airline ahead of time and get on the standby list , agreeing to wait until a flight had empty seats . Boquet did it as a college student in 1981 , waiting at the New Orleans airport most of the day until he got a seat on a flight to London for less than half the price of a reserved seat . Even then , getting back posed a bigger problem , and Boquet waited several days before he got a flight back to New Orleans .
