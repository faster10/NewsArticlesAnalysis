In 1988 I served as Frank ' s press secretary . Few bosses were tougher . He was running for re election against golden boy Pete Dawkins Heisman Trophy winner at West Point , Rhodes scholar , Vietnam vet , Army general , millionaire banker a man so handsome , he was a model in ads for men ' s shirts . Frank was not as glib as Dawkins , so I told the press , " Frank may not be a great communicator , but he ' s a great legislator . " That did not go over well . " I am paying you to say good things about me , " he thundered . " I can get people to criticize me for free ! "
