Forget what you ' ve heard about a reconquista : the fabled reconquering of the Southwest by Mexican Americans on behalf of Mexico . That ' s loco . Most Mexican Americans are barely on speaking terms with Mexico . We ( I am among them ) understand that our neighbor had no room in its economy for our dark skinned , uneducated parents and grandparents , who were forced to go north . Now , most of us reciprocate and have little room in our hearts for Mexico . Our loyalty is to the United States . Even if we were speaking to our Mexican brethren , we ' d be conversing in different languages . Most Mexicans speak Spanish , and about 80 of U . S . Latinos speak English .
