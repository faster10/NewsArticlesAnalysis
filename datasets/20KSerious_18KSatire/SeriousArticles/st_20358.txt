This past week , the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation along with nine professional physician groups released a list of 45 common tests and procedures that are performed too often . The list includes electrocardiograms for asymptomatic patients , imaging tests for routine back pain , and Pap smears for women younger than 21 years old . Along with the recommendations to cut down on these procedures , an education campaign called Choosing Wisely was launched with the goal to start the important conversation between doctors and patients about the necessity , or lack thereof , of these commonly ordered tests .
