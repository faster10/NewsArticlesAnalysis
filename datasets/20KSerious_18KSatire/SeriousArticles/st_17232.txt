Marijuana . With the growing acceptance of weed , we can expect that more laws will change to allow medical and recreational use of marijuana . How will the rest of the laws in this country adjust ? For instance , Washington state is coming up with a Breathalyzer type device to check if drivers are high . But it will be interesting to see how readily available these devices are going to be . Will legalization improve the scientific understanding of the long term consequences of the drug ? What other uses could this drug have to help those who may need pain relief most ?
