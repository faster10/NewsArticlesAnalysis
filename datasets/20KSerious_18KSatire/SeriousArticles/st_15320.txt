Libya ' s next challenge is the writing of a new constitution , and it has set itself an ambitious , perhaps impossible , timeline of a draft within 60 days of the constitutional committee ' s first meeting . The country needs time to debate the big issues , and the more actively involved a broad cross section of civil society is , the better the outcome . As is true in Egypt and Tunisia , religion will be a flashpoint in the constitution . Already , various groups are pressing to make Islam a central source of law , while others are trying to restrict the role of religion . How Islam is reconciled with human rights in general , and women ' s rights in particular , will be a litmus test for which path forward Libya chooses .
