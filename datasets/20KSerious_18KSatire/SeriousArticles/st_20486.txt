First is the new Perspective Shift feature . Until now , you could focus only on one small section of a Lytro image at a time , which seemed to negate the benefit of having a camera that could focus on everything in the frame . Perspective Shift finally allows you to bring the entire image into focus , but that ' s not the most interesting part . When you click and drag on a Lytro picture , there is also a 3 D effect , allowing you move the image around for altered angles . Existing Lytro camera owners will be happy to learn that the effect can be applied to older images as well .
