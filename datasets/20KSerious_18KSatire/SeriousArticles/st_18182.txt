However , Clinton did stumble on one intelligent thought . She realized that to get rid of or contain ISIS , as its predecessor al Qaeda in Iraq was contained , Sunni Arabs would themselves need to do the job . Yet you can ' t get to this outcome by attempting the herculean task of reforming the corrupt and sectarian Shi ' ite governments of Iraq and Syria . As long as those governments dominate Sunni lands , Sunnis will turn to ISIS , al Nusra , or other radical Islamist groups to defend against them . The only solution is to recognize the stark reality that the artificial states of Iraq and Syria are no more . So is a pan Arab restoration of the caliphate , as desired by ISIS or al Nusra , the answer ? No that is unworkable too , especially if Islamist crazies are running it .
