But while the Wilpons can t be excused for getting in bed with Madoff ( note : if an investment looks ? too good to be true , it probably is ) and while acting like a low revenue team in big money New York is never going to win you allies , they have made the best of their own self inflicted wounds . Mostly by having the good sense to get out of the way of GM Sandy Alderson and manager Terry Collins as they executed a long term plan to build the farm system and the club . Maybe Alderson could ve done it more quickly if he had a decent payroll to work with , but it s also likely the case that Alderson ? who was running the A s with a Moneyball style philosophy before Billy Beane was ? wouldn t have been hired if the Mets didn t need to cut costs . Either way , the Mets have developed an amazing stable of young pitchers and several good position players which now have their fans justifiably excited again .
