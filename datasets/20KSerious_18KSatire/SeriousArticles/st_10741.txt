One French police official , with knowledge of the investigation , said it came as a surprise to learn that Abaaoud , the suspected mastermind , had a cousin in the Paris suburb of St . Denis who was already under investigation in a drug case . The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to publicly share details of the investigation , said it was even more of a shock to learn that Abaaoud himself was in the same Paris area , despite his status as one of Europe ' s most wanted men . Abaaoud is among the dead in rubble of a St . Denis home that was raided on Nov . 18 .
