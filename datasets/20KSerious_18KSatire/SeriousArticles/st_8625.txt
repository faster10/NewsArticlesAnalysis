The author says he personally has been attacked repeatedly by Muslims : " I ' ve ' only ' experienced 8 assaults , attempted robberies and multiple threats . I ' ve never actually been severely ravaged , robbed or beaten my Muslims ( a broken nose is the worst thing that occurred ) but I know more than 20 people who have . I know at least 2 girls that have been raped my Muslims and I am familiar with two more cases in my broader network ( 1 gang rape ) . One girl though was cut badly in the face by Muslims . "
