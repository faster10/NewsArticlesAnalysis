One thing is a team . Another thing is a team with Messi , it s a different story , said Mourinho , spelling out just how decisive Messi was . He played a Champions League final with Guardiola 2009 and 2011 . He ? normally ? is playing a Champions League final with Luis Enrique 2015 . And if one day he plays for Anthony ( any random team ) , Anthony will go to a Champions League final with him . So when people analyse teams , you have to remember that this boy makes everything different , he makes everything different .
