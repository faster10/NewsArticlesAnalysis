About the Cardinals : The NFC West champs won more games than they ever had in their mostly dreary 96 year history . Now they ' re just one win away from their second berth in the Super Bowl , which they ' ve never won . Arizona won its only previous ? NFC Championship Game appearance ? but is 2 6 in road playoff games in the Super Bowl era . . . . The Cards also led the league in offense for the first time in the Super Bowl era and posted 489 points , most in team history and second only to the Panthers in the regular season . . . . A fifth ranked defense rounds out a well balanced squad , though the late season loss of DB Tyrann Mathieu ( knee ) remains a blow . . . . QB Carson Palmer , coming off his first career playoff win , had an MVP caliber season and established more team records ( and career bests of his own ) with 4 , 671 passing yards and 35 TDs . . . . OLB Dwight Freeney was signed off the street and provided a team best eight sacks in 11 games . In five games after replacing injured Chris Johnson in the regular season , rookie RB David Johnson , an excellent receiver out of the backfield , compiled 658 yards from scrimmage .
