Reigning award show queen Taylor Swift was this year s big nominee with six nods , and if she d swept the board she would have become the AMAs most decorated winner ( overtaking Whitney Houston ) . In the end , she won three ? more than anyone else on the night ? including Song of the Year for Blank Space . She was a no show ( she s currently on a break from her 1989 world tour , and could have been there in theory ) , and all of her categories were pointedly announced off camera . In fact , unlike most award shows , there were no absent winners and no sorry we couldn t be there video messages .
