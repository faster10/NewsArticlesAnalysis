And we should not forget that achieving military effect from distance is almost as old as warfare itself . An English longbowman at Agincourt would not have known which French noble his arrow would strike a British artilleryman behind the lines on the Somme would not have known which Germans his shells would maim or kill . Today we can do better than that . Not only is sophisticated surveillance capability a part of the drone itself , but accuracy can be enhanced by electronic intercept cross referencing or , on occasions , by visual confirmation from special forces on the ground . For those concerned about a fair fight , the work of these teams is hardly risk free , and it is highly possible that intelligence intercepts and or special ops were used in the killing of Mohammed Emwazi .
