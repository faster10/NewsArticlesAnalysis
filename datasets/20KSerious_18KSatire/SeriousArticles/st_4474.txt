Van Dyke : They just went with the flow ! It ' s funny I was concentrating on the dancing , mostly , and they had given me a voice coach who turned out to be an Irishman , and his Cockney wasn ' t much better than mine .

One British poll named Van Dyke ' s accent the second worst British accent ever Van Dyke observes , however , that he was beaten out by Sean Connery ' s " Untouchables " performance .
