? ? I have Denver as obviously the biggest winner in the wild card round , because if Pittsburgh s gritty win at Cincinnati means quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and receiver Antonio Brown ? ( concussion protocol ) ? are either out or considerable less than their usual starring role selves against the Broncos , Denver s route to hosting another AFC Championship Game just got considerably easier . Who would have expected Peyton Manning to perhaps be the healthiest quarterback in next Sunday s game ?
