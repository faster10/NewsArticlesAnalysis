The congressional hearing has been a battleground for more explicit ideologies in movies about the House Un American Activities Committee . Among them : Irwin Winkler s 1991 morality play Guilty by Suspicion with Robert DeNiro and , more currently , Jay Roach s upcoming release Trumbo , in which Bryan Cranston stars as the blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo . Cranston plays the part with a mix of wry ennui and stony resolve , which give the hearings a crackle one doesn t always see from these proceedings in other films . ( Also , it s a chance to watch Louis C . K . play a conflicted congressional witness , and who doesn ' t want that ? )
