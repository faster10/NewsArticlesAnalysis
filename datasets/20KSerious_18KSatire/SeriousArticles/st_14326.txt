" As alleged , Dreamboard had strict rules and a rigid hierarchy . Its membership was tightly controlled by the group ' s administrators , " Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer told reporters . " Applicants to the group were required to upload quote nude or hardcore child pornography to become members and members were required to continue posting additional images every 50 days or risk expulsion . Moreover , members could increase their status based on their level of commitment to the enterprise . From member , to VIP , to Super VIP , to the most elite status of all , Super VIP Dot . Only those members who produced their own child pornography could be granted the status of Super VIP Dot , " Breuer explained .
