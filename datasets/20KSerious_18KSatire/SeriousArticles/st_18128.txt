In fairness , Trump seemed visibly bored by this line of attack and quickly let it drop . ( Not as bored as he will soon get with this whole presidential candidate business , I suspect . ) There are lots of other places Obama could go , Trump mused , without coming right out and saying that the only possible reason for this visit was treason and surrender . Trump is not running against Obama , unfortunately , and couldn t quite see an opening to suggest that Ted Cruz , because Canadian by birth , must also be a frequenter of mosques .
