A 12 year NFL veteran , Palmer had not won a career playoff game until last week when he prevailed against the Green Bay Packers despite an uneven outing . His shaky playoff form continued against the Panthers as the Cardinals fell behind 17 0 in the first quarter and their offense devolved into a string of miscues . Larry Fitzgerald , the team s dependable veteran standout who put up 176 receiving yards in last week s triumph , managed just four catches for 30 yards as his team went out with a whimper . " If we would ' ve lost in a shootout and it went down to the wire it would ' ve hurt . But we just didn t have it today and that really stings , " said Fitzgerald , fighting back tears . Arizona s defense may have lost some of its sting when Pro Bowl safety Tyrann Mathieu went down with a season ending ACL tear last month . The Cardinals showed little resistance against Carolina s offense and Cam Newton , surrendering 476 total yards .
