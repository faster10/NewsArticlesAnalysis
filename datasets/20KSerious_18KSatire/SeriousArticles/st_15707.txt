With this kind of non sense it s hard to even like you and your my favorite NFL LB . ONE FAN , ONE FAN spilled some popcorn on you as you were carted off the field . I know many fans who were their and they spoke up after they saw some popcorn go over the edge . We DID not like or condone it and definitely doesn t represent our fan base . We cheered as you were carted off as a sign of respect . Since your so delusional maybe you should realize their is NO rivalry anymore were back to where we always are and that s fighting to win the NFCW and your back to where you always are and that s fighting for a top 5 pick .
