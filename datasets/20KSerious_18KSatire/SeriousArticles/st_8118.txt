Hoiberg and his players don ' t believe in moral victories , but when the Bulls can keep it close against the Warriors and do it while playing without Rose and Brooks , and having veteran Kirk Hinrich play almost 35 minutes it ' s easy to understand why the locker room was upbeat after a loss . The Bulls ' backcourt of Hinrich and Jimmy Butler combined for 45 points , besting the Warriors ' dynamic duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson , who combined for 42 . That ' s the first time all season Curry and Thompson have been outscored by an opponent ' s backcourt , according to ESPN Stats Information .
