The bulk of the problem today was the defense . They re playing better , but they give up yards between the 20 s like nobody s business . And why can t they cover Tight Ends ? ! That all being said , they ve come up with some big plays over the last couple weeks that totally bailed out the offense . And they seem to get pretty stingy once they ve been pushed behind their 20 yardline . But , no matter what the offense is doing ( good or bad ) they need to be more consistent at getting off the field on 3rd downs . They ve come up with splash plays ( as Tomlin likes to call them ) recently , but when they don t have the splash plays to rely on they need get stops .
