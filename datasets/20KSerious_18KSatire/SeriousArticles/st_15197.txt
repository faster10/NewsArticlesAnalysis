Outside the structures of the blues , Clark is still a journey man songwriter , sometimes settling for easy rhymes and singsong melodies , as he does in " Blak and Blu , " which aspires to the thoughtfulness of Marvin Gaye , wondering , " How do we get lifted How do we not go insane ? " Give Clark credit for striving to be something more than a blues rock throwback and singing from a troubled heart . And hope that he gets through the narrow portals of pop radio . But on this album , it ' s still his blues that cut deepest .
