Meanwhile , relations between Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru were going stronger by the day . While Nehru was in prison in India , Bose travelled from Vienna to Badenweiler to be with Kamala Nehru , who was suffering from TB . He remained there till Nehru arrived after being released from prison . When Kamala Nehru died Bose was there to help Nehru and his daughter Indira ( then 19 ) with the funeral arrangements . When Nehru told Bose that he was intending to set up a foreign affairs department in the Congress the latter was mighty pleased as that was entirely in consonance with his own views .
