Public opinion polls suggest that the country continues to be closely divided when it comes to support for Republicans or Democrats . Entering the final year of a two term presidency , it is ironic that Barack Obama captured the nation ' s attention due to his emotional plea for Americans to come together not as red America or blue America , but for the United States of America when he was a State Senator from Illinois in 2004 . And this is what makes me sad . Sad that we cannot do better . We are not " Rs " and " Ds , " but we are indeed Americans , and there happens to be broad consensus on a number of seemingly intractable issues ( like gun control ) .
