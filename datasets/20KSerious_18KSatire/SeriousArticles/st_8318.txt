When the desire to communicate is met with an equal and opposite urge not to compromise in order to communicate those two things are in perfect balance is when everything happens with rock roll . And that ' s what Dylan achieved in " Rolling Stone . " I don ' t know or particularly care who this song is about though I ' ve met a few people who have claimed it was about them ( some who weren ' t even born in 1965 ) . The real thrill for me was that " once upon a time " in the world , a song this radical was a hit on the radio . The world was changed by a cranky voice , a romantic spirit , somebody who cared enough about an unrequited love to write such a devastatingly caustic put down .
