The act of bullying hurts not only the children involved , but the entire community . That ' s why PACER Center has organized National Bullying Prevention Month in October , a time for communities nationwide to unite and promote bullying prevention through creative resources designed to engage , educate and inspire . Ignoring the problem is not the answer . Instead , our communities can take steps to raise awareness of bullying and start teaching young people that the end of bullying really does begin with them .
