Where will the engine of growth come from ? Equity is the key engine of growth . In a country where there are practically no IPOs and the market capitalization of the Iranian listed companies dropped from 400 to 100 billion in a few years , it will be a challenge to convince investors . Furthermore , financial education is very limited . The question is " where to start ? " I met three of the nine investment banks . All of them were created after 2008 . They all need one form or another of financial training in corporate valuation and the Mergers and Acquisition market is at ground zero . They know it and their executives are all prepared to learn and develop new ideas to help their companies .
