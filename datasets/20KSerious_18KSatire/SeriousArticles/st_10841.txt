Former President Bill Clinton was always a charmer , for good and bad , but Hillary has always been a bedrock of pragmatism and calculation when it came down to doing business . She is willing to send children from violent crime ridden countries back . She will shuttle back and forth to the Middle East to negotiate with whomever it takes to resolve disagreements . She will sit in front of a hostile congressional committee for hours and literally laugh at their face as they pepper her with questions , which she slaps down one after another . Meanwhile , Donald Trump , the " Great Negotiator . " is whining about difficult questions from Megyn Kelly .
