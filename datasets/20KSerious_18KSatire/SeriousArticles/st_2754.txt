It felt almost disappointing that Curry didn ' t fire up another try or two late in the fourth , as the Warriors looked to hold off the still battling Wiz . After all , the NBA ' s all time single game record of 12 made 3s ? shared by Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant ? was right there . Then again , for a player who already owns the records for most 3s in a single season ( a mark he ' s on pace to shatter this year ) and a single postseason , that record must feel like it ' s always right there . No shooter ever has made domination of the long distance record books seem this inevitable , and there haven ' t been many who have made inevitability this much fun to watch .
