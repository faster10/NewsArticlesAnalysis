Well , if Henry and three fourths of that Alabama front seven decide not to show up OK , so if the Gators are going to have a real shot at upsetting the Tide in the ATL , they ' ll need all hands on deck on defense to stop Henry , who is the life force of Alabama ' s offense . The good news is that Florida is second only to Alabama in the SEC in rush defense ( 111 . 25 ypg ) . Now , putting pressure on Coker is also essential because he ' s been prone to turning the ball over . He ' s thrown eight interceptions on the season , while Florida has forced a SEC high 24 turnovers and has also scored 88 points off turnovers . Offensively , Florida must get quarterback Treon Harris on the move . He ' s been inefficient lately because defenses are spying him up perfectly and taking his running lanes away . Mobile quarterbacks can be issues for Alabama ' s defense , so if Harris runs well , the Gators have a chance . Edward Aschoff
