In a rigorous study in Uganda , which has very scarce resources , researchers trained community members to deliver group interpersonal therapy to depressed men and women in 30 villages . The groups met weekly for four months . During the meetings , participants shared their experiences , and the group leader facilitated support and suggestions for change from other group members .
