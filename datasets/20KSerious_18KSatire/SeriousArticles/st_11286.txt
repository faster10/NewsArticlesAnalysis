" Dollhouse " is fiction , but there are clearly some parallels between the lives of the Kardashians and Romeros . And in light of Kim ' s divorce , it ' s entertaining to read about a celebrity fairy tale wedding filmed for TV . ( You ' ll have to read to see whether the marriage lasts longer than 72 days . . . ) All in all , " Dollhouse " is just Kardashian camp packaged in a neat novel . It ' s completely ridiculous , but entertaining nonetheless . And with the Kardashians I wouldn ' t expect any less .
