BEAUBIEN : Yeah . We ' re expecting that they are definitely going to say yes . I mean , this is a crisis that ' s crossing international boundaries . It ' s serious in nature , so yeah , we very much expect that they will make that declaration . And once they have done that , then we ' re going to look for what are the guidance that they ' re issuing to local countries ? Some of this is probably going to be technical advice on how to treat patients . Some of it could be limits on travel or other measures to try to stop Zika from spreading . During the Ebola outbreak , the WHO put in place treatment guidelines for countries , saying anyone who ' s infected should get this type of care . They also said people with Ebola should not travel , nor should anyone who ' s been in contact with people who are Ebola . A couple of years ago , they recommended that the last three countries with endemic polio transmission require proof of polio vaccination for anyone trying to fly out of those countries . So there ' s a range of measures that they could take . Zika has already spread quite far and plus , there ' s no vaccine . So we ' re not expecting to see any travel restrictions at this point as part of their recommendations .
