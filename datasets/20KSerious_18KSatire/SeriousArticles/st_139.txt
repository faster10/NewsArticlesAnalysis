' My debut was against Liverpool in the Worthington Cup and I remember being tackled and playing up for the free kick like we did in Spain but my team mates turned , saying ' Get up , get on with it , we don ' t do that here ' . I was used to playing a passing game , even if it meant going backwards , but the fans would shout and coach Ray Wilkins took me to one side and said , ' I know what you want to do but here you have to move it forward more quickly ' . It was all part of learning a different culture , it was good preparation for when I came back . '
