It ' s used to find potential treatments for a wide range of common diseases and afflictions , including cancer , diabetes , birth defects , HIV , multiple sclerosis , ALS , and Alzheimer ' s . Unlike adult tissue cells , fetal tissue cells can be manipulated into almost any kind of tissue , are less likely to be rejected by a host , and have the capacity to replicate rapidly ? making them perfect for analysis into how diseases work . They are also being tried as actual treatments for Parkinson ' s disease , spinal cord injuries , and diabetes , with researchers injecting fetal cells directly into organs in hopes of regenerating them . Fetal tissue was also a vital component in the development of vaccines for polio , chicken pox , rubella , and shingles . The polio vaccine alone saves 550 , 000 lives a year . Alta Charo , a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison , says fetal tissue research has benefited " virtually every person in this country . "
