Richard III was no saint but neither was he a criminal . All but one of the so called crimes laid at his door can be refuted by the facts . The one that cannot is the disappearance of his nephews , the " Princes in the Tower " and the answer to that question is simply that no one knows what happened to them . All that follows is conjecture they just disappeared . Richard had no need to kill them they had been declared bastards . Henry VII needed them out of the way , but he got so scared whenever a pretender appeared that it is likely that he knew they were alive at the time Richard died at Bosworth . Did they die in 1483 or 1485 or were they spirited out of the country to their aunt , the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy ? We will probably never know .
