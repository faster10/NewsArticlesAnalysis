A good tip on tipping ? Get small bills or coins from your hotel ' s front desk to make tipping easier . But if you have only large bills , it ' s perfectly acceptable to ask a hotel porter or even a skycap for change when you give them a tip . After all , tips are a part of their business . They ' re not embarrassed , and you needn ' t be either . And if you don ' t have local currency , U . S . greenbacks can work just as well as a " thank you " in London , Lombok , or Lahore .
