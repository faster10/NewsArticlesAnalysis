With a net worth of 5 . 5 billion ( and a wife , Wal Mart heiress Ann Walton Kroenke , worth another 2 . 6 billion ) , Kroenke has among the deepest pockets in the league . He ' ll be privately financing the stadium , which could cost up to 2 . 66 billion , in addition to putting up the 550 million relocation fee . LA ' s public officials held fast in their refusal to fork over any money , a welcome change from the usual pattern of politicians bowing to sports owners . The city says it will pay a relatively small 180 million toward tax breaks on things like infrastructure , road improvements , security and shuttle buses . The plan also includes the development of an " NFL campus " in LA to house the league ' s expanding media operations .
