Rickman s death was shocking to all of his fans , not just his Potter co stars . For my generation , it s hard to believe that he is really gone . Rickman , as Professor Severus Snape , was such a crucial part of my childhood , playing the terrifying professor that I never wanted in school . His portrayal of Snape was important for me to see because he taught me that you re not going to love everybody and certainly not everybody will love you . Harry Potter was often at the wrong end of Snape s judgement , causing Harry to have a strong disliking of him .
