True , Obama was a skeptic of America ' s original intervention in Iraq in 2003 , and wisely agreed to leave in 2011 when the pro Iranian Nuri al Maliki regime in Baghdad showed us the door . But now he seems to be having second thoughts about having left , and is slowly returning U . S . military personnel to help stem the ISIS juggernaut in the Land Between the Rivers . Surely we should have learned from our original intervention that while with the presence of large numbers of American boots on the ground we can hold the place together , that success will only last as long as we are willing to stay there .
