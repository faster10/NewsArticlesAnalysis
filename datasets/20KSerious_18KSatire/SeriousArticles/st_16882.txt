Some of that might be due to a soft early schedule as NBA . com ' s John Schuhmann noted , most of their work against the league ' s top offenses still lies ahead . Then again , the Atlanta Hawks had a top 10 offense until they played San Antonio on Saturday . . . and then the Spurs held them to 25 first half points en route to a 25 point blowout . Objects in the rear view mirror are always closer than they appear , and no matter how Golden State bounces back , these Spurs ? now 12 0 at home , with 10 of their next 13 at AT T Center ? are closer still .
