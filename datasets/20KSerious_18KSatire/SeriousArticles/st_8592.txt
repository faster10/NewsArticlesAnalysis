And with that in mind , it ' s important to remember in this case that the defense will not be eyeing an acquittal , rather a sentence that spares Tsarnaev ' s life . To make this case , the defense attorneys will no doubt delve deep into his personal history , the evidence that his older brother , Tamerlan , was the mastermind , and that Dzhokhar was under his brother ' s spell . Perhaps most importantly , it should be remembered that in defending Tsarnaev , they are not endorsing him , but instead are endorsing our collective humanity and our Constitution , fighting for even the worst among us to be afforded its consideration and its protection .
