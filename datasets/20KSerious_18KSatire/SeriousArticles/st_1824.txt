Overall new HIV infections have been reduced by over 35 percent since 2001 . Speaking at the same occasion , the chairman for the Zimbabwe National Network for People living positive with HIV , Mr Sebastian Chinhaire , called for the development of drugs with lesser side effects to ensure treatment adherence . " Surely there is no need for all those who are HIV negative to be positive as this represents failure of our programmes to save them " , said Minister Haufiku . " We need to encourage people to go for free Hiv Aids tests , and also use condoms " said Deputy President Honourable Cyril Ramaphosa on the World Aids Day .
