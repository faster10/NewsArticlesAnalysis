I love it when people are willing to show their personality or their opinions outwardly , says Nordeman . As an editorial photographer Nordeman is often hired to work on assignments where he disappears into groups of people gathering through a lens that tends to capture the kinetic energy of our culture . I love to be in the midst of a group of people who are celebrating something , says Nordeman . What I love is people , and this idea of performance and spectacle . And so in order to get as close to that as possible , I find a way in . And maybe finding that way in for me is through the camera .
