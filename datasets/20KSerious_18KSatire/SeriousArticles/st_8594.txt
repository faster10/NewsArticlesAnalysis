A year later , we joined millions of people along the race course and cheered on the 36 , 000 runners who ran one year after the bombing . Running the race again was a way to reclaim both the day and the finish line .

And this is what we should keep doing moving forward , leaving the attackers in the dust , forgotten in a cell somewhere to live with what has been done .
