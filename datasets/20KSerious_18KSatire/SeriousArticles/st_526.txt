In the meantime , the Bernie mentum we saw this summer has slowed considerably . Most troubling for his campaign is that he s losing serious ground in Iowa and struggling to hold on to his advantage in New Hampshire . As the establishment favorite , Clinton can afford to lose one of those contests to start 2016 , and maybe even both of them ( especially given her massive advantage in South Carolina ) . As the insurgent , though , Bernie needs at least one of those states to keep the contest from turning into a coronation . This debate won t be his final chance to choose between cause and candidacy ? but after Saturday there will be only two more debates before the contest officially kicks off in Iowa .
