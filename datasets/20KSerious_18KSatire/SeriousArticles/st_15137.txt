Favors had one of his best games of the season against the Pacers last Saturday and his salary jump reflected it . Favors scored 35 points ( 22 in the restricted area ) and pulled down 13 rebounds against Indiana . He shot an impressive 73 percent down low , but I suspect he won t repeat that performance against the Knicks . In the past 10 games , New York has allowed opponents to shoot only 53 percent from the restricted area , third lowest in the NBA in that span . That number drops to 51 percent when Kristaps Porzingis is on the floor , who is averaging 2 . 9 blocks per game in his past 10 games . I don t think Favors will live up to his price tag tonight .
