I have had countless e mails and phone calls today , asking me if I ' m happy , and if I feel that my brother can finally rest in peace . At the risk of sounding like I ' m never satisfied , I have to say that I am not entirely happy . Sure , some weird , throttled joy is bubbling up in me today , and I don ' t hold with any camp that would contend that " Gadhafi deserved a fair trial . " But yet I fear that with his death goes a warehouse of secrets and lies that could have been revealed in order to salve the souls of Libyan families who lost loved ones during this regime . Men and women have literally disappeared from their houses and places of work and worship , only to be buried in mass graves .
