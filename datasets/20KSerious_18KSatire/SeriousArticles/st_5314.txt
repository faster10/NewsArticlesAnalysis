Because so much is at stake for Clinton in Iowa , she ' s pulling out all the stops . Clinton surrogates are absolutely flocking into the state , to talk up Clinton in front of as many audiences as can be managed in one week ' s time . This includes her biggest surrogate , former President Bill Clinton . Last week , the Clinton campaign began fighting hard against Sanders , essentially reverting to the Clintonian " throw everything including the kitchen sink at your opponent " strategy ( which they deployed throughout the 2008 primary campaign ) . But over the weekend , they seem to have realized that this tactic might not be as effective in famously polite Iowa . Clinton has reportedly pulled back on the more vicious attacks against Bernie ( this involved reining in an attack dog or two ) , and may spend the week concentrating on making more of a logical argument than an emotional one , in the hopes of avoiding voter blowback against the negativity . We ' ll see anything is possible , at this point . But no matter how positive or negative a tone they strike , Clinton surrogates will be thick on the ground all across Iowa , right up until the caucusing starts .
