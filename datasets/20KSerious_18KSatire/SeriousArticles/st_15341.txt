Let s avoid the backlash against refugees , and against Muslims and anyone who believes in Islam . This is a battle with extremists , who have no religion and people who have hijacked Islam . Europe needs to look for answers elsewhere and stop blaming the victims of persecution who are fleeing war zones . This moral panic plays into the hands of extremists like ISIS and ignores the facts about refugees . In the U . K . alone , immigrants including refugees have paid more into the public purse compared to U . K . born counterparts and there are almost 1 , 200 medically qualified refugees who are recorded on the British Medical Association database . So please pause for a moment , take a deep breath and stop blaming refugees .
