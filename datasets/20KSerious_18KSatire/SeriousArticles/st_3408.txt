I recently found out about Dr Lisa Newman ' s annual trips to Ghana where she performs surgery on women with triple negative breast cancer . I asked her if she could use breast prosthesis for her patients . She was overwhelmed and said that she currently takes only a few and how helpful and meaningful that would be for her patients in Ghana . Doctor travels to Ghana for cancer clues Well I ' m sure you can assume that I am now on another journey to provide breast prostheses for those women in Ghana as well as women here in the United States .
