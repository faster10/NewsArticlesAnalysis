As for the Pacers , they made it a very close game thanks for a 40 point fourth quarter . Paul George had a solid game with 33 points , eight rebounds , six assists , three steals , one block and five 3 pointers . George s 3 point percentage is regressing a bit , though . He s typically a worse shooter in the second half of the season , so it s probably safe to assume we ve seen the best out of him so far this year . That is probably kind of obvious considering he s had one of the best shooting seasons from a forward so far in years .
