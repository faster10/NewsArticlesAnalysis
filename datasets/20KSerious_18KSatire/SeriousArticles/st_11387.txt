Oil states tend to be undemocratic states , because control of the state so directly translates into control of the nation ' s wealth . When the price of oil rises , the value of power rises with it . It ' s not a coincidence that oil states from Russia to Venezuela to Iran have turned to more repressive and hard line policies since the price of oil began to rise in 2001 . By contrast , the 1986 collapse in the price of oil is widely cited as a decisive factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union .
