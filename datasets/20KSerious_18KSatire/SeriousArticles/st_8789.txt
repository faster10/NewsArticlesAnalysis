What is a proportional response to terror ? When would it be better to treat a threat as a criminal matter to be handled within our basic system of laws and when should it be treated more aggressively " even to the point of suspending basic elements of due process , as in the suggestion by some to treat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant ? Or do we do damage to our national reputation and character as we did in the decade past with the contra constitutional provisions of the Patriot Act or our actions at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo ?
