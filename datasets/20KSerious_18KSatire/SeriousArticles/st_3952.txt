The Affordable Care Act has its pluses and minuses , with plenty of people legitimately aggrieved about what it s done or how it s worked out for them and plenty more opposed for philosophical reasons . But any alternative that provides similar ? ( or better ) access to health care protection from medical bills is bound to require a ? similar combination of regulation and government spending . ? Republicans oppose such measures on principle ? which is why , ? when they talk about Obamacare , they exaggerate the downsides , ignore the upsides , and pretend they have better alternatives .
