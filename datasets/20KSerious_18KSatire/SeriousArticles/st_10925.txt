A : I talk to the actors throughout the year whenever big stuff is happening with the character , from death to them perpetrating death , we talk about it . They absolutely have an idea of what ' s coming up . Typically we ' re a couple episodes ahead , sometimes it ' s a little tighter than that , sometimes there ' s a great deal of lead time with regard to the discussion . It ' s a huge cast , but I still try to communicate with the actors very often , especially when it ' s about dramatic stuff .
