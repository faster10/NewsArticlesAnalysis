They re very good . They re attacking , they play physical , they play hard , they ve got a lot of speed . They ve got some big boys up front that can really get after you both run and pass . They are good on the back end . They ve got one of the best corners in the league . So , again , similar to last week . You look at all three levels . They ve got great talent , they have a great scheme that they ve been implementing there for a while , and they haven t missed a beat . They ve overcome a couple injuries as everyone has , and they are playing as well as anybody in the league on that side of the ball for sure .
