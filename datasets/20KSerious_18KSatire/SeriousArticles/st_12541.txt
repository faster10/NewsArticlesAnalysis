Americans are fearful of another terrorist attack after what happened in Paris , and they re largely distrustful of President Obama s ability to prevent one . A new Washington Post ABC News Poll showed that 83 ? percent of registered voters believe a large scale terrorist attack in the United States is likely in the near future , with a record low of 40 ? percent of Americans approving of Obama s dealing with terrorism . Just 45 ? percent of Democrats said in that same poll they have only a fair or no amount of faith in their government to prevent terror attacks at home . The numbers speak to a broader disarray within the Democratic Party about the path forward after Paris : This week , 47 House Democrats rebuffed Obama and joined Republicans to vote for a bill that would severely limit the president s ability to place 10 , 000 Syrian refugees in the country next year . Republicans , who voters traditionally trust more to handle foreign policy , have an opening to show Americans they re the party with the right strategy to keep the United States safe .
