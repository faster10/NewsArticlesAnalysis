Another example is the problem of violence . When any act of violence , especially terrorism , is given a religious justification , it is necessary to distinguish whether the violence is inherent in the religion or ideology , or whether the religion is being distorted to justify the violence for political purposes . If the latter is the case , then it is the obligation of the larger community to condemn the use of religion to justify immoral or criminal acts . Thousands of Muslim institutions and leaders , the great majority of the world ' s billion or more Muslims , have unequivocally condemned the hateful and violent ideologies that kill innocents and violate the dignity of all humanity .
