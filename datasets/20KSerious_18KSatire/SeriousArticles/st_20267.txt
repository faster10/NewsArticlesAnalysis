Tonight in his address to the delegates in Charlotte and to viewers across America , Obama will have a chance to step up and truly become Bill Clinton ' s successor , rather than a supporting player living in his era , in his shadow . Clinton ' s speech was superb even served as it was without portion control . But it did not do what only Obama can do . It did not offer the current president ' s vision for the future . It did not offer new solutions to the new problems we face as a country . Clinton may have forcefully said we ' re better off now than we were four years ago , but Obama can and must say how we will be better off four years hence and how that will better position America for future growth beyond that .
