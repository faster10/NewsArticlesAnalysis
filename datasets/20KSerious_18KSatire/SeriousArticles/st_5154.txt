It is a great honor to be recognized by the Academy with a nomination for our short , Sanjay s Super Team . ? This is an incredibly personal , but also other worldly , story that was as much a labor of love for our crew as it was for myself . Making a film about my own childhood , and exploring the space that separates a young boy from his traditional immigrant father , meant that everyone really had to trust my vision , and the result is a truly beautiful film . So I share this honor with the crew , my true Super Team .
