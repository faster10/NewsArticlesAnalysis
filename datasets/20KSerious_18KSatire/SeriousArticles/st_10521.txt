If you re worried about the virus spreading and having to cancel a future trip , you may want to consider some types of travel insurance . Connie Miller , the sales and marketing director at Travel Leaders in Omaha , says that one of her pregnant clients purchased cancel for any reason travel insurance , which ( just as it sounds ) allows her to cancel her trip for any reason ( provided she does it within a certain window of time , usually ) . Though that type of policy is more expensive than trip cancellation insurance , it may be better for those concerned about the Zika virus , since trip cancellation insurance may not cover a CDC travel alert such as the one issued now .
