Martin : I thought it was going to be difficult . When I wrote " A Dog ' s Life , " which was the first dog story I wrote , I had to experiment for a long time . It was told from the point of view of Squirrel , a dog , and I had to do quite a bit of experimenting with her voice before I settled on it . Rose ' s voice seemed to come to me more naturally . I think already knowing what her obsessions were , not only homonyms but prime numbers and rules , helped because her interests crept into her voice and helped shape it . So it wasn ' t as challenging as I had thought it was going to be .
