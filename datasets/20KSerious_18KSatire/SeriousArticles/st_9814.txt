? The Chiefs allowed fewer than 100 rushing yards in 11 of 17 games this season , and I m not sure how much the Patriots are going to try to run given the hobbled state of their running game . The Chiefs stuffed 11 of the Texans 24 rush attempts for 2 yards or fewer , and if it s not defensive tackles Dontari Poe and Jaye Howard fighting through double teams and making stuffs at the line of scrimmage , it s inside linebackers Derrick Johnson and Josh Mauga swarming to the football and chasing ball carriers down sideline to sideline .
