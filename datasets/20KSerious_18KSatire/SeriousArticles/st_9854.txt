Asked if he has a sense that everything s coming together , Carroll said : " Yeah , I do feel like that . They feel like that , too . I think last week had something to do with that also . We know that we played really well in those couple of games we let get away from us against Cincinnati and Carolina . We knew that . We knew what happened , and unfortunately , they got away from us . Those are games that you look at the other way around those could have been dominant games for us , and we didn t get it done . It s there to be had . "
