You have to be sympathetic to the contrary perspective here , those aghast to seeing Curry ' s name this high . It all happened so fast . Curry wasn ' t even considered a star until 2013 , as he gained momentum over his fourth season in the league . He hadn ' t ever finished top five in MVP voting until the very season he won it , in 2015 . The NBA ' s GMs still couldn ' t fathom what they ' d just witnessed , and voted him fifth most likely to win the award going into this season . It seems they might have miscalculated , perhaps mistaking a new , enduring reality for a momentary fluke .
