This postseason , the Royals ' team strikeout rate of 16 . 04 percent ? 81 in 505 plate appearances , right in line with their 15 . 9 percent regular season mark ? is far and away the best in baseball . The Mets have struck out in 27 . 43 percent of their plate appearances . The league average in the playoffs is 24 . 34 percent , up from 20 . 4 percent in the regular season because the pitching in the playoffs is so much better . It ' s not a huge surprise , then , that Kansas City ' s offense ? one rooted in a decidedly small ball notion ? is far and away the best in October , too .
