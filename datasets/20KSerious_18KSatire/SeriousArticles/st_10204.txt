But for thousands of astrophysicists around the world , the German Roentgen satellite ( " ROSAT " ) was no mere rubbish it was an old and important friend . Launched in 1990 , a few months after the better known Hubble Space Telescope , ROSAT provided images of the sky in X rays ( very short wavelength light ) , as opposed to the red green blue light visible with Hubble , meaning it could see the most energetic phenomena in the Universe . Plus ROSAT had better image quality than any X ray satellite had before , an improvement comparable to the superiority of Hubble imaging compared to ground based telescopes .
