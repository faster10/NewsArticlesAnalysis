Common sense tells us , though , that the loss of Gordon ' s paycheck is relatively insignificant compared with the loss of Gordon himself . When Michelle tells her boys about their dad , she ' s not going to show them a pay stub . She ' ll tell them how much he loved them both , how funny he was , what a good golfer he was and how much others loved to be around him . One of the last things Gordon , a 1 handicap , got to do was to give Stafford , age 2 , his first golf lesson . It was , of course , the last golf lesson he will get from his father .
