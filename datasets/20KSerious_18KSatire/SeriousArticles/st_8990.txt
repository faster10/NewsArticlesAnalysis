If Donald Trump really skips the final GOP debate before Iowa which at this point seems likely then it may just be the latest in a series of shrewd moves the businessman has made in the lead up to the caucuses . There ' s a reason football teams don ' t like to throw the football with a lead late in the fourth quarter . You don ' t want to make a mistake and give your opponent a chance to make a play . And Trump is simply running down the clock by skipping tonight ' s debate . Sure , he will get knocked around plenty but probably not as much as he would if he showed up . And with the GOP race still tight in the middle of the pack ( especially in New Hampshire ) , there is a good chance the extra speaking time without Trump will be spent by candidates bashing rivals on stage with them . ( Cruz vs . Rubio is a good bet . ) Plus , we ' ve probably been talking about the real estate mogul more during the will he or won ' t he speculation . So do Iowans or New Hampshire voters care that Trump is skipping the final debate before the caucuses ? Well , if they haven ' t been dissuaded by anything Trump has said or done yet , it ' s hard to see how this would .
