This guy is a veteran , Linehan said . He s played . He can make that transformation because of that veteran ism to flip what they call protection he s been in a couple places now to what we do . I think that s the thing he is showing . He is really a strong kid . You can see the body strength in the run game . We ve had two practices with him out there . He carries his pads really well . What I have seen it s been 24 hours , two practices real impressed . I think he is going to be a really good addition for our team .
