At this very moment , a dozen boats in the town of Taiji , Japan , are heading out and rounding up hundreds of dolphins in a secluded cove . The fisherman will close off the cove with nets , and with the help of employees from various dolphinariums , they will try to find the next " Flipper " among their catch . The fishermen will snatch these beautiful creatures from their natural habitats , hoist them into nets , load them onto airplanes and drop them into a cement tank in the middle of Turkey , Korea or other nearby Asian countries .
