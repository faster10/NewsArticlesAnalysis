The United States did not vote for socialism . It could not do so , because neither party offers socialism . Both parties champion a free enterprise economy cushioned by a certain amount of social insurance . The Democrats ( mostly ) want more social insurance the Republicans want less . National politics is a contest to move the line of scrimmage , in a game where there ' s no such thing as a forward pass , only a straight charge ahead at the defensive line . To gain three yards is a big play .
