Yet there ' s another reason why GOP establishment types might be rooting for Trump over Cruz right now : If you don ' t stop Cruz in Iowa , it ' s going to be hard for the establishment to stop either of them . Think about it Cruz carries Iowa , and that could catapult him to second place in New Hampshire , while Trump would remain in the catbird ' s seat in New Hampshire . That scenario could freeze out the establishment candidates like Marco Rubio , Jeb Bush , Chris Christie , and John Kasich . But what if Trump beats Cruz in Iowa ? Well , there ' s more of an opening for a Rubio Bush Christie Kasich to finish second in New Hampshire , strengthening the establishment going into South Carolina and beyond . Of course , if Trump wins BOTH Iowa and New Hampshire , it could be game over for the GOP nomination . But on paper , there appears to be more of an opening for the establishment if Cruz DOESN ' T win in Iowa .
