It used to be that if you were a person living abroad and you wanted to see the U . S . , you had to first go to an American Embassy and get a visa . You would be interviewed by an embassy official who would ask about your background . Since the 1980s , residents of many countries no longer have to go through that process .

You ' ll need to answer a few questions on a form on the Internet and have a passport with a digital photograph .
