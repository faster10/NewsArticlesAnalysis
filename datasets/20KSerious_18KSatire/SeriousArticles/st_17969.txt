The second issue is , Taliban began as an Afghan phenomenon , became a regional phenomenon . Tehrik i Taliban of Pakistan launched a vicious attack on children in Peshawar to which very robustly , H . E . the Prime Minister , and the people and government of Pakistan responded . But , that very response has brought them on to our country . Until now , we have launched 40 operations by our special forces against them but the question that this raises is what is the nature of the Taliban and how do we deal it because that question needs exploration ? Can we have two standards , one standard , how do we differentiate between reconcilable and the irreconcilables ? What are the networks that enable these people , devoted to violence rather than political dialogue , to continue ? How do we coordinate regionally in order to deal with this phenomenon ? And , it s important , I think , in this regard to create a mechanism of verification , a mechanism of regional cooperation , in seeing how the networks of terror coordinate , who finances them , what is their linkage with the criminal economy , the drug economy particularly , but the rest of the criminal economy ? How is radicalism shaping and maligning our holy religion and our opportunities for global engagement and dialogue ?
