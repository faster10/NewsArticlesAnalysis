Zachary Quinto : Well , I ' ve been having a great time talking about all that stuff , too . No complaints ! But it ' s always good to promote other projects that I have going on . The great thing about this movie is that it really is a friends and family situation . We ' ve known Victor and Anna ( Martemucci , who cowrote the film with the Quinaz brothers ) for years . And to be able to give them this opportunity and to bring all the other collaborators that they work with on a regular basis into the equation was really gratifying for us . One of our main tenets is providing opportnities for people that we ' ve loved and have inspired us for a long time and Victor and Anna are certainly among them .
