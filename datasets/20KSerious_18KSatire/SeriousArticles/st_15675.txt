I ' m a big anti cheating guy , so if a woman hit on me while I had a girlfriend , I ' d be flattered . If she offered to go home with me or tried to kiss me or something like that , milk would shoot out of my nose and I ' d run for the hills . ( I have an odd fight or flight mechanism . ) Subtlety is your friend . We ' ll pick up on the signals . If a guy is interested , wait for him to honorably break up with his girlfriend before the two of you start dating . Frankly , this is just good manners .
