We are not , in other words , tilling a lot of new ground in Spectre . In fact , the screenplay is pretty consciously tilling old ground , with shout outs to all three of Craig ' s 007 movies , and also to those of his predecessors , including a compartment smashing fistfight on a train that echoes camera angles and even a couple of Sean Connery ' s punches from From Russia With Love . ( For more on the shout outs to earlier 007 exploits , check out my colleague Chris Klimek ' s ruminations . )
