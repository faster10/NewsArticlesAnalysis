Less than a month after French President Fran ois Hollande mused that sanctions on Russia should be lifted ( apparently reflecting the prevailing sentiment in much of the European Union ) , Russia has launched a new offensive through its proxies in Ukraine . Facing a full blown crisis , with the Russian economy estimated to be contracting by at least 5 this year , Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be unconcerned about further economic pressure and diplomatic isolation . Is he irrational ? As the only one making important decisions in Russia today , does Putin not care about the sanctions ? He is not and he does . His is a multiphased , well calibrated endgame to destabilize Ukraine and to weaken the sanctions at the same time .
