John Stamos visits "Full House" house, goes unnoticed
Visiting the "Full House" house and not noticing one of the show's stars? As Stephanie Tanner would say, "How rude!"John Stamos, who played Uncle Jesse, paid a visit recently to the San Francisco house where the hit sitcom was set -- and while he was there, he says, he went unrecognized.Stamos posted a photo to Instagram on Friday showing him in front of the home, dressed in all black down to the hat and sunglasses. A handful of fans are also in the shot, apparently paying him no mind."Boy, these youngsters have 0.0 idea what they're missing. #Fullhousehouse. #TURNAROUND," he captioned the picture.Boy, these youngsters have 0.0 idea what they're missing.  #Fullhousehouse.  #TURNAROUND.

Back in January, a number of them reunited (and sang the "Full House" theme song) at a birthday party for the show's creator, Jeff Franklin. Rumors have also swirled of a potential "Full House" reboot or revival. Last year, Stamos told CBS News, "We're working on something that's sort of reunion-like, not with the full cast... sort of a reunion type thing with the girls.""The legacy [of the show] is so important... I don't want anything to mess what we did up," he added at the time. "We'll only do it if it's something that will augment the show and maybe add a little more happiness to what people get out of it."
