" They ( Kansas City ) have the unique characteristic that they are aggressive , but they don ' t chase bad pitches and will take their walks .

This team is a year older , they ' ve been together like frat boys for 10 years and when you bring in Ben Zobrist and Kendrys Morales , who are switch hitters who annihilate great pitching , that ' s a hell of an addition .
