McAllister has apologized for the indiscretion , sort of , but said he has no plans to resign . In fact , he said , he ' ll run for re election next fall . That ' s not exactly an act of contrition he seems more sorry he was caught than for damaging the public trust . Though certainly it takes two to tango , as they say and we don ' t yet know details , including how the relationship started , or even if it has stopped it ' s clear McAllister has different rules for himself than for others . And that for a guy with scant political experience , he felt plenty comfortable with using his position ( and his office ) for personal gain .
