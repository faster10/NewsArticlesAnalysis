Planned Parenthood isn ' t making any money from the sale of fetal tissue , but other organizations certainly are . Many laboratories rely on middlemen who pay abortion providers small fees ? usually 100 or less ? for specimens , extract from the specimens whichever cells are in demand , and then deliver those cells to researchers . While the firms cannot legally profit from selling the tissue itself , they can charge whatever they like for processing and preparing it . A small vial of fetal liver cells , for example , can fetch more than 24 , 000 . The companies argue these prices merely reflect the cost of isolating the cells . " These are hard processes , expensive processes , " says Cate Dyer , founder of the for profit StemExpress . " Just to attempt to do some of these isolations can cost us thousands of dollars , and it may not even work . " But critics see the reimbursement policy as a gaping loophole ? one that could easily be closed . " What ' s going on now is probably legal , but Congress won ' t like it , " says Boston University bioethicist George Annas . " The law can easily be changed . "
