Google could , in fact , be working on a project using the advanced holographic technology developed by Magic Leap , a start up that the Mountain View giant supports and finances . Magic Leap has filed a patent application for a portable device ( a headset or glasses ) compatible with this kind of 3D imagery for games and professional applications . This could make Google a key competitor for Microsoft , which demoed its own Augmented Reality ( AR ) device HoloLens in 2015 , allowing wearers to interact with " holograms " placed in the real world view of the wearer . Microsoft ' s HoloLens will be available in the first half of 2016 for US 3 , 000 per headset , for developers looking to create games and applications that make use of the new technology .
