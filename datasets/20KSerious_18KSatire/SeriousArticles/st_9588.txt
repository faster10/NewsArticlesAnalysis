Planning is crucial . Before Congress , I tended to deal with things day by day . Now , time is precious . During our campaign I received some sage advice from Arizona Rep . Jeff Flake ' s wife , Cheryl . She recommended that when Jason is in Washington , I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own , such as errands , volunteering , time with friends , helping with homework , and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet and yes , I mastered this skill ! So , when Jason is home , we can use our time as a family working , reconnecting and having fun .
