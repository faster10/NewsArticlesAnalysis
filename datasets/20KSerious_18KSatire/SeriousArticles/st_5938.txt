If the infection is extensive , has already spread , or doesn ' t respond to the topical ointment , oral antibiotics are used for seven to10 days . Because of the recent increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria like methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , watch your child ' s symptoms carefully to make sure the condition improves after the first course of antibiotics . If it doesn ' t , tell your doctor quickly he ' ll need to prescribe an appropriate antibiotic if a culture indicates that the infection is due to MRSA .
