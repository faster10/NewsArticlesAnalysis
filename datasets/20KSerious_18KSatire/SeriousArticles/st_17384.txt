John Skrentny , who runs the Centre for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California , describes a recruitment phenomenon he calls racial realism . Employers match African American , Asian American and Latino candidates with markets or groups of the same race , on the basis that they will have a superior understanding . It happens across the public and private sector , in supermarkets and schools , in hospitals and telemarketing : This isn t positive discrimination , indeed it is its opposite . It is not intended to foster equality of opportunity but to maximise profit . If , in the pursuit of that , a tacit racial segregation results , so be it .
