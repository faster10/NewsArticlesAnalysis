Patterson : There ' s the next Alex Cross and then a couple of kids books , a follow up to " Middle School : The Worst Years of My Life . " I ' m trying to write books that are really funny but also have things for kids to sink their teeth into and think about . I ' m writing one now about middle school and summer camp , and then right around Christmas , I ' ll have a book about a middle school kid who desperately wants to be a stand up comedian , and he knows every joke in the history of mankind , so that ' s kind of a fun one .
