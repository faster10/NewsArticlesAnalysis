Europe s Schengen agreement , which allows passport free travel between signatory nations , is at risk of unraveling under the stress of mass migration ( itself fueled by terror in the Middle East ) and now the Paris attacks . Schengen , concluded in 1985 and effective since 1995 , is one of the proudest achievements of modern Europe ? more popular and more widely adopted than the euro . The ability to drive between countries without so much as tapping the brakes has promoted tourism , trade , and the free movement of labor . Italian companies do more business with the Swiss , because their trucks don t get stopped at the border . And Chinese tourists are more likely to visit Germany if they know they can swing through France and Spain as well without getting another visa . When two countries are in Schengen , trade between them increases an extra 0 . 1 percent each year , says Dane Davis , a commodity researcher who co wrote a paper on Schengen published last year in the World Economy , an academic journal .
