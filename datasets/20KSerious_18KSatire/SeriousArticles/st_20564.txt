Pros : How ' s this for an origin story ? Musk grew up in South Africa before leaving home at 17 , without his parents ' consent , rather than serve a compulsory stint in an army which , at the time , was enforcing the race based apartheid system . He ' d end up in the United States four years later although he ' d already sold his first software , a video game called Blastar , when he was 12 . Since then , all he ' s done is create publishing software Zip2 ( sold to AltaVista for 300 million ) , co found PayPal ( he owned 11 of its stock when eBay bought it for 1 . 5 billion ) and help create Tesla Motors , makers of the first commercial electric car . Oh , wait . . . he also runs SpaceX , a company working on space exploration . Director Jon Favreau says Musk was his inspiration for Robert Downey Jr . ' s Tony Stark character in the " Iron Man " movies .
