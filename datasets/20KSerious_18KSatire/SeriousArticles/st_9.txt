By refusing to accept the case for review , the justices let stand the conviction of Cedrick Alderman , a Washington state man who was stopped by police in 2005 on suspicion of selling cocaine . Officers then discovered he was wearing a bulletproof vest . That in itself did not violate state law , but because Alderman was an ex felon convicted of armed robbery in 1999 and the vest was manufactured in California , he was convicted under federal law . He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison .
