Since 2004 , the trend has gone away from hiring former NBA players to run teams . Only four of the past 24 head of basketball operations general manager hires have been former players : Phil Jackson with the Knicks , Vlade Divac with the Kings , Doc Rivers with the Clippers and Larry Bird with the Pacers . Five players turned executives were hired prior to 2004 : Pat Riley with the Heat , Mitch Kupchak with the Lakers , Ernie Grunfeld with the Wizards , Danny Ainge with the Celtics and John Paxson with the Bulls . Of the nine total , only Rivers is African American . So if there wasn ' t a significant percentage of African Americans even when players made up a greater portion of the hiring pool , what ' s going to happen now that the trend is toward candidates with MBAs and law degrees instead of player pedigree ?
