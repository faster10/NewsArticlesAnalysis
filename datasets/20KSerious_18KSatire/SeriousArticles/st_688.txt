" Al Qaeda had declared war , in fact , on the Pakistani government , have threatened and continues to threaten to try to get their hands on nuclear material in that country . . . . So they obviously have a lot at stake in this fight . So we ' re going to continue to work with them and continue to try to partner with them against al Qaeda , because we recognize that it ' s not only in our interests , but in their interests . "
