But what exactly have they got ? Sure , some of Trump s positions are not conservative . But this frame assumes that conservatism is a coherent political philosophy . And in today s Republican Party , that is not the case . Instead , conservatism is a mishmash of contradictory positions that can mostly be summed up as If Obama ( or any other Democrat ) is for it , we re against it ! Mair might have some issues she can talk about with regard to their relation to traditional conservative thought ? Trump s position on eminent domain , for example ? but the nuances of that debate are going to be lost to the frothing , inchoate rage cases of the Republican base who oppose any argument that sounds vaguely intellectual or acceptable to anyone connected to Washington , D . C . You know , the people who keep giving us GOP Congresses in election after election after election .
