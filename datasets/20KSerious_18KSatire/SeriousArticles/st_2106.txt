But yesterday , Kanye West ( who doesn ' t tweet often ) went full Call of Duty on his timeline in a fiery dispute with rapper Wiz Khalifa . Wiz commented on the ownership of the term " wavy " ( which can be seen as accusing Kanye , who changed his upcoming album title from " Swish " to " Waves " , of stealing the term from rapper Max B ) . Khalifa then tweeted " hit this KK and become yourself " , which Kanye took as the initials of his wife , Kim Kardashian . Wiz responded that KK was " marijuana " , not Mrs West , but Kanye was not buying it ( you can see the full exchange here )
