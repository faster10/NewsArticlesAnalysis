The 2007 version of Marques Colston returned with eight grabs for 114 yards and a touchdown . Both Willie Snead and Brandin Cooks had two touchdown catches each , and Mark Ingram had 80 rushing yards in the offensive assault . Once again , the Giants dormant pass rush yielded very little in terms of quarterback pressure , and they had zero sacks on the afternoon . In an afternoon full of blown coverage and missed assignments , only Dominique Rodgers Cromartie looked the part of an NFL defender , forcing the Snead fumble and intercepting Brees deep in Giants territory . Overall , the front four has no bite and the linebackers struggle mightily in pass defense , just ask Ben Watson . The safety play continues to be inconsistent at best with rookie Landon Collins and Brandon Meriweather .
