You can never prepare for an incident like this from somebody that just goes off . How they pick a destination you don ' t know . This person drove all the way from Belton , which is about 16 miles to our east . He wasn ' t a Killeen resident , so how he picked Luby ' s you don ' t know . He actually drove through the front window and the people that were in the restaurant thought maybe he had an accident where you try to apply the brakes and hit the gas pedal . . . . . When he came out shooting , the people were kind of trapped .
