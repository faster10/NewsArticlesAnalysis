This one is delicious Rick Perry vs . George H . W . Bush . I ' m sorry , but Perry is Fred Thompson on steroids . To be clear , Thompson was actually a pretty damn good lawyer who has some intellectual heft to him although he hid it rather well in his 2008 race . On the contrary , Perry literally can ' t string two sentences together . His performance before the Values Voters Summit was universally panned . Perry couldn ' t give a good speech with all the time in the world to prepare . We are now told the problem is that he doesn ' t get enough sleep . Break out the Lunesta Rick Perry is coming storming back ! Note to the Perry campaign : You are supposed to give him the Lunesta after the debate , not before . I know Perry speaks some Spanish but I don ' t believe " debate " translates to " siesta . " Bush was a war hero , a successful entrepreneur , director of the Central Intelligence Agency , ambassador to the United Nations , U . S . envoy to China , and chairman of the Republican National Committee . George H . W . Bush went on to serve as vice president and president of the United States . Sorry , Rick , I don ' t see you filling those shoes anytime soon .
