AIR SHOW : The Lions are a one dimensional team on offense , leaning heavily on passing because they re the worst rushing team in the NFL . Matthew Stafford might like what he sees when he drops back because the Raiders rank 31st against the pass . Oakland , meanwhile , also seems set up for success through the air with Derek Carr throwing to rookie receiver Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree . The Lions have put two starting cornerbacks on injured reserve the past two weeks , Rashean Mathis and Josh Wilson , and signed a player , Bill Bentley , who was out of work since they cut him in June .
