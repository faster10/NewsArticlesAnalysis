As a historian , I can t help also reminding folks of the Democratic primary in 1944 , when party bosses picked Harry Truman over the widely popular , desegregationist , left leaning Henry Wallace .

Wallace was part of the radical wing of the New Dealers , and his most famous speech rejected the idea of an American Century and advocated the Century of the Common Man . In retrospect , activists would smartly place their efforts in supporting Henry Wallace for a few months on the campaign trail .
