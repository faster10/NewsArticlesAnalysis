Although I will not be on the ballot in 2013 , we will continue our campaign for real change in Iran under the banner of " The Campaign for a Better Iran . " I will also look for future opportunities to run again . We believe our platform offers the safest path to an improved Iran and deserves to be supported . Other options , including another revolution , more sanctions , and war are unacceptable . Meanwhile , we hope to convince the country ' s next president to apply our realistic and pragmatic plan for national reconciliation , resolution of conflict with the U . S . , and economic growth .
