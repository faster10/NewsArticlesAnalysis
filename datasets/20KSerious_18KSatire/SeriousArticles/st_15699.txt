Mathieu Kassovitz : It ' s very inspirational to have seen all these movies that made French movie history and film history , period , and being able to go to the same places and see where all these pre war movies were made . Paris is still the same as it was , so the spirit is the same also and it ' s kind of elevating for us directors to be in a town with a city soul , a lot of soul . So it gives you a lot of opportunities and ways of not just showing a city , but the spirit of that city so that ' s what we keep on doing today .
