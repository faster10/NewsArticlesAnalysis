Leaning on a quote from Robert F . Kennedy , who was attorney general at the time of the protests and arrests , Echols said , " Few of us will have the greatness to be in history , as the Friendship Nine have done , but each of us can work to change a small portion of events within our own actions and , by example , touch the lives of others so that in the total of all of those acts , it will be confirmed and recorded that justice is for all people , and that injustice must not be tolerated in any place at any time . "
