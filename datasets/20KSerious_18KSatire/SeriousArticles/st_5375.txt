But I have to do a lot of things most kids don ' t do , like having meltdowns and taking medications . Everything else is easy for me , except being quiet . I can ' t play hide and seek . When I try to trick people or fake sleep , I have to turn the other way so people can ' t see my facial expressions , because my face tics when I try to keep my eyes closed . I can only win if I ' m at a high point at least 20 feet away , when I ' m not within hearing distance . This one time , I gave myself up , because I was on top of my mom ' s shelf and somebody was walking past . They were about to walk right by and I let out a little squeak and they got me ! I was so frustrated .
