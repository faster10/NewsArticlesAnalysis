One of my favorite " old skool " hip hop records is " I Know You Got Soul " by Eric B . and Rakim , and it ' s got a classic line , " It ' s not where you ' re from , it ' s where you ' re at " which always applies in hip hop . I was just a good DJ who got better because of an enthusiasm for music and playing out . Once people became aware of me outside that more insular hip hop scene they were kind of like " Oh , how did he get here ? Must be because of his parents . " And they have to find something to say and that was one of the criticisms they chose .
