Is it Alex Smith s turn in 2015 to join that list ? The Chiefs haven t won a playoff game since Montana was their QB back in the 1993 playoffs , and if Kansas City is to break that seven game , postseason losing streak , Smith will have to keep playing at the top level he s shown the league during January play in 2011 and 2013 . Smith posted a career best QB rating ( 95 . 4 ) over a 16 game season this year with the Chiefs , so there s no reason to think he cannot continue his postseason success against the Houston Texans on the road this Saturday .
