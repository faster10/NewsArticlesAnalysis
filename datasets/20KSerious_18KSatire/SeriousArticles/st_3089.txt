I have argued for years that sovereign immunity makes the most sense when government is providing its core services , particularly services that the market could not easily supply . Elsewhere , sovereign immunity can cause problems , due to its hidden costs . First , because government agencies need not buy insurance , they earn a subsidy that may not be warranted . Second , immunity from suit creates precisely the moral hazard problem that private sector tort liability is meant to ameliorate .
