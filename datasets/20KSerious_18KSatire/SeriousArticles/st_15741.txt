Jacksonville at Baltimore : The Jaguars are in the midst of another frustrating losing season , but there have been three major bright spots . Blake Bortles looks the part ( at least some weeks ) and starting wideouts Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson are proving to be the most dynamic pair of guys named Allen in the league ( and also a pretty good 1 2 punch of second year wideouts ) . Jags fans have a lot to be encouraged by ( I swear ) , but I don ' t see them waltzing into Baltimore and winning on Sunday .
