NFL owners meet in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday with the hope they will end our national nightmare and put at least one team , and probably two , back in Los Angeles . Seriously , nobody has suffered since the Rams and Raiders left after the 1994 season . NFL revenues have climbed to 10 billion per year , ratings have never been higher and there hasn t been one protest from Los Angeles fans or politicians in 20 years to bring the NFL back . But the league wants to start cashing paychecks again in the country s second largest market and the Rams , Chargers and Raiders all want to relocate to Hollywood , a place they all once called home . Rams owner Stan Kroenke used the scorched earth approach in his relocation application to get out of St . Louis . He not only raved about his proposed stadium in Inglewood , but tore apart St . Louis effort to get the Rams to stay with a 1 . 1 billion river front stadium . Any NFL Club that signs on to this proposal in St . Louis will be well on the road to financial ruin , and the League will be harmed , the Rams application for relocations said . It also said , Compared to all other U . S . cities , St . Louis is struggling . The Chargers and Raiders are joined in a project in Carson , but I think the end result is the Rams and Chargers will become partners in Kroenke s deal in Inglewood . The plan is for the winners of the LA Derby to play in the Los Angeles Coliseum starting in the 2016 season until the new place is ready .
