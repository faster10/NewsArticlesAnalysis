Piccard : The first indications from the engineers are that everything went perfectly well the climb performances were even higher than expected ! What is the next stage ? The objective of this first prototype is to demonstrate by this summer , the feasibility of a night flight propelled only by solar energy . Before that , we ' ll do several additional test flights , each lasting a bit longer , until we complete the first complete day night day flight cycle . Then with the experience of this first aircraft we will start the design of a second airplane whose objectives will be to cross the Atlantic and then by 2013 , to fly around the world in five legs , each lasting five days .
