The fact is , a third party candidate ? no matter how many billions they have ? is a virtual impossibility , thanks to electoral politics and the 12th Amendment . Candidates need to win a majority of electoral votes allocated to the states ( that is , not a plurality ) . An election with anything less isn t decided by the person with the most votes it gets thrown to the House of Representatives , where an independent candidate will almost certainly come in last place as Democrats and Republicans vote for their own candidate .
