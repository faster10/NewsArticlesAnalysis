Chavez earned many titles in his life , but " champion of immigrants " was not one of them . He was primarily a labor leader who was concerned about illegal immigrants undercutting union members , either by accepting lower wages or crossing picket lines . He never pretended to be anything else , and he resisted attempts by others to widen his agenda . When he pulled workers out of the field during a strike , the last thing he wanted was to see a crew of illegal immigrant workers take away his leverage .
