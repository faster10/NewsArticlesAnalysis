It ' s hard to throw five touchdown passes and get overshadowed , but that ' s what happened to Jameis Winston . Winston had a big game ( 246 yards , 5 TDs ) , but Doug Martin ' s was bigger . The Dougginator ran for 235 yards against Philadelphia , the second highest total in franchise history . The only bad news for Martin is that he didn ' t get in the end zone . Martin and Barry Sanders are the only two players in NFL history to rush for at least 230 yards , but not score a TD . The Buccaneers 521 total yards was a franchise record .
