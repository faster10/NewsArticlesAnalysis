Most murders involve young men , often as both shooter and victim , as in the Trayvon Martin case . Young men , of course , often get in conflicts where they are threatening one another : that is , where both of them are trying to scare the other with " imminent great bodily harm . " Florida ' s law may allow one of those chest bumping young men , without consequence , to end the mutual dispute by shooting the other dead on the street . When it is over , the only witness may be the shooter , and his version of events will presumptively control . There is no morality in this rule .
