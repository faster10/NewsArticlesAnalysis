Seven years ago , when Clinton s own campaign was accused of prejudice , her husband was outraged . She did not play the race card , but they did , Bill Clinton said of the Obama campaign . The former president went on : This is almost like , once you accuse somebody of racism or bigotry or something , the facts become irrelevant . Three months later , Mr Clinton was still fuming . They played the race card on me , and we now know from memos from the campaign and everything that they planned to do it all along , he protested . This was used out of context and twisted for political purposes by the Obama campaign to try to breed resentment elsewhere . You really got to go some to try to portray me as a racist .
