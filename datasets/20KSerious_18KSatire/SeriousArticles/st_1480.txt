Horowitz , Nov . 15 : One of the more obscure yet destructive provisions of the Gang of 8 bill I wrote about in 2013 was section 3405 ( page 693 ) , which created an entire new pipeline for refugees . This bill would have concocted an unconditional right to immediate legal permanent resident status for any person in the world who declares himself stateless . Had the bill passed in 2013 , it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless . Most of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians , Somalis , Palestinians , and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma .
