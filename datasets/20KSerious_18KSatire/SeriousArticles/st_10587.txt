This isn ' t an argument for some other performer to take over the tribute . None of the other scheduled Grammy performers ? Adele , Kendrick Lamar , the Weeknd , Carrie Underwood , Sam Hunt ? would make a better solo Bowie tribute , because Bowie s legend is greater than the sum of its parts . A few covers of his songs , which must either try to imitate or transform his talents , will never feel sufficient . So how to enact a proper posthumous homage ? David Bowie lived a dozen lives in his career . Just show them to us in a humble , respectful montage .
