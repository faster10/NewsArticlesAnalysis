Whether or not Trump accepts his offer , Tawil believes Trump s new ad is just one more way he is undercutting possible support from Iowa s citizens . Tawil says that he , like most of his community , is a registered Republican , and GOP anti Muslim rhetoric only makes him feel more trapped . I cannot deny that the comments of Mr Donald Trump and Dr Ben Carson have been very hurtful and very damaging , he says , saying he will have to pray to discern which candidates are close to God s will . We are shaken . Right now I am sure I will not vote for him , that is 100 , but as a religious leader I cannot tell people what to do .
