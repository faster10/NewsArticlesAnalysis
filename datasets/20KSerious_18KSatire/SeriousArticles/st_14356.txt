TS : NAU is a company that I founded with Michael and Jean Lucien , friends from the architect firm I worked at . I guess we all wanted to collaborate , and me being interested in drifting back from the world of architecture to the world of film , I guess Michael and Jean Lucien had something to offer . They usually take over the architectural side of things and I can be more free and visionary . I push them further with the kind of ideas I come up with and at the same time they make my ideas real .
