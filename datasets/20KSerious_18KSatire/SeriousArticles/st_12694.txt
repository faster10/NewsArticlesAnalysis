And , as Quartz ' s Tim Fernholz wrote Tuesday , this is where Sanders ' promise to start smashing heads on Wall Street rings a bit hollow . The Fed ' s board of governors has seven seats , and most of its members are appointed to 14 year terms , with the exception of the chairman and vice chairman , who sit for four . That makes it tricky to stack the Fed with sympathetic regulators eager to chop banks down to size . Meanwhile , the FSOC is a 10 member board of regulators , including everyone from the Fed chairman to the Treasury secretary to the chairman of the National Credit Union Administration . While these are all presidential appointees , Sanders would have to get his picks through Congress , which would be far harder if business minded Democrats and Republicans suspect that these men and women will start wreaking havoc on their favorite donors .
