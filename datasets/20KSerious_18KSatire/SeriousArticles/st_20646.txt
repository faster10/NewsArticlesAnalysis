Last week , Utah Jazz head coach Quin Snyder was asked a question about stalwart defensive center Rudy Gobert , who d yet to impress to that point of the preseason . Snyder s answer to the question didn t have all that much to do with Gobert specifically , but rather the general vibe around what many view as an ascendant team . The length and tone of Snyder s response ( embedded below thanks to transcribing from Jody Genessy of the Deseret News ) makes you think he d been sitting on this issue for a while in hopes he d eventually get a chance to address it at length . ?
