The problem is that when the underpinning of growth is not the monetary policy spurring domestic investment but a depreciating exchange rate taking demand from other countries , it creates an unsafe environment . I do some unconventional monetary policy , capital flows out of my country , capital flows into my neighbouring country , that country s exchange rate appreciates , I get growth for a while . But as capital flows into that country , its real estate prices increase , people demand too much , its debt levels increase , that country s economy becomes fragile , said Rajan .
