I will not deny that terrorism is a real threat , it definitely is . However , it is extremely incorrect to associate the words " Muslim " and " terrorist " when literally all the facts implore you to do otherwise . The only way that we as Americans can defeat terrorism at home and across the world is by accurately targeting its root causes . There have been 355 mass shootings in the United States this year and falsely blaming Muslims for the San Bernardino shooting will do absolutely nothing to address this serious problem . It is time that we begin addressing terrorism on an educated and factual level .
