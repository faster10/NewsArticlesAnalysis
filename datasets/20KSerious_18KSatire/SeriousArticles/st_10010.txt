Zakaria : It ' s really quite brave of the Conservatives to take on the fiscal problem but there is definitely a danger that they are doing it too soon and will put the economy into a lower growth mode . This is something that you have to remember for the United States as well . If you have lower growth , you also have a worse deficit because the biggest contributor to deficits is a decline in tax revenue . So the slower the economy grows , the fewer people who are employed , the lower the taxes going to the government treasury , the bigger and bigger the deficit becomes .
