At first that statement during her eulogy seemed really strange . What exactly is she " doing " for him ? But look at the context . She called him a " wonderful father " and is clearly standing by him . She stood up there in front of 250 people with her son in a tiny casket and had the strength to give a eulogy on behalf of both of them . She talked about how much she loved Cooper , about God , about Cooper being in " the most peaceful , wonderful place there is " and about how she was relying on her faith to give her strength .
