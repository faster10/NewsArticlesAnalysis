Yeah , over the course of the season we ' re definitely gonna learn a lot more about the Alexandrians and get to know them . Ultimately some of them are gonna rise to the occasion and become part of the core team , and others won ' t , and like Sturgess and David and Annie will succumb to the ways of the world . Laughs . To some degree , the way our gang has survived is just by doing what needs to be done , and struggling with it emotionally and intellectually , but at the end of the day , they do exactly what needs to get done , and I feel like the Alexandrians haven ' t been faced with that , and they ' re going to be because the world ' s not gonna let them do anything else .
