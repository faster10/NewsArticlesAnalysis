Federer has looked in sublime form through four rounds , dropping just one set ( vs . Grigor Dimitrov ) en route to his 11th Australian Open quarterfinal in 17 appearances . The good news for Federer is that he s never been stopped in the round of eight at Melbourne Park , but the bad news is that Berdych has beaten him at a major ? twice ? most recently at the 2012 U . S . Open . Federer has won four in a row ( including eight straight sets won ) , and hasn t suffered a defeat at the hands of the 30 year old Czech since early 2013 .
