Because of the formal rules that unions fight for in labor contracts , district leaders can almost never get bad teachers out of the classroom . Nor can they allocate good teachers to the schools and classrooms where they can do the greatest good for kids . Add to this that the evaluation process is a full blown charade , and 99 of all teachers , including the very worst teachers , are regularly given satisfactory evaluations . Also , teachers are paid based on their seniority and formal credits , without any regard for whether their students are learning anything .
