Grievous labor rights problems at Apple ' s supplier factories have been known for years , including the spate of worker suicides in 2010 at the giant plant in Shenzhen , China , known as " Ipod City . " At this factory owned , like the Chengdu plant , by Apple ' s biggest supplier , Foxconn more than a dozen workers took their own lives by throwing themselves from the roof of the factory ' s overcrowded dormitories , in apparent protest of the brutal treatment facing workers at the facility . ( Foxconn reportedly responded by putting up nets outside the dorms and making workers sign pledges not to kill themselves . )
