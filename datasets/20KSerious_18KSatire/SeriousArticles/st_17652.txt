Activists and community members are protesting in Chicago because it took the city more than a year to charge the officer who shot Laquan McDonald . Did you see that video ? It ' s a no brainer . They ' re protesting because the city tried to suppress the video and made no public response to this shooting for over a year . It doesn ' t matter who else was killed in Chicago in the past year . This was a shooting of a teenager by a police officer which makes it different . Remember when we thought Lt . Joseph Gliniewicz was shot by three men ? That was different , too . It ' s always different when it involves a police officer .
