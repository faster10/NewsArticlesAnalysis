Hart : I have like five movies coming out . Everything will be out in 2014 and 2015 . I think I ' m getting the opportunity to play the kind of character I ' m interested in now . The movie " Ride Along , " starring Ice Cube and myself , is an action comedy and I ' m doing everything I ever wanted to do in the film . I also have " About Last Night , " which is a remake of the original , starring Michael Ealy , Joy Bryant , Regina Hall and myself , and " Grudge Match , " which stars Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro . I ' m about to do one with Will Ferrell and I ' m about to do one with Seth Rogan . I ' m sure I ' m forgetting one .
