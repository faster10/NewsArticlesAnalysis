But this season is not that . This Broncos team is not that . This is Manning in winter , his fluttering passes no longer pinpoint , his body breaking down . He missed six games this season with a foot injury and backed up Brock Osweiler for another game . Never has he averaged fewer yards per game than this season ' s 224 . 9 . Not since he was a rookie has he averaged so few yards per pass ( 6 . 8 ) or thrown more interceptions than touchdowns . His 17 interceptions were the third highest total of his career , and he played in only 10 games .
