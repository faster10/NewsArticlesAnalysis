Washington has developed a de facto policy of ignoring North Korea , especially after talks to disarm that nation failed during the Bush administration . In 2010 , after North Korea sank a South Korean Navy ship , President Barack Obama said Pyongyang must be " held to account . " In 2013 , after North Korea ' s third nuclear test , President Obama vowed " swift and credible " action . But aside from the umpteenth condemnation by the U . N . Security Council to which North Korea is indifferent the world mostly goes back to ignoring Pyongyang after headlines change .
