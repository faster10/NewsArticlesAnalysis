I think rape and sexual assault allegations should be treated like allegations of mugging or burglary ? which is to say , investigated promptly and thoroughly , on the assumption that the person reporting a crime is telling the truth , Kate Harding , the author of 2015 s ? must read examination of rape culture , Asking For It , ? told me over email . But that s often not how it works ? so many people , including many in the justice system , presume that anyone reporting a rape is just as likely to be lying as not . When feminists affirm that we believe victims , we re saying there s absolutely no good reason to presume that when someone reports sexual violence , there s a 50 50 chance they re lying .
