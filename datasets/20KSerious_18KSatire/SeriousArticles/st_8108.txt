Vanessa : When I heard it loud and clear was when I was on location shooting a show called " Who Do You Think You Are . " I was on the phone with my 11 year old daughter . She started with violin , played piano and percussion , then she wanted to switch to the trumpet , and then wanted to drop it altogether . I remember saying , " We don ' t drop our instruments in this family . Everyone takes an instrument until they graduate , and that ' s what we do as a family , so you ' ve got to figure out if it ' s violin or trumpet or something else . And I don ' t ever want to hear the music teacher telling me you ' re not showing up again . " And that ' s when I knew , I am the same parent , I have heard this before .
