Now , I want to be absolutely clear at the start and I ' ve said this over and over again , this also becomes routine , there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do I believe in the Second Amendment . It ' s there written on the paper . It guarantees a right to bear arms . No matter how many times people try to twist my words around I taught constitutional law , I know a little about this ( applause ) I get it . But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment .
