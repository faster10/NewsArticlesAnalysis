Mohamed El Gindy , a successful businessman who opposes Morsy and spent much of December camping in Tahrir with the young revolutionaries , has experienced this division within families firsthand . A relative who had joined the Salafis informed him that the extreme Islamist group had put El Gindy at No . 5 on its " hit list , " which is widely believed by Egyptians to exist . The relative was unapologetic until El Gindy told him that he might as well put El Gindy ' s mother on the list , too , since the octogenarian also had joined the street protests .
