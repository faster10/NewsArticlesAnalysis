Near the end of the session , he had a chance to show his softer side when he was asked by an 11 year old girl how he would improve education . He stressed the need for parental involvement and a greater incorporation of technology : Every student should have an IPad . He would eliminate tenure for public school teachers in grade K 12 ? No one ever got fired for their views on algebra ! ? and work to get rid of underperforming teachers . Here he blamed teachers unions for blocking educational reform . He finished by telling the girl how important it was for her to do her best , even on days when she might not feel like doing her homework , noting that I have those days too !
