Senator Rand Paul , who had a pretty good night , jumped in on the immigration discussion . " I was there and I saw the debate . I saw Ted Cruz say , ' we ' ll take citizenship off the table , and then the bill will pass , and I ' m for the bill . ' " he asserted . " The bill would involve legalization . He can ' t have it both ways . But what is particularly insulting , though , is that he is the king of saying , ' you ' re for amnesty . ' Everybody ' s for amnesty except for Ted Cruz . " This set up Rubio ' s best line of the night . " This is the lie that Ted ' s campaign is built on , and Rand touched upon it that he ' s the most conservative guy , and everyone else is a you know , everyone else is a rhino . " Rubio said . " The truth is , Ted , throughout this campaign , you ' ve been willing to say or do anything in order to get votes . "
