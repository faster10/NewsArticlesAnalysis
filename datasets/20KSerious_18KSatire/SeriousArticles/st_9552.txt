Obviously , A Good Day to Die Hard has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops , though , and it shouldn ' t be written off as a misfire . The film ' s 7 , 036 per theater average from 3 , 553 theaters was strong , and with a " B " CinemaScore grade , it may benefit from word of mouth in the weeks to come . Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend , and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard ' s 134 . 5 million finish , but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard ' s strong international performance so far . The film earned a tremendous 61 . 5 million overseas this weekend , bringing its international haul to 80 . 1 million and its worldwide cume to 113 . 4 million . Those overseas results may keep John McClane Yippee Ki Yaying for years to come .
