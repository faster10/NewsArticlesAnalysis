If that is not enough , in Europe , the far right is gaining ground in countries like Poland in the east and France in the west . If Mr Trump s rhetoric is anything to go by , things seem to be heading in a direction where Muslims in the west are all set to be in the 21st century where Jews were in the early 20th century : segregated , singled out and persecuted . There are voices of moderation within the west that are trying to fight this xenophobia . President Obama has refuted Mr Trump categorically while , cautiously and indirectly , urging Muslims to do more to improve their standing in western perception . Prominent Republican leader and speaker of the house , Paul Ryan , made it an exception to condemn Mr Trump s assertions . In France , President Hollande is determined to see through French commitment to accommodate the agreed quota of Syrian refugees despite strong opposition from Jean Marie Le Pen s National Front and other rightwing elements . Western leaders on the right , centre and left have been unanimous in opposing Mr Trump on this mad assertion . The issue , however , remains in balance in the west owing to the sensitive nature of the issue and the ever looming threat of Islamist terrorism inciting fear among the western public . In this , one can just hope that the voices of moderation in the west succeed in blocking the eminence of a situation similar to the precursor of horrible anti Semitic persecution in the last century for Muslims in the west .
