If Cruz has lost control of the expectations game , Rubio s campaign has played it masterfully . The Florida senator has seen his numbers tick up in internal polling for much of the week leading up to the caucuses ( although Thursday s debate may have slowed his momentum ) , but his campaign continues to dismiss talk of a second place finish even though , should Trump or Cruz underperform , it remains an outside possibility . Saturday s DMR poll , which showed Rubio flat at 15 percent , undercut the notion that the senator has momentum in the race s closing days ? but it also keeps expectations on the low side , making a finish closer to the 20 percent mark likely to seem more impressive even if Rubio remains off the pace of Trump and Cruz .
