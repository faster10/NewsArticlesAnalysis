MR : I definitely didn ' t make Amy a star . I helped her find a great sound that really fitted well with what she wanted to do . In her songs there ' s a lot of heartache and remorse and regret and fire that was in a lot of music , jazz and soul of the ' 50s and ' 60s . And it was also that we gave it a modern twist . . . I added drums from hip hop I wanted to make a modern soul record that if RZA from Wu Tang heard he would ' ve wanted to sample it . So if anything , I think Amy is more responsible for me being where I am than maybe the other way around .
