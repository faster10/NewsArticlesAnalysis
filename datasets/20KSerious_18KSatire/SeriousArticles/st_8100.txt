I think the problem is Trump his spirit and psyche , not his English language aptitude . Here ' s an illustration . When I taught Middle School and High School English I used to use a fast trick to ascertain where a student ' s education had stopped . I ' d give the English student in question a math problem . I had taught 6th grade math . I knew there was a good chance a 10th grader who couldn ' t do a 5th grade math had stopped learning before or shortly after 5th grade . Trump is probably good at math . But his use of language strikes me as indicative of some kind of delayed development .
