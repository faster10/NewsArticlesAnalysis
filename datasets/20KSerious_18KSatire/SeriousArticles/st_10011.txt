Palin has a long track record of endorsing in Republican primaries . In 2012 , her support proved crucial for Ted Cruz in a surprise victory in his Senate primary . Cruz later said her endorsement had been a game changer and was key to his victory . Palin previously helped a number of longshot Republican candidates win Senate primaries in 2010 . Her endorsement of attorney Joe Miller in the 2010 GOP primary for Senate in her native Alaska helped Miller topple incumbent Lisa Murkowski in that race . ( However , Murkowski eventually won re election as a write in candidate in the general election . )
