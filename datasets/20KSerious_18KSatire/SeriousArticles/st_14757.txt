Fantasies never fail to succeed . Superman , Spiderman , Batman and Star Wars , no matter which sequel it is , still capture the imagination of audiences across countries , across cultures , across age groups and across continents . They touch the basic human instinct to supersede human boundaries and control and subjugate many forces in the world . That instinct in real life is best seen in politics where politicians act as supermen and try to fight star wars with other countries to become the super power controlling the planet . The US has coined these fantasies but has also envisioned itself as the super power of the world by claiming to suppress the evil forces trying to destroy the universe . Since the definition of evil forces is highly tilted towards the stereotyped figure of a Muslim state with rebels turning into terrorists trying to fight for their own definition of religion , the last two decades have seen wars in South Asia , i . e . Afghanistan and Iraq , spilling over in the region with disastrous effect . Somehow , without peace being restored and without a war being won , the US does turn out to be the victor and retain its super power status .
