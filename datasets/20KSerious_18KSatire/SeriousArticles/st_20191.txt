For instance , a 2010 study published in Psychological Science found that people of higher socioeconomic status were worse at reading other people ' s emotions , a skill known as " empathic accuracy , " a basic part of empathy . In a follow up experiment , the researchers including Dacher Keltner , my colleague at UC Berkeley ' s Greater Good Science Center made people feel higher or lower on the social ladder . Regardless of their actual socioeconomic status , people temporarily made to feel upper class had a harder time reading other people ' s emotions people made to feel lower class showed better empathy .
