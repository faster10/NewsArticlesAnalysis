Thus , I am deeply discouraged and disappointed by our state governor s decision to reject refugees who are just as much victims of terrorism . It does not reflect our American values for embracing diversity and supporting those in need . This is especially problematic for Massachusetts , a state founded for freedom from religious oppression . I know we are better than the actions we are presently pursuing based on fear . To succumb to that fear is to react as terrorists want us to to move past it delegitimizes their ideology , one purporting Islam as inherently incompatible with the West .
