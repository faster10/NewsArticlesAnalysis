This could be one of the uglier games of the week , thanks primarily to the Rams . They can t do anything through the air , but the defense should be able to have its way with Matthew Stafford and the Lions . Gurley s learning how hard it is to run effectively when you don t get any help from the passing game , but he has also seen the Cardinals and Bengals the last two weeks . The Lions will be a welcome sight . Johnson has now gone six straight games without reaching the 100 yard mark . It ll be hard for him to break that streak against a Rams defense that is sixth in pass DVOA and has allowed the fourth fewest points to receivers .
