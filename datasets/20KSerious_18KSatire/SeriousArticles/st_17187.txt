I think analytics play a tremendous role , but you have to take a look at them with wisdom and allow them to tell part of the story . Then the advantage of also watching these games . I don t look at any one thing , any one statistic or number to tell a story on a specific team , but I certainly think that it does . The first thing , if you had to twist my arm , I would look at the defensive numbers of a particular team , and I think that tells the real story on how much of a legitimate threat , how much of a legitimate chance they have at winning it all or being a great team .
