As so many people rejoice , I have to admit to some pangs of sadness as I watch the news of the recovery of Berry , DeJesus and Knight . I know there are so many families , like my own , who fear that they will never see their loved ones again . We think of the joy that DeJesus and Knight ' s families must feel . We watch as Berry ' s relatives exult at her return : " I ' m excited to see her , " said her cousin . " I ' m excited to hold her , excited to squeeze her , to tell her how much I love her and miss her " and know that we may never get to say those words .
