Willimon : That ' s an interesting question . I don ' t think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history . What the media does is respond to narratives that are already coursing through the nation ' s system . Conflict always makes for a good story , and stories that interest people will always rise to the top of the headlines . But I just see that as a function of the media doing what it has always done since the first leaflet was printed trying to find its audience and keep them engaged .
