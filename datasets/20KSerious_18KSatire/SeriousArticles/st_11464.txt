When it comes to climate change , you would be hard pressed to find a leading Republican who accepts the scientific consensus that climate change is real , made worse by humans , and that we must act soon to slow and reverse its impact . If anyone , you would expect Marco Rubio , a Senator and presidential candidate who prides himself on his youth ( he listens to hip hop ! ) , to break the GOP mold and instead align with his generation in the fight against climate change . But even Rubio can not bring himself to accept the scientific reality . He is more likely to attack scientists and any attempt to address the crisis . Should we just his ignore his climate ignorance because he wants to cut taxes ?
