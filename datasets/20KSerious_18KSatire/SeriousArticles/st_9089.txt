United owner Mike Ashley was last heard outside of a London pub saying Pardew was ' dead , finished and over ' if the team were beaten here at Stoke . Well , the billionaire was in attendance and he arrived in a chauffeur driven people carrier before being shielded from the rain by a Stoke official as he entered the stadium . Dressed in his trademark black and white tie and white shirt , Ashley stopped to sign autographs , to which one fan hollered , ' Are you signing a cheque , Mike ? ' . If his club remains in and around the relegation zone then he may well be forced to open his cheque book for real come January .
