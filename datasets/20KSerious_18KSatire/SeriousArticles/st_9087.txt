Or you ll be attracted to a political activist who tells it like it is , who has lived by his convictions for 50 years , who won t take a dime of money from big corporations or Wall Street or the very rich , and who is leading a grass roots political revolution to regain control over our democracy and economy . In other words , you will be enticed either by a would be dictator who promises to bring power back to the people , or by a movement leader who asks you to join together with others to bring power back to the people .
