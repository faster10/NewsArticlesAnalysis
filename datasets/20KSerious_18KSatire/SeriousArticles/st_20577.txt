As for politics , the U . S . needs to work with other states to push Egypt ' s military to support the reforms that failed between early 2011 and Morsy ' s fall . This means a broad based effort to agree on a constitution , the creation of real political parties , and help for protesters learning how to organize politically and focus on practical governance and reform . It means taking enough time for elections to be open , to include Islamic and more secular parties , and focusing on the same kind of mixed national government and consensus politics that seem to have emerged in Tunisia .
