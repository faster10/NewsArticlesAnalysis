Joe Montana , as befits a four time Super Bowl champion , seems to have his own category . No , Montana , 38 , did not go out a winner in 1994 but he played superbly , guiding Kansas City to its second straight playoff berth as he threw for more than 3 , 000 yards and 16 TDs . He led the league in lowest interception percentage . In a wild card round shootout against Miami and Dan Marino ( their first playoff meeting since Montana s MVP effort in Super Bowl XIX ) , Montana completed 26 of 37 passes for 314 yards , two TDs and an interception . But Marino was equally efficient , throwing for 257 yards , and his two TD passes rallied Miami to a 27 17 victory . Yet even in defeat , Montana stood tall .
