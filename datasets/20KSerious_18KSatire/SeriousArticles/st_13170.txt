Despite his appropriation by both sides of the immigration question in America , apparently Martin Luther King never directly addressed the issue in his day it was not perceived as the major crisis that it is today . Still , we may with a good deal of confidence project what his position on immigration might be at this juncture in that we know the factors that would shape and inform his thinking on it they are the same factors that shaped his thinking and his activism on every public issue he addressed . These factors include the witness of the Bible , in this case biblical pronouncements about the treatment of immigrants by citizens of a country not their own , and King ' s belief that every human being is imago dei made in the image of God . These factors were undergirded by the foundational ethical teachings of the Bible to which King appealed throughout his social ministry justice and love .
