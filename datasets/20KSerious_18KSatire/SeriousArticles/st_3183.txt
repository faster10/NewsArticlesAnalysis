Even after shooting a dismal 35 . 3 percent in the first half and mustering only 38 points at Saturday ' s intermission , the Celtics dug deep . They blistered the floor in the third quarter while connecting on 7 of 10 3 pointers ( and actually led by as much as 12 ) . The Hornets charged in the fourth quarter , but Bradley ( team high 23 points ) hit some big shots ( and had a couple key assists down the stretch , too ) and Turner ' s contested layup in the final seconds sealed Boston ' s satisfying win .
