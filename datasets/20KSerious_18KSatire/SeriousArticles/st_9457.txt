3 ) Dreams give us faith that healing is possible . They show us the potential of the human spirit . As Peter Levine , author of Waking the Tiger , says , " I have come to the conclusion that human beings are born with an innate capacity to triumph over trauma . I believe not only that trauma is curable , but that the healing process can be a catalyst for profound awakening a portal opening to emotional and genuine spiritual transformation . I have little doubt that as individuals , families , communities , and even nations , we have the capacity to learn how to heal and prevent much of the damage done by trauma . In so doing , we will significantly increase our ability to achieve both our individual and collective dreams . "
