In response to the tens of candidates running for president in 2016 , Colbert started this ? Hunger Games ? parody segment , in which , swilling a glass of champagne and wearing a bright wig ? la Stanley Tucci s Caesar Flickerman in the actual ? Hunger Games , he gives an elegy to each fallen candidate ( tribute ) as he or she drops out of the race . This is one of the most frequently recurring bits on ? The Late Show ? so far , because the race has already left quite a few tributes behind , namely Rick Perry , Scott Walker , Jim Webb , Lincoln Chafee , Lawrence Lessig , and Bobby Jindal . Colbert s obvious glee in ripping into the dead campaigns makes this one of the best recurring bits yet . He gives comic obituaries to the deluded , hubristic , and woefully underqualified candidates , and it s a great use of Colbert s satirical skills ? playing an oblivious goof while still delivering withering political takedowns .
