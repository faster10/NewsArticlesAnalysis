The Baath party was founded as a pan Arab political entity which sought the unity of the Arab world through nationalism , secularism , and socialism . This party had the objective to emancipate the Arab peoples , while deemphasizing religious differences . It would be initially important in the development of Nasser ' s Egypt , Iraq , and of course in Syria . In the 60s and early 70s the Soviet Union contributed fundamentally to the creation of a national industry in Syria , which took over importations . The USSR supplied engineers , scientists and machinery for the development of the country ' s industries . Soviet cooperation in the development of the oil industry was key for the Syrian economy , as well as their contribution with the construction of railways and agriculture . Mixed corporations were built . It is calculated that around 10 percent of Syria ' s population worked in these companies .
