If , as a result of the finding of Richard III and all the publicity it has engendered , people can be encouraged to read the facts for themselves , it will be a truly great event and all who have been involved in the project are to be congratulated . I have followed its progress from an early stage when Philippa Langley , a member of the Richard III Society whose idea it was , first came to me to ask if she thought it was viable and would the society be willing to back it . I have tried to encourage her at times when doors were being shut and when there were setbacks and together we appealed for money when there was a shortfall . It is a great testament to Philippa ' s tenacity and bloody mindedness that the project has been so successful .
