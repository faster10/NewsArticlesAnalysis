The Treasury Department has attempted to deal with inversions before , issuing a notice in September 2014 to make it harder for U . S . companies to borrow against their foreign cash to finance inversions . It also tightened the calculations for when a deal triggers anti inversion restrictions in the tax code and changed how passive assets would be counted in those tallies . And it limited maneuvers by companies to shrink themselves by paying extraordinary dividends before a deal so they would escape the arithmetic tests in the anti inversion law .
