Jorge Ramos : Well I was working as a journalist in Mexico , and one day when I was very young out of college they censored one of the stories that I was doing on the president of the country . And back then I was very idealistic and I still am and I decided to quit . I quit my job in Mexico . I sold my car for 2 , 000 , got a student visa and came to the United States . And it was supposed to be for only one year , that was January 2 , 1983 , and that year has become 27 years . So this country gave me the opportunities that my country of origin , Mexico , couldn ' t give me .
