Transportation offers a telling example as app based services including Uber and Lyft instantly connect drivers in their own cars with customers who need a ride . Consumers get cheaper transport , and car owners get to earn some money with a vehicle that would otherwise be idle . But Uber will inevitably undermine established car services , and firms that directly pay wages and benefits to workers such as drivers , mechanics , managers and dispatchers . Yes , you may get a cheaper ride across town today , but the cabbie who is put out of work had his or her life turned upside down .
