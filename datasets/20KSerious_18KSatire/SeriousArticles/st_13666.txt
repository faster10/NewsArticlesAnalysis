Rockies get Parra ? The Colorado Rockies added another lefthanded hitter to an already crowded outfield by agreeing with Gerardo Parra on a three year , 27 . 5 million deal . He hit . 291 with 14 homers and 51 RBIs last season for Milwaukee and Baltimore , which obtained him in a deal at the trade deadline . Parra , 28 , plays all three outfield positions and is a two time Gold Glove winner and a lifetime . 277 hitter with 56 homers and 311 RBIs . There s a logjam of lefthanded hitters in Colorado s outfield , with Parra joining Gonzalez , Corey Dickerson and Charlie Blackmon . It very well could make someone expendable before spring training rolls around next month . ( AP )
