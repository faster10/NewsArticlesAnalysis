The late addition of Iran to the guest list created a new hurdle Monday , since the Islamic Republic hadn ' t agreed to a set of goals laid out in 2012 . The National Coalition called Iran ' s participation a " deal breaker " and threatened to leave the talks . The United States urged U . N . Secretary General Ban Ki moon to withdraw the invitation unless Iran signed onto the Geneva I goals . Iran eventually announced that it would not agree to any preconditions for the conference , and the United Nations rescinded its invitation Monday evening .
