Summit ' s Alex Cross fared badly in fifth place . The thriller , which stars the oft cross dressing Madea director Tyler Perry in the title role , grossed 11 . 8 million , the worst debut ever for a film starring Perry and the worst debut ever in the Alex Cross series . Morgan Freeman formerly played the action star , based on a popular character in James Patterson ' s series of novels , in 1997 s " Kiss the Girls " and 2001 s " Along Came A Spider , " which opened with 13 . 2 million and 16 . 7 million , respectively . Alex Cross , which cost Summit and QED Entertainment about 23 million to make , played to a typical Tyler Perry crowd . Audiences were 60 percent female , 68 percent above the age of 35 , and 74 percent African American , and although relatively few people saw the film , those that did liked what they saw , issuing it an " A " CinemaScore grade . Maybe if the film had been called Tyler Perry ' s Alex Cross , it could have started a bit better .
