While Argentinean Patagonia can be barren and almost desert like , Chilean Patagonia is rugged in the classical sense . It ' s peppered with craggy , Gothic mountains , dense forests and sparse pockets of civilization . Lake O ' Higgins is located in the Ays n region , one of the most remote areas of Patagonia . It ' s the least populated region in Chile , and one of the most sparsely populated places in the world outside Antarctica . The closet thing to an urban center is a place called Coihaique , in which more than half of the region ' s 100 , 000 residents reside , and smaller frontier settlements are home to fewer than 500 people , such as Villa O ' Higgins where Faustino sells his livestock .
