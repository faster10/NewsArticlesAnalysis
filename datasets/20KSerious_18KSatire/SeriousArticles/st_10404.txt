Music defined us . T . Ray Verteramo fell in love with heavy metal , which was under heavy fire at the time by Tipper Gore and those of the self proclaimed moral majority . It was a topic of discussion on " Crossfire " when Frank Zappa was a guest . Verteramo believed it to be an issue of free speech . The experience shaped her . " When you ' re judged so readily , so quickly , and so harshly for so long , it ' s hard not to become more empathetic . My tastes haven ' t changed and I ' ll never use hairspray again . But my appreciation and gratitude to be able to enjoy and share the music I love freely has definitely grown . "
