Watch Shakira Teach Her 2-Year-Old Son to Read in This Sweet Video!
Shakira’s 2-year-old son is growing up so quickly! The “Hips Don’t Lie” singer shared a video of herself teaching Milan how to read -- and her fans are clearly loving the sweet clip as much as we are. It has nearly 4 million views on Facebook! In the video, which she also posted to Instagram, Milan proves what a stellar reader he already is.  Shakira is seen teaching him words like “Nono” which translates to  "Grandpa " in English and “Gol” which, well, means “Goal.”  We’re sure his dad, Gerard Piqué, is happy about that one since he plays soccer professionally for FC Barcelona and Spain’s national team.

Last month, Shakira shared an adorably sweet photo of baby Sasha’s feet, comparing them to Gerard’s. “I have Daddy's feet, it looks like I've been playing football my whole life, " she wrote in her caption.
