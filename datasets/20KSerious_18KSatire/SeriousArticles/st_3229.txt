From there , I decided to make turkeys the theme : large Perma Stone turkey " statues , " gently tinted in various earth tones smaller turkey place card holders turkey chocolates for dessert and turkey decals for some of my Wedgwood Drabware plates . We printed the clip art ( you can find it and instructions at marthastewart . com turkey decals ) on a home printer and stuck it on as a purely decorative embellishment the plates were replaced with heated dinner plates for the meal . The decals are so easy to apply , and they are very appealing for any celebration . ( Just imagine Christmas or Halloween imagery of your choosing temporarily adorning plain dinnerware ! )
