The uncomfortable reality is that the federal budget is on an unsustainable path , and it ' s not because federal agencies are growing like kudzu . Discretionary nondefense spending hasn ' t grown at all in recent years , and defense spending has grown only modestly . The problem over the coming decades is the rising cost of healthcare , especially for the growing number of seniors . Only one candidate acknowledged this ? Kasich , again ? but he didn ' t say how he planned to slam the brakes on doctor bills and hospital costs in Medicare and Medicaid . And when Cruz was asked about cutting benefits to retirees , he touted a plan to let younger workers shift some of their Social Security contributions into private retirement investments ? a shift that defeats the purpose of providing guaranteed income for seniors in the future , while draining the system of money needed to pay for current retirees ' benefits .
