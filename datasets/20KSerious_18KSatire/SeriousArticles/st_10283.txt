The Broncos can ' t rely on the type of field position advantage they enjoyed a week ago as well , I don ' t believe , and even then the short fields did not result in big points . The streak of 22 straight postseason possessions without a touchdown is mercifully over , and Manning certainly saved his biggest moments for the clutch . His receivers won ' t drop as many early passes as they did against the Steelers , either . But then again , neither will Brady ' s , and Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola will be much better in the return game than an overwhelmed Martavis Bryant was filling in for Brown a week ago , and the Pats ' exceptional punting and kicking game also mitigates a significant advantage the Broncos held last week .
