I was in a hotel conference room in another state , auditioning to be on the long running TV game show " Jeopardy ! " for the fourth time . For almost 20 years I ' ve tried to get on " America ' s Favorite Quiz Show , " going all the way back to my freshman year in college , where I missed passing the written test by " one question " ( not really , but the contestant coordinators asked us to say that as they did not reveal actual scores ) . I ' ve auditioned for the show in three states and the District of Columbia . I traveled eight hours by car for the 2011 audition , and five hours by train for the college test . And I don ' t regret a single moment of it .
