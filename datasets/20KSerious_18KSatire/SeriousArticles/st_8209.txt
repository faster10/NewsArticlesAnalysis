In the U . S . , a man will work a part time job in a warehouse , running a forklift and hauling merchandise throughout the night , impatient to reach home . At Bagram Air Field , a soldier waiting for his leave flight back to the States will draw extra duty . His detail will move dead bodies dozens of them throughout the night , storing them carefully inside of a transport plane . He will be impatient to be done with the solemn yet gruesome task , but when he is finished , he will have to be ordered to take leave .
