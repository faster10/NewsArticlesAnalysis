Up front , when Rivera sees disruptive tackles Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei wreaking havoc , you wonder if it reminds him of how Tommie Harris and Tank Johnson did it for him with the Bears . Some of my experiences in coaching , you get to certain experiences like the playoffs , and sometimes you get a little bit of panic . Did I do enough ? Knowing GM Steve Keim has nailed pretty much every pick at every position , it s time to explore a backup plan for Palmer that can soon turn into a replacement ? unlike what he has on the bench now with Drew Stanton and Matt Barkley .
