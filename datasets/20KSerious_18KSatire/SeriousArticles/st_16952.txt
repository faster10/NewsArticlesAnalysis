We hate to beat this into the ground , but we can ' t emphasize enough how important it is for Green Bay to get its running game going and not be one dimensional . Repeating what we said last week : When the Packers rush for over 101 yards , they win . Green Bay is 10 1 this season when that happens , including a victory last week over Washington when the Packers rushed for 141 yards . Meanwhile , Arizona is 13 0 when allowing 115 or fewer rushing yards this season . The Cardinals three losses came when they allowed 164 , 141 and 145 rushing yards .
