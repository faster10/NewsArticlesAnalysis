The Ravens usually aren t searching for quarterbacks this time of year , but 2015 has been the strangest of times for the organization and the team is another QB injury away from a big problem . So the Ravens worked out former Texan Ryan Mallett on Wednesday . There was no immediate signing following the workout , but it could be a sign that Jimmy Clausen hasn t impressed the coaching staff as much as they would have liked . Of course it could also be a case of Ozzie Newsome doing his due diligence to ensure he fields the best team possible .
