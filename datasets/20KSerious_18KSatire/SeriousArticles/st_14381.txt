Panthers ( 1 . 5 ) at Cowboys ? I believe in Dallas . I really do . With Romo back they ' re a much better team . It clearly showed on Sunday and they were even more impressive in the second half as Romo started to shake off the rust . Short week and travel for the Panthers here hurts , but Dallas is coming back from Florida too and the Panthers players were able to get some rest after blowing out the Redskins . Carolina does one thing offensively really well ? run the ball ? that doesn ' t serve as a good matchup for the Cowboys defense ( 25th in DVOA against the run according to Football Outsiders ) and with Charles Johnson returning I expect them to manufacture some pass rush against that vaunted Cowboys offensive line . This isn ' t going to be a blowout but I think the Panthers pull off the road win and move to 11 0 .
