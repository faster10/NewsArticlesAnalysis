FILE In this Jan . 21 , 2016 , file photo , the Flint River is shown near downtown Flint , Mich . Flint ' s water became contaminated with lead when the city switched from the Detroit municipal system and began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save the financially struggling city money . Darnell Earley didn ' t come up with that plane , which caused a health emergency . And he certainly can ' t be blamed for the Detroit school system ' s decaying facilities and wrecked finances , which have prompted teacher boycotts this month . But the 64 year old budget expert was in charge of Flint ' s city government and the Detroit schools at key points in their recent turmoil , and that has made him a focal point of anger about Gov . Rick Snyder ' s use of " emergency managers " to temporarily run public entities in Michigan that are hopelessly in debt . Paul Sancya , File AP Photo
