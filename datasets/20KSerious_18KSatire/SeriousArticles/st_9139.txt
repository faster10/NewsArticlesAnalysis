Former Maryland Gov . Martin O ' Malley who has been sandwiched between the two top candidates during every single forum to date had a message for his supporters who might be flagging due to his low standing in the polls : " hold strong . " Moderator Chris Cuomo pushed O ' Malley on who he would encourage his supporters to get behind if he fails to meet the 15 percent threshold of caucus goers that would make him a viable candidate in Iowa . But he wasn ' t ready to give away his supporters yet he encouraged them to " hold strong at your caucus " and said he relished a tough fight .
