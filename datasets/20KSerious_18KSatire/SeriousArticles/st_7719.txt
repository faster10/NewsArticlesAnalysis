A staunch defense maybe of a band Gallagher currently has no plans to reform , but for someone so imbued with a British identity , the new album has particularly strong American sentiments . The new band includes an American guitarist , the first single release ' The Death of You and Me ' has a New Orleans style brass section , and the videos for all the singles so far including ' Dream On ' and ' AKA . . . What a Life ! ' have a 1970 ' s Americana theme with Noel as a central figure . Despite this , when asked if this had been a conscious thematic move , Gallagher remains adamant there is no new ambition to " crack " the United States .
