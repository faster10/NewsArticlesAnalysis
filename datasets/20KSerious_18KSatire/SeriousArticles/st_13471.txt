Prime Minister Gordon Brown is under the most direct pressure the pressure simply to quit because his party secured its lowest vote since the disastrous election of 1983 and shed 91 seats in Parliament . Although he stays on for the moment at least in Downing Street as prime minister , Brown ' s moral authority has taken a hammering . His only hope of remaining there is if he can negotiate a deal with the Lib Dems . But he will only get the chance to attempt one if David Cameron ' s Conservatives and Nick Clegg ' s Liberal Democrats have already failed to clinch a deal .
