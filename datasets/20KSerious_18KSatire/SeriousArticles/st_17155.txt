Walt ' s unplanned self sacrifice in shielding Jesse from the bullet not only exposed what humanity was left in Walter White , but underlined the significance of their relationship , no matter how fractured . " When he hears that the blue meth is still out there , that Jesse is still cooking , it ' s like , ' That bastard ! He convinced them to be a partner with him , he ' s still cooking ! I ' ll kill everybody ! ' " says Cranston . " And then when I see him , the shred of humanity left in Walter White is exposed at that moment and he acts . So if there ' s any redeeming quality to him from the standpoint of the audience , it ' s that moment . He even allows Jesse to kill him . Jesse has the gun and he points at me , and he says , ' You want this ? ' And I go , ' Yeah . I think it ' s fitting . Go ahead . You need to do it , go ahead . It ' s okay . ' And then he says , ' If you want this , then do it yourself . I ' m not going to do it for you . ' At least there was some conclusion to their association . Their friendship did matter . And it was because of that history and friendship , that was the basis of his impulsivity . Because otherwise it would just be , ' Jesus , look at that guy , that poor bastard , ' but I ' m not going to risk my life for some stranger . There is more than familiarity . It ' s deep rooted . And it ' s so true . Because sometimes you don ' t know the depth of what you feel until you ' re tested . That ' s why I think it ' s a satisfying ending . It ' s still true to Walter White . Because he always possessed that . But it ' s not saccharine sweet . It ' s not done out of ' Ohhh , Jesse . ' It ' s just . . . ' Jesus . ' If anything , it makes me hate Jack even more for his brutality . "
