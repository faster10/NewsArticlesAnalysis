Lauder : Roundabouts are a wonderful technology that have been well established outside of our country and they ' re starting to appear more and more in America , but very , very slowly . They ' re kind of expensive to put in and they sometimes require eminent domain condemnation of land around where they ' re put in . So it ' s kind of a big deal to put in . Whereas the nice thing about the sign I ' m proposing is that it ' s probably about 200 per location , to take down the old sign and put up a new one , which is obviously a drop in the bucket and could be implemented in a very short time once it was approved .
