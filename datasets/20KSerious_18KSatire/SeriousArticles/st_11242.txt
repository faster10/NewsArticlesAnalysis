As if it wasn ' t bad enough that she was sexualized in front of her peers during what was undoubtedly the most exciting night of her life , but to be further humiliated on a social networking site and called one of the most degrading terms that can be used toward women is reprehensible . The Onion is a site known for its sarcasm and although I ' m sure they didn ' t mean it , does that make it better ? Am I supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the statement ? Am I supposed to look at my daughter and think , wow , it would be really really funny and smart if someone jokingly called her the c word ? How ironic .
