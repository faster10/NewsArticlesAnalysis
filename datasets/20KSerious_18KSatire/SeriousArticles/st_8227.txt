With Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani , as well as other relationships , I think it s refreshing that they don t meet our conventional expectations of what a celebrity couple should look like . Maybe they ll redefine what we think is appropriate in terms of like dating like , a twist in what we ve accepted as a scripted narrative . It s exciting , like meeting a stranger s lingering eye at a bar or bumping into someone at just the right moment . You re not sure what , but you know something is going to happen . Maybe they ll work out and give us a new perspective on reducing the categorization we re so quick to jump to . For now , one can only hope they enjoy dancing to the beat of this new drum .
