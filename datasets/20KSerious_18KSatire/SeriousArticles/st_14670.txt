When they were born , one child policy came out so that they don ' t have siblings . With great efforts , they finally found a job and ready for get married , however the housing price is as high is Mount Everest . Finally , they ' ve had their own family , but then having two children is encouraged . They then need to take care of four old people and two children . To accomplish it , they probably need to keep working after the retiring age . So , please be nice to those who were born in the ' 80s !
