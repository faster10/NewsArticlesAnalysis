The first U . S . president to push for guest workers was Abraham Lincoln . Industries were facing labor shortages during the Civil War and , with Lincoln ' s support , Congress in 1864 passed The Act to Encourage Immigration . The bill allowed employers to recruit foreign workers and pay their way to America . There were more guest workers during World War I . But the concept really became popular during World War II and the Cold War . From 1942 to 1964 , under the Bracero program ( as in " brazo " , which is Spanish for arm as in someone who works with his arms and hands ) , nearly 5 million guest workers came in and out of the United States .
