For solitude and serenity searchers , the Vilcabamba trek is ideal . " Total isolation . There ' s nothing like doing a trek when there ' s no other people , " says Michelle Graham of Llama Path Tours , as she describes why Vilcabamba is her favorite of the alternate treks . This trek enters the last refuge of the Incas , Vilcabamba , and like Salkantay , offers spectacular diverse views ranging from tropical jungles to snowy peaks . Unlike Salkantay , however , this trek combines Inca history with little interference from tourist passersby .
