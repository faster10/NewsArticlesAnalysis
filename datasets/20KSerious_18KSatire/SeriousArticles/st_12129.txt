For those who can ' t appreciate the gravitas and nobility Bowie brought to art , watch his video for " Lazarus , " his last artistic statement . This is a man who knows he ' s dying and he faces that looming specter head on , turning it into a work of art . In it , he lies on his deathbed , frail yet determined . When it was released , it was captivating and intriguing . In retrospect , its haunting quality can cause you to forget to breathe . Who else could immortalize his death in such a graceful and subtle way that , before he dies , we don ' t even realize that ' s what we ' re seeing ?
