Raiding the refuge was always a bad idea . For one thing it would give these wannabe martyrs exactly what they want , an opportunity to get hurt or die at government hands and become fuel for radical right wing propaganda . They even brought children onto the property to raise the stakes . In the past , federal raids under similar circumstances involving children ? most notably in Waco ? not only resulted in innocent lives being lost , but in providing right wing radicals even more justification to demonize federal authorities .
