I think we should build on the progress we ve made , Clinton said . Under the Affordable Care Act , we now have 90 percent of Americans covered , and we have the chance to get the costs down , which will be my primary focus . I want to cut out of pocket costs and cap prescription drug costs . I don t want to start over . I don t want to plunge our country into another contentious debate . I feel if we re at 90 percent coverage , that it s a lot easier to get to 100 percent coverage and fix what needs to be fixed than to start all over again and try to go from zero to 100 percent I just don t think that s achievable .
