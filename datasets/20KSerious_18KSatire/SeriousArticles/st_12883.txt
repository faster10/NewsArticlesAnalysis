Except that we were so many , 2 millions and probably more ( the police said it had to stop counting after a while ) , that we had to walk in adjacent streets . Paris was an immense crowd . At Bastille , we noisily cheered the big black coaches driving the dozen heads of state joining the march : every European leader had come , alongside a couple of queens and kings , and the Palestinian and Israeli prime ministers . Half of Bordeaux was in the streets too , a third of Lyon and Marseille . In the whole of France , 4 million people marched . It felt wonderful and liberating . However , both respite and solace were short lived .
