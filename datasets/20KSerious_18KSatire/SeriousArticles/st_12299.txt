The biggest one is the fate of Syrian President Bashar al Assad , whose role is side stepped in the agreement . Russia and Iran , the latter of which is participating in international talks for the first time , say he s a necessary bulwark against extremist groups like ISIS and al Qaida . The U . S . , Europe , and Sunni Middle Eastern powers pin blame for the conflict , including the rise of ISIS , on Assad , and say he must step down . The issue can t be avoided forever : Saudi Arabia made clear Saturday that it would continue to support Syrian rebel groups if Assad does not step down . Secretary of State John Kerry suggested Saturday that Syrians could decide Assad s fate through the democratic process , saying , We did not come here to impose our collective will on the Syrian people . This would seem to suggest that Washington is now open to him playing a role in the transition .
