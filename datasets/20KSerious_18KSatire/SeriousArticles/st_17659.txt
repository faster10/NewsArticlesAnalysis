Islam never outright rejected scientific empiricism but instead tried to reconcile and integrate it into its religious beliefs , with a surprising amount of debate about the primacy of either faith or reason . It preached that divine revelation could be found in other religions and so practiced tolerance in the lands that it conquered a kind of Islamic multiculturalism . One of the giants of the European Enlightenment , Voltaire , favorably opined that Islam was more tolerant in its treatment of minorities than Christianity ( consider the comparative persecution of Catholics in Ireland or of Jews in Spain ) .
