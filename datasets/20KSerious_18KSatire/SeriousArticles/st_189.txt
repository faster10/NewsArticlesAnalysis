The 49ers do not have the personnel talent that the Eagles did but they have reliable pieces such as Joe Staley and Anquan Boldin on offense , defensive pieces to build around in NaVorro Bowman , Ian Williams , Eric Reid , Aaron Lynch and Jimmie Ward , among others . Perhaps having a solid defense in place can help allow Kelly to develop his offense over time and figure out if Kaepernick is part of the solution there . The team also has players in Carlos Hyde ( if he ' s healthy ) and Torrey Smith who could help flourish in this system under Kelly , and the seventh overall pick in the 2016 draft could net them an immediate impact player .
