McCarron scuffled all evening , as the Steelers were in his face with multiple blitz packages , but somehow the Bengals grabbed a 16 15 lead on a McCarron to Green 25 yard touchdown with 1 : 56 left in the contest . Cincinnati was able to take the lead after Steelers veteran signal caller Ben Roethlisberger left the game with a right shoulder injury late in the third quarter . After the Green TD put Cincy ahead , Pittsburgh back up Landry Jones tried to rally the Steelers , but he tossed an ill timed interception to linebacker Vontaze Burfict that seemingly put the game out of reach with less than two minutes remaining .
