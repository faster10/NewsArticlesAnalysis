And when it comes to talking points , no one has them down more firmly than Cruz . When he finds a joke or quip he likes , he sticks with it . For instance , among the things he said at the debate was that " There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible ? and not a one of them is as good . " I ' ve heard Cruz say this at least 10 or 15 times on television I can ' t imagine how many times reporters following him around on the campaign trail have heard it . You will never hear Cruz tell a joke or use a statistic just once , or five or 10 times I imagine him toting around piles of index cards on which he has every bon mot written out for easy access and memorization .
