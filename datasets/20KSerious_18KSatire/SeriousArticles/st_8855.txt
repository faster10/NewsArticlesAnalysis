Here again , we have to be careful not to confuse yesterday s China with today s . Looking to IMF data , China s inflation rate averaged 4 . 5 percent annually from 1990 to 2014 . That is consistent with a fast growing emerging economy . During the five years ahead , the IMF estimates an average of 2 . 4 percent annually , which is consistent with a mature economy . Similarly , real productivity averaged 8 . 8 percent annually from 1990 to 2014 , but is expected to be a more modest ( but still enviable ) 5 . 7 percent annually over the next five years . Finally , a realistic long term dividend yield is one that resembles that of large companies in a mature economy I would say 2 percent .
