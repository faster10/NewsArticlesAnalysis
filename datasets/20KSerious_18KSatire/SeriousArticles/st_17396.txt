When Suharto was overthrown in 1998 , Indonesian extremists who had been gaining battlefront experience with al Qaeda in Afghanistan returned to the country and formed various militant groups , chief among them Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) , which staged attacks on targets perceived as un Islamic , such as Christian places of worship and nightclubs . The group , led by Abu Bakar Bashir and with a presence in several Southeast Asian countries , seeks to establish a pan Islamic state across much of the region .
