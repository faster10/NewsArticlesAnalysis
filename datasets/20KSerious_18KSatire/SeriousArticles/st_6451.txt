Manning is going to his fourth Super Bowl after the Denver Broncos beat the New England Patriots 20 18 on Sunday . He owes a big thanks to Denver ' s defense , which got two huge fourth down stops deep in their own territory in the fourth quarter and then got a stop on a two point conversion attempt after giving up an amazing fourth down touchdown to Rob Gronkowski with 12 seconds left . Broncos cornerback Bradley Roby intercepted a pass on the two point conversion attempt that was tipped by former Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib and the Broncos held on to win .
