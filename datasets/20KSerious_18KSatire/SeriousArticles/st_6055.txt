Ciara Kirrane of Stop Climate Chaos , a coalition of civic society organisations , says , We see Paris as a beginning rather than an end . It s an opportunity to start connecting people s demands for justice , equality , food , jobs and rights and to strengthen the movement , to force governments to listen and act in people s interests and not in the vested interests of elites . Paris will launch us into 2016 as a year of action for people s demands and solutions to take centre stage . For instance , we need Ireland to have a national mitigation plan to reduce our emissions now .
