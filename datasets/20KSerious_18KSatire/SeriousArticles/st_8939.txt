After placekicker Adam Griffith tied the game at 24 with a field goal early in the fourth quarter , Saban did what no one expected , least of all Clemson coach Dabo Swinney . He called a play named pop kick , where Griffith lofted a soft , arcing kickoff to the right side of the field . Crimson Tide defensive back Marlon Humphrey caught it on the fly 15 yards downfield at the 50 yard line . It was the unexpected call Saban had to make if he wanted to win a fifth national championship ( Bama legend Paul Bear Bryant won a record six national titles ) .
