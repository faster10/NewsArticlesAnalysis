Let them say we re crazy , what do they know ? Those lyrics from the Starship track ( written by Dianne Warren and Albert Hammond , whose son went on to be in the Strokes ) are probably ringing true for Gwen and Blake right now . The world may scoff at this seemingly chalk and cheese pairing who are still reeling from their divorces , but who needs them ? Extra points if the video re creates the scene from Mannequin ( in which the song was featured ) in which Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall ride around on a motorbike in a tux and an evening dress .
