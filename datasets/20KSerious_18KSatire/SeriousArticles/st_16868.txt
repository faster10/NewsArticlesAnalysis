And , boy did we learn . Rickman s perfect portrayal of one of the millennial generation s most loyal and conniving antiheros will keep us forever thinking twice about judging people at first glance . Severus Snape may have died a complicated , misunderstood man whose main legacy lives on in the middle name of one of Harry Potter s children . But to Potter fanatics who grew up with him on screen , Severus Snape will forever be Alan Rickman , who painted such a vivid picture of what was living in our imaginations . Our children and their children will watch the Potter movies in fear of him , in disgust of him and , eventually , in awe . They ll turn to us wide eyed , just as we were when we learned the truth , and say , After all this time ?
