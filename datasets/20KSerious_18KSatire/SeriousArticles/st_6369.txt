What to watch : This could be the second consecutive year Pittsburgh enters the playoffs without its leading rusher , and it wasn ' t pretty last time when they failed to compensate for the absence of Le ' Veon Bell . As good as Brown and Ben Roethlisberger have been , being predictable could be a formula for disaster if the Steelers can ' t mount a credible running game . On the other side , the Bengals surely won ' t want to put the game on McCarron ' s arm , but he ' ll need to establish some semblance of balance against a team vulnerable to the pass .
