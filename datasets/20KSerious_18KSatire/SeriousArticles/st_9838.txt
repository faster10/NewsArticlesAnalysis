" Ridge will not be dead or presumed dead , " said Bradley Bell . " He will just not be in the picture . I don ' t want to do a presumed death because I don ' t want the story that follows to be all about Ridge . This will be a Brooke story . Ridge is a pivotal part of the show and he will be back in a matter of time . . . and probably not all that much time . I will continue writing for the character . I ' m looking at this in two phases , really . There will be a period of time without Ridge , which is where some new , interesting avenues for Brooke will come into play . But at some point it will be necessary for Ridge to return to the show . Who will be playing the role at that point remains to be seen . "
