Russia and Iran are now dictating the future of Syria . Obama is pretending by dint of a token deployment of Special Forces and an increase in ineffective air attacks against ISIS that the U . S . suddenly out of nowhere has a coherent Syria strategy . Is this some sort of quasi cold war tit for tat game Obama is playing ? Putin dispatches his air force to pound Assad ' s adversaries so days later the U . S . unveils that it is deploying a MARGINAL , largely symbolic force of 50 ground troops into Syria ? Don ' t buy one nickel of it . It smacks of a veiled effort to ward off critics at the expense of putting a token U . S . force in harm ' s way and for what strategic objective ?
