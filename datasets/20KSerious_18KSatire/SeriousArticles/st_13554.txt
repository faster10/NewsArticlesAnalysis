The legacy isn ' t based on the fact that " The Evil Dead " had a great screenplay , because it didn ' t . In fact , the plot is as basic as they come : Five college students drive out to a shack in the middle of nowhere , mess with an old reel to reel tape recorder that plays malevolent incantations , and unleash bloody Lovecraftian hell . The film ' s effects were cut rate even for the early ' 80s , and the acting ( other than a charismatic breakout turn by lantern jawed B movie icon Bruce Campbell ) was amateurish at best .
