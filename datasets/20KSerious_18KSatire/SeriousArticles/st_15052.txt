And here s Branstad , the longtime governor of the state that has become one of the lynchpins of Cruz s campaign , when asked the question about the senator s eligibility on Monday : When you run for president of the United States , any question is fair game . So let the people decide . That s so funny , I could spit . Why don t you say whether he is or he is not , Terry Branstad ? Because if he s not , you wouldn t want Iowans to waste their time caucusing for him , would you ? ( For what it s worth : Cruz has been talking about phasing out the Renewable Fuel Standard , which provides the God fearing corn people of Iowa with a lot of money . Branstad s son Eric leads a pro ethanol pressure group that exists to push candidates on the issue . )
