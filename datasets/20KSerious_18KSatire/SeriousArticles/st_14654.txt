What about the panel itself ? I think we have to leave it entirely to the President ? ? ? s discretion and hopefully he will nominate not the Sens or the Panagariyas with political leanings , but citizens who have spoken out on issues without much botheration other than national interests at heart . I can certainly think of names like Deepak Parekh , NRN etc . , but I am sure there are plenty of other Indians who would fit the bill . There ? ? ? s no reason why the nation would not trust these men with stellar credentials when we have lived with the decisions of people with dubious and questionable character , not to mention competence .
