Some in Madrid think it impertinent that Bale has pushed for a central role . They ignore the reality that players who fail to stand up for themselves in this intensely political environment tend to be trampled on . His journey from the wing to a central striking position began at Spurs so he was hardly likely to surrender that ambition in his prime , even with Ronaldo and Benzema to consider . Bale says : There have been comments in previous interviews where I ve been stuck on the right and maybe didn t have that freedom , but now I m able to come in and float around a bit as well . My main position would be on the right , obviously . I m enjoying my football and my position very much .
