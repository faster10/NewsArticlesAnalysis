Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) set up JeM as a competitor to the Lashkar e Taiba ( LeT ) , which the ISI had formed earlier . Before the formation of JeM , three Pakistani terrorists ? Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar , Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Maulana Masood Azhar ? were released by Indian authorities in return for hostages taken during the hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC 814 in December 1999 . Azhar and the two other terrorists , upon their release in Kandahar , were ferried to Pakistan under ISI escort . Within a few weeks , Azhar announced the formation of JeM in Karachi .
