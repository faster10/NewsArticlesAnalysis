To be honest , the PGA Tour and R A should have acted already . I was originally of the opinion that Trump could be a good thing for the sport , as he invested in resorts such as Doral and Turnberry which were in danger of turning into faded glories . Even though he had accused Mexico " of bringing drugs , crime , rapists " into the US and even though he opined that " tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border " , my suspicion was that the game should hesitate from taking the high ground .
