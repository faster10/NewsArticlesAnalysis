Grease : Live aims to use the best elements of stage ( rotating sets , sliding walls ) and film ( camera tricks to recreate the Thunder Road car race ) in its three hour TV production . Two songs from the original Broadway production not in the classic 1978 movie are included : Freddy , My Love , and Those Magic Changes . Choreography ( by Glee s Zach Woodlee ) has been updated , like the T Birds classic arm movements in Greased Lightning . But , for the most part , Grease still lives in the innocent 1950s .
