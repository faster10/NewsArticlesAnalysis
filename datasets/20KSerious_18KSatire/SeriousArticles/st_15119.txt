Tearing this president down is not the way for Republicans to regain a majority coalition , although some pundits and talk show hosts will be tempted to do just that . Instead , Republicans should allow themselves to like the president , just as they fight against his policies . And as they fight his policies , they should do all that they can to market their own ideas so that the American people understand that the Republicans have positive alternatives that will make our country stronger , safer and more prosperous in the future .
