When we got a chance to go out there and kind of tip our hats to the fans , I can t tell you how many people were yelling Thank you to us , Wright said , either sweat or tears , perhaps both , under his eyes . And how excited they were to just say how much they appreciated what this team was able to deliver to this city . That means a lot to me , and I m sure it means a lot to everybody in this room where you have a tough defeat , a tough series , everybody s kind of hanging their head , but you got these fans ? hundreds , thousands of these fans , just yelling Thank you to us . That s why this place is the best .
