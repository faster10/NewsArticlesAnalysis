Hamilton , who is careful with his money , as even his father has joked , has surprised Mercedes bosses Niki Lauda and Toto Wolff by how painstakingly detailed he has been in negotiations . ' We ' re in the final stages , ' revealed Hamilton last week . ' I don ' t know what the timelines are and we ' re not rushing . Getting it done before or after Melbourne does not matter . I ' m not sure I ' ve enjoyed it , but it ' s been an experience . If I ' d gone through my whole career and not done something like this I ' d have always wondered if I could or couldn ' t do it .
