There was also much political symbolism in this launch . The opening of a luxury hotel on Tahrir Square was intended to send out a signal that all is well in Egypt again after the removal of two presidents , the death of thousands of protesters , the detention of many more , an insurgency in Sinai and , last month , the accidental killing of a dozen Mexicans and Egyptians by security forces . Tahrir has also been transformed . After that 1960s postcard was taken , a large portion of the square was turned into a bus station and when that was moved in the 1990s , into a wasteland . Since the mass protests of 2013 , it has also been a tank park . Now it has been relaid and repaved and is once again a large open public space . The burnt out headquarters of Mubarak s National Democratic Party have also been demolished and the area is being turned into a new sculpture garden for the museum . So on Friday , when I checked out of the Nile Ritz Carlton to head south to Luxor and a Nile cruise , the sun was shining , the hotel was buzzing , the square looked almost pristine , there were more visitors to the Egyptian Museum than I have seen for several years , the world s media was having fun with the possibility of there being a hidden chamber in Tutankhamun s tomb , Egypt s skillful Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou was due to launch a This is Egypt campaign at London s World Travel Market and it seemed entirely possible that tourism , so vital to the Egyptian economy and to so many Egyptians livelihoods , might finally be on the rebound .
