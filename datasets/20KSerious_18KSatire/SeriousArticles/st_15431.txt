The Constitution s First Amendment has long been interpreted as a flat prohibition on actions that the U . S . government may take , including those actions that respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof . Targeting groups of persons , including non U . S . citizens , seeking to enter the U . S . based on religion ? whether as Muslims , Jews , Christians , Buddhists , or Hindus ? would violate the First Amendment . Back in the late 19th century , the U . S . Supreme Court upheld the imposition of a receivership on a Mormon Church on the basis that Mormonism was not genuine Christianity , but everyone agrees that nothing of that sort would be thinkable today and that the Religion Clauses reach to every imaginable religious group .
