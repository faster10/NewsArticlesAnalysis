Buried in the autumn statement , there was also an announcement that the government intends to completely cut the ? 2 . 6bn a year it gives to councils for public health spending ( which covers areas such as drug and alcohol abuse , sexual health , and teenage pregnancy ) . The idea , apparently , is that the money can be made up thanks to all those business rates . The more likely outcome , of course , is that these things will fall into the same fragile category as libraries , parks , bus subsidies , welfare advice , help for homeless people , transport to school for children with special educational needs , and more : a great roll call of the basics of any halfway civilised society , either under threat , or disappearing fast .
