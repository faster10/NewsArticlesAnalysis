Occasionally , when it s not raining , weather radar can pick up some interesting things . Last year , for example , I wrote about an enormous mayfly hatch showing up on weather radar along the upper Mississippi River in Wisconsin . In places like Texas and California , smoke from wildfires also routinely shows up on radar . These special views are possible when radars switch to what s called clear air mode : the tracking beam slows down , enabling the radar to become thousands of times more sensitive and allowing particles as small as soot to become detectable .
