Each new member ' s voting status will last 10 years and will be renewed if that member has been active in motion pictures during that time period . British actress Charlotte Rampling , who was nominated for her role in drama " 45 Years " , told French radio station Europe 1 the objection to the lack of diversity among her fellow nominees was " racist to white people " . The academy now aims for women to comprise 48 percent of its membership and " diverse groups " at least 14 percent as an initial step . Members will get lifetime voting rights after three 10 year terms , or if they ' ve been nominated for an Oscar . Previously , all active members received lifetime voting rights .
