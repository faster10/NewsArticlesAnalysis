Web connected printers fill this need in a few ways . First , they connect to the ever growing cloud for business users and make their lives easier . Second , the email to print concept clearly has the potential to drive new kinds of usage , both from business users and consumers who do things like print photos and news . Finally , there ' s also opportunities for developers to create sticky apps perhaps not on the scale we ' ve seen in mobile , but with HP betting the future of its printers on web connectivity , you can bet we ' ll see some big winners emerge from the developer community .
