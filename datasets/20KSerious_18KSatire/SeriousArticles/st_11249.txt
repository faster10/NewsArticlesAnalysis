Go nuts , Rand . Let that libertarian freak flag fly . Unleash the ? hostile college dorm debater inside of you . ? He can t win , but he can sure as hell play spoiler for some of the candidates who have treated him brusquely in past debates . Trump won t be there , which is just as well for Paul given how badly the front runner has manhandled him in the past , but he can certainly take the fight to candidates like Chris Christie and Marco Rubio , who are both angling for the second place spot in New Hampshire as a springboard to future campaign success . Some of Paul s best debate moments in the past have come during scraps with Christie and Rubio as they ve defended government surveillance and huge military expenditures . Before he sold out his principles to run for president , Paul was a hard charging opponent of bloated defense budgets and cast them as antithetical to conservative principles . If he recommits to that idea , he could press candidates like Rubio on the contradiction between fearmongering about the national debt while also proposing huge tax cuts and massive increases to military spending .
