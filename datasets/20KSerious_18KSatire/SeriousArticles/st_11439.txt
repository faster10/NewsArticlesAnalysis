This has been Denver ' s crucible in 2015 , too . Three of the Broncos ' four losses have come in the four games in which they posted their lowest pressure rates on defense , per ESPN Stats Information . The one exception there was a 24 12 win over the Lions during which the Broncos got two short fields in the fourth quarter off turnovers to barely pull away . If one issue can decide the AFC Championship Game , it very well may be whether the Denver pass rush shows up when the Broncos need it most .
