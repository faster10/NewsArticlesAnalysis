It always made me laugh to hear stories about the insanity that would go on between Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried during the making of the movie " Aladdin . " The truth was Robin and I didn ' t bump into each other once during the making of that film . I recorded the Parrot role , and he recorded the Genie separately . So when I saw the film for the first time at the premiere , I was able to laugh along with the rest of the audience at Robin ' s performance . I had never heard it before .
