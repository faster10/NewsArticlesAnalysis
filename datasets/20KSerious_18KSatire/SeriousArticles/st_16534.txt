This was a horror show waiting to happen , and it should give us pause over current arms deals we are engaged in . Not least the UK s ongoing deals with Saudi Arabia which Amnesty has repeatedly warned risk being used to commit violations of international law in Yemen and should be immediately stopped . The global Arms Trade Treaty which came into force almost exactly one year ago , was intended to be pre emptive in the analysis of the atrocities we are seeing these arms being used to commit today . The ? UK was one of the key supporters of the treaty , and they should now lead by example as to how it should be implemented . At some point someone needs to hit the off switch on this conveyer belt of supply , abuse and retaliation .
