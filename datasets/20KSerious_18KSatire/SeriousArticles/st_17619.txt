TRUMP PROMISES TO DEPORT SYRIAN MIGRANTS : Donald Trump said he would deport all Syrian refugees who settle in the U . S . if elected president . " Anybody that ' s brought into this country from the migration is going to be out , " Trump said at a rally in Knoxville , Tenn . , last night . " We ' re not gonna do it . We ' re gonna have a country again , we ' re gonna have borders , we ' re gonna have a country again , right now we don ' t have a country . " Rather than accept Syrian refugees in the U . S . , which Trump argues is a " Trojan Horse " that could allow entry for terrorists into the country , he advocates for building a " safe zone " inside Syria , where he said refugees could wait out the conflict . According to ABC ' s JORDYN PHELPS , more than 25 governors have vowed to reject Syrian refugees from settling in their states in response to the Paris attacks . http : abcn . ws 1l1b0LW
