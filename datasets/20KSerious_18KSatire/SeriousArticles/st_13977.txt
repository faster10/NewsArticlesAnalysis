Tris , a . k . a . Beatrice , has been raised as a member of Abnegation , one of five factions in a walled dystopia that was formerly Chicago and still looks , strikingly , like a semiruined concrete playground version of that city . The members of Abnegnation dress in plain gray frocks , like the Amish , and they ' re all about puritan self sacrifice . The other four factions are Erudite ( defined by their transcendent knowledge ) , Candor ( who are compulsively honest ) , Amity ( the naturally peaceful ) , and Dauntless ( the fearless tattooed warrior jocks in black " in other words , the sect that anyone cool would want to be part of ) . Beatrice and her peers have the right to choose a faction for themselves ( it ' s like picking a college " you can go to Yale even if your folks didn ' t ) . But when she takes the test to learn which faction she ' s best suited for , it turns out that she ' s in the rare forbidden category known as Divergent , which means she has the qualities of three factions at once : Abnegnation , Erudite , and Dauntless . It may sound silly to say she ' s an outlaw because she ' s self sacrificial , brilliant , and strong all at the same time , but what ' s really forbidden is independent thought .
