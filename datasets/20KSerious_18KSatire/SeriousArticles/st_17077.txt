What made " The Sopranos " different from the boatload of Mafia shows that came before it was that Tony was in therapy . The sight of a mobster having an anxiety attack and suffering through psychotherapy was the central conceit of the show , the selling point of the pilot episode that led to the six season series . But if " talking about your feelings " seemed like the least masculine thing you could do , here too Tony represented the plight of the modern American male , reconciling his animal instincts with polite society . Therapy is where strong silent types get sent to be civilized .
