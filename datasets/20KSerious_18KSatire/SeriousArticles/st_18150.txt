The notion that the U . S . is at war with Islam has its roots in the Israeli Palestinian conflict . Generations of Arabs Muslims and otherwise have been politically socialized to view the U . S . as the main patron of Israel , which is portrayed as a brutal " Zionist " state that has subjugated Palestinians and " stolen " their land . However , it was the war against Afghanistan in 2001 , and subsequent invasion of Iraq in 2003 that framed the narrative more clearly in the minds of many as a general U . S . war against Muslims everywhere .
