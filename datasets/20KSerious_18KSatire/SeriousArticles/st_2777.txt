" Palin asked a crowd of thousands packed into an arena at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa , Oklahoma , echoing Trump ' s campaign mantra . Palin , who was absent from Trump ' s Wednesday morning event in Norwalk , Iowa , despite an expected appearance , rejoined the Trump campaign in Tulsa , warming up the crowd ahead of the candidate ' s speech . But Palin also struck a personal tone , alluding to problems her son and other returning military vets endure when returning to civilian life and suggesting that President Barack Obama ' s lack of support for veterans was related . " It ' s kind of the elephant in the room , " she began , addressing her family ' s struggle . Palin ' s oldest son , Track , was arrested earlier this week in a domestic violence case in which his girlfriend told police she was afraid he would shoot himself with a rifle : KOCO
