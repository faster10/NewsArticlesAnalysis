Rand got bumped from the last prime time debate because his poll numbers were , in the technical jargon of elite political scientists , bad . But rather than slumming it with Rick Santorum and the other hopeless dreamers in the JV debate , Rand went to the Twitter headquarters in New York to preside over some online town hall thing and tweet out a bunch of sassy hashtags . That actually wasn t the worst strategy in the world ? if you don t want to be viewed as a loser also ran , don t show up at the event created specifically for loser also rans . And even though his polls are still in the latrine ( 2 percent nationally , just ahead of last place Santorum ) , Fox News rules were lax enough to just barely grant him entry thanks to a well timed twitch in his Iowa numbers .
