This is a more acute question with Carson than with any other candidate , because he has no political record we can examine to see how he might perform . The policy ideas he has put forward range between the impossibly vague and the utterly outlandish . Even more so than Donald Trump , who has at least managed a large organization , Carson offers only himself ? his heart , his spirit , his soul ? as the reason why America should elect him president . In assessing him we have no choice but to look at the man , because there s nothing else . Some parts of his personal story are irrelevant to that assessment , but some parts aren t . And it s those that should really give us pause .
