Meanwhile , Germany s Federal Prosecutor said he has taken over a criminal investigation into an alleged terror plot that led authorities to cancel the national football team s game with the Netherlands in Hanover on Tuesday . The probe will examine whether a terrorist organisation planned an attack , a spokesman for the investigator said . The Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe is Germany s top investigator for crimes against the state . The office is also handling a separate probe into the Paris attacks because of the German victims . The game , which Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of her cabinet planned to attend , was intended as a show of solidarity after the carnage in France . It was called off about 90 minutes before kickoff when police received a tip that a bomb attack was planned inside the stadium .
