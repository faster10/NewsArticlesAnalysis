I ' d say 90 of them are work trips , and as a result I ' m usually traveling alone . So when there is someone I know next to me , of course then I don ' t ever have to wonder , " What is the person next to me thinking ? " because they know . That ' s part of the challenge too , is how far am I willing to go . . . . I really don ' t ever want the project to become intrusive . . . . Gum , for example . I ' ve done a few things with chewing gum , but . . . I really don ' t ever do things with chewing gum if there ' s someone next to me who I don ' t know because I feel like it ' s just a little too impolite .
