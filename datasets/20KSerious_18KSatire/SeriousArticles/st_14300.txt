" It ' s like the lottery : If you don ' t play the lottery , you can ' t win the lottery , " offensive coordinator Norv Turner said . " If we don ' t give him the ball , he can ' t break long runs . He was close in that game to breaking four or five different times , and we ' re close to finishing blocks or getting on the right guy and giving him that chance . We knew going into the season we know where we ' re at right now , six games in that we have a lot of work to do on the offensive line . I think we ' ve gotten better . I think in another month , we ' re going to be better than where we ' re at right now . But it is a work in progress . Adrian ' s done a great job of not getting frustrated , because I know he sees how close he is on a number of plays . It ' s a matter of all of us staying with it . "
