Everyone likes to joke that it s not a big deal to win a Golden Globe , but this lack of preparation suggested that the awards are so low stakes now , even the winners don t care enough to prepare . Many seemed to forget that you couldn t curse on television , resulting in profanity censoring silences that lit up Twitter with the frustrating question : WHAT DID HE JUST SAY ? ! ? Those actors and directors who did put in the effort were often rewarded by the house band playing them off stage . Who could blame Henson if she bugged out a little , Cookie style , when she heard the familiar orchestral music cut into her speech . Please wrap ? she huffed . I waited 20 years for this ! You gon wait .
