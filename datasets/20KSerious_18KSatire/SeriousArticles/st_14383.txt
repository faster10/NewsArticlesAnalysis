Texans ( 2 . 5 ) vs . Saints ? The Saints are coming off a bye and it ' s possible Dennis Allen fixes the Saints defense except I ' m not sure it is because the Saints personnel is kind of a problem . Brian Hoyer and DeAndre Hopkins can do some damage against this team on the road even with two weeks to prepare . The Saints offense is a concern , but Houston ' s been dynamite defensively the last three weeks , giving up less than 10 points per game over the last three games since the Dolphins debacle .
