Bateman , in particular , is enjoyably nimble and unbuttoned when he sheds his usual persona of responsible and exasperated guy and lets some devil out .

And that resourcefulness rubs off on Reynolds , a pleasant if less complex performer . Acting here as if he were a vaguely disgruntled but resigned grown up , Reynolds gets to escape the tonal confines of his boyish smile .
