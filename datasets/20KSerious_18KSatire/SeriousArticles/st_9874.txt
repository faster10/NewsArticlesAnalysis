" Just taking it as it goes , " Irving responded . " You ' re not getting anything out of me . No percentages , no target dates , nothing . I ' m feeling good . Personally I ' m in a great place just being able to be out here and practice with the guys , being able to go up and down and continuously , as well . The first time I went up and down it was more controlled . Today , there was a lot more up and down , being able to test my wind , being able to test my knee , going from offense to defense and translating and being able to get out in the fast break and being able to try my moves that I ' ve been practicing . Kind of knock off most of the rust I ' ve had . This is what this week has been about . "
