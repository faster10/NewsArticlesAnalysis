Ole Miss slowed down offensively and Engram ' s score marked its final points of the day . LSU , on the other hand , drove into Rebels territory four more times , and the Tigers ' best opportunity came with eight minutes left . LSU had a first and goal at the Ole Miss 1 yard line with four chances to punch it in . One would think that the Tigers would give it to Leonard Fournette until he scored . LSU ran just one play for the former Heisman front runner , a botched toss play that lost 2 yards . The other three plays didn ' t work either , as LSU ' s inability to finish that drive would be the lasting memory in this bad beat .
