In a thoughtful speech last week on the presidential campaign trail , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for regional powers such as Jordan and Turkey to play a larger role in combating Islamic State . But she also suggested a more flexible role for the more than 3 , 000 U . S . forces now serving in Iraq as trainers and advisors . She would allow U . S . personnel to be embedded with Iraqi units and to help call in airstrikes . Admittedly , such a change in posture would increase the risk that U . S . forces would come under fire , but it also could improve the effectiveness of operations against Islamic State strongholds .
