A statement issued by chief minister J Jayalalithaa said examinations originally scheduled from December 7 onwards will now be held in the first week of January next year . This means that even schools in areas not affected by rain will not have exams until early 2016 . Due to the incessant rainfall since Diwali in Chennai , Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram , schools and colleges have been closed for 21 working days including the Diwali holidays , leading to concerns among teachers about completing the syllabi .
