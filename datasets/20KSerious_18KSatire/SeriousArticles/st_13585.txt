Certainly , the PKK has a history of killing dissidents within the Kurdish movement , says Hugh Pope , senior Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group . He told me : " You do have to remember that the PKK has a long history of killing its own people . " Meanwhile , the Turkish state has long relied on military force , arrests and law suits to crush the Kurdish movement inside Turkey . The Turkish PKK war is one of the longest running conflicts in the Middle East , with more than 40 , 000 people killed since the 1980s . Many Kurds view the Turkish government and armed forces as mortal enemies , while many Turks label the PKK and anyone affiliated with the PKK as " terrorists . " So certainly I can expect some Kurds will accuse Turks of assassinating these three women , even if there is no evidence to back up that claim .
