Teresa Barger : I think the first thing to remember is that it is just the A shares market the local Chinese market has its own dynamics . Most people will argue that the Chinese market is overvalued . We did an analysis of the Shanghai market for the last eight years and found that they have been destroying value for those eight years on economic value added basis . So a part of it is , yes , these prices have fallen and , of course , the government intervention has not been helpful in them finding the floor . Of course , we have very specific things such as the ban on large holders selling and confusion as to when that ban will be lifted . I also think there is a lot of concern over the currency .
