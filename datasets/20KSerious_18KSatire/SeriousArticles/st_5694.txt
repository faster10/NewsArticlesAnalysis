Wouldn ' t it be nice if , for this one time , this kind of story really did cause the rest of us to re examine and reflect upon our unfinished business regarding race and culture ? And to ask ourselves what constitutes racism in our 21st century society ? It is true that we no longer have racially separate drinking fountains , rest rooms and train compartments . But it is also true that a disproportionate number of young black people receive far harsher jail sentences ( e . g . life with no possibility of parole ) than their white counterparts convicted of similar crimes . Is that justice ? Or is it a form of racism ?
