Cutler s near pick : The Bears start on offense was entirely sloppy , a five possession disaster that went punt , punt , punt , punt , punt . They also only picked up one first down during that stretch . And on their third series , Cutler uncorked an ill advised on the move throw that should have been intercepted . Packers corner Quentin Rollins had a read on the play and darted into the throwing lane with Cutler firing under duress . Rollins , however , dropped the pass . And rather than setting Rodgers up with a short field in Bears territory with a chance to further fluster a disjointed road team , the Packers instead settled for a Bears punt . Cutler had another near turnover , with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter that could have been game changing . Struggling to handle a shotgun snap , the quarterback fumbled for the sixth time this season and Rollins seemed positioned to recover the loose ball at the Bears 47 . But Cutler got on it first . The Bears punted on the next play and gained a 43 yard advantage in field position at a crucial point in the game . A turnover there could have been disastrous . ?
