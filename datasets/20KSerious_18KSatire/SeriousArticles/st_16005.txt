In an all Indian school , as I recall , we didn ' t elaborate by acting out the parts of Pilgrims and Indians . This was a tradition in the white public and private school systems in America . I recall speaking to a lady of Kiowa descent who talked about the actions of her fellow students in a public school in Oklahoma . She said she was hurt and embarrassed to see the white children paint their faces and stick cardboard feathers in their hair while they danced and whooped like Hollywood Indians during Thanksgiving week . As a girl from a deeply traditional family , the actions of her classmates brought her to tears .
