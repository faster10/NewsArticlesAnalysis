Though publicly agnostic on the question of whether Curry ' s season is best , Kerr sees parallels to Jordan ' s impact on the public . " It ' s similar in people ' s reaction to when they see Michael or Steph , " Kerr begins . " Michael would just draw crowds everywhere . We ' d get to a hotel in the middle of the night , there ' d always be 50 to 100 people out there , 2 a . m . hoping for an autograph . People come before games to see these guys warm up . That happened with Michael . That happens now with Steph . There ' s sort of a fascination that happens now with Steph that reminds me a lot of people ' s infatuation with Michael . "
