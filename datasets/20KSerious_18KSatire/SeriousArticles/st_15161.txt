During World War II , the U . S . incarcerated as many as 120 , 000 Japanese , the majority of them American citizens , due to fears that they would act as fifth column for the Imperial Japanese Army . And during the Second World War , fear of an influx of refugees from the conflict in Europe , combined with anti Semitism , resulted in the notorious St . Louis tragedy . In this incident a ship , the St . Louis , carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazism in Europe was prevented from landing in Florida ( shots were fired across its bow to keep it away and the Coast Guard was dispatched to prevent it from landing ) . Its passengers were sent back to Europe where many disappeared in Nazi death camps .
