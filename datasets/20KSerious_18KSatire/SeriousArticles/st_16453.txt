i write songs all the time . sometimes they re just weird songs i sing while changing a baby , or songs about annoying things that i sing to myself , or to friends while sitting at a bar , or about christmas , or new york . sometimes these songs live in my head for years and have verses upon verses added to them , almost infinitely . sometimes they re just ghosts of ideas , and sometimes they re fully formed things which float in front of me , seeming like they d be easy to make flesh , only to fight furiously as soon as i try to pin them down in any way . some of them I make with friends in a room with instrument things . only a tiny fraction of these ever become Songs get recorded , feel like something that should be shared . those ones , i write the title or some lyrics of down on a page in a little book i carry around . or i sing a bit of them into a tape recorder ( or now a phone , I guess ) . i ve been doing this since i was a kid .
