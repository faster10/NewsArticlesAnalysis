Yeah , and I don ' t think he ' s done very many . I wouldn ' t characterize it as probing , but , because it was on the subject of the event , I was glad to be able to share with him what I was hearing from everybody which is that everyone was so impressed with his reemergence and a kind of new level of musicianship . I heard that from several people . And I passed that along to him , so more than sort of the interview I was glad to be able to communicate that to him , and he was , I think , flattered to hear that . But you know , he ' s really focused and hard at it , and I think he ' s really glad to be out there .
