John McCain: Benjamin Netanyahu should ‘speak to the American people’
Sen. John McCain said on Sunday the U.S. relationship with Israel has deteriorated and that ongoing talks with Iran over its development of nuclear weapons are not helping to ease built-up tensions. “They are convinced that these negotiations with Iran will lead to Iranian acquisition of a nuclear weapon, which will then nuclearize the entire Middle East,” the Arizona Republican said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Story Continued Below Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress in March at the behest of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), who bypassed the White House with the invitation. And the White House announced President Barack Obama will not meet with prime minister during that trip. McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he believes Netanyahu should explain his case and that any action taken by the Obama administration to change sanctions against Iran should be treated as a treaty and submitted for congressional approval. “I believe it’s important that Prime Minister Netanyahu speak to the American people and, by the way, we need congressional ratification of any decision that is made,” McCain said.
