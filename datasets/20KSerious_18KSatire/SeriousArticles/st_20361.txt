Not the perfect start as Nestor smashes home for 0 15 , and a double fault makes it 0 30 . Come on Jamie ! Soares swats away a volley on the next point to reduce the deficit to 15 30 , but a missed Murray backhand has them down 15 40 , and two break back points . The first one is saved , as Step ' s return crashes into Nestor , as is the second ! Nestor ' s return flies long . Two solid first serves there from Jamie , when he needed them most . And it ' s championship point when Nestor puts his volley wide after a brilliant lob from Murray . Can he do it ? The first serve is an ace , but it ' s a let ! This is so tense . You can do it Jamie . Oh my word , it looked like he had done it , but Nestor ' s return is excellent , and Murray can ' t get it back . Back to deuce . Feather light touch from Nestor on the next point earns he and Step a break point , and this time they take it ! Oh dear , we ' re back on serve .
