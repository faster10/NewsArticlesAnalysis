Cruz s positioning is one of the reasons that Marco Rubio ? who is the darling of the pundit class and the one candidate seen as the best hope for seriously challenging Hillary Clinton in the fall ? has started going after Cruz for previously supporting a measure that would have curtailed NSA data collection . Rubio has argued , dubiously , that doing so has made America more vulnerable to terrorism . On the surface , this is not a bad strategy ? it s hard to go wrong talking tough on national security if you re a Republican . But the NSA issue plays both ways . There are plenty of Republican libertarians who are none too happy about the government collecting the phone records of Americans . Cruz may indeed be vulnerable on national security , but this is hardly a silver bullet .
