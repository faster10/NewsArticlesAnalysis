We Africans want to worship God as Africans not as Westerners to think and talk about God as Africans , and to live and celebrate the Christian faith as Africans , in our own words , in our voices , and in our own style . These are the only way through which the Gospel come alive for us . They also are manifestations of the family traits of our Catholic faith and reveal the face of the God of Jesus Christ and our ancestors while pointing to the eschatological fruits of God ' s kingdom . The fifth Gospel which reflects African types and models of faith and life may be strange to many outside Africa , but in the stories of the daily struggles and joyful faith and strong hope of Africans in the trials and troubles of today one can see the revelation of God ' s presence and the surprises of the Holy Spirit .
