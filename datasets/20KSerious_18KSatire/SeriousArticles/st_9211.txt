Moscow insisted that the talks would not start unless Saleh Al Muslim , the powerful president of the Kurdish Democratic Party , was seated with the Syrian Opposition . Al Muslim had been excluded from the Riyadh Conference of the Syrian opposition , held in the Saudi capital in late 2015 , so as not to provoke the Turkish government , which considers Al Muslim a representative of a terror group . The solution currently on the table is for Russia to exclude Al Muslim ? for now ? in exchange for Saudi Arabia agreeing to pull back Al Zoubi and Alloush from the talks .
