Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded the first triple double of his career . Greg Monroe went 11 for 16 in the game , scoring 28 points . The defense held reigning MVP Curry to 2 for 8 shooting from the three point line . With time winding down , Michael Carter Williams provided the game s highlight with an emphatic dunk that put a symbolic full stop to the Warriors streak . The Bucks players deserve the majority of credit for this victory . As Curry pointed out after the game : for 48 minutes , I don t think anybody can say we played as hard as they did .
