Second , if Trump ' s and Cruz ' s estimates are both close to 50 percent , Trump ' s lead probability is slightly lower than when both candidates ' vote shares are in the 20s . The margin of error for an individual number in the poll decreases as the percentage estimate moves away from 50 percent either falling toward zero , or climbing toward 100 . ? So if Trump is polling at , say , 25 percent in one poll and 45 percent in another , his numbers have a smaller margin of error in the first poll . And similarly , if Trump is polling at 55 percent in one poll and 75 percent in another , his margin of error is smaller in the second poll the one that puts him further away from 50 percent .
