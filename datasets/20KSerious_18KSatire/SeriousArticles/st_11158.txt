Isaiah the prophet put it thus : " As high as the heavens are above the earth , so high are my thoughts above your thoughts and my ways above your ways , says the Lord . " And it is at the heart of the First Commandment : " I am the Lord your God you shall have no other gods besides me . " The Bible thus holds off all the attempts of human beings to divinize or render ultimate some worldly reality . The doctrine of creation , in a word , involves both a great " yes " and a great " no " to the universe .
