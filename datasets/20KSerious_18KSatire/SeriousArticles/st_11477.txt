So far , that political mission has been successful . Ukip s advance failed to prevent a Conservative majority and , although the few Tory MPs who are definitely opposed to EU membership are vocal , the big Tory split over Europe has not yet materialised . The mission to reform the EU and to renew its mandate from the British people , on the other hand , has been floundering . Mr Cameron is a pragmatist and proud of it . The Prime Minister has been sinuous in reflecting and appeasing public opinion , which is sceptical in the proper sense of the word about the EU . But even he must have had higher ambitions for Britain s role in the EU than the pile of fudge that is currently being cooked up in Brussels . ?
