Emory Baird of Brodnax , Virginia A quick game of shuffleboard was interrupted by an intercom announcement declaring one of the Trade Center towers had been hit by a stray plane . Completely oblivious to what was happening , I continued my game . As a result of the events and disappointment in myself over my reaction , I am now a state certified firefighter . I can only pray for the courage you all showed . A special thanks to FDNY , we haven ' t forgotten you . From Company 2 to you , thank you . You set the example for the world .
