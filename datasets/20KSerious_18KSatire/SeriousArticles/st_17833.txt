HORSE RACE POLLING HAS A LIMITED LIFE SPAN Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie : " Surveys of public opinion typically take place over two or three days then the results can start to age . If the immediacy of information is unimportant , the aging of a poll is not of great concern . This is especially the case if the information sought is unlikely to change due to outside events . During political campaigns , however , the information environment is dynamic , so poll results tend to age quickly . Depending on the information of interest to the reader , an aging poll might still be useful . But , if you are following the horse race ( who is leading an election in a hypothetical matchup ) and want to know the support for candidates or issues in a dynamic environment , a poll grows less valuable as it ages . In some elections where voters have limited information about the issues and don ' t know the candidates very well , horserace polling may be useless within a day or two of being completed .
