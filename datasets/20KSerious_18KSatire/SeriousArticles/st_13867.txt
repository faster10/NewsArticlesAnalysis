He was exonerated 18 years later when DNA testing was able to prove his innocence , and filed a 36 million lawsuit against Manitowoc County , former sheriff Thomas Kocourek , as well as former district attorney Denis Vogel . However , a couple years later , Avery and his nephew , Brendan Dassey , were charged with the murder of AutoTrader magazine photographer Teresa Halbach .
