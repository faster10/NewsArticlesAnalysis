Instead we ' ve had a lamentable apparent lack of transparency from the tour and Johnson ' s hapless management company that has just allowed the sorry mess to rumble on and on . If the Golf . com story is wrong , why isn ' t his agent expressing his fury and taking legal action ? Perhaps this is yet to happen . If not imagine what it will be like when Johnson does come back . You can picture the first question right now . ' Did you test positive for drugs ? ' And so on . All they have done is suspend the questions for another day .
