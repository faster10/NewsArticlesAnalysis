True , some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to Obama but most of it has to do with the message of the Democratic platform . Romney characterized 47 of the country as a bunch of moochers ( and coincidentally came away with 47 . 8 of the popular vote ) . That means a lot of voters : the numbers suggest 88 of the people who voted for Romney were white . That ' s a problem . If Democrats don ' t figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people , they could possibly lose the Senate .
