The slim drop does not mean that Rises will outgross The Dark Knight domestically it has virtually no chance of catching its 533 . 3 million total but it may very well outdo its predecessor worldwide thanks to stronger international grosses . The Dark Knight grossed 468 . 6 million overseas , which gave it a jaw dropping 1 . 002 billion cume worldwide . After three weekends , Rises has earned 378 . 4 million internationally ( for a 733 million worldwide total ) , and it looks like it is headed past the 1 billion mark as well . Although naysayers may point out that The Dark Knight Rises is performing below original domestic expectations , the film is clearly a hit .
