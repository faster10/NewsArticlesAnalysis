TC is dead on . This team doesn t deserve to win . I love how it s all TC s fault that our offense can t seem to score for an entire half when the org decided to replace a 2 time sb winning OC with MacAdoodoo . His offense is so great that it is held scoreless for an entire half and can barely run a 2 minute offense ? lol . Also , how come the DC is given a pass all season long ? We complained about the great , Radio , yet Spags defense is worse by a country mile ( with better players by the way ) . I realize that this is probably TC last year , but I have yet to hear anybody say who should replace him . Who ? ( crickets chirping ) .
