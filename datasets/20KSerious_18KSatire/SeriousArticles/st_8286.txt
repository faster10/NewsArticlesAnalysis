But you can either dwell on it or deal with it . I chose the latter . At 17 , I got my first job working at a video store . It helped me feel more " normal " and more " American , " even though I still couldn ' t legally drive . After I graduated , I started driving without a license . I had no choice I had to get to work and school . When most people my age were excited to drive , I felt the opposite . Every time I was behind the wheel , I had a constant fear of being pulled over . Yes there was some excitement , but that quickly faded when I realized the risks I ran . Being pulled over meant a ticket , my car being towed , and money to fix it all . When I was 21 , I got into a minor accident where I made a small dent on an older man ' s car . When I pulled over , I just remember wanting to disappear or die . My heart sank and I was scared out of my mind . I called my dad , who came over quickly with my uncle . As I waited , the man insulted me . When he learned I had no license he flipped , cursing me and calling me every name in the book . After that accident I was even more cautious when I drove .
