Santorum seemed frustrated to be left out of a back and forth between Christie and Jindal over how conservative their records were . This is a legitimate debate between Chris and Bobby between someone who says he can win in a blue state and someone who says he is a principled conservative , Santorum said . He raised his hands and paused signaling he was the true conservative eliciting laughter from the audience . Later , he said he respected Democrats because they fight , shouting the final word . I respect them because they are willing to take it to us .
