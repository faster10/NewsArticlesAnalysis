The shift in Republican views toward government from Bush to Obama is a reflection of rank partisanship , and nothing else . If Republicans were genuinely concerned about the size of the government or about encroachments upon individual liberty , there would be no reason to trust the Bush administration any more than the Obama administration .

On almost every front , Obama has either continued Bush s policies or tried desperately to clean up the mess he left behind .
