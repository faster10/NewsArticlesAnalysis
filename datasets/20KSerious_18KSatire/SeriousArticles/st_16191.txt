This was never going to be a repeat of their match on Tuesday when Federer pretty much caught Djokovic cold . Armed with such recent intelligence the Serb was always going to come much better prepared for the final and the contest was a tough , uncompromising one from the start . He was better in the group stage so I had to change something , Djokovic said . I returned better , made him play more shots . It s difficult to have time to do anything against him . All in all , it was a very solid performance . I was glad to keep the focus and concentration up after a long season . Now I go on holiday to recharge my batteries .
