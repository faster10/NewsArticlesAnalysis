VACCHIANO : Overall the Jets might have more talent ? especially young talent ? than the Giants . And with a new GM and coach who seem to have a plan , they re clearly on the upswing . But since we re talking the next five years , answer me this : Who ll be the Jets quarterback ? I can t take them seriously until they have a good answer for that question . Eli Manning isn t young anymore , but with Beckham at his side , in a bad division ( that most importantly doesn t include the Patriots ) , I could see him positioning the Giants for at least one more big run .
