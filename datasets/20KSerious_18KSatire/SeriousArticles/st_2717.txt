For those that talk bad about Harvin , now you see why teams seek after him . Reliable in the return game whether it s punts or kick offs and a highly talented second option . 19 catches for 218 yards yet played only 4 games and Bills clearly needed him this game . If only he wasn t injury prone . Taylor is tough too . Had his miscues but still his first full season he s play . They got things to work on overall but looking more like a team . Finally got the penalties down for the first time in two years .
