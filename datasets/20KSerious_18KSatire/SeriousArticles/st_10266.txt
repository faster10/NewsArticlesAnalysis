AR : I didn ' t feel , or sense , any bitterness or hate . That struck me very strongly . They were just there to remember and not to hate . When everything was over , we went to this little club that sits in the back of the village . Some of the older guys were out in the front , chatting and smoking and having a beer or wine . And we went in and got something to drink . They knew that we couldn ' t really speak Italian . We could just say hello . But there were a feeling of acceptance of " thank you for being here . "
