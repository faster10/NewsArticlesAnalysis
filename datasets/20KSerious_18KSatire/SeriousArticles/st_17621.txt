ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : The speed with which the Paris attacks went from a national security debate to an immigration one says more about the perceived state of today ' s Republican Party than it does about today ' s perceived security threats . The Republican contenders have sought to one up themselves with letters , bills , demands , and sound bites aimed at blocking the Obama administration from allowing Syrian Muslim refugees into the United States . Half the nation ' s governors almost all of them Republicans are threatening not to welcome them into their states , even though there ' s little they can do to bar them if the federal government accepts them as refugees . Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz have offered differing ( and mostly non specific , so far ) proposals to make it easier for Syrian Christians to enter the US as refugees , while potentially blocking Muslims . ( George W . Bush administration veterans Condoleezza Rice and Ari Fleischer are among those calling it a mistake to turn America ' s back on refugees , for what that ' s worth . ) The rhetoric brought a harsh rebuttal from President Obama , who called it " un American " to impose a religious test on refugees . It does not , for now , look un Republican in this primary season .
