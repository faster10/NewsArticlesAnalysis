" Digital technology has made it so much easier to access the past . You can YouTube almost any video , TV clip , or just the sound . It ' s used almost as an audio library , " said Simon Reynolds , author of " Retromania . " " Young people today know vastly more in terms of the history of music than I would have at their age , because I couldn ' t access it there were limits . Cassettes cost money . Now , you can listen to virtually anything for nothing , if you ' re willing to download illegally . You can school yourself on the whole history of music on YouTube . . . . It ' s not so much about finding new things , but about finding old things that are new to you . "
