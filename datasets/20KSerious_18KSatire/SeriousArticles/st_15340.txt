In my time in the United Kingdom , I have met refugees from places like Syria and Afghanistan , and all of them show signs of love and compassion , and are caring people who are fleeing persecution from groups like ISIS and the Taliban . They make a huge contribution to society . These are people who have lost everything from their homes , belongings , family members and relatives . The trauma and psychological impact they have faced is heart breaking . These are people with dreams and aspirations they are not terrorists .
