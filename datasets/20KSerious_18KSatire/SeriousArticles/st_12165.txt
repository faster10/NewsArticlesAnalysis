10 . Ojo Caliente ' s mineral waters have worked wonders for thousands of years . Ancestors of the native Tewa tribes , 16th century Spanish colonizers , and ailing bodies in search of a miracle cure have all made the pilgrimage to soak in the geothermal water that flows from an ancient volcanic aquifer to the surface at the rate of more than 100 , 000 gallons per day . Southwest of Taos , Ojo officially became a " spa " 145 years ago , but it still has public Lithia , Iron , Soda , and Arsenic springs . For privacy , rent a brand new Cliffside Suite with kiva fireplace and a private soaking tub .
