French President Francois Hollande indicated on Sunday that the nearly Rs 60 , 000 crore Rafale jets deal is unlikely to be signed during his current visit although it is on the " right track " . " The Rafale is a major project for India and France . It will pave the way for an unprecedented industrial and technological cooperation , including ' Make in India ' , for the next 40 years . " Agreeing on the technicalities of this arrangement obviously takes time , but we are on the right track " , Hollande told PTI in an interview ahead of his visit beginning today .
