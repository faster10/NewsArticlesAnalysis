Russell : I ' m inspired by the people I work with . At the Genius Lab , we have three incredible artists . Ernest English makes enormous participatory public art pieces . Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates very large scale work . When I saw her photos , I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background . And then there ' s the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163 . She is a joy to work with , and her piece is all about love , which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about LGBT .
