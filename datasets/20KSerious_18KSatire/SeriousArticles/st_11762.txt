Interestingly , though , if you look at rationale contained within the State Department s just released determination that the Keystone XL project is not in the national interest , it isn t centrally built around the idea that the emissions caused or enabled by Keystone XL will be very large and a direct climate problem . Rather , it s that the global ? perception of encouraging development of a relatively dirty fuel would undermine the U . S . s position of climate leadership , which would , in turn , undermine the willingness of other countries to cut their emissions too ? and it s through that pathway that the climate could ultimately be harmed .
