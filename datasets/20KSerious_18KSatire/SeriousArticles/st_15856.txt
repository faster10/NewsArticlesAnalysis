You ' re favored by two touchdowns , you have the best defense in the country and you ' re going up against one of the least threatening offenses in the SEC . So what ' s the one thing you can do to lose the game ? That ' s right , turn the ball over . It cost Alabama against Ole Miss and it could cost the Tide again if they give Florida free possessions . What ' s more , Alabama ' s offense needs to be sharper than last week against Auburn when they settled for field goals too often . If Derrick Henry is bottled up by a very good Florida defense , then it will be up to Jake Coker to move the ball downfield without throwing interceptions something he hasn ' t been asked to do much this season .
