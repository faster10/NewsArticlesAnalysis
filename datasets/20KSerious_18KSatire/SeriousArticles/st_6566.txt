I don ' t bring this up because I care whether any particular candidate ends up winning the presidential nomination of his or her particular party . I don ' t mention it out of exasperation with the speculative filler that has passed for much of political coverage and analysis for the last year . I understand the need to be selective about media consumption , especially when it comes to political coverage . So I ' ve limited my exposure to occasional news pieces , columns and relevant televised coverage . ( And the work of satirist Andy Borowitz for The New Yorker . Sample headline : " Trump : I would attack ISIS on Twitter . " )
