MONDELLO : He ' s a ghost . And it ' s a lovely romance , and he ' s lovely in it . And I think everybody saw that he had another side . Ang Lee hired him to play a part in " Sense And Sensibility " shortly thereafter . He was an actor I mean , you know , he was a classically trained actor in Britain and had done a lot of stage roles . And so he could pretty much slip into something rather quickly . And he actually won a Tony Award , I think , for " Les Liaisons Dangereuses " on Broadway , playing another villain . But then he was very funny in shows like " Private Lives " on stage . So he was just all over the place .
