No . 4 : Perez was named World Series MVP , but they could have picked just about anybody from the Royals lineup . Perez hit . 364 ( 8 for 22 ) in the series , but Mike Moustakas did everything right at third base and hit . 304 ( 7 for 23 ) . Ben Zobrist seemed to double everytime he swung the bat , while Alex Gordon set the tone for the series with his game tying homer in the ninth inning of Game 1 as the Royals came from behind in each of their four victories . Hosmer hit only . 190 , but he led the team with six RBI along with his well timed dash home in the ninth inning Sunday night .
