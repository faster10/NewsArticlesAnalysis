KERBER VS . KONTA : These are two players not used to getting this far in a Grand Slam tournament No . 7 seeded Kerber has done it twice , once each at the U . S .

Konta was born in Sydney , Australia but took British citizenship in 2012 after having lived there since 2005 . She also carries a Hungarian passport because her parents are from there , so she refers to herself as a ' ' tri citizen .

Not that it matters to her . ' ' No , no , that ' s absolutely fine , ' ' she says . ' ' I mean , I think I would be a real princess if I was complaining . ' '
