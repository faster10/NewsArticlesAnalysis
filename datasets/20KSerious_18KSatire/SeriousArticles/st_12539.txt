Oil is selling for less than 50 a barrel today . That ' s less than half the price when the Keystone XL pipeline was proposed in 2008 . According to the State Department ' s environmental review , at prices above 75 per barrel , producers would find it worthwhile to develop the tar sands with or without a pipeline . The efficiency of pipeline transportation is most important to tar sands development at prices between 65 and 75 per barrel . And at prices below 65 per barrel , it may not be worth producing tar sands oil , even if cheap pipeline transportation is available .
