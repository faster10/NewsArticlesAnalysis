Excited and moved. It was an adventure to get it on screen--we wanted to make a movie that was true to Nick Pileggi's book and to the life of Henry Hill and his friends, which means that we broke some rules and took some risks," Scorsese said in a statement. "So it's heartening to know that 'GoodFellas' has come to mean so much to so many people. It's wonderful to see one of your pictures revived and re-seen, but to see it closing Tribeca, a festival of new movies, means the world to me."De Niro, who co-founded the Tribeca Film Festival, added: "I was most proud of this film 25 years ago and equally proud of it now."The festival runs April 15-26.
