The Kurdish freedom fighters are certainly ground troops who do need support . That does mean we should challenge Britain s Nato ally Turkey , which allows jihadis to cross the border and keep attacking the Kurds . Western backed states like Saudi Arabia need confronting because they are the root of international extremism . Whatever happens ? and the British contribution to bombing raids will be probably relatively tiny any way ? there needs to be renewed focus on a settlement involving all the key regional players . This would establish a national unity government that could command the confidence of the Sunni majority , which could then suffocate Isis . Nobody pretends that is easy . But there are real doubts over this latest military campaign , and they need to be voiced .
