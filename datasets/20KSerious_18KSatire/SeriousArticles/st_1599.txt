Going forward , The Atlantic ( and any other publication that chooses to run sponsored content ) should adopt and clearly communicate an explicit ethics statement regarding advertorials and their corresponding comments . This statement should guide the decisions it makes when working with advertisers , and serve as a filter for the sponsored content it chooses to publish , and what it recommends advertisers submit . It should also prevent readers from being silenced if given a platform at all .
