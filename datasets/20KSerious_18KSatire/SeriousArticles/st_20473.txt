Downer has innumerable Bryant stories to share from his time at Lower Merion , including the time he angrily chased a teammate into the hallway for failing to give him the ball for the last shot in the team scrimmage .

A few days before a state semifinal game against rival Chester , Bryant went diving for a loose ball in practice when he collided with a teammate and left a puddle of blood on the court from a broken nose .

He listened while Bryant unfurled a round of profanities . Then he watched Bryant angrily rip off the mask , smash it into a wall and shout , " Let ' s go to war ! "
