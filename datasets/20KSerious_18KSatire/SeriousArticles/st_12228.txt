Emmy winning actress Viola Davis says she would not blame the Academy for the lack of diversity at the upcoming awards but the Hollywood filmmaking system , which gives less opportunities to a colour artists . " The problem is not with the Oscars , the problem is with the Hollywood movie making system , " the two time Oscar nominee said at Elle ' s sixth Annual Women in Television Dinner . After Academy voters failed to nominate a black actor in any of the acting categories for the second year in a row , Davis said the questions Academy voters should be asking themselves are , " How many black films are being produced every year ? How are they being distributed ? The films that are being made , are the big time producers thinking outside of the box in terms of how to cast the role ? " she said .
