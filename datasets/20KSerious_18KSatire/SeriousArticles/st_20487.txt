Sherman : The way it works is that Fox is a place where everyone is trying to maximize their own power and everyone is trying to use leverage . Historically , Roger Ailes has had the most leverage . The network functions as an expression of his worldview , and the only main exception to that was Bill O Reilly , because he built his own audience . He was , for years , the highest rated host on the network . He really had the only show that started working in the late 90s , during the Clinton scandals . Ailes has less power with O Reilly than he does with other talent .
