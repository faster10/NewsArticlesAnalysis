What is Ted Cruz watching on TV?
With a presidential bid underway, Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz won't have a lot of time on his hands for leisure. But "CBS This Morning" co-host Gayle King wanted to find what he likes to watch and listen to when he does have the time. "I just finished watching the third season of House of Cards," Cruz said in an interview Tuesday on "CBS This Morning." "Fortunately there are fewer murders in politics in real life."As for music, Cruz said he grew up listening to classic rock, but the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 changed that. "On 9/11 I didn't like how rock music responded," Cruz said. "Country music collectively, the way they responded, it resonated with me...at a gut level I had an emotional reaction that said, 'these are my people.' And so ever since 2001 I listen to country music but I'm an odd country music fan because I didn't listen to it prior to 2001."
