Holsworth noted that the chances of McAuliffe passing some of his top legislative priorities , like Medicaid expansion , with the House in firm GOP control were already slim .

With little hope for major Democratic leaning legislative successes , McAuliffe will be free to focus even more on economic development efforts .
