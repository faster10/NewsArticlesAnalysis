Matt Harvey had allowed one Royals baserunner to reach second base over eight innings . Against the team that does not strike out , Harvey got nine of them . If it wasn ' t his booming fastball , it was his slider . If not that , his changeup . Then , his curveball . In a single inning , the fourth , Harvey struck out Lorenzo Cain on a changeup , Eric Hosmer on a curveball and Mike Moustakas on a fastball , at 97 mph . He was powerful . He was clever . This was to be his signature game , except a game is nine innings not eight , which is , generally , what he told the pitching coach , Dan Warthen , when Warthen notified him he ' d done his part after eight innings .
