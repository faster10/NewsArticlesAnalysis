But there is no doubt that Islamist intellectual pioneer Sayyid Qutb and the founders of al Qaida and the leadership of ISIS all considered themselves to be following the Wahhabist and or Salafist tradition , which has found its fullest expression in Saudi Arabia . Osama bin Laden was born and raised in Saudi Arabia , and 15 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the 9 11 attacks were Saudi citizens . Anomalies , you say ? A handful of disgruntled outsiders in a stable , pro Western society ? Mm hm , OK . You go right on thinking that , darlings .
