ANALYSIS ABC ' s RICK KLEIN : So he ' s not Bob Dole ' s favorite guy , just like he isn ' t George W . Bush ' s man , or John McCain ' s . ( Can you be disliked by three more effective boldfaced names , in the modern iteration of the Republican Party ? ) Ted Cruz isn ' t playing their game because he ' s playing a different one entirely , in casting himself as the right blend for a frustrated GOP that ' s sick of losing and sicker still of the party establishment . Cruz is quickly developing into the man to watch , for his understanding of the primary electorate and the deft ways he uses that knowledge . As Jeff Greenfield notes in a Politico piece , Cruz may be the most effective debater in the Republican field because he ' s playing chess while his opponents play checkers . He ' s executing a game plan that ' s hard to read from the sidelines somehow , he pseudo attacked Marco Rubio on a high profile issue ( immigration ) and a low profile one ( sugar subsidies ) without having to utter Rubio ' s name . Cruz ' s camp sees itself as the potential heir to Ben Carson ' s horde of voters . He ' s looking like the next man to watch in the still fluid race and with Cruz , it ' s never dull . http : politi . co 1SL2Hzy
