3 . Jared Goff , California : The Golden Bears ' offense struggled to finish drives while missing running backs Daniel Lasco and Khalfani Muhammad in their 35 22 loss at Stanford , but Goff played a fantastic game that reminded us of why he ' s a top NFL prospect . The junior finished 37 of 54 for 386 yards and a pair of scores . Several of his throws , including a scoring toss to Darius Powe , followed an almost artistic trajectory that weaved through multiple Cardinal defenders . Goff ' s arm strength was also on full display during this game , as he made several accurate passes across the field from the far side hash mark . Goff was impressive , but his team ' s overall performance simply was not complete .
