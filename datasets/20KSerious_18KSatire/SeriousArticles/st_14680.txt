That was followed up by 2010 another absolutely insane year in that the Cavaliers didn ' t make the Finals . The Celtics were not good that season . I will stand by this until the end of time . They were bad for long stretches and were generally just trying to get through the season . They flipped the switch in a big way , and even then , really struggled in that first round matchup . Then everything just came together and through sheer force of will , the Celtics brought themselves past Cleveland and Orlando to the Finals . It is both a credit to the Celtics that they were able to not play all that well and still find ways to win , and a damning condemnation of the Cavaliers that they didn ' t have the fortitude to find ways to get past Boston . James of course struggled in that series and departed for Miami months later .
