Mushers estimate costs at close to 20 , 000 just to compete in the long distance event including a 4 , 000 entrance fee , the year long training of a dog team and the necessary supplies to be stocked all the way along the 1 , 150 mile trail . Many mushers compete with dog teams borrowed from other kennels to defray their own expenses .
