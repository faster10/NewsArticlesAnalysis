It s worth noting that , though certainly not perfect , O Malley deserves better treatment than this . As I ve discussed before , O Malley has a decent record as governor of Maryland , from legalizing same sex marriage and abolishing the death penalty to raising the minimum wage and extending in state tuition breaks to undocumented immigrants . Just as importantly , he lacks many of the electability concerns that beset Clinton ( who has been a polarizing and scandal plagued figure since her days as First Lady ) and Sanders ( who could be painted as a radical in the general election ) . In an election year that could see the Democratic nominee facing off against Donald Trump or Ted Cruz , any politically viable option with a progressive record at the very least warrants serious consideration .
