These teams played in Week 10 in what was one of the season s most shocking results : an 18 16 Lions win at Lambeau Field , the franchise s first win there since 1991 . Of course , the Packers , an 11 1 ? 2 point favorite , were my Lock of the Week . I can t figure this team out . It started 6 0 and looked like a lock to make Super Bowl 50 . Now , after four losses in five games , it ll probably have to win three road games as a wild card to make it there . Not having Jordy Nelson is hurting more than most thought , and it s made Aaron Rodgers look human at times .
