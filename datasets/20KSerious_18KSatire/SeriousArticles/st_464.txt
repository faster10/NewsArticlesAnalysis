Not Impossible just kept growing because of passionate , brilliant people who were always willing and able to do good , but just needed a place to point their energy . A guy up in Canada named Javed Gangjee saw a TED talk I gave about the Eyewriter , decided he wanted in , and started devoting all his spare time to taking it one step further . The Eyewriter relies on the patient ' s ability to blink , as a way to " click " the cursor the way you ' d click a mouse . But what about patients who can ' t control their ocular muscles anymore ? he asked . Don ' t they deserve to communicate , too ? So he started devoting all his spare time to hooking our Eyewriter device up to an EEG a homemade device to register brain activity as a way of clicking a mouse .
