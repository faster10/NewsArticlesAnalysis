Here s a thorough look at Chicago Police Department s policy on lying and how rarely it s punished in a report by DNAinfo s Mark Konkol ( and then costaffer Quinn Ford ) . This piece ran in 2013 . Here s what Garry McCarthy said about the practice then : The third rail in departments across the country is Rule 14s , lying . You lie , you die , that s what they call it in Boston . You get terminated if you lie during an official investigation . And I support that , McCarthy said . If you boldface lie . . . my policy is termination . It has to do with our credibility . There s no evidence any cops were fired after the incident . http : dnain . fo 1XOgLP7
