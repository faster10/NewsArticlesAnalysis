The Healthy Indiana Plan ' s key departure from traditional Medicaid is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts . The program was developed under former Gov . Mitch Daniels and initially served about 40 , 000 adults under a Medicaid waiver that HHS granted before Obamacare ' s existence . After Pence was elected in 2012 , he said a slightly updated version called the " Healthy Indiana Plan 2 . 0 " is the only vehicle he ' d consider for expanding coverage .
