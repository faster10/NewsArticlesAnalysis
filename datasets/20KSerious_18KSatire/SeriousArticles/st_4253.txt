As a professor at Georgetown I have taught many outstanding young officers over the past 14 years . I have kept in touch with many : some are still in uniform they give me firsthand reports of the glory and the errors of today ' s military . Others are in civilian life : they connect me to the ground level challenges young veterans face , from the job market to navigating the VA . If you really love your country , the least you can do is be able to name someone who is sacrificing for your freedom .
