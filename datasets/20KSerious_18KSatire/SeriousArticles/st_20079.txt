Getting to 100 clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies , profits and influence are all at stake . But this change is possible we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels . In May , Denmark published a plan to get to 100 clean by 2050 , at a cost of less than 20 Euros per Dane per year . Countries as diverse as Norway and Uruguay are already nearly at 100 clean . Even China , the world ' s biggest carbon emitter , is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on Earth .
