Senior military leaders ? tapped by Obama for their posts ? have gone along with his incremental approach . At his confirmation hearing to serve as the nation s top military officer in July , Marine General Joseph Dunford said the military , by itself , cannot destroy ISIS .

Beyond military might , he said it will take local ground forces , effective local governments , a halt in ISIS financing and tighter borders in the region to prevail ? a tall order for a region wracked by instability .
