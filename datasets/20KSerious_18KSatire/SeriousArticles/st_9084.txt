Even if you just can ' t bring yourself to believe that people who take civil liberties seriously have long held serious civil libertarian criticisms of campaign finance laws , or if you simply think they ' re all wrong , I ' ll offer this last salve : It has never been easier for groups of citizens to swarm together and flow money through the Internet toward campaigns and candidates who excite them . Ask Ron Paul or more relevantly , Barack Obama what ' s more powerful : 10 million from Dr Evil Industries , or 10 each from 1 million people who can actually vote ?
