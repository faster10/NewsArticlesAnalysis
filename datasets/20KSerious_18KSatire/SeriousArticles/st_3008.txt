The original trilogy ? Star Wars ( 1977 ) , The Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 ) and Return of the Jedi ( 1983 ) ? have proved so enduring that even Lucas later missteps haven t damaged the brand . The second three films , beginning with The Phantom Menace ( 1999 ) , were often criticized as pandering and even a little boring , but all were blockbusters . ( Robbins estimates that the number of actual tickets sold for Phantom is still among the highest in history . ) Lucas further angered fans by rereleasing the original films with slicker special effects and re edited scenes .
