Cologne , a city of more than 1 million people , had added just 142 extra police for the holiday . Most had only come on duty at 10 : 00 p . m . As every German now knows , the small police force would prove incapable of preventing the crowd on that square from committing hundreds of assaults on women , stealing their valuables , groping and even raping them . The incidents have caused profound soul searching in a country that allowed in an unprecedented 1 . 1 million migrants last year in what its leaders described as an act of historic generosity toward refugees . Germans , who have prided themselves for generations in an orderly society that requires only gentle policing , are beginning to come to terms with change on a vast scale .
