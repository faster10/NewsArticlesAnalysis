It s possible that Frank Luntz s focus group ( which isn t really a focus group at all ) does not reflect the views of any substantial number of Republicans . These dial demonstrations are as much parlor game as they are legitimate research . But wouldn t it be nice if it really did reveal that the rank and file GOP are willing to listen to someone who says that the party has to take some responsibility for the state of our politics today ? That a Republican leader could still say that welcoming immigrants is still an American value ?
