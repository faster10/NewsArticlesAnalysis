As the hashtag OscarsSoWhite began trending , just as it did last year , ceremony host Chris Rock joked in a Twitter promo that he was thrilled to be hosting The White BET Awards . Then it got serious . Spike Lee , who was honored at the Academy s Governors Awards months ago , and Jada Pinkett Smith announced they were boycotting this year s Oscars and encouraged others to join them . Note : Lee clarified to Good Morning , America on Wednesday that although he would not attend the Oscars , I have never used the word boycott . I m not going , my wife s not going . Everyone else can do what they want to do . ? Rock began facing pressure to resign as host in protest . Each day , more high profile figures are lending their voices to the chorus calling for change . For 20 opportunities to celebrate actors of color , actresses of color , to be missed last year is one thing , said David Oyelowo , who starred as Dr Martin Luther King Jr . in the Oscar nominated Selma , at an event on Jan . 18 . For that to happen again this year is unforgivable .
