There was no other performance in 2013 ( yes , even Matthew McConaughey s Oscar winning one ) that was as insanely impactful as DiCaprio s Jordan Belfort .

Remember that inspirational monologue with the lions and cocaine and freeze frames ? It s enough to make Gordon Gekko look over his shoulder .
