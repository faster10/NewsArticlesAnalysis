As his daughter , who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words , I am one who believes that the man who , on March 7 , 1965 , listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the Governor ' s Mansion from Selma , Alabama , was not the same man who , in March of 1995 , was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of African American men , women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers , retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from Selma to Montgomery .
