Start with Kelly as a coach . He doesn ' t exactly have the resume of a guy about to be forced out of a job . Put the Thanksgiving mess aside for a moment and consider the body of work . The 2015 Eagles are a disappointing 4 7 after Thursday ' s blowout defeat , but Kelly is now a combined 24 19 ( . 558 ) after leading a team that had gone 4 12 in 2012 to consecutive 10 win seasons . To contrast , Gus Bradley took over a 2 14 Jags team that same offseason and has gone 11 31 ( . 262 ) since , and there has been no guillotine putting down a rent deposit in Jacksonville . The argument from Kelly doubters is that the man has gone 5 10 in his past 15 games , but that ' s a totally arbitrary end point . For reference , Kelly went 11 4 in the previous 15 games before that stretch , and you can see how much predicative value that 15 game sample had .
