Cruz s bet , however , is that Trump and Carson eventually collapse . Although it s possible that Trump and Carson hang around until the convention , it s not the most likely scenario . Trump has proven himself vulnerable in recent months , and one suspects his farcical adventure could end at any moment . The RNC also knows Trump would be a disaster as a general election candidate , and they ll do everything possible to torpedo his campaign . I m not confident they can stop Trump , but it remains to be seen .
