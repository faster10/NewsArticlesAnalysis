In many ways the British social structure is now less European than before . In all of Europe the degradation ( and denigration ) of its traditional working class has gone furthest , its management is the most Americanised . Income distribution has become more unequal and so , despite considerable amelioration under the New Labour governments ( 1996 ? 2010 ) , the UK has some of the most extreme poverty in western Europe . The changes since the Thatcher revolution have made Britain a more market based society than any other in Europe .
