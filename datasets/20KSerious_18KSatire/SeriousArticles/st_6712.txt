Reasons to be excited : The 11 5 Chiefs certainly have momentum on their side as they ' ve won 10 straight games after their dismal 1 5 start . They beat the Broncos 29 13 in Denver on Nov . 15 . The Chiefs are getting back to full health defensively . One of their top pass rushers , Tamba Hali , played against the Raiders for the first time since breaking his thumb . The other , Justin Houston , returned to practice last week , though he didn t play against the Raiders . Houston didn t play in the team ' s last five regular season games because of a knee injury .
