Dr Clare Walton , of the Alzheimer ' s Society charity , said : ' The finding that people who are obese in their 30s are three times more likely to get dementia is striking , but it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a study where only 19 of the 451 , 232 people observed were obese in their 30s and went on to develop dementia . Given the growing body of evidence that being overweight in mid life rather than in later years seems to be the bigger risk factor for dementia , it is never too early to start making healthy lifestyle choices .
