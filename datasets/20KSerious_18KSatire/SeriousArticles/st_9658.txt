Tonya Couch , 48 , was brought back to Tarrant County , Texas , this week after her deportation from Mexico , where her son , Ethan Couch , remains in an immigration detention facility . Fred Couch filed for divorce in August , accusing Tonya Couch of cruel treatment toward him , but the divorce is still pending , according to court records . We have also never seen or heard of a sheriff taking the additional unprecedented step that he took earlier today of interrogating her while in custody at court today ( surrounded by four deputies ) and while clearly represented by counsel , but without her counsel present ! If she is released , she ll be required to wear an ankle monitor and give up her passport as conditions of her bond .
