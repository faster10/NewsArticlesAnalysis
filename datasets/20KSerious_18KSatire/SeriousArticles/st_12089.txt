Two American government agencies , NASA and NOAA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , compile separate analyses of the global temperature , based upon thousands of weather stations and ocean buoys scattered around the world . They released their results yesterday , showing 2015 as the warmest year in a global record that began in 1880 . Preliminary data from the Japan Meteorological Agency also show record warmth for 2015 , and a British monitoring program is expected to report a similar result in coming weeks .
