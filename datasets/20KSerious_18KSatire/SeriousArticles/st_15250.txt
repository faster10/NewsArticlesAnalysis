Rand further expounded on her beliefs in essays that were published in her newsletters , and in anthologies with titles like " The Virtue of Selfishness " and " Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal . " The latter , first published in 1966 , contained three essays by Alan Greenspan , one of which argued forcefully against all forms of regulation , even building codes . These essays were published by Rand and reflected her thinking . His strident essays for that book , which he has never repudiated or withdrawn from publication , were echoed by his actions in the 1990s as a principal supporter of financial deregulation in his capacity as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
