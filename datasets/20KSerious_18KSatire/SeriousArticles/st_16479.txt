I m not saying that we want to select who is nominated or wins , but if you are telling me out of best actor , best actress , best supporting actor , best supporting actress ? out of 40 slots , two years in a row , that there are no blacks and no browns who rose to a level of being considered , that s hard to believe , he said . That s unacceptable . Then I have the right to say , You know what , you can do what you want , but you won t do it with my support . Let s see if advertisers and others think that you are as attractive to pay those high fees if they know that sizeable portions of the population will not be watching your show the night it airs Advertisers don t want to be identified with institutional patterns of discrimination .
