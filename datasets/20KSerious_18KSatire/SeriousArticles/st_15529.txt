The centerpiece of his earlier years was the War on Poverty . In his State of the Union address in January 1964 , Johnson said : " Unfortunately , many Americans live on the outskirts of hope some because of their poverty , and some because of their color , and all too many because of both . Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity . This administration today , here and now , declares unconditional war on poverty in America . . . . The richest nation on earth can afford to win it . We cannot afford to lose it . "
