It was both amusing and painful to watch . I ' m not sure whether to applaud Cain for not knowing how to lie with the panache of other Republican presidential hopefuls , or tell him to run for the exit . I hope he doesn ' t quit the race , as some Beltway commentators are suggesting he should do not because this scandal is so bad that he can ' t recover , but because the elite media can ' t wait to clear the field and get to what they think will be the main event : Mitt Romney versus Barack Obama .
