Smith told an Atlanta radio station in 1993 , mid original controversy , " I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt Viv of Bel Air Show because I know she is going to dog me in the press . She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing . She ' s mad now but she ' s been mad all along . She said once , I ' ve been in the business for 10 years and this snotty nosed punk comes along and gets a show . ' No matter what , to her I ' m just the Antichrist . "
