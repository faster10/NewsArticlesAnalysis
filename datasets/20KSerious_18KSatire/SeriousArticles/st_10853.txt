New York managed to flip multiple storylines on their heads . While the Royals ' ability to make contact is obvious , the Mets swung and missed at just two pitches from Royals starter Edinson Volquez . About 20 minutes before the first pitch , reports from the Dominican Republic said Daniel Volquez , Edinson ' s father , had died at 63 . Whether Volquez was aware of his father ' s passing was unclear the Royals said he did not know , while an ESPN report said Volquez learned of it on the way to the stadium .
