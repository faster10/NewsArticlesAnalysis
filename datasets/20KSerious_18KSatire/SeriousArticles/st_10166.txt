On July 26 , Palin will be a free woman . No longer will she have to juggle official responsibilities , a national political following and her children . She can travel freely to the Lower 48 without worrying about how it may affect her standing back home . She can defend herself and her family against slander without the controversy distracting from the duties of high office . She can make money to pay the bills . She can pick her battles without being hemmed in by the state legislature and bureaucracy .
