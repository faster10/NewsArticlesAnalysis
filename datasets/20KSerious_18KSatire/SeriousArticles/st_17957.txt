Brady has said he wants to play another 10 years , and even though that would be highly unlikely considering he will be 39 in August , as long as he stays healthy , he has another three or four years left at a high level . Manning s body appears to be held together by Scotch tape and Band Aids . He will be 40 in March , and considering his physical ailments the last few years ( ankle , thigh , foot ) and the decreasing velocity of what never was a real fastball , this is surely his last shot at getting his second Super Bowl ring . Brady is going for his fifth , which would break the tie with Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana .
