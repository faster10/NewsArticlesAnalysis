At The Mission Continues , we challenge veterans to serve and inspire in communities across America . We are creating successful transitions by engaging returning veterans in six month fellowships at nonprofit and public service organizations in their home communities . During their fellowships , our veterans are provided with a stipend , mentors , and an intensive curriculum designed to achieve one of three post fellowship goals . They go on to full time employment , full time education , or participate in an ongoing role of service in their communities .
