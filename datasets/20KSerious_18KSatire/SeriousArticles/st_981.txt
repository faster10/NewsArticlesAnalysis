LENNON : Other than Jeurys Familia and Bartolo Colon ' s successful playoff cameo there wasn ' t much to be impressed about with this year ' s group . Addison Reed , eligible for arbitration , will get a bump up from his 4 . 87 million salary this season , and the Mets don ' t have any suitable in house replacements . Alderson will just have to see what shakes loose in the reliever market , and that usually doesn ' t develop until December ' s winter meetings or later . As desperate as the Mets are for bullpen help , we don ' t see them rolling the dice again with the twice suspended Jenrry Mejia , however .
