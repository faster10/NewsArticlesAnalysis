The military aligned party , the Union Solidarity and Development Party led by president Thein Sein , has campaigned on its record of running the government the last five years and a promise to guarantee stability . Suu Kyi s campaign has centred on strengthening the rule of law . The new government will inherit immense problems : sectarian violence , fighting with ethnic militias , rampant cronyism and corruption , and inadequate infrastructure and financial institutions to attract foreign investment . Some parts of the country are controlled by ethnic militias , and several of Burma s leading exports , including jade , opium and timber , have been tied to conflict , crime and corruption .
