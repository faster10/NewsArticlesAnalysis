One month after the revolution , we had a referendum on the constitutional amendments . Massive number of Egyptians motivated by their hunger for democracy participated in the poll . As a woman rights activist , I seized the opportunity to test people ' s willingness to include women in their vision of democracy . I ran a survey about whether " it is good for Egypt to have a woman president " outside polling stations in three areas Nasr City , Shubra , and Downtown . With the help of two interns , we surveyed 1453 people , including 634 women . The answer for my survey question was " 100 no . " Ironically , most of the words that followed this extreme " no " was loaded with much hatred and derision toward women . Despite the impressive role of women in the revolution , most Egyptians still believe that women are made for kitchen not for office .
