For that reason , Bill Belichick is going to coach his defense to stop C . J . Anderson and Ronnie Hillman on the ground , not the passing game with Manning . As much as today s NFL is about throwing the ball , the Broncos can t win that way with Manning throwing the way he is . They gained plenty of chunk yardage on the ground the last time they played the Patriots , and Kubiak s run scheme has historically succeeded against Belichick s defense . In six career games against the Patriots as a head coach , Kubiak s offenses have rushed 159 times for 740 yards , a 4 . 65 average , with 13 touchdowns .
