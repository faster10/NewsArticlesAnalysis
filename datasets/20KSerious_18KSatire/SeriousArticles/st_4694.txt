It was at the end of last season when Panthers general manager Dave Gettleman truly caught on to Newton ' s growth as a passer . He watched Newton turn a 3 8 1 team last year into a division winner in the final month of the season . The Panthers won their final four games last year and beat the Arizona Cardinals in the playoffs . It was that stretch run that solidified Gettleman ' s belief in Newton as a complete player , and he signed Newton to a contract extension . Gettleman didn ' t blink when he gave Newton a five year , 103 . 8 million deal . He knew he had a once in a generation quarterback who was evolving into something special .
