The senior officials said Obama ' s action planned for Monday at the White House would amend two executive orders . The first , signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 , prohibits federal contractors from discriminating based on race , religion , gender or nationality in hiring . Obama plans to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protections , and order the Labor Department to carry out the order . The officials said that means the change will probably take effect by early next year .
