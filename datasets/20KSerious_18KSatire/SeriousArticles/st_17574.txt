On third and 1 , NC State backup quarterback Jalan McClendon ( a freshman who hadn ' t played since September ) fumbled , and Syracuse ' s Oliver Vigille not only recovered it but returned it for a touchdown . The Wolfpack now led 42 23 and were covering by a half point . On the next play , the Orange recovered an onside kick and all of sudden , those who took the Wolfpack were starting to sweat . Syracuse drove down to NC State ' s 3 yard line and had a fourth and goal to determine which team would cover . That team wouldn ' t be NC State , which allowed Zack Mahoney to hook up with Steve Ishmael for a touchdown that made the final margin 13 . It marked just the second time in the last two seasons that Syracuse scored multiple touchdowns in the fourth quarter .
