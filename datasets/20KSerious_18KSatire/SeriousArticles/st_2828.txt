Cruz bashes the Washington cartel . . . b ut 16 years ago , as a young domestic policy adviser for Bush s 2000 campaign , Cruz himself had sought Washington s embrace . He d . . . taken an 80 percent pay cut and moved to Austin , with visions of a big , important White House job to follow . . . . In the Bush campaign Cruz was known for trying to angle additional time with Bush , both on the trail and at the governor s mansion , where the policy team would brief Bush in private sessions . . . . He lacks a subtlety that a lot of other people bring . He makes it feel like he wears his ambitions on his sleeve , said one Bush 2000 aide . http : politi . co 23qg9iU
