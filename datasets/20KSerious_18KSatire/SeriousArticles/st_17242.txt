Last night , Labour MP Graham Stringer led calls for a wide ranging frontbench reshuffle after next month ' s Scottish referendum . He told The Mail on Sunday : ' There needs to be a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle before the Labour party conference . After Scotland votes No to independence he Miliband should bring back Alistair Darling , who led the anti independence campaign , and former Home Secretary Alan Johnson . Both of them have bags of experience , which our frontbench lacks . We also need to match the Tories ' new found focus and drive . '
