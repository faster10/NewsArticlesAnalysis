Grylls : People said you must ' ve been positive to go through a broken back but the truth was it wasn ' t like that . It was a very dark time with struggle and doubt . I think the hard thing for me was not knowing . None of the doctors could tell me if I would walk properly again or climb properly again . I realized I could determine what was best for me and that ' s why I chose ( to climb ) Mount Everest as the goal . People looked at me like I was crazy , but the staff at the rehab center knew the power of a dream and having a focus like that .
