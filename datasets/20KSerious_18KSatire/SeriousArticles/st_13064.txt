The only reason Smith isn t a must start play is because of the depth of the quarterback position . He has played great football all season and should take advantage of the Chargers , but can you really start him over Drew Brees , Russell Wilson , Ryan Fitzpatrick or Tyrod Taylor , the quarterbacks I have ninth through 12th , this week ? Smith is my No . 13 quarterback , and I ll be starting him confidently in a two QB league . He had 253 yards on 25 attempts the first time these teams played , but didn t throw for a touchdown . That should be different this Sunday . Woodhead hasn t been immune to the unraveling in San Diego , scoring one touchdown and catching just 18 passes for 186 yards in the last five weeks . He s no more than a low end RB3 or flex play .
