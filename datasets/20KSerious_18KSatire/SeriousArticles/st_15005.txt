As far as models in the arts , one would be the screenwriter William Goldman , who ' s a friend and mentor of mine . The thing about Bill that ' s so extraordinary , besides the fact he ' s had a career that ' s spanned half a century , he continues to keep challenging himself . In a similar vein I would say Ken Burns . There you have someone who has such a singular vision and really stuck to it . The documentary world is a tough racket . The ability to make documentaries that are not only so epic and thorough and artful , but have them reach mainstream audiences I find it to be not short of miraculous .
