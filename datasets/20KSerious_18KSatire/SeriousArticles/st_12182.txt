As Carolyn Petit notes in the 20th anniversary retrospective of the second and arguably the strongest game in the series , TIE Fighter , what makes the entry stand out is the way that the game made her think about the empire , and about portrayals of villainy in general , in a new way TIE Fighter let you see the empire from a new perspective . The game didn ' t make you feel like a bad person doing bad things , but like a pilot who might reasonably have believed that what he was doing was in the galaxy ' s best interests . ?
