There ' s nothing onerous about any of those measures and they should by all means be implemented . But because they are executive actions ? and because Congress has steadfastly refused to work with the president to pass common sense gun control laws ? much more still needs to be done . A more reasonable Congress would require universal background checks for all transfers of guns anywhere in the nation would repeal the law that allows dealers to complete a sale after three days even if the background check isn ' t complete would ban sales of military style rifles and high capacity magazines would allow federal funding to be used for research into gun deaths as a public safety issue ( now effectively barred by Congress ) would prohibit sales of guns to people convicted of stalking and would crack down on straw purchases by legal buyers acting as fronts for others , which authorities say is how the San Bernardino killers obtained their rifles .
