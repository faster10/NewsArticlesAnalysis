Christina Joseph of Chicago , Illinois As a person who was there in NYC watching the monuments of my city fall down , I can only remember the compassion . The firefighters who came from all over the United States to help , to offer support and just to be there . The many doors of religious organizations that were open day and nights to offer solace . One such church was on Park Avenue near Grand Central and it had a sign that just said " come in and sit " and it did not matter who you were , where you came from , we all needed each other . We still do .
