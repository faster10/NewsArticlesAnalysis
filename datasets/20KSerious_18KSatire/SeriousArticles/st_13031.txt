" We work those situations all the time , " Reid said Sunday after the Chiefs returned home and had time to digest their 27 20 loss . " We wanted to maintain our timeouts as best we could . We didn ' t want to give the ball back at any point back to New England after we go ahead and score that next touchdown . We had a penalty involved there . It wasn ' t a perfect world , not quite the way we wanted it . So we took a couple of shots to get it in , and we still had a 1 : 15 or 1 : 13 , right around there . "
