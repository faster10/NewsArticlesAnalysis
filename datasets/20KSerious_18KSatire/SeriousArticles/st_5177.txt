In this Thursday , Jan . 14 , 2016 , file photo , police officers are deployed near the site of an explosion in Jakarta , Indonesia . Counterterrorism forces apparently did not anticipate Thursday s attack , though authorities announced last month that they knew of a credible threat . Security personnel , however , were able to respond rapidly . That was partly luck police happened to be in the area on other business but it still bolstered the image of security forces and government . ( AP Photo Dita Alangkara , File )
