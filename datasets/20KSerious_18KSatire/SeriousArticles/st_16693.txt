All of this wasn t incidental to the band s appeal . As critic Jody Rosen wrote in Slate in 2011 , James Murphy s best songs ( the aforementioned tracks Losing My Edge and All My Friends , the NYC requiem New York , I Love You But You re Bringing Me Down , and Someone Great , which is about an actual death ) had always been elegies . In addition , I m willing to wager that a significant part of Murphy s appeal to his fans ? most of whom were much younger and didn t sport the greying beard that he did ? was the promise that they could age gracefully , and might even achieve the impossible , remaining hip . So it made sense ? was in fact in keeping with the ethos of the whole band ? when LCD vowed to be the rare pop act that quit while it was on top .
