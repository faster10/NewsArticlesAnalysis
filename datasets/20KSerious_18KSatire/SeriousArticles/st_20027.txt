The state ' s Cuban voters are less likely than Hispanics in other states to find Trump ' s anti immigration bloviating offensive , and , Burstein writes , " the Florida voting population includes a high percentage of evangelicals ( a group with whom Trump seems to have had baffling success ) .

" Trump ' s resonance with today ' s version of the American Dream is hugely aspirational for people who are unemployed and financially hurting , " Burstein writes . Burstein also believes Trump has the potential to turn out a huge number of new voters across the country basically , all those reality TV watchers who don ' t normally pay any attention to politics .
