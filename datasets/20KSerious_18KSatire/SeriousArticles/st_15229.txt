We just weren t finishing in the red zone how we needed . The Sooners are 1 3 in those games , the one win , a 13 2 victory over Florida State in 2001 , delivering a national championship . And I said 15 for 15 , with the message being let s make them print 15 tickets this year , somehow , some way . We came out with a lot of energy . After Oklahoma scored easily on the opening drive , the Tigers spent much of the night keeping Mayfield , who over recent weeks had ( rightfully ) inspired Johnny Manziel comparisons , off balance and in check , something no team accomplished since Texas in early October .
