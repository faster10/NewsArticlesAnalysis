Played by Matt Smith , he journeys through " Time And Relative Dimension In Space " in his aptly named ship , the TARDIS which looks like a blue British police call box on the outside , and is as iconographic a vehicle as the U . S . S . Enterprise , Millennium Falcon or DeLorean . Launched in 1963 , change and evolution is part of the show ' s DNA . When a lead actor steps down , The Doctor essentially dies and is regenerated into a new body , but as the same character with a new actor portraying him . Smith is the 11th to do so . However , over five decades , more than the 30 companions have been unique characters with their own back story . The Doctor invites them on adventures across the " time vortex " to face monsters and save worlds . As they retire or die , fresh ones are needed to keep the him company .
