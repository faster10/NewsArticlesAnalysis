My first brush with Bowie was at age 12 , as I watched Heath Ledger bust a choreographed routine to funky , bass slapping tune in A Knight ' s Tale ( 2001 ) . Now , all I remember is thinking , " What a tune , I need to find out what this song is . " In the days before Shazam or SoundHound , I had to write the lyrics down . I remember going into the computer lab in school the next day to search the lyrics hoping to find a hit and I did . The track was Golden Years . That was my introduction to Soul Train era Bowie .
