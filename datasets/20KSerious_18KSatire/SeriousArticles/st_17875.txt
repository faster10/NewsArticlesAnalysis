The rout has been caused by a combination of factors . The lifting of sanctions on Iran will bring more supply into a market that is already seeing over supply . Even if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries finally cuts production , it will be more than compensated by the return of Iran . Global oil inventory is also hitting a ceiling as there is little storage capacity left to spare . Over supply coincides with weak global demand . Slower growth , in China in particular , is expected to impact demand adversely . In addition , there is the currency effect . Every major currency has lost ground against the dollar other things being equal , dollar denominated oil prices could fall if this trend continues . Going forward , the geopolitical complexities that could influence the supply demand equation are mind boggling . There is a proxy war on between Iran and Saudi Arabia . Production has also been affected by war in Libya and Iraq . Meanwhile , persistently low prices could lead to widespread shutdowns in production of shale oil and gas , leading to a reduction in exploration efforts .
