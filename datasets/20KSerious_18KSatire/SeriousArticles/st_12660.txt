" The industry has been building up over a very long time , starting with white men running the studios who hire other people who look like them . It just hasn ' t changed that much , and it won ' t until there ' s a concerted effort on every single front : talent , the executives in the studios , the people we mentor . If you have a person of color directing a film , there ' ll be more people of color on the crew and in the movie . You have to overindex now on every hiring opportunity you have . "
