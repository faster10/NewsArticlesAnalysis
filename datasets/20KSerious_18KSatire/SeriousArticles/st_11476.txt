Perez : Yeah that ' s why I was with her the night before . That was the night that other woman had planned on doing everything . I usually didn ' t let her leave without knowing where she was going but that particular morning as fate would have it , I was asleep and she got up early to pick up some paperwork that Yolanda had said she had found . I heard Selena but I didn ' t get up . I didn ' t know she was leaving . I thought maybe she was going to hang out with my Dad who had stayed over . I didn ' t even think to ask and then she was gone .
