" In 1999 , some Danish soldiers on patrol in Mitroviza had shown symptoms of lead poisoning , " Polansky told us . " So their blood was taken , and it came back they had extremely high levels of lead poisoning . So in the summer of 2000 , a UN medical team took blood tests all over Mitrovica . They found the highest lead levels were in the gypsy camps because they had been built on the tailings stands of the mines and the pollution from the smelter drifted right over their camp . Their blood samples were sent to a lab in Belgium and it was found that the children in these camps had the highest lead levels in medical literature . "
