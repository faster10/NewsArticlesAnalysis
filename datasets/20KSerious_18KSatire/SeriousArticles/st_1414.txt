NEW YORK ? Researchers at Kansas State University have a solution to testing drones safely in a real world environment : They built a big cage . The Federal Aviation Administration severely restricts where drones can fly , including a prohibition within five miles of an airport . The college s Salina campus sits within a five mile radius , and since the school started an unmanned aircraft program in 2008 , flights have been offsite . The cage , 300 feet long , 200 feet wide , and 50 feet tall , is a netted structure that looks a bit like an enclosed golf driving range . Wind , rain , snow , and other weather conditions pass into the test area and don t block GPS signals , so researchers can test drones in lifelike situations . ? ASSOCIATED PRESS
