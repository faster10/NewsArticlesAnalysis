This will be hard to achieve while Jeremy Corbyn , the Labour leader , remains unpersuaded of the wisdom of further military action despite UN support . He told his party that he will not vote for action under any circumstances , so there is no chance of the Opposition reaching a collective view . Since there are doubters still on the Conservative benches and quite a few on the Opposition side , maybe it would be sensible to resolve this matter with a free vote . If MPs are permitted to make up their own minds unwhipped , it is likely Mr Cameron will obtain the convincing mandate he seeks .
