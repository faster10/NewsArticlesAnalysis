I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching " Creature Double Feature " smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah . There was something about seeing these behemoths stomp Tokyo to dust that made me absolutely giddy : the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by A bomb radiation , the model shop ingenuity , the laughable man in a rubber suit campiness . It ' s been 16 years since Hollywood nearly soured that love affair , thanks to Roland Emmerich ' s 1998 atrocity . And I was hopeful that the splashy new 3 D reboot might rekindle the old flame .
