Martin : Once I found a rhythm and developed the characters , I liked not having to say goodbye to them at the end of each book . On the other hand , by the time I wanted to end the series , I really felt it was time . I had told everybody ' s stories as well as I wanted to , and it was finally time to say goodbye and let them graduate from eighth grade . I also wanted to spread my writing wings and try different things , write in different time periods . I think we all felt it was time to end the series . But I love hearing from adults who read " The Baby Sitters Club " books as children .
