ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : So it comes to this : The Republican establishment cannot decide which of its front running presidential candidates needs to be stopped ? or at least stopped more urgently . Leading conservative thought leaders , as encapsulated by the remarkable series of essays published by National Review , are engaged in an all out assault on Donald Trump as not representing the true strains of the movement they ve fought for over decades . Leading conservative elected officials , meanwhile , are sounding alarms about Ted Cruz ? viewing him as a threat less to ideology than to the existence of a viable national party . Sen . Lindsey Graham is likening the choice to choosing the manner of your death , and there is an element of which brand of poison conservatives are more eager to swallow . The fact is , though , that voters are indicating that the causes Trump and Cruz are being hit for not representing ? ideology , and governing realities ? simply don t matter the way they have in the past . There s still room ( and room for hope among what s left of the establishment ) for another candidate to emerge to save the GOP s principles from the party s own voters . Yet if this race comes down to Trump and Cruz , we ll be witnessing the end of the Republican Party as it s been organizing itself for the past half century .
