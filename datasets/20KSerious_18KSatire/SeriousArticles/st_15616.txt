Houses , echoing with the footfalls of generations , came apart , and blew away like paper . Whole communities , carefully planned , splintered into chaos . Restaurants and supermarkets , gas stations and corner stores , all disintegrated , glass storefronts scattered like diamonds on black asphalt . It was as if the very curve of the Earth was altered , horizons erased altogether , the landscape so ruined and unfamiliar that those who ran from this thing , some of them , could not find their way home .
