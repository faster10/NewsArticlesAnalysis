Several new women ' s groups have formed on the right , although efforts remain disparate and halting . The Susan B . Anthony List has been around for decades , but its budget is less than a seventh of Emily ' s List ' s and it only supports female candidates after they ' ve won a primary . The National Republican Campaign Committee , which helps elect Republicans to the House , in 2013 launched Project GROW ( Growing Republican Opportunities for Women ) , to encourage more women to run for the House . But the bid fell short , recruiting 13 percent fewer female candidates than in 2012 and holding just one pre primary fundraiser for a female candidate she lost , and GROW withered . Other efforts to raise both money and the number of Republican women running include ShePAC , launched by former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin the Unlocking Potential Project , initiated by 2016 GOP presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina Right Now , a PAC begun by Brittney Thune Women Lead , lead by Republican National Committee member Christine Terretti and the Women2Women listening tour , launched by Sarah Chamberlain at the Republican Main Street Partnership .
