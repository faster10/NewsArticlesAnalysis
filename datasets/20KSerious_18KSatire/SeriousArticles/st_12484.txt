Steven Spielberg : It ' s one of the big mysteries . They float so many trial balloons with Lincoln ' s face every year in the form of advertising , spoofs , parodies , " Saturday Night Live " sketches , Presidents ' Day commercials . Lincoln has kind of become a caricature . One of the last movies , which I haven ' t seen in 15 or 20 years , that was about Abraham Lincoln was in the ' 30s , with Henry Fonda " Young Mr Lincoln . " I don ' t understand why it ' s taken so long for anybody , let alone our group , to bring Lincoln to a movie theater .
