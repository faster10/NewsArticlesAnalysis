To me , all of these non fossil energy technologies are simply tools to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels . They should not be regarded as ends in themselves including nuclear . Each of them have their pluses and minuses , and we need to weigh the costs and benefits of each . Solar and wind have their own problems , the biggest being scalability . But there are many others as well that would only be magnified as they take a more dominant role the industrialization of the countryside being , to me , one of the most pernicious .
