Despite this , what is Britain being offered ? At this point , pretty thin gruel . Consider migration . David Cameron has already accepted a compromise on his promise to stop migrants sending child benefits to relatives abroad . Brussels was also said to be mooting an emergency break ? a term now increasingly devoid of substance ? on migrants from other EU nations claiming in work benefits for four years , rather than on actual numbers of people . This would only apply if the UK were able to demonstrate that its welfare system is under strain and if the other countries agree to the measure . Mr Cameron has sensibly criticised this proposal as not good enough .
