The Mets have three of the 11 most difficult starting pitchers to hit , as ranked by the percentage of times hitters swing and miss : Game 3 starter Noah Syndergaard ( seventh at 27 . 9 ) , Game 2 starter deGrom ( ninth at 27 ) and Game 1 starter Harvey ( 11th at 27 . 5 ) . Syndergaard will take the ball in a veritable must win game after Harvey and deGrom failed to get Kansas City to miss much . The Royals missed only 8 . 9 of the time they swung at pitches from Harvey and deGrom , a fraction of how those pitchers typically manhandle hitters .
