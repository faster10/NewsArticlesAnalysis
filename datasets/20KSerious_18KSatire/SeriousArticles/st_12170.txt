A three state solution for Iraq is not a new idea : it was bandied about in some quarters in the run up to the 2003 invasion , but the idea was never taken seriously by leaders in the West . That was a mistake . The Coalition was right that the majority of Iraqi citizens did want to be liberated from Saddam Hussein in 2003 but President George W . Bush , British Prime Minister Tony Blair , and others simply could not conceive of violating the international norm of sovereignty to the point of killing a country and creating three new ones in its place . This crazy logic continues to hold in other places , such as not recognizing an independent Somaliland ( despite relative peace , its own currency , etc . in contrast to neighboring Somalia ) .
