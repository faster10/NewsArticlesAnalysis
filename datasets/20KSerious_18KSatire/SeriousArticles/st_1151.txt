Of course , Gov . Kasich and the other statewide office holders who were elected in 2010 are not on the ballot this Tuesday , and in fact will not have to face the voters again until 2014 . But there will be a Republican presidential candidate on the ballot next year . It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself . Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio , it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013 .
