I didn ' t discover that I had diabetes until 1968 , when I awoke from a diabetic coma in a military hospital in South Vietnam . As an infantry sergeant , I went unconscious during battle , was presumed dead and placed in a body bag . Fortunately , two days later , an alert medic who was putting toe tags on dead soldiers felt my pulse still beating and immediately rushed me to the hospital . I credit diabetes with saving my life , as I later learned that many soldiers in my outfit were killed or wounded .
