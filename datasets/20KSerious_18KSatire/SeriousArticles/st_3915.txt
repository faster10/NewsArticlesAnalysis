Willems : Oh yes . Absolutely . I love it . I get a box every month filled with ( letters from ) kids infringing on my copyright . It is a legalistic nightmare , and a complete joy . And I post on my blog my favorites . But I just love it . I started out drawing Charlie Brown and Snoopy . And then I would have my own characters interacting with them . When I start seeing kids draw their characters interacting with the pigeon , you see that the creative crutch is going away , and that they ' re really becoming authors . For me , it ' s so important to doodle and draw . In my house , every night at dinner we have a big piece of paper that we put on our dining room table as our tablecloth and we doodle . I fear that grownups just don ' t doodle anymore . There is a day in everybody ' s life when they realize that they ' re not going to be a professional basketball player and they ' re not going to be a professional cartoonist . It ' s usually the same week . But people keep playing basketball . And they stop drawing . And I just think that that ' s such a waste .
