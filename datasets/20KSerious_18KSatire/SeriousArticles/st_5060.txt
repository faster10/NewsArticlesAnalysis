Thompson then went on to Hollywood and starred in several important movies and television series . He appeared in at least 20 films , including In the Line of Fire , the Hunt for Red October , and Cape Fear . But acting out roles seemed to have bored Thompson , who decided to go back into politics in the early 1990s . He was elected to the Senate in 1994 and served for two terms before going back to Hollywood . He went from being a professional prosecutor to playing a district attorney on NBC s Law Order in the role of Arthur Branch .
