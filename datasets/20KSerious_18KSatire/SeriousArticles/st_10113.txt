" We ' re not in a great place defensively , " Van Gundy says about the 11th best defensive team in the NBA . This is interesting because last season the Pistons clocked in at 21st in defensive rating . It was Van Gundy ' s first season as the coach and the executive . He made major changes like not committing long term to Greg Monroe , waiving Josh Smith with a lot of time and money left on the contract and swinging a deal for Reggie Jackson at the trade deadline after Brandon Jennings . It was chaos but it was his chaos . And at a certain point , you have to focus the chaos into your brand of basketball .
