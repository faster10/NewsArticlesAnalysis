LC : The mood on the Bernie side was unbelievable . So , for example , I was in Davenport , Iowa , with him last Friday night , and in a room , a ballroom , dancing kind of place that normally holds 500 people , 1500 people were in there . A ballroom floor , a balcony , totally packed , people stood up the entire hour he spoke , he was introduced by a young worker , who was also a student , who talked about his own student debt , while he works , not only a student , but also delivering sandwiches , 7 an hour , which will never pay even the interest on the debt , and at the same time , he s volunteering hours every day for Bernie Sanders it was amazing introduction , and the mood that s just one example . I was in tire building plants and aluminum smelting plants , and call centers , postal workers the energy level , the volunteers Last Friday night 200 volunteers showed up just in Davenport , they didn t even have a place to sleep , they didn t care , they slept on the floor so that they can go out and knock on doors and hang signs on doors about the caucus rules for Monday night .
