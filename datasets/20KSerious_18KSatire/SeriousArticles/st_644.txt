Honestly , I was a little light headed . I didn t have the energy I should have had , Thomas said of his start . But also I just didn t get any good looks . I mean they were playing pretty good defense to where if I did try to get some looks I d be forcing them . So I just tried to let the game come to me , and then in the second half just be a little more aggressive and be myself . And I saw some openings and my teammates kept giving me confidence saying , We need you . We need you . And I just went from there . They just gave me some energy packs ( at halftime ) . I drank a lot of Gatorade and saw my first shot go in and I felt like I couldn t be stopped .
