We need to let every member contribute ? not once they have earned their stripes , but right now . I come at this job as a two time committee chair . The committees should retake the lead in drafting all major legislation . If you know the issue , you should write the bill . Open up the process . Let people participate . And they might change their tune . A neglected minority will gum up the works . A respected minority will work in good faith . Instead of trying to stop the majority , they might try to become the majority .
