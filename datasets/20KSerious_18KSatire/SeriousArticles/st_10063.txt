Hold yourself to quantifiable progress . We constantly evaluate the outcomes of our work , and that evaluation is data driven , not anecdotal . For example , we know that the various features of the Meyerhoff Scholars Program peer support groups , intensive advising , early research experiences work in combination . UMBC ' s students graduate , and they go on in large numbers to earn Ph . D . s in science and engineering . But which elements of our approach are most critical and cost effective ? We ' re currently working on a project funded by the National Science Foundation to tease that out . If we don ' t look critically at what works and what does not we can ' t recalibrate and continue to improve .
