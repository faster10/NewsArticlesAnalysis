The interior remains the same decadent , lovingly crafted , and intimate space it s always been , only now it has been blessed with the vastly improved dashboard controls from the Vanquish . These include better organized , capacitive touch buttons and gorgeous knurled knobs in place of the DB9 s haphazardly arranged , Tic Tac sized buttons marked by the automotive equivalent of hieroglyphics . The transmission remains pushbutton style with a row of large crystal buttons , and the centermost spot is reserved for the crystal capped key ? er , Emotion Control Unit , in Aston speak ? which lights up in red beneath your finger when you fire up the engine . Yep , it s pretty sexy .
