As I soon as I stepped into the office , my co workers gave me a round of applause . They told me that they were proud that I got on the show , and that it didn ' t matter whether I won a million dollars or nothing at all . My boss dropped off one of his collar stays on my desk , with a note that " you ' ll always remember . " For the next 30 minutes or so , everyone wanted to ask me about the " Millionaire experience " : What was Regis Philbin like ? How long does it take to record a 60 minute show ? etc . It turns out that no one was ashamed at my performance after all . They were just happy that a lifelong dream came true .
