At this point I ' m not sure what happens . The IP address MarkMonitor ' s software is going to see , presumably , is our public one , not the private address of the device that ' s been singled out on our condo complex ' s network . How do we identify the perpetrator ? Should we identify the perpetrator ? If our ISP says we ' re in violation , is it incumbent on us to run our own tracking software , somehow , to identify the person ( s ) involved ? Are we supposed to somehow issue these warnings ourselves , since the ISP won ' t technically be able to ?
