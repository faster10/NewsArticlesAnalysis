I started off at Westmont , a beautiful Christian college nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara , California . What a safe place that was . It was also extremely nurturing . The professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us . My peer group was all about what ministry you signed up for , not what sorority you were rushing . We lifted each other up , had intimate sunrise Bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends , talking about how to lead a godly life .
