On the game s final drive , the Bengals defense was already beginning to die of a thousand cuts as Ben Roethlisberger , with an injured right shoulder no less , was moving his team into field goal range using mostly check downs . Then the Bengals decided to slit their own wrists through the stupidity of not one , but two of their players . The result was that everything the team had worked for this entire season , went right down the drain . There is no excuse for this complete lack of good sense , as Burfict s personal vendetta was his primary , and perhaps his only , concern this evening .
