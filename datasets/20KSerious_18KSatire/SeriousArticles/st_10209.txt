General manager Sandy Alderson starts overhauling a feeble offense . On the same day outfielder Michael Conforto gets called up from Double A , veteran pros Juan Uribe and Kelly Johnson are obtained in a trade with Atlanta . From July 25 on , the Mets lead the National League in runs , homers and slugging percentage . That s who shook the clubhouse up . When Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe walked in that clubhouse and guys all of a sudden realized their jobs were at stake , it changed . We got some guys swinging the bats much more aggressively with much more sense of urgency , and that s when I think we turned things around , Collins said .
