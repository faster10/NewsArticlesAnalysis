The protagonist is Dilma Rousseff , the country s first female president , a former guerilla fighter who was imprisoned and tortured for her work fighting the 1964 1985 dictatorship . She was narrowly reelected last year , giving her Workers Party 16 consecutive years in power , but has become deeply unpopular due to a deep recession that has been worsened by a 2 billion corruption probe at state oil giant Petrobras . Dozens of politicians have so far been ensnared by the investigation , but there is no evidence Rousseff personally profited , despite serving as the firm s chairwoman for seven years before becoming president in 2010 .
