Lacy s stampede : On the night s second snap , Packers running back Eddie Lacy busted off his longest run of the season . Zero in on the 29 yard charge and you ll see the Bears overpowered up front . Defensive tackle Eddie Goldman was swallowed by a double team at the snap and Jarvis Jenkins was driven 5 yards backward and dumped on his tail by Sitton . Inside linebacker Jonathan Anderson overran Lacy in the backfield . Pernell McPhee couldn t get off a block . Shea McClellin was overpowered by JC Tretter . And safety Adrian Amos missed a tackle 5 yards past the line of scrimmage . Off Lacy went , headed toward midfield before Kyle Fuller finally pushed him out of bounds . It wasn t just a fluky moment either . The Packers had their way in the running game all night , piling up 177 yards on the ground with Lacy averaging 6 . 2 yards on his 17 carries . Over the past two games , the Bears have allowed 347 rushing yards , dropping to 29th ? in the league against the run . It s a troublesome weak spot that the Bears will need to patch up in December to keep their playoff hopes alive .
