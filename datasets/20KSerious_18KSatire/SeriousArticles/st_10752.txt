Why To Watch : Cam Newton and Marcus Mariota on the same field . Nuff said . Reigning players of the week in each conference . At a time when everyone is shredding the league for the quality of quarterback play , or lack thereof , these two are the antidote . One is going to be a legit MVP candidate and the other is going to be rookie of the year I suspect . Mariota looked unencumbered by his recent knee injury as last week ' s game moved on and Newton just cannot be kept out of the end zone by foot or by arm . They are exciting to watch , and if you can ' t find joy in their games , then you might want to switch to cricket or something . The Titans have been a far more competitive team with Mariota on the field and already have two wins against the NFC South their only two wins of the season . The Panthers look like a team that will have the proverbial letdown game soon , and after so many huge NFC wins , facing an AFC afterthought on the heels of wins over Indianapolis and Green Bay screams out as a trap game to me .
