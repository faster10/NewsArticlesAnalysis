Candy and raisins , and things that will stick to your teeth . It ' s funny , a lot of dentists give out raisins during Halloween . Most people thing it ' s because it is healthy , but no . In actuality , it sticks to their teeth and creates cavities . It is not really a nice thing that dentists do ! But raisins are probably one of the worst things for your teeth because it coats the teeth in sugar . Not good . Stay away from those . Stick to a crunchy vegetable diet those actually wash away some of the bacteria .
