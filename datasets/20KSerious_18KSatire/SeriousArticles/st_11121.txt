' For these rich clubs whose owners invest a huge amount of money , they expect to win every year , but only one team can win the title . It is difficult to tell whether the players or manager is at fault because they won the league last year with the same players . It is hard to know what has made the difference this year .

But expectations are high , and it is the same at Chelsea . They want their team to win all the time . '
