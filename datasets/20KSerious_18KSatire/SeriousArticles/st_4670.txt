What I ' m worried about is the challenge of raising well behaved kids in a society that sometimes make this difficult . As a parent of young children 8 , 6 and 4 I want to care for them but not coddle them . I don ' t worry about being too hard on my kids or demanding too much I ' m more concerned that , like many parents , I ' ll wind up being too soft , too accommodating and too eager to excuse their misbehavior . I want them to be kind , thoughtful , generous and grateful for all they have .
