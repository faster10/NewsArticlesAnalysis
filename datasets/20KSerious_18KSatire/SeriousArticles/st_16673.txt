Meanwhile , the pesticide department of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) has intensified its vector control program . " We have intensified surveillance in areas that reported maximum number of dengue cases and Aedes Aegypti breeding sites . The breeding spots are found round the year , but they are less common during the non monsoon period , " said BMC pesticide officer Rajan Naringrekar . He added that Mumbaikars should not think that Aedes Aegypti bred only in monsoon . " We have found breeding spots in water storage drums , feng shui plants , plates or bowls generally kept for feeding pets and so on . We need people ' s cooperation for vector control , " said Naringrekar .
