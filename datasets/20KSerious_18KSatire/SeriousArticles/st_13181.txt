Although the Democratic opponents to single payer healthcare proposals are correct to say it would dismantle Obamacare , their arguments are misleading , especially in regards to the implications of doing so . The affordable healthcare act fails to ensure around 30 million Americans , nearly ten percent of the population , and so many concessions were made from the initial universal healthcare package , what was passed is far from what the social safety net of healthcare for all is supposed to be . A single payer healthcare system would correct the shortcomings of Obamacare , and save Americans billions of dollars . Instead of Americans soliciting healthcare from private insurers , everyone would have access to healthcare as right of American citizenship , similar to citizens of every other advanced capitalist nations .
