Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently stated , " If sequester happens , it is going to badly damage the readiness of the United States of America . We have the most powerful military force on the face of the earth right now . It is important in terms of providing stability and peace in the world . If sequester goes into effect , and we have to do the kind of cuts that will go right at readiness , right at maintenance , right at training , we are going to weaken the United States . And make it much more difficult for us to respond to the crises in the world . "
