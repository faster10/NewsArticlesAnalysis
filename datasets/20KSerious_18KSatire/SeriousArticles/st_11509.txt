Kathy Griffin is perhaps one of the most shining examples . Like Rivers , Griffin has a talent for nailing celebrities to the wall with a smile , while simultaneously flaying herself . Nowhere was that more evident than her Emmy winning reality show , " Kathy Griffin : My Life on the D List , " a self deprecating examination of how Griffin was trying and failing to climb the Hollywood ladder . It ' s not hard to imagine that if Rivers had been born a few decades later , she would ' ve made a similar show . ( After all , Rivers kept working hard right up until her passing , starring in reality shows with her daughter , Melissa , and gleefully torturing celebrities on E ! ' s " Fashion Police . " )
