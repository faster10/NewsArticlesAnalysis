That ' s the tropical location of the Eden Resort , which is offering a great package deal for married couples looking for relationship counseling . Jason and Cynthia ( Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell ) want to give it a shot , and persuade their supposedly happily married friends Dave and Ronnie ( Vaughn and Malin Akerman ) , Joey and Lucy ( Favreau and Kristin Davis ) , and Shane and his 20 year old girlfriend Trudy ( Faizon Love and Kali Hawk ) to join in the fun . Apparently , nobody has trouble raising the fare , even in these recessionary times .
