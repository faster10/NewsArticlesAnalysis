While I am not suggesting that Trump is another Hitler or even has Hitlerian sensibilities , there are some interesting similarities between the two . Trump , according to his former wife , is fascinated with Hitler and reportedly kept a book of his speeches by his bedside . Both Trump and Hitler are master opportunists who respond cunningly and swiftly to their political and social environment . Both identify passionately with the nation , tending to fuse their personality with that of the nation . Both are charismatic figures who appear to mesmerize their followers . The power of both rests on their public speeches and the hysteria generated in the gatherings . Both are vague on facts and on their promises to make the nation " great again . " They have emerged in a time of economic crisis , political uncertainty and widespread fear in society . Both harp on the theme that the nation has been humiliated and that they will restore its honor . Both are political outsiders and mocked by the establishment note the critics making fun of the hairstyles of both , with Hitler providing additional opportunity with his mustache .
