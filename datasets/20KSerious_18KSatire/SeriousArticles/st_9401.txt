The obvious problem with this approach is that Trump is not a traditional candidate vulnerable to traditional opposition research and negative ads . He has made it part of his branding that he will say or do or tweet anything , no matter how vile , and then complain that any backlash is a lie propagated by political enemies intent on tearing him down . And still his supporters love him . The immunity to political history , and to reality , is his major appeal . He could spend the next debate eating puppies onstage and his supporters would cheer it as a hilarious rebuke to Muslims who consider dogs haram to the point where they won t even pet them .
