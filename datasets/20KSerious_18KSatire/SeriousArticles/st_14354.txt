ISIS has grown exponentially over the last four years , taking advantage of ungoverned space and violent Shia Sunni sectarianism to win the attention and support of thousands of would be jihadists . It has attracted hundreds and probably thousands of fighters from across the Arab world and Europe . Even so , its forces are spread across a huge area and would be vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Iraqi military should it reorganize into an effective force . And ISIS depends on powerful Sunni tribes to the west and north of Baghdad as its hosts and partners . If they perceive its practices as too draconian or its caliphate as marginalizing them , the tolerance they have shown in the face of a common enemy the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki will soon evaporate .
