French and Malian forces retook Konna from the rebels on January 18 . Most of the town ' s residents had returned by the time we were allowed in to assess critical needs , and life was beginning to return to normal . But there were still many signs of the conflict . The road leading into the town was littered with burned out pickup trucks and shrapnel . We even found an unexploded bomb in one home we visited , quickly warning the family of 17 to stay clear before reporting the bomb to the French military to be rendered safe . Similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of Islamist rebels will persist throughout Mali , even as military operations begin to wind down .
