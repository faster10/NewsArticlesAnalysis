It s beyond what I d ever imagined in my wildest dreams , Brady said . I remember the first one I ever participated in , which was in Pittsburgh . We had to fly there on a Friday . I missed Friday of practice so I could do a press conference at the site of the game . It was the first time it really felt like , Wow , this is a big deal . Fifteen years later , to be a part of 10 of those , I never imagined that any of this was ever even possible . I just knew that I loved the game , and I played with so many great teammates who have , like I said , sacrificed so much . When you play with teammates like I have and you see what they go through over the course of the season , what they deal with in their lives personally , how that reacts to them professionally , kind of the blood , sweat and tears you put into it , you never take it for granted .
