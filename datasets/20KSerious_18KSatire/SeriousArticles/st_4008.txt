When we played Scunthorpe the game we won to get promoted to the First Division under Stan Ternant in 2000 up until then I ' d been in Northern Ireland . Bertie Ahern Taoiseach of Ireland at the time was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day . I said to him : " Bertie , I ' ve got to be at this game , these talks cannot drag on and on . " As it happened I left early and by the time I ' d landed in Manchester things had wrapped up , so he got to his game as well , but I did sneak off early it has to be said .
