Current state : During the past month and a half , there s been some uncharacteristic game changing mistakes from the special teams . A fumbled punt by rookie Chris Harper proved costly in the Denver loss . A blocked punt and a punt return surrendered for a touchdown were costly in the Eagles loss . There have been other miscues , with Keyshawn Martin and Amendola both losing punts , and penalties costing either long returns or allowing the opposing team to go back on offense . So the Patriots have struggled in an area where they re typically strong . Even Mr Automatic Stephen Gostkowski missed a fairly easy 46 yard kick in Miami on Sunday .
