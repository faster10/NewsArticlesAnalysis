Why was complaining about loose monetary policy such a prominent feature of the debate ? Inflation is low . Core inflation ? the consumer price index minus volatile food and energy prices ? has been under 3 percent since the Bush administration , and is now resting a hair under 2 percent . At this rate of inflation , it would take more than 35 years for prices to double . The dollar is extremely strong against the euro , its major competitor currency , and also strong against the yen , which is the opposite of what you d expect to see if loose Fed policy were destroying the value of the dollar .
