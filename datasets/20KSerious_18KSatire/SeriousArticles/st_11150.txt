Then she asks her subjects how and where they would like to be photographed and takes their portrait . Some wear traditional regalia and pose in sites relevant to their tribe ' s history . Others stand on their porches in T shirts and jeans , or on the roofs of buildings . Letting them decide is central to the project , Wilbur said .
