The chaos of a contested convention will be new to almost all participants . One almost occurred in 1976 , as Ronald Reagan mounted an unsuccessful challenge to President Gerald Ford at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City . Both candidates arrived in town three days before the vote to woo delegates and the convention dissolved into a rules fight before any ballots were cast . In an 11th hour ploy , Reagan tried to pass a rule that made Ford pick his running mate 12 hours before the nomination vote , hoping Ford ' s choice would displease enough delegates to tip the scale . The rule amendment did not pass . Out of more than 2 , 000 delegates voting , Ford won the nomination by 117 votes .
