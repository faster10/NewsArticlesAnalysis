Take them all away and Newton will hand off to running back Jonathan Stewart , who has been a workmanlike grinder when needed . And if that ' s not enough , Newton will take it himself , punishing blitzes or pressures that forget their contain assignments , becoming a 6 foot 5 , 250 pound dump truck . If necessary , he ' ll flatten cornerbacks on an option play ( see : Arizona ' s Chris Clemons late in the third quarter on third and 10 ) , or jump over a gang of defenders for a touchdown ( see : the very next play ) .
