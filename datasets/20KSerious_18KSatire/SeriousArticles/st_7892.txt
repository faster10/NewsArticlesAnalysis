If Morsy were to officially resign , the Brotherhood would no longer need to rally around an individual , one of their own , who has been humiliated and mistreated . Morsy ' s resignation also provides the Muslim Brotherhood with a face saving exit from its entrenched position of " Morsy is to be reinstated " during their protests . If Morsy were willing to leave office , it would also illustrate to Egyptians his desire to prevent further loss of life , return Egypt to civility , end the country ' s national disunity and allow the Brotherhood to return to the political process through elections rather than disruptive protests .
