BEAUBIEN : Well , you know , part of what we ' re expecting them to come up with is prioritizing what research needs to happen right now to help the entire global community focus on Zika . As I said , there ' s no vaccine . We also don ' t have any antiviral . There ' s no treatment out there , so they ' re going to be encouraging , you know , governments the CDC , other , you know , probably private companies , to try to push for coming up with an antiviral . And they ' ll probably try to tell countries this is what you do to screen for Zika . This is how you should handle a case of microcephaly , these cases of birth defects with the underdeveloped heads that we ' re seeing in Brazil . And then they ' re going to be telling everybody to stay away from mosquitoes . The one thing they will probably not weigh in on is pregnancy . Some countries have told women not to get pregnant . The WHO has made it very clear that they ' re going to stay out of that one and don ' t want to get involved in making recommendations about women getting pregnant or not .
