We have learned four key elements that we continue to instill in all our programs . First , begin with human rights empower people to claim their rights to health and well being with confidence . Two , start where people are have empathy and respect while you understand their history , their language and culture and their priorities . Three , do not try to force change lay the groundwork for dialogue , introduce people to ideas , identify shared values and allow them to decide what the change will be and when they will make it . If you start by just fighting what they are doing , you ' re going to get resistance . Finally , and perhaps most crucially , remember the solutions already exist within the communities with which you work .
