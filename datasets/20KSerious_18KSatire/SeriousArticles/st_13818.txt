Calling it a half assed strategy at best , Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R S . C . ) forced the witnesses to admit Russia is not fighting the Islamic State ( someone break the news to Donald Trump ) , but rather Iran , Russia and Hezbollah are all supporting Syrian President Bashar al Assad . We have no military plan ? none ? to help the rebels currently fighting the Islamic State to topple Assad . Any political settlement is absurd given that Assad has support on the battlefield from Iran , Russia and Hezbollah , and those who want him ousted ( Syrians ) have exactly no military support . Graham inquired : What kind of deal do you think you are going to get ?
