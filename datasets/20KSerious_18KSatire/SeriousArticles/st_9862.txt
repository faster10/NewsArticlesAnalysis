Iranian assets worth about 107 billion have been frozen overseas since the US and the EU issued economic sanctions against Tehran nearly four decades ago . An executive order revoking sanctions imposed by Washington was issued by US President Barack Obama . However , the US has so far lifted only secondary sanctions against Iran , which means American citizens are still banned from trading with the country , according to the US Department of Treasury . Although some 400 Iranian companies and individuals are to be removed from the sanctions list , 200 others will remain blacklisted .
