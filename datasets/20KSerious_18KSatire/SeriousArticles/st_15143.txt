When I was 21 , and just out of college , I fell in love with a bright and beautiful young woman named Joanna . At the time I was enduring yet another one of my periods of acute anxiety . I was jittery and unfocused , fearful and obsessed I couldn ' t sleep I couldn ' t eat my libido was gone . Meeting Joanna banished these afflictions . Almost overnight , I recovered a sense of confidence , stability , optimism and poise . No therapist or pill had ever done that for me . Love , I concluded , was the best treatment for anxiety known to humankind .
