I do wish Mair , Wilson and their allies luck in the effort ? I have no more interest in seeing Donald Trump win the Republican nomination than they do . But I m highly doubtful that they will be able to do much of anything beyond freezing to death on the ice . At this point , all that stops Trump from dragging out the agony of this nominating process until the GOP convention next summer is Trump himself tossing in the towel . And he looks as if he s enjoying the attention too much to do that .
