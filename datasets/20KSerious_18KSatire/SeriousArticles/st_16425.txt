Existing data do not link media violence with mass shootings or other societal violence . Debate continues in the general public and within academia , but the evidence just isn ' t there . The U . S . Secret Service and U . S . Department of Education , in a joint report in 2002 , found no evidence that school shooters consume more violent media than others . And although media probably have become more violent in recent decades , this period has also seen a massive decline in youth violence to 40 year lows , not an increase .
