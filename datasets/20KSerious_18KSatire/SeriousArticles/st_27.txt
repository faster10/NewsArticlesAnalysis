WRs Marques Colston , Brandin Cooks , Willie Snead : They deserve to be singled out individually , but too many guys loaded up on big days for the Saints ' offense . Colston , 32 , found that same fountain of youth that Watson has been sipping from with eight catches for 114 yards and a touchdown . It was his first 100 yard game of the season but the 28th of his career , tying him with Joe Horn for the franchise record . Cooks had six catches for 88 yards and two touchdownss . Snead had seven catches for 76 yards and two touchdowns . Snead lost a critical fumble in the fourth quarter , but he got drilled with a perfectly placed hit before he had secured the ball .
