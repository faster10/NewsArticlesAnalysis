What began as a surprisingly strong start under Coach Jason Kidd slowly fell apart in the second half of last season . Jabari Parker suffered a season ending injury , and Milwaukee s offense essentially disappeared . A full season with last year s acquisition Michael Carter Williams and this summer s acquisition Greg Monroe should remedy some of those issues . Monroe s court vision will open up opportunities for the likes of John Henson , Khris Middleton and Giannis Antetokounmpo ( The Greek Freak ) . Can that make for an offense that matches its stout defense remains to be seen .
