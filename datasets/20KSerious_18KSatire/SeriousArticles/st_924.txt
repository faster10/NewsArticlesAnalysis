Even a cursory glance at technological development reveals multiple paths that could lead to human level machine intelligence in this century . One likely path would be to continue studying the general properties of the human brain to decipher the computational structures it uses to generate intelligent behavior . Another path would be the more mathematical " top down " approach . And if somehow all the other approaches don ' t work , scientists might simply brute force the evolutionary process on computers .
