His nomination is actually doubly significant for me . I got so used to seeing him in the cutting room as Mad Max . It just shows what a great actor he is . I didn t feel any familiarity watching him in The Revenant . I felt like he was Fitzgerald , says Miller of Hardy s character in the Alejandro Gonzalez I ? rritu film . ? It just shows that he s the guy who s prepared to take on anything . He s like a decathlete in the Olympics . He doesn t just do the 800 meters but he does the broad jump , the high jump and the pole vaulting . ?
