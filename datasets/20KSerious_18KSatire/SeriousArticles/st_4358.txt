The Bulls struggled just as much offensively as defensively , shooting a mere 1 of 20 from three point range as part of a 37 percent shooting night overall . Derrick Rose put up a good line with 29 points on 12 of 22 from the field , but he did much of his damage early . For that matter , the Warriors seemed content with his scoring if it meant no one else posed much of a threat . Pau Gasol had a particularly awful game , missing all eight of his shots on his way to a one point showing . The silver lining for Chicago is that most teams look equally disjointed against a group as good as Golden State .
