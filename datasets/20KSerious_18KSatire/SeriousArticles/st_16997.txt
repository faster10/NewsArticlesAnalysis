Martha Plimpton : Well , I think it says a lot about my commitment to promoting the show . Laughs It ' s a funny thing : A lot of people who haven ' t seen the show yet say they haven ' t watched because they ' re not really sure what it is . They think it ' s about a baby , or that it ' s extremely dumb or something . But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize . The writing is very , very sharp . If dare I say it , it ' s a lot more sophisticated underneath . Laughs Do you know what I mean ? The exterior is really ridiculous and silly , but there ' s real sophistication in the writing , and I ' m really proud to be a part of it . And I think it ' s really smart , and it makes me laugh . If it makes me laugh , well , I ' m sorry , but then it must be good . Laughs Because I don ' t laugh at a lot of things .
