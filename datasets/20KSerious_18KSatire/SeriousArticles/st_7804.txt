Gans described the reaction of two French victims ' relatives at the meeting held for victims relatives . " They were very emotional at this point . They asked if it could be arranged for all the relatives to get the results at the same time , so that some wouldn ' t be waiting whilst others had results . This was denied by representatives . They said this is the order we have for the investigation . When we have results we have to contact families , " he said . " The victims ' families will just have to sit and wait . This was very painful to hear . "
