The problem was , he picked a poor time for his first miss in about two years . Gary Anderson hadn t missed a kick throughout the 1998 season when he lined up in the NFC Championship Game to kick a goal ahead field goal with 2 : 18 left in the game . Headed the same direction toward the open end of the stadium in the third quarter , Wilson overthrew Chase Coffman , and Trae Waynes intercepted the deflected pass to set the Vikings up for another field goal . Rookie David Johnson has become quite the asset as a runner and a receiver , and a Packers secondary that played on Sunday without top cornerback Sam Shields because of a concussion will have to keep up with the terrific wide receiver trio of Larry Fitzgerald , Michael Floyd and John Brown .
