WHAT WOMEN WANT IN 2016 . " Downward spiral . " " Pathetic . " " Frightening . " " " Hanging on by a Thread . " These are how a group of women in a focus group last night held by pollster Peter Hart of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania described the state of the country , according to ABC ' s SHUSHANNAH WALSHE and BEN GITTLESON . Yes , there was one " hopeful " and another " better , " but overwhelmingly it was a negative reaction . The women were Democrats , Republicans , and one independent in Columbus , Ohio and the focus group was livestreamed for reporters to watch . The women were asked a variety of questions about our nation , it ' s government , and of course the 2016 election and the candidates . Some of the queries may seem initially like lighter fare , but revealed fascinating answers . The women were asked what they thought the 2016 candidates ' backbones were made of not literally , of course . The answer shows possibly some hope for Hillary Clinton as she got six steels , one iron , one titanium , one metal and the rest were not good news : plastic , rubber , and wire . As for Donald Trump , two of the women said gold and another glitter . He also got steel and iron . But , Jeb Bush may not want to hear what his backbone is made up of . The women cited play doh , yarn , marshmallow , straw , even jello . And as for Ben Carson ? One woman said bibles and another mentioned dinosaur bones . A focus group of a dozen men held shortly afterward revealed similar attitudes : America is " divided " and " polarized " Clinton ' s backbone is made of titanium or metal Bush ' s is jello , styrofoam or papier m ? ch and Carson ' s spine consists of " robotics " or " brain , just all brain . " It ' s a small , but revealing snapshot into where voters ' minds are less than twelve months from Election Day .
