T . J . Ward : Ward , who has been fined multiple times already this season , will likely feel the financial sting again for his helmet to helmet hit on Cutler in the fourth quarter . Ward , who continues to be an active , productive presence in the defense overall , expressed his frustration after the game that any player would had difficulty avoiding the hit as Cutler was going down , but the fact remains he hit a quarterback late in the head . That ' s just the kind of penalty a player Ward can ' t commit and it certainly could have been costly in another situation .
