Columbia University declined to comment directly on the fliers but issued a general statement : " To avoid chilling complainants from coming forward and to respect all parties involved , the University does not comment on the particulars of disciplinary proceedings regarding sexual misconduct . In addition , the University is mindful of the multiple federal laws that govern these matters and provide important protections to survivors of sexual violence and to students engaged in our investigative process . These laws and our constitutional values do not permit us to silence debate on the difficult issues being discussed . "
