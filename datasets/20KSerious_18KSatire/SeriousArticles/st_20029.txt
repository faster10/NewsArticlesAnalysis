For labels , as well as artist estates , the appeal of a musical or a branded revue is obvious . Shows like Cirque du Soleil s ONE ? and Immortal , ? both based on the music of Michael Jackson , or Love , which used songs written by the Beatles , have proven themselves to be major sources of revenue . Immortal , which opened in 2011 , grossed 2 million per night in Las Vegas , according to Pollstar , and Love was instrumental in making Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr some the highest earning musicians the years it was active .
