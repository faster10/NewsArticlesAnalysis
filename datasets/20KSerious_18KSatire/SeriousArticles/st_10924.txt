Near the conclusion of " Thank You , " the third episode of " The Walking Dead ' s " sixth season , Glenn Rhee , portrayed for the run of the show by Steven Yeun , appeared to be torn apart by zombies . But fans of the show remain unconvinced that Glenn is gone for good , likely fueled by a statement from Gimple himself that was read on " Talking Dead , " the " Walking Dead " after show , which stated that fans of the show would see " some version of Glenn again , " be it in flashback or otherwise .
