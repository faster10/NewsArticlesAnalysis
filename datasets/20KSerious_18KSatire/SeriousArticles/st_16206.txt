The fourth possibility is that there was nothing useful we could have done . And it is hard to imagine how we could have prevented the use of chemical weapons in Syria . We couldn ' t have launched a pre emptive strike , and it ' s probable that it wouldn ' t have been effective . The only feasible action would be to alert the opposition and that , too , might not have accomplished anything . Or perhaps there wasn ' t sufficient agreement for any one course of action so , by default , nothing was done .
