Under construction since 1987 , the massive and still unfinished 105 story Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang looks like a luxury hotel designed for Mordor . Nicknamed the ' Hotel of Doom ' and described as ' the worst building in the history of mankind ' by Esquire , construction halted due to lack of funding , and the partially completed building stood windowless and looming ominously over the city for 16 years before work resumed in 2008 . Strikingly modern when first designed , time has not been kind to the building , which now looks simultaneously menacing , dated , and unconscionably extravagant relative to the impoverished populace .
