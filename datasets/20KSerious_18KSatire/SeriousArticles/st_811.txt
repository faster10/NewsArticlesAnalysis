Djokovic s contention that they will play mostly from the baseline is hardly a blinding revelation ? although if either player is in a hole , desperation will kick in . For the most part , they will stand , deliver then grind . The Serb has not followed his serve to the net once in 597 opportunities the past fortnight . Murray has tried it five times in 601 serves , for a 3 2 success . Both have sharpened their short game once the ball is in play , Murray winning 97 points in 122 visits to the net , a slightly better return for his daring than Djokovic s 93 from 124 .
