In last year ' s roundup of notable workplace stories , we included the tale of the iPhone 4 prototype that went missing after its owner left it at a bar . Clearly no lessons were learned from that gaffe , because another Apple employee made the same mistake with the iPhone 5 prototype , losing it at a Mexican restaurant . And at least the iPhone 4 was sold for the worthy amount of 5 , 000 . Allegedly the iPhone 5 archetype raked in a measly 200 on Craigslist . Hopefully the next iPhone iteration will be kept under lock and key . Source : CNET
