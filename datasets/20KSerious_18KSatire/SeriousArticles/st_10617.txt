Fortunately for Paramount , the tiny cost of the Paranormal films still make them highly profitable , but the sharp drop off from " PA3 " to " PA4 " could spell trouble for the franchise . " Paranormal Activity 4 , " which received a " C " CinemaScore grade from polled audiences , has received the worst reviews of any entry in the series , yet Paramount chose to open it earlier than its predecessors . The film was released on Thursday night at 9 p . m . " PA2 " and " PA3 " opened at midnight and perhaps negative word of mouth spread faster and earlier , thus limiting its weekend prospects . Also making matters difficult was direct competition from Sinister , the similarly themed horror title that opened to 18 million last weekend .
