Google street view, now on Mt. Everest
Forget the endurance training and oxygen deprivation. A veteran sherpa will lead you on a trek through the mountains of Nepal via Google Maps. Google expanded its Street View to include interactive images of Nepal's Khumbu region, from expansive views of the mountains and towns around Everest, to inside a monastery and a German bakery selling raisin bread and apple strudel.The company partnered with a veteran Nepalese sherpa who guided the company through capturing the sights of his home. "Our region is famous for being home to Everest, but it's also the home of the Sherpa community and has been for centuries," Apa Sherpa wrote on Google's blog. "The region has much more to offer than just the mountain. So last year, I guided the Google Maps team through my home region to collect Street View imagery that improves the map of our community. Now you can find Thame on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of Everest, like Khumjung and Phortse." You can start your trek above 13,000 feet here.
