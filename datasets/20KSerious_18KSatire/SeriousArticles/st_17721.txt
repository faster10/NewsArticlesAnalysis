This year has been so fulfilling , and rewarding , and reminded me again why I love acting , which is something ? that I had ? not fallen out of love with ? but something that I had just forgotten about . But when you work with ( Anomalisa co director ) Charlie Kaufman , ? and you work with Quentin Tarantino , ? it reminds you of how amazing an experience ? it can be . You know , Quentin , he gets the best out of everyone , he really does . He s such a huge part of this performance , and he does it in these incredibly delicate , nuanced ways . And he makes the set ? as brutal as it is ? just a place everyone wants to be . Laughs . There s something about his joy that is just absolutely infectious .
