Chloe Sevigny: Jennifer Lawrence is "annoying," "too crass"
Is it actually possible to dislike Jennifer Lawrence, with all her awards show falls and down-to-earth interviews?Apparently, there's at least one person immune to the Oscar winner's charms.26PhotosJennifer LawrenceOscar nominee for "Winter's Bone" plays Katniss Everdeen in "The Hunger Games"In a new interview with V magazine, actress Chloe Sevigny ("American Horror Story: Asylum," "Big Love") admits she's not a fan of the 24-year-old "The Hunger Games" star."I like Emma Stone. Whenever she's herself, she's really cute," Sevigny said in the interview. "Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass."Ouch.The comments came as Sevigny, 40, discussed how actors' personalities impact the success of their careers - and how she might not have the "star quality" to become a Hollywood A-lister."So much is about marketing and selling the product," she mused. "They'll have a really peppy funny girl on the talk show rounds, and everybody adores her and loves her and wants to be her or f--- her, and then so many more people want to watch the movie or TV show. I understand that star quality, how much value that carries.""I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina Jolie is a great movie star. I don't think I can be that, or just be an actor. I don't think I have the charisma," Sevigny added. Which is probably why I never reached another level."
