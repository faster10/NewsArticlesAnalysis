I ' d like to know whether any mute swans kill six ducks per day or even per year . Mute swans have no direct interactions with most sea ducks I don ' t even think they compete for food but hunters have a " daily limit of 7 sea ducks ( scoters , eiders and long tailed ducks ) in addition to the regular duck bag in coastal waters of the Long Island Zone only . " Note italics in the state regulations : Hunters may kill extra sea ducks only if they happen to be hunting in the part of the state where the sea is . Clever .
