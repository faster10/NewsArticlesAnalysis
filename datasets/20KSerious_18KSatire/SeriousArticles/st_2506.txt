Even I was guilty of STP related snobbery . I was once in a bar on the Lower East Side with a crowd of rock writers and one of our pals who happened to be a famous guitarist from one of the biggest bands of the 90s . We were listening to the jukebox , which happened to have Purple , STP s second album on it . We were trying , bored , buzzed , to come up with the most preposterous statement ever : the kind that would get you into a bar fight . One of us , I can t remember who it was , said , Stone Temple Pilots are more important than the Velvet Underground . ? We all laughed , because it wasn t and isn t true .
