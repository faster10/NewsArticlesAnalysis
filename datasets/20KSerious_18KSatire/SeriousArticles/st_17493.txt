The TV list is dominated by British men . Out of 20 nominees across four categories , 7 are from our shores . Most ? Mark Rylance , Damian Lewis , Idris Elba , Patrick Stewart ? are household names , although the name Tobias Menzies ( who has been nominated for historical romp Outlander ) may make a few people scratch their heads . British ladies have fared far less well ( unlike last year ) with only Joanne Froggatt taking a nod for her role of luckless ladies maid Anna Bates in Downton Abbey .
