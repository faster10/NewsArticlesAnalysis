ITU has always sought a multi stakeholder approach . In 2003 and 2005 we led the way with the World Summit on the Information Society , which for the first time brought all sides together to debate how transformational information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) should shape the future . We expect the same kind of constructive cooperation to occur at WCIT . It is crucial that the Internet is not only kept open for business , but is also opened for everyone . We can then continue to innovate and gain the vast benefits that result from access to knowledge .
