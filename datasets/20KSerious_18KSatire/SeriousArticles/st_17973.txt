Let me again , in conclusion , thank H . E . the Prime Minister for hosting us , for inaugurating the meeting . You ve honoured me by coming to the airport , a rare privilege Mr Prime Minister . On behalf of the Afghan people and the government and myself , let me thank you . And , let me again thank Mr Sartaj Aziz for the excellence of the arrangements . I m sure that the proceedings of the meeting will be very productive and we can count on 2016 being very different than 2015 . In 2015 , Afghanistan was forced to fight for its survival . I hope that with this meeting , 2016 would be a year , where we embark on a path of true stability and prosperity in coordination and cooperation with our neighbours , near and far . Thank you .
