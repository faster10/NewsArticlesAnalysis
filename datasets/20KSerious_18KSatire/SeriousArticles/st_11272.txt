The issue of water grabs is a particularly slippery one . Unlike land , water flows and moves from one place to another its availability goes up and down , affected by the seasons , human use , or climate change it can be visible on the surface and invisible underground . It can be a source of food , or disease and pollution . Rights , access and uses are complex and varied . Who has the right to the water in a river the people who live beside it in a given place , the farmers who depend on it for irrigation , or those upstream or downstream ?
