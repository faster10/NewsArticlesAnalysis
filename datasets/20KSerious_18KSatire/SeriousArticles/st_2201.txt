When I was a child I had an illustrated chart of all the kings and queens of England on my bedroom wall . I loved that poster : There was moody King Alfred sighing over burnt cakes , fat , arrogant Henry VIII , Queen Elizabeth I with her inscrutable half smile , Charles II hiding in the tree . They were live and vivid stories of heroism , frailty , failure , fealty , attached to real ruins that real families ( including ours ) seemed to trudge off to engage with at weekends thanks to the National Trust . To me they were a kind of half fantasy . Factually real , but entirely constructed in my imagination .
