Kartheiser : Every director brings a little taste of themselves . At the end of the day , Matthew Weiner has final cut . At the end of the day , Matthew Weiner will re shoot a scene if it doesn ' t fit into the look of the show . That ' s wonderful . Everyone has stylistic differences and he wants them to express those things , but he wants to make sure that there ' s a consistency to the look of the show , to the tone of the show . That being said , I absolutely love John Slattery as a director . He loves the art form of it .
