Obviously , from the perspective of state bureaucracy of either county , rapprochement between India and Pakistan hurt its corporate and ideological interests from the short to the long run . There are some reports which hint to the a similar bureaucratic mistrust exhibited from the bureaucracies across the border in the wake of Agra summit initiated by Pakistani general , Pervez Musharraf , and the then BJP government of India . This variable is further substantiated with data , at least , from Pakistan side where certainelements from within the security establishment played the dubious role of insiders and provided required intelligence to the outsiders , mostly aggrieved elements of a variety of militant organisations , that successfully carried attacks on the Pakistan state , not sparring even the military personnel and installations that included ISI headquarters and the GHQ . That was the moment the Pakistan state must have opened its eyes to the new but bitter realities and taken due measures accordingly . This selective approach impaired our security vision and a heavy price was and has been paid by our state and the society even today .
