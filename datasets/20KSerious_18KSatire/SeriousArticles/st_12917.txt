Human rights organizations condemned the government recommendations to avoid getting pregnant , saying that it s unfair for poor women to have to assume such an enormous public health responsibility in the face of laws that make it impossible for them to do so . You re asking women to make a choice that sounds logical from a health perspective , but it s not a real choice , says Tarah Demant , senior director of the Identity and Discrimination Unit at Amnesty International . It s putting women in an impossible place , by asking them to put the sole responsibility of public health on their shoulders by not getting pregnant , when over half don t have that choice .
