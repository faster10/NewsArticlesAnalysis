Ordinarily , such a package is certainly not to be sneezed at , as the associated stimulus is without doubt meaningful and helpful in underpinning growth and inflation prospects in the euro zone . However , the problematic issue is that yesterday s announcement represented a major disappointment to markets which had developed extremely elevated expectations about what would be delivered by Draghi et al . In particular , markets had been priced for a larger depo rate cut , an increase in the monthly run ? rate of QE purchases and a longer extension of the planned timescale for QE . So when it became clear that Draghi s 5 ? point plan was failing to hit the very lofty expectations of market participants , the result was a pretty violent market reaction across a range of asset classes .
