A CENTCOM spokesperson announced with some pride that prior to destroying 160 oil trucks recently , U . S . planes dropped leaflets telling the drivers that we were going to strike those oil trucks . We then apparently made several low passes to further scare off the drivers . This faculty lounge logic makes absolutely no sense . This type of so called humanitarian concern only will jeopardize our own pilots and aircraft . It is only a matter of time before ISIS uses such prior notification to guide its shoulder fired missiles , causing the loss of American pilots and aircraft .
