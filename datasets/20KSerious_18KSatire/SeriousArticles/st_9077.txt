The Aussie will face a stern examination from four time Australian Open runner up Andy Murray in their fourth round clash on Rod Laver Arena , but said he had a point to prove after Federer s recent comments that Tomic was a long off his stated goal of reaching the top 10 .

If he believes I m very far away from the top 10 , I also believe my prediction that he s nowhere near Novak s tennis right now , he said .
