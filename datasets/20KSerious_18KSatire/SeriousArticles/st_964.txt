From children with skin the same color as mine saying that my normal speaking voice was somehow faked and that I spoke and therefore acted " like a white man " from a black woman who berated me for listening to the Beatles in my car because , in her words , their music " wasn ' t yours " from strangers and would be acquaintances of varied races over several decades who openly wondered if I was something other than African American because of an eclectic range of interests ( Jewish novelists , New Wave French movies , Wallace Stevens ' poetry , etc . ) that didn ' t quite jibe with whatever was expected from African Americans .
