So , in preventing HIV and AIDS , should our national and global health focus shift to men instead of women ? No , that clearly is not the answer . We know that young women are particularly at risk of becoming infected by HIV and among heterosexual women and men , women are infected at higher rates than men are . This is due to sexual coercion , exploitation and violence and because far too many women lack autonomy and equality in their intimate and sexual relationships with men . In short , the behavior of men too often puts women at risk .
