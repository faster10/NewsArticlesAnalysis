In the last few days , more than half of US governors have said they do not want future Syrian refugees resettled in their states . All Republican presidential candidates now oppose bringing in more Syrian refugees , calling for a pause at a minimum . Republican candidate Donald Trump said that , if elected president , he would evict all Syrian refugees in the US , and , in keeping with his tendency towards extreme exaggeration , he tweeted that refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country . Even candidates that are generally seen as more moderate spoke out against accepting Syrian refugees . For example , Marco Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants , said the US should not accept Syrian refugees , because there s no background check system in the world that allows us to find out who might be a Daesh ( the self proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ) fighter .
