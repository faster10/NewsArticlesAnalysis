We humans are funny creatures : We ' re unhappier waiting for test results than hearing a definitive cancer diagnosis . We like to know . Your search for your co worker was random and innocent , but sometimes we do tumble , " Alice in Wonderland " style , into Google rabbit holes that we don ' t need to conduct . Like a dog rubbing its injured paw into the ground , we get buzzed on pain as we search for ex significant others , say , or find out more and more about a tragic 12 car pileup a few miles away .
