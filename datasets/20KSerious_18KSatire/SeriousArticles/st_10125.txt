At a time when the two backward satraps have registered a famous victory over the BJP and energised the opposition ranks , the book should be a recommended read for anyone keen on not only knowing what makes these two contrasting figures tick but also understanding Bihar , a state of wants and deprivations but which has often given a new direction to the national polity . The tome is not really a fresh piece of work but brings together Thakur s , himself a Bihari , earlier works on the two leaders but vastly changed circumstances in the state heightens its significance .
