It now appears , as some had predicted from the start , that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal massacre in San Bernardino were motivated not by disgruntlement over workplace slights , but by Islamic extremism . According to the FBI , Tashfeen Malik ? who , with her husband , Syed Rizwan Farook , killed 14 people and injured 21 more at an office holiday party on Wednesday ? had pledged her allegiance to Islamic State on Facebook . There ' s no indication so far that she or her husband were directed to launch the attack by the group . But given the pledge ? and the assault weapons , pipe bombs and other explosives the couple was stockpiling , as well as the contacts discovered between ? Farook and terrorist groups ? the evidence strongly supports the assumption that the two were self radicalized independent operators inspired to action by rhetoric , terror and violence abroad .
