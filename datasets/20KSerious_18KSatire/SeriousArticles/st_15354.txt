Our " wine educator , " Jonathan Tyer , is so passionate about wine that he plans to enroll in graduate school next fall at UC Davis . Tyer is already an accomplished and prize winning home vintner whose enthusiasm is infectious , as he explains how all of these wines are grown on the hillsides . Sipping our wine , we get a rare behind the scenes peak at the operation the oak barrels where the juice is pressed out of the grapes , the lab where the science of winemaking is conducted to test sugar composition .
