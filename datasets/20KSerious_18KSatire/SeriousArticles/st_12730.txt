During this holiday season , my hope is that everyone will realize the importance of being a blood donor . For people like me who need regular transfusions , blood is often best matched among people of the same ethnic group , so donations from anyone who is a minority or has a rare blood type such as U or Fy ( a b ) are especially important . You could help someone like me live a healthier , happier , pain free life . I am a testament to the importance of blood donation and the services that the American Red Cross provides on a daily basis . Without both I wouldn ' t be able to be a happy and successful young lady .
