EMAIL REPRIEVE : POLITICO s Josh Gerstein reports : A federal judge has turned down a request from the website Gawker to force former HILLARY CLINTON aide Philippe Reines to explain why he had work related emails in a private account and how he decided which messages to include in 20 boxes of records he handed over to the State Department in July . Following a 50 minute hearing in Washington on Thursday morning , U . S . District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson did not rule out requiring such a filing at some point but said she was not convinced it was necessary now . http : politi . co 1U9qfyU
