In a single quarterback , season long league , you drafted Roethlisberger to be your guy . You likely ? save for an extreme circumstance like trading for a better QB while he was out ? don t have a better alternative . You need to start him . In weekly leagues , you might be inclined to wait and see how he does in his first game back before rolling the dice with him . In that regard , skepticism is understandable . I m going with Philip Rivers in weekly formats , but Roethlisberger is arguably a top five option .
