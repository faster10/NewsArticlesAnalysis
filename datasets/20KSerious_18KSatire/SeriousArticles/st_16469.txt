One good example for why they feel this way : In the weeks leading up to the CNBC debate , there were intense behind the scenes discussions between the campaigns , the RNC , and CNBC over the network s plan to not include opening and closing statements .

CNBC ultimately backed off , telling the RNC ? which was negotiating on the campaigns behalf it would allow an open ended opening statement and a closing statement .
