The question now is whether Sandy will stimulate similarly new ways of thinking about our infrastructure . Will she energize what to date have been spotty efforts to prepare the city and its systems for sea level rise and storm surges ? Will the money made available by Washington in disaster relief be used to sow the seeds for real change ? Will the dislocation experienced by all focus sufficient attention on those state institutions that have been given the power to oversee the city ' s infrastructure but not the ability to finance it effectively ?
