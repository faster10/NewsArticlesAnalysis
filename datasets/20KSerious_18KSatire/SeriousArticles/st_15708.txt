The intensity of the Van Gaal Cruyff split does seem curious . All Dutch teams , including Van Gaal ' s , pass the ball exceptionally well . Both coaches have a penchant for the back three and for attacking football . They grew up in neighbouring Amsterdam suburbs and played at Ajax where Van Gaal , who played in Cruyff ' s position , left because he couldn ' t establish himself in the first team . Van Gaal then followed Cruyff as coach at Barcelona in the 90s , providing the link to Guardiola .
