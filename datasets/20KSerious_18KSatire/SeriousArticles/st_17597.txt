We are now living in a Frankenstein political age ? a parliamentary culture with a presidency grafted onto it . Barring some massive shift in our system ? Obama called for one in the speech , but who is especially optimistic about that ? ? a one party state is required to pass any significant legislation . Politics is so polarized that Paul Ryan , seated directly behind Obama , wouldn t even clap for a section about curing cancer . Activism , organizing and popular movements , not Washington , are providing the dynamism and action these days . A divided Congress leaves the president able to bomb other countries , sign executive orders and engage in the kind of rhetorical bully pulpit politics that Obama ? whose speechifying , public demeanor and embrace of his position as America s first black president became bolder , more liberal and more pronounced as his ability to actually do anything domestically shrank to virtually zero ? has skillfully deployed in the past couple of years .
