The mass execution of 47 people on Saturday the largest carried out by the Saudi regime for 35 years involved beheading in some cases . When Isis carried out that barbaric practice it is rightly condemned , when Saudi Arabia uses it , the world has for too long looked away . Capital punishment of any kind ought not be condoned in diplomacy . As more states of the US slowly discontinue the practice , and no other Western country kills its own citizens , states like Saudi Arabia should be confronted with civilised disapproval .
