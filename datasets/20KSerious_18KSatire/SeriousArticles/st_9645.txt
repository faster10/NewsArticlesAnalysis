Our iPhones and tablets have made touch screens commonplace , and we can communicate with Siri or Google through voice commands just like the computer on the Enterprise ( though maybe not as effectively ) . We can instantly connect with others across great distances and even across language barriers thanks to recent advancements like Microsoft ' s Skype Translator technology .

Scientists have even been able to transport particles of matter across distances , perhaps taking the first steps toward transporting people through space one day .
