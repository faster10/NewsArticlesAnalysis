Among the criticisms lodged against Sanders is the assertion that his health plan represents a departure from his previous health proposals as a congressman and senator . While Sanders previous proposals called for health plans to be administered by states , his new one calls for federal management . On the topic of foreign policy , in a New York Times interview last week , Sanders appeared to shift his position on both normalizing relations with Iran and putting Iranian ground troops in Syria . ( Briggs contended that neither move was a shift , but rather that Sanders earlier statements were being misread . )
