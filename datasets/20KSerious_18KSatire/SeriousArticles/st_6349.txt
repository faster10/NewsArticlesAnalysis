3 . Eating meat adds to your greenhouse gas footprint : Finally , eating animals , like doing almost anything , contributes to a person ' s greenhouse gas footprint . The United Nations estimates animal agriculture accounts for 14 . 5 of human greenhouse gas emissions , with the main source of those emissions 45 of the total being the fossil fuels used while growing and fertilizing crops to feed the animals . There ' s some debate about how much animal agriculture contributes to climate change overall . But there ' s no doubt it has a sizable impact , and more so than plant agriculture .

Pork and chicken are better , creating about 2 pounds and half a pound , respectively . Potatoes , apples and asparagus are better still , creating a tiny fraction of a pound of greenhouse gases .
