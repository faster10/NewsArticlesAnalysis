Last weekend , 24 year old surfer Ben Linden was attacked by a great white near Perth , becoming the fifth fatality off that coast in the past 10 months . In response , the Western Australia Fishing Minister , Norman Moore , promised to write the federal government " to know if there has been any update on the status of the white sharks and the sustainability level at which the Federal Government will lift protection . " If Mr Moore has his way , hundreds if not thousands of sharks will be killed in Australia . I have a problem with that .
