Yeah . There are giant tectonic plates that are shifting and this is reflective of the Republican Party at large . And the central fault line between these two plates is immigration , where Trump has staked out the most extreme position . Early on , Murdoch was very anti Trump and told Ailes to tone down the Trump coverage because of this . In recent weeks , Murdoch has warmed to a Trump candidacy , mainly because he sees how enduring Trump s power is . And if there is one thing we know about Rupert Murdoch it is that he will make concessions to power if it will advance his business interests . He made a pact in the 1990s with Tony Blair even though he was a Thatcherite . He sees that Trump may be the nominee and could be the next president and so he wants to figure out how to deal with this guy .
