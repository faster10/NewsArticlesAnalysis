Ebola is a human tragedy , just like enterovirus D68 , which causes sudden muscle weakness and severe respiratory problems , particularly among children . It has shown up in almost all the 50 states , with about 500 Americans infected so far , far more than ever . And it has begun to kill , beginning with a 4 year old boy in New Jersey . Five new cases were reported in New Jersey alone on Tuesday . And there are no antiviral vaccines or cures . Yet enterovirus D68 is known by a scientific name and number . ( Unfortunately for Africans , the Ebola virus was named after the Congolese river where the first outbreak was detected ) .
