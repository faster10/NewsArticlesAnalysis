The attacks occurred three days before the Spanish general elections , which the Popular Party government appeared likely to win . But the swarm of media reports blamed the attacks on Spain s involvement in Iraq . On March 14 , voters turned out en masse and elected the Socialist Party .

Most of those 9 percent said they switched to the Socialist Party , whose narrow margin of victory ( 43 percent to 38 percent ) suggested that the bombing may have tipped the elections .
