Still , Cruz shouldn t panic . The polls tell us much more about today than they do about Feb . 1 , when Iowans will officially kick off the 2016 presidential nominating contest . With less than three weeks to go until then , more than half of the respondents in the Register poll said that they could still be persuaded to back a different candidate ( though those backing either Trump or Cruz are the most likely to say their mind has been made up ) . That could create a serious opening for Cruz , who is the second choice of 23 percent of Iowa Republicans , compared with 11 percent for Trump . The doom saying senator also appears to have the advantage when it comes to ground level organization in the state , something that has traditionally been integral in a contest that sees only about 1 in 5 registered Republicans show up to caucus . Meanwhile , when Silver and his team factor in endorsements and national polls , they see Cruz s chance of an Iowa victory rising to 50 percent and Trump s falling to 26 percent . ( FiveThirtyEight has found some evidence it may actually be a bad thing in the long term to be doing better in national polls relative to early state surveys , which is one reason Trump s prospects drop when you add other factors to the state poll numbers . )
