The more plausible explanation is that the state invested heavily in football as a means of gaining prestige and asserting identity . So it ' s a state project which has borne fruit . The epitome of the state ' s exploitation of Brazilian football expertise was the repressive dictatorship ' s propaganda attempts to associate itself with the success of the Brazilian team in the 1970 World Cup finals . I think when some people protest now , they are maybe ( unconsciously ) associating this Cup with that authoritarian project and rejecting it .
