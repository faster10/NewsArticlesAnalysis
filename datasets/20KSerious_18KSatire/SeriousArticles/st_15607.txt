That s another point I make in the book which I think is important in looking forward to these primaries . There are a lot of smart Republican strategists who make the point , fairly , that in the last two elections the more moderate conservative , compared to their opponents , prevailed : John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 . But if you look carefully at both contests , the reason both McCain and Romney prevailed is that it was the conservatives splitting up their side of the vote . In 2012 , Gingrich and Santorum , combined , were ahead of Romney in many states . And in 2008 , McCain was very lucky because his more conservative adversaries kept knocking each other off , so that Huckabee beat Romney in Iowa , then Fred Thompson took enough votes away from Huckabee to allow McCain to win South Carolina . McCain won these early primaries with no more than a third of the vote .
