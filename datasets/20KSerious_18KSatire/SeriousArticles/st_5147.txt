Let us not forget that the Assad family has ruthlessly ruled Syria for over 50 years , and Russia has been the Assads ' benefactor for just as long . Russia has had a major Mediterranean naval base at Tartus has served as the principal supplier of arms to the Assads for decades . Russia has a compelling geostrategic imperative to keep a Shiite regime in power in Syria to thwart an extremist Sunni takeover because that will only accelerate Islamist terror attacks in the Russian Caucuses . Putin is playing a classic geopolitical balance of power maneuver . He is not wedded to Assad far from it . Putin will throw Assad under the bus whenever it is strategically useful for him to do so . All Russia desires is to midwife a Syrian proxy regime to legitimate and protect Russia ' s military presence in Syria and help prevent an Islamic extremist army marching north into Russia .
