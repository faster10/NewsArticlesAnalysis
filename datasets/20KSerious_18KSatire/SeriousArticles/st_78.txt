Flint residents complained about contaminants in their drinking water almost immediately after the city changed its water supply to the Flint River . The response to their complaints , which test results substantiated , was to dump chlorine in the water to kill the bacteria . The chlorine , a well known corrosive , added to corrosives already present and caused Flint ' s pipes to leach dangerously high concentrations of lead . Treating the dirty water with chlorine seems simple enough except that a 2011 study had found that given the condition of Flint ' s pipes , water from the Flint River would have to be treated with an anti corrosion agent before use .
