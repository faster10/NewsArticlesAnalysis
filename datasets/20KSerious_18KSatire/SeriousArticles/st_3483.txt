India and France have had a long standing cooperation in the space sector . When we started the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) our sounding rockets were French . All our satellites that weigh two tonnes and above have been launched by Arianespace ( French multinational company and commercial launch service provider ) . The French , in turn , use our PSLV ( Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ) to launch their smaller satellites . We are also doing joint fabrication of satellites . It ' s a solid relationship of equals in the space sector .
