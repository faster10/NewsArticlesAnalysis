Craig started off by talking about if the Caps have some post season awards coming their way saying yeah I think Trotz should be the coach of the year for the way he kept this team together Holtby should win the Vezina but for the Hart he will have a battle with a couple of guys . As for T . J . Oshie and if he is surprised with his early season play Craig said I am I thought he would be a different player what has surprised me more than anything is he is such a hound on the puck , I always thought of him as a fancy Dan he has brought more to the table than I ever thought .
