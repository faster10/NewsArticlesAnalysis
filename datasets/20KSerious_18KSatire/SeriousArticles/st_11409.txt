After a fatal attack on Rajan in Bangkok in 2000 by the Chhota Shakeel gang in which his aide Rohit Verma was killed , Rajan went on a killing spree , targeting Dawood ' s henchmen on suspicion that they leaked information about him . Rajan also killed Sautya outside a hotel in Dubai in a sensational shootout .
