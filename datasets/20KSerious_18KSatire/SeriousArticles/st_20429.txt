1868 Amendment XIV The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution defines the U . S . citizen , and thus clarifies who may vote : " All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside . " Children of immigrants , even illegal immigrants , are citizens and may vote when they come of age . However , this amendment does not expressly grant suffrage to non whites and women . It does set the legal age for voting at 21 . This amendment also allows a state to remove the right to vote for " participation in rebellion , or other crime . " As a result , most states still ban incarcerated felons from voting , and several states extend that ban to ex felons .
