First things first : This is a shortsighted policy proposal that isn t just morally misguided it s dangerous . As Slate s Joshua Keating points out , the Islamic State is doing everything it can to get young , nihilistic recruits to move to Syria , not fan out across the globe . Closing our borders to refugees would only provide ISIS with a bigger pool of frustrated , marginalized young Muslims to try to radicalize . Furthermore , there s no reason to mistake Syrian refugees for ISIS terrorists . As another of my colleagues , Will Dobson , explains , there may be no more difficult way for a would be terrorist to enter the United States right now than to pose as a Syrian refugee .
