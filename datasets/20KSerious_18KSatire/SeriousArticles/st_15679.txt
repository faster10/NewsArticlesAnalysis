The US sees China as an adversary seeking to usurp its position as top nation . President Barack Obama may talk of a pivot to Asia , but America tends to see the China relationship as a zero sum game , in which one side s gain is the other s loss . Any appeasement or concession to Beijing , it is argued , will only prompt China to seek more . Throw in America s post war role as guarantor of the status quo in the western Pacific and its close alliance with the Philippines and other countries in the region concerned by Chinese expansionism , and the dispatch of a US warship into contested waters around the artificial islands China is building in the Spratlys makes perfect sense .
