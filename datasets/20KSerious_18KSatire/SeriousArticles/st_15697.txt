Wright : First off , improving the defense was San Antonio ' s No . 1 point of emphasis during the preseason , after the way the team performed in the first round loss last season against the Los Angeles Clippers . Back in October , Popovich called the team ' s transition defense in Games 6 and 7 against the Clippers the " worst transition defense in the history of basketball . " The Clippers outscored the Spurs 33 4 on the break in last year ' s playoff series , and Popovich figured that since they ' re usually one of the worst offensive rebounding teams in the league , they ' d better shore up their transition defense . Outside of that , I think San Antonio ' s emphasis on defense was a function of them still trying to find their way offensively as they work Aldridge into the mix . The Spurs are mature and experienced enough to know that some nights shots will fall , and other nights they won ' t . But the one thing they can always control is their effort on defense , which as you know can often open up things offensively .
