From Addis I went in South Africa and I went to Mozambique to meet the president of Mozambique . The day after I was back to Dakar . Two days after I was back to Geneva and I traveled to New York for one day . I came in the morning , I left the next day in the evening . I went back to Geneva , go to Paris and then came back to Senegal . So it ' s a life of crazy . "
