Following his inauguration , Afghan President Ashraf Ghani made a courageous outreach to Pakistan , which included a historic visit to Pakistan s GHQ . Hopes were raised very high . To quote my article , The making of history ( Daily Times , November 20 , 2014 ) : Throwing aside diplomatic norms , the Afghan president visited the GHQ immediately after landing in Islamabad . A foreign head of state heading straight towards a military HQ on arrival carries a lot more than ceremonial importance the Afghan president means business because he well understands where the real power concerning national security rests . Subsequently , Ashraf Ghani described his discussions the next day with the Pakistani PM as a shared vision to serve as the heart of Asia , ensuring economic integration by enhancing connectivity between South and Central Asia through energy , gas and oil pipelines becoming a reality and not remaining a dream . The narrative for the future must include the most neglected of our people becoming stakeholders in a prosperous economy in stable and peaceful countries our faiths are linked because terror knows no boundaries . We have overcome obstacles of 13 years in three days , we will not permit the past to destroy the future .
