Oof . Elon Musk speculated that a collet ( a rotating clamp similar to a chuck on a drill that attaches telescoping rods together ) on one of the landing legs didn t secure it tightly enough . When the booster put weight on the leg , it collapsed , and down she went . The root cause may be condensation that got in there from the thick fog at launch , which then froze in the upper atmosphere . Mind you , this is speculation ! I m sure SpaceX will examine the debris very closely to see what s what .
