Presidents and Congress are often in tension with each other . The Framers of the Constitution knew that would be the case and designed a system meant to keep either branch from growing too powerful . The Constitution expressly vests all legislative power in Congress , and just as expressly obliges the president to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . When issues like immigration divide the American people , they tend to divide Congress , too . Presidents can use the bully pulpit to try and shift public opinion , but only Congress can legislate . A president who rewrites laws to fit his own preferences sabotages the constitutional order he took an oath to uphold .
