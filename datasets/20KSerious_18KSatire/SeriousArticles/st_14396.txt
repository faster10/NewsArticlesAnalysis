Warren isn t being entirely silent . She periodically emerges to praise the major candidates for espousing policies she favors . In December , the Clinton campaign was elated when Warren took to Facebook to praise the candidate s call to block riders in the year end budget bill that would have weakened financial regulations . Secretary Clinton is right to fight back against Republicans trying to sneak Wall Street giveaways into the must pass government funding bill , Warren wrote . Whether it s attacking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , undermining new rules to rein in unscrupulous retirement advisers , or rolling back any part of the hard fought progress we ve made on financial reform , she and I agree : President Obama and congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts . Sanders has garnered similar approbation . On Jan . ? 6 , Warren unleashed a tweet storm in support of his speech on Wall Street reform : I m glad BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable , make our economy safer , stop the GOP from rigging the system .
