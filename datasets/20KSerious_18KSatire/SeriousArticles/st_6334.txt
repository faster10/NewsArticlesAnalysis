America ' s crisis on the border needs solutions , but they must live up to our American values and reflect who we are as a country . And they must be bipartisan . Republicans need to get hold of themselves , understand facts and keep their anti immigrant extremist voices in check . If they don ' t do it for the country ' s future , they should at least do it for their own political survival . Republicans cannot afford to further alienate the county ' s largest minority . If the GOP does not reverse its lack of Latino support , it can say good bye to its chances of getting to the Casa Blanca .
