I called up a few experts and asked your advice on this topic . As one of my Facebook friends was smart to point out , it ' s probably not a good idea to be in the business of telling people " what they are or are not . " Environmentalism takes many forms and encompasses a range of issues . I ' m not willing to say a person cannot be an environmentalist and also an omnivore . ( If you ride a bike and eat steak , is that better or worse than being a vegetarian who drives a Hummer ? ) But I would hope that person has thought through the very real environmental consequences of meat consumption .
