This basic supply demand dynamic also means that many developers ask for some pretty insane terms . Some demand deals that involve a huge upfront payment in exchange for a few weeks ( or even just days ) of work . And if a decent developer isn ' t already working full time , it ' s not unreasonable to assume he ' s at least a little commitment averse . So , if you ' re serious about making something beyond a quickie cash grab , find a developer you are sure will stay with the project for updates , and not abandon it the second it hits the store .
