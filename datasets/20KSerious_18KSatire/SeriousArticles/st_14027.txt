For Bowie , the 70s started a little late . He described 1970 as a waste of a year because the delayed release of The Man Who Sold the World enhanced his sense of depression and pointlessness the unreleased Tired of My Life presented him as a typical victim of post 60s malaise . He only began to survey the new decade with confidence on Hunky Dory ( 1971 ) and what he saw was an exhausted landscape of fallen icons and sunken dreams , crying out for change . Life on Mars ? was his tour of the cultural ruins , with a teenage heroine who deserved better . Bowie saw a leadership void in rock and felt that the hungry new generation he described in Changes and Oh ! You Pretty Things needed a new kind of rock star , attuned to the chaotic vibrations of the time : someone like David Bowie .
