When I asked officers on Latakia base about this , they didn t deny the authenticity of such selfies but said these soldiers weren t in combat units ? they were in freight convoys , protecting cargo . The Kremlin has said there are no Russian troops in combat roles in Syria , though it has said there are trainers and advisers working alongside the Syrian military and also forces guarding Russia s bases in western Syria . The political leadership seems concerned about possible casualties among the troops that would undermine public support for this campaign like it was during the Soviet war in Afghanistan . As one high ranking officer told me : We re staying put at the base ? back in Russia they don t want more coffins .
