So I figure I better get started now . A new friend at the bus stop gave me good advice , which was to sign up for the PTA activities that get you face time with your kid working an event that the kindergarteners will attend , for example , as opposed to something for the older students . Kids get a kick out of seeing their parents at school , right ? And also to do things that get you face time with the teacher staff appreciation , for example because , well , that one is self explanatory , especially given my worries about Alex ' s pain in the ass ness .
