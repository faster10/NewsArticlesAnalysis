Lessin : Originally the film was fueled by a sense of outrage . What it became , I guess , was something a little different . It ' s really about hope and survival . We were inspired by Kim and Scott ' s journey , and their commitment to do something different in their lives . The voices on 911 calls , we think about those people all the time , and there ' s no way to know what happened to them . What keeps us up at night now is that people are still struggling . Levees are still vulnerable , there ' s a lack of affordable housing , lack of jobs . Schools are a dismal failure . Tens of thousands of people can ' t return home . We hope in this new administration , things will happen .
