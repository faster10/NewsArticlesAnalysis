JR : I think it is a fair question and I think its something that I that I have to answer very honestly . As a journalist , I am not allowed and I will never give my opinion on the air when I ' m doing the newscast . I have to give both points of view and that ' s exactly what I do all the time . But as an immigrant with a voice , because I have the privilege of having a voice , there are times when I have the need to talk for those who don ' t have a voice . As long as you ' re very clear on your roles , as long as you tell people exactly what you ' re doing , I think I am being fair and honest .
