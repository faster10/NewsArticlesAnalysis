SNOW JOB : Viewers of last night s game were able to see Nike s new commercial : Snow Day . The commercial begins with Rob Gronkowski waking up to a snow covered landscape . When he steps out on his front porch , he is pelted by a snowball thrown by Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh . It s safe to say the snowball was the only effective thing Suh did against the Patriots all night . As the commercial continues , Suh and Gronk are joined in by a plethora of other star athletes , who join in to play a pickup game of football .
