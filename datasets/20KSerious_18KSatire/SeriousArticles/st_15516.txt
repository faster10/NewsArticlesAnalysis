When you are finally ready to leave the estate , you can mingle with the locals at any of the cafes and pubs in the nearby villages of Ballater and Braemar . In addition to offering fresh , locally sourced food , both offer remarkably good shopping . There are several art galleries showcasing local artists , bookshops stocked with everything you ' d want to read about the region and country shops where you ' ll be able to stock up on Harris Tweeds , Hunter boots and Barbour coats . If you want a real taste of Highland whiskey , there are tours and tastings at the Royal Lochnagar distillery , less than a mile from the estate , which has been producing whiskey since the mid 19th century .
