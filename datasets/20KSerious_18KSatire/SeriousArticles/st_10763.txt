This is more or less where things stood in early 2014 , when the price pendulum suddenly began swinging in the other direction , as production from unconventional fields in the U . S . and Canada began to make its presence felt in a big way . ? Domestic U . S . crude production , which had dropped from 7 . 5 million barrels per day in January 1990 to a mere 5 . 5 million barrels in January 2010 , suddenly headed upwards , reaching a stunning 9 . 6 million barrels in July 2015 . ? Virtually all the added oil came from newly exploited shale formations in North Dakota and Texas . ? Canada experienced a similar sharp uptick in production , as heavy investment in tar sands began to pay off . ? According to BP , Canadian output jumped from 3 . 2 million barrels per day in 2008 to 4 . 3 million barrels in 2014 . ? And don t forget that production was also ramping up in , among other places , deep offshore fields in the Atlantic Ocean off both Brazil and West Africa , which were just then coming on line . ? At that very moment , to the surprise of many , war torn Iraq succeeded in lifting its output by nearly one million barrels per day .
