The Royals have rewritten not just a franchise s sorry history , but forever changed the way sports are viewed and loved and consumed back home . Kansas City has not had a championship parade in 30 years , long enough that babies conceived and born in the years since have grown up to know sports success only as something that happens in other places . It is long enough that some of those kids are doctors , or war heroes . They have careers and mortgages and marriages . Some have divorces . This is a long time coming .
