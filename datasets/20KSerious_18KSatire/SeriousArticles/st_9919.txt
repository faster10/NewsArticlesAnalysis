Careful readers will note that I m arguing that both Democrats and Republicans got an end to debt limit and government shutdown extortion . There has long been a dominant fiction in Washington that agreeing to lift the debt limit somehow constituted a concession on the part of Republicans for which they should be given something in return by Democrats . In reality , Republican leaders themselves have wanted the debt limit increased ? because default would hurt the country ? and have acquiesced in the manufacturing of debt ceiling crises mainly in a vain quest to placate conservatives by making it look as if the GOP is fighting Obama . Thus , both sides have now been liberated from the need to do this any longer . Meanwhile , both sides wanted the fix to Medicare Part B . Both got that .
