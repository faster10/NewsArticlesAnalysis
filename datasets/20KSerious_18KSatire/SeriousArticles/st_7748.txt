As an aerospace professional and former NASA executive , I have encountered over the decades many concepts for private space exploration . Until a few years ago , none of these ideas met the sniff test for what I call the " practical visionary , " that is , someone capable of seeing a new future , yet solidly grounded in lessons learned . Something was always missing in these early ventures either the technical approach required some " unobtanium " technology to be invented , the advocate had good ideas but no money or the " build it and they will come " philosophy showed total naivet in business and marketing .
