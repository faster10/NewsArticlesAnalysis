I was able to go to the appeals process with the film , where you show it to a different audience . . . . You screen it for theater owners , and then you get up and do 15 minutes on why you feel it should be an R . Joan Graves of the MPAA gets up and does 15 minutes on why she feels it ' s an NC 17 , then you get 10 minutes to rebut , she gets 10 minutes to rebut . You leave the room , and that audience makes the vote . . . . You have to win by a two thirds majority to have the rating changed .
