Editor ' s note : Canadian writer Margaret Atwood is the author of more than 35 books of poetry , fiction and nonfiction . Her novels include " The Handmaid ' s Tale " and " The Blind Assassin , " which won the Booker Prize in 2000 . Her new book , published this week by House of Anansi Press , is " Payback : Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth . " Atwood says the book " is not a practical guide about how to get out of debt . Instead it examines the underpinnings of the whole structure why we human beings have such a thing as a debt credit system in the first place . "
