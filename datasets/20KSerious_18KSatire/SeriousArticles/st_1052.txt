3 . Isaiah Thomas went hero ball at the worst times . For a guy known to be so great at after timeout plays , Brad Stevens saw his team run hero ball isolations for Isaiah Thomas on possessions to end regulation and the first overtime , both misses , one of them blocked by the much larger Shaun Livingston . The Celtics don ' t have that transcendent player , and really need to run quality sets . They scored 10 points on 14 after timeout plays via Synergy Sports . They have had so many players contribute this season , so it was weird to see them go to Thomas in those situations . He ' s their best offensive player , but he ' s also small , going against smart , long defenders . Missed opportunities there for the Celtics .
