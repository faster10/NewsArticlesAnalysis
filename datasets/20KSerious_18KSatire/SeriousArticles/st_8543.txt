Fortunately , not bothering to develop a tailored message for Northern moderates is something that the unique size and makeup of this primary field allows him to get away with . Nearly all New Hampshire polling in recent weeks has shown the same static picture : Trump is out front with roughly 30 percent of the vote , followed by a five way tie for second between Sen .
