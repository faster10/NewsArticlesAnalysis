Now to breaking news , the brand new report about what happened on that plane that crashed in Malaysia killing all 162 people on board . The airbus a320 went down halfway into its two hour flight just after last Christmas and the report finds a small crack on a computer board on the airasia jet started the problem but they ultimately blame the pilot ' s response saying they caused the jet to lose control . Steve ganyard joins us with more . What can you tell us about what exactly happened ? It was a series of errors by the aircrew that caused this mishap of the there was a very mine more computer problem but because the crew made these errors , the aircraft pitched up , lost air speed , stalled and for three or four minutes flopped around out of control before it hit the ocean killing everyone aboard . Steve , this type of plane , the a320 is a plane many of us fly on . Does this new information , this report have any impact on air travel in the U . S . ? It doesn ' t reflect on airbus or the a 320 but the rise of these large third world budget airlines and real questions about their safety . But it also goes to a larger question , Amy , I think my first flight in an airplane at age 13 , the instructor taught me how to stall the airplane , how to recover from a stall . In this case the basic piloting skills that may have been lost on this crew could have saved the day . So have we lost something with this automation we have in these airplanes in basic piloting skills ? All right , a big question there . A lot of people will be focusing on today .
