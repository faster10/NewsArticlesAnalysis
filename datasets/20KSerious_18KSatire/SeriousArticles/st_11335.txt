The Giants haven t just lost credibility , as John Mara said last week on the day when Coughlin stepped aside . They have lost our interest , at least when Eli isn t throwing it to Beckham . They were not the biggest game in town this season because the Jets were , even if things went wrong for the Jets at the very end , the way a lot of Jets seasons have . It has been years since you thought of the Giants as an elite team , even with an elite quarterback with that quarterback playing at his highest regular season levels as he has had the controls for McAdoo s offense .
