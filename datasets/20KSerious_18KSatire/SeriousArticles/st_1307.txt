And on top of everything else , the exchange website is a complete boondoggle . Sebelius testified the government has spent almost 175 million on HealthCare . gov so far , and the real tab will surely be much higher after the emergency repairs . Already , this is substantially more than Apple spent to develop the iPhone , and even ( as I pointed out recently ) more than NASA spent on the Mars Pathfinder mission . It likely makes HealthCare . gov the most expensive website ever built , and certainly the most expensive not to function although perhaps that word no longer means what we thought it did .
