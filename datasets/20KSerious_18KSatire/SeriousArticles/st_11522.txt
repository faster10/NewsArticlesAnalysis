Feinstein has said that online companies have to report the child pornography they find , so why not report terror related posts as well ? But unlike child porn , there is no central database of images , videos and texts that could help identify terrorism related activity online . A better response would be to beef up law enforcement ' s ability to spot such material , while doing more to rebut the propaganda by offering a better , more truthful vision of Islam and the world . Tech companies can be important partners in those efforts , but the Feinstein Burr bill isn ' t the right way to build that partnership .
