Reports of Maggie Smith's "Downton Abbey" exit may be premature
Perhaps the Dowager Countess isn't departing "Downton Abbey" so soon after all.Publicists for the series say Maggie Smith was misinterpreted in remarks widely reported as suggesting she plans to leave after its sixth season later this year.Smith, 80, told Britain's Sunday Times newspaper that "I can't see how ('Downton') could go on."Speaking of her character, she added: "I mean, I certainly can't keep going. To my knowledge, I must be 110 by now."Milk Publicity said Tuesday that Smith spoke lightheartedly, and "has always been on the record as saying she'll be with the show for as long as the show runs."Producers haven't announced whether the show will continue past season 6. Creator Julian Fellowes is due to script a new period drama, "The Gilded Age," set in New York City. "Downton Abbey" finished airing its fifth season in the U.S. Sunday night on PBS. British viewers saw that season finale at the end of last year.
