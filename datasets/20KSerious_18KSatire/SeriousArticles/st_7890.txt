Germany ' s policies provide considerable financial help , but they essentially encourage mothers ( recent figures show that only 15 of fathers take advantage of the leave ) to quit the work force . Only an astonishing 14 of German mothers with one child in fact resume full time work . Thus the family policies end up promoting the role of the father provider , while mothers in effect feel the need to choose between family and work from the moment the first child is born , an especially risky proposition when one in three marriages ends in divorce .
