Thirty years later , Emily ' s List is a powerhouse , raising more than 60 million for pro choice female Democrats in the 2014 cycle . It expects to easily top that to help elect Hillary Clinton and other Democrat women in 2016 . While Emily ' s List grew from Democratic women giving money to elect women , female GOP donors give far less than their Democratic sisters and comprise the smallest percentage of political donations . No one has been asking Republican women to run or briefing them on policies , as Emily ' s List does . The impact over the decades is clear : there were 62 Democratic women in the House compared with 22 Republican women . And there were 15 Democratic senators versus just five GOP female senators . In state legislatures , 59 . 8 percent of the women elected are Democratic , while 39 . 4 percent are Republican .
