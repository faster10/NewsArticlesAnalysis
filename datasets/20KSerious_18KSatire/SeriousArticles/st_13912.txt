The crowd couldn ' t help but get behind this incredible effort . However , as the small child approached the finish line , he possibly buckled under the pressure . He was about a foot and a half away from winning the race when the roar of the crowd cheering him on was simply too much . He stopped right in his tracks with the camera zoomed in on his face . He leaned back on his legs under him and began sobbing . He cried for the entire crowd and the cheers immediately turned into " awwwww " sounds . The rest of the competition was nowhere near him .
