Applause was sporadic , the loudest coming when Trump mentioned getting rid of gun free zones on military bases , when he told the crowd Christianity is under siege , and when he touted his recent endorsement by Arizona s controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio . A law enforcement official said 1 , 000 chairs were laid out , of which about 75 appeared full by the time the rally was under way . And while no one could offer an official count , an estimate put the crowd at 700 to 800 people . It was still a sizable group in comparison to what other candidates draw at their rallies , but one that was low energy , according to NBC News Kerry Sanders . ?
