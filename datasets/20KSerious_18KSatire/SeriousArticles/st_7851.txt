Advocates are not leaving that outcome to chance . In a show of how serious they are about legalization as public policy , they are actively assisting states in implementation . If the movement will continue to succeed , it must be actively committed to making implementation work and work well . If the experience of the Affordable Care Act in 2013 has shown us anything , it is that implementation matters . Botched rollouts , unforeseen bumps in the road and other challenges hurt advocates and embolden opponents .
