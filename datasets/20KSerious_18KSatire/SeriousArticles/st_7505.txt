CRUZ SAYS TRUMP S IMMIGRATION POLICY AMOUNTS TO AMNESTY : Ted Cruz has praised Donald Trump for making illegal immigration a central issue of the Republican presidential race , but in an exclusive interview with ABC News , Cruz said that Trump s immigration plan amounts to amnesty . " So Donald Trump ' s position is once you deport them , it ' s what ' s called touchback . A lot of establishment Republicans had touchback . Basically you make them fly back to their country for a minute , touch the ground , and then they come back with amnesty as citizens . Now , Donald is entitled to do that . He can advance that position , but he doesn ' t get to pretend that it ' s not amnesty if he ' s legalizing and making citizens 12 million people here illegally , said Cruz in an exclusive interview with ABC s GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS . Cruz also accused Trump of latching onto the issue of illegal immigration for political gain , ABC s JESSICA HOPPER writes . Cruz says during the battle over the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill , Trump was notably absent . ? http : abcn . ws 1SBiGDa
