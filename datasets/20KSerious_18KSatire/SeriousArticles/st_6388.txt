In South Carolina , we don ' t register by parties the GOP primary is open to all those who call themselves Republicans . Our voters are a much more diverse group than those in Iowa and New Hampshire . Yes , Christian conservatives dominate the GOP here , but victory in South Carolina means you have successfully appealed to a wide variety of Republican concerns . It means you have the support of fiscal conservatives ( Coast and Upstate ) , social conservatives ( Upstate and all around ) , transplanted retirees ( Upstate and Coastal Low Country ) , business owners ( Statewide ) and veterans ( Midlands and Coast ) .
