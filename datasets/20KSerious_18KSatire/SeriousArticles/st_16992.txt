Tusk said that the situation will worsen as a result of Russia ' s decision to launch airstrikes against ground targets in Syria , which began at the end of September . The majority of the strikes have been in areas held by groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al Assad , including fighters backed by Washington and its allies , rather than those occupied by the militant group ISIS . Russia ' s involvement has been heavily condemned by NATO , who have called on the country to stop its attacks on the Syrian opposition and civilians .
