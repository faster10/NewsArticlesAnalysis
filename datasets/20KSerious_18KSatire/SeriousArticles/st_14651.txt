Imagine an America where everyone had performed a year of service , and the first question people ask each other when they meet is " where did you serve ? " Imagine if every year , we had an army of 1 million young people educating needy public school children , reclaiming our environment , performing critical disaster relief , attacking poverty and uplifting opportunity , and caring for and empowering our veterans . Imagine what our conversations around race , class and religion would be like if all Americans lived in a culture of solidarity and mutual responsibility , and worked together to tackle our greatest challenges . Imagine how young people would be viewed if they had abundant opportunities to serve as leaders in our communities .
