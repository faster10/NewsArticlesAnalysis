Should Romney disclose his tax returns and other information relating to off shore accounts ? Yes , he should . Like many others who have been financially successful and as a result have complicated financial histories , Romney has shown a deep reluctance to disclose anything more than the bare minimum and has only released his tax return for one year . But he is asking voters to entrust him with the most powerful and important office in the world . In return , voters have a right to know who he is and how he got here . Put it out , take whatever hits are coming , and move on . If he has been as honest as all his friends believe , he will ultimately be a stronger candidate and can refocus on what matters : the country .
