If you ' ve been to L . A . , you know how bad the traffic is it can take me 2 hours to drive the 18 miles from my office to Dodger Stadium . All those vehicles contribute to Southern California ' s horrible air pollution . It ' s true that cars now emit fewer pollutants due to regulation at the federal and state level but Los Angeles simply has too many cars for the carrying capacity of the region . A massive increase in public transit , hybrid and zero emission cars and trucks is a sound solution to help alleviate this pollution .
