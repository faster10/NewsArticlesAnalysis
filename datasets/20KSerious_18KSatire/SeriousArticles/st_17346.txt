But here is where things get unusual . Deep pocketed big shot activist investors like Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb , both of whom have targeted Yahoo over the years , have a formula ? they take a substantial position in a company , sometimes one percent or more of its stock , and compel it to change its practices or reallocate its capital . Maybe the investor gets a board seat or two . Often the stock ticks up on mere news of the activist s stake , making it even easier to exit with a profit a year or two later .
