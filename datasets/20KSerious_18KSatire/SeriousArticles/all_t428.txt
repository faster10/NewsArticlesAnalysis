Aaron Schock’s office reviewing his travel reimbursements
Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock is beginning an internal review to discover whether he complied with House rules covering reimbursement for official travel. This review comes after POLITICO raised questions Tuesday about tens of thousands of dollars he has received from his official account for use of his personal vehicle on official duty. “Congressman Schock and his team have a well-deserved reputation for constituent service,” a statement from his office said. “This is due to extensive travel throughout the district which is 205 towns and 19 counties. The Congressman’s staff has access to his vehicle so it is used frequently when he is both in and out of the district. For example, this weekend over 800 miles were driven crisscrossing the district for events. Congressman Schock takes his compliance responsibilities seriously and procedures concerning this issue will be reviewed to determine whether they can improved.” Schock regularly received monthly $1,000 checks out of his members representational allowance to cover the mileage he reported incurring on his personal vehicle. He was reporting that his car was driven upwards of 2,000 miles each month.
