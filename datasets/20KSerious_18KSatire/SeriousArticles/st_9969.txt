" We ' ve written school board members and let them know that there is a precedent and Supreme Court ruling on the subject . In each case where there ' s an open challenge , a school will go through the process where they appoint a committee or take it to the school board to investigate what the actions should be . You could look at them negatively and say there ' s a certain amount of reinventing the wheel because the legal precedent is quite clear . At the same time , allowing the school community to go through the process of figuring that out and debating it I think has an unquestionable value , and that ' s one reason we like to leave it to them .
