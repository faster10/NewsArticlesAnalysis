A : Absolutely . The bigger you get , the more pressure you have to deal with . The hard part is I ' m a normal size girl , and I ' m fine with that . All these stars are so tiny , and they spend their lives trying to be skinny . I want to look my best , but I ' m not a model . I ' m not an actress . I ' m representing normal girls . It ' s OK to have a little bit of curve . I ' m happy with my body . So many girls come up to me and say , " Thank you for being normal , " and I ' m proud of that .
