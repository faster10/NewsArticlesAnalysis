One of these processes is the Heart of Asia Conference founded in Istanbul , in Turkey in 2011 . The 5th Ministerial Conference of the aforementioned process was held in Islamabad this week . It was important for Pakistan to hold a significant international conference . But two uncertainties haunted the conference up till the last moment . First was the question as to weather Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani will participate in the conference as co chair or will he send some lower state functionary to record his protest against Pakistan s continuous and not so secret support for Afghan Taliban ? It goes without saying that holding this conference without proper participation of Afghanistan would have been like playing Hamlet without a prince of Denmark . US , China and some other countries lobbied behind the scenes for the participation of Afghan President in the conference . A delegation of Pashtun politicians from Pakistan visited Kabul to request the Afghan President and other leaders to play their role in the peace process . The problem seemed to have been resolved when President Ashraf Ghani agreed to meet PM Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of Paris Summit on Environment . But the news emanating from Quetta about Mulla Mansur , the new Taliban leader getting wounded or killed in a factional shoot out created new uncertainty .
