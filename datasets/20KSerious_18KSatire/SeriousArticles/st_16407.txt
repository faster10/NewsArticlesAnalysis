So not only does Blandino get it wrong , ( there was never ever a grab ) , but he then basically absolves his officials because it s too much to expect his officials to accurately figure out what a facemask is at full speed ? Really ? Against Buffalo , Blandino s cronies robbed the Bills of a chance to run a Hail Mary by applying a college football rule in an NFL game , and weeks later the Packers get an extra play they never should have had because at any speed , his crews blow . Failure is now just business as usual for the NFL vice president of officiating .
