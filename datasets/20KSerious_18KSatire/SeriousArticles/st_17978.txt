Similarly , New York ' s highest court , the Court of Appeals , first authorized TV coverage in 1987 , and since 2009 all oral arguments have been covered and posted in the court ' s archive , according to Gary Spencer , the court ' s public information officer . Coverage is provided by just two small cameras mounted on window sills at the sides of the court room , operated remotely from a studio in the basement . " Our experience , " Spencer said , " is that it has not caused any problems . The more the public can learn about what leads to a decision , the more willing they are to accept it . "
