One last thing to keep an eye on next week : exit polling on women , Latinos , Asian Americans , African Americans and millennials . If Democrats are losing ground in most or all of those groups , the coronation of Hillary Clinton may have to be postponed for a while . And if all the harsh Democratic advertising fails , it may be a sign , as Molly Ball suggests in The Atlantic , that " cranky social issues warriors " whose campaigns are " obsessed with social issues " may now be defining Democrats and not Republicans .
