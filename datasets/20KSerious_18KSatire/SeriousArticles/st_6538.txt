As a leading U . S . official wrote in an internal memo a few years ago , Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide . Let s see ? who was that ? Well , my goodness : It was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , whose personal , political and nongovernmental affairs are so thickly encrusted with Saudi money it s a wonder she can see out the windows . ( That passage comes from an intergovernmental cable sent to the Treasury Department , which was later retrieved and released by Wikileaks . ) So whatever else we might want to say about Clinton and the Saudis , we can t accuse her of being na ? ve or ignorant .
