It s not just that I m from Chicago . It s that the 1995 96 Chicago Bulls changed my life , inspired me to do what I now do 20 years later , and there s also that whole part where I recorded all 100 Bulls games from that season onto VHS tape , and still have the ones that survived the crossover on DVD out in my garage . If I had to pit one bit of basketball trivia as the subject of a quiz that would save me from internal damnation , I d want to discuss the season that saw Pete Myers pre halftime half court heave in game 75 cost the Bulls a 73 9 record .
