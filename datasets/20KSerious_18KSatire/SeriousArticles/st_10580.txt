He needs to build off his preparation , McCarthy said when asked how Lacy could get back in his good graces . He s put up some yards in the prior games , but he can be better . We need to be better as a team , frankly . I discussed this in our team meeting . There s a lot more to give . The fine details are not where we want them to be . There s a formula for us to get it there . That was made clear to our players and with the expectations and the commitment that we ve made to each other , and we ve got to do a better job .
