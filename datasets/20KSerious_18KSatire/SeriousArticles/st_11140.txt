Ken Howard called and told me I was picked for the award . It was a surprise to me I was amazed and am delighted to receive it . The last recipient was Rita Moreno , who ' s an old friend of mine from our MGM days we were under contract at the same time . It ' s special because it ' s from my peers people who have talent and know what you do so I ' m looking forward to it ! I ' ve asked my daughter , Carrie Fisher , to present it to me , and we ' re bringing the whole family , so it will be a family affair !
