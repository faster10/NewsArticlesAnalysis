So , it s an empty promise . One of the reasons I lift up Eisenhower as the alternative to Goldwater at the time , and representing in his core beliefs something like what conservatism needs now , is that Eisenhower was certainly a budget balancer . He was certainly prudent , he was certainly pro business , he was all these things conservatives like ? but he did not pretend that you could roll back the New Deal . He did not pretend that Americans wanted nothing from government . He was willing to use government where he thought it was appropriate . He created the interstate highway system he created the student loan program , which helped me go to college . Eisenhower was conservatism as prudence and trying broadly to preserve the American way of life , while accepting that certain things change with the times because the problems change . I still think , in the end , conservatism is going to have to go back ? or ? forward , in a way ? ? to being about that , and not about a series of ideological slogans that include promises they can t keep .
