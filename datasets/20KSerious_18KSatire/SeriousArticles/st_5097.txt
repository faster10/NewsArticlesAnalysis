Winners : Jeff Bagwell and Tim Raines . Yes , they fell short of election Bagwell was 15 votes short and Raines 23 but they ' re now close enough that their selections next year appear inevitable . Bagwell climbed from 55 . 7 percent to 71 . 6 Raines from 55 percent to 69 . 8 . The only hitch could be that Raines is down to his final year on the ballot and he ' s not quite the clear cut Hall of Famer that Bagwell should be . Still , Raines is now so close and given the campaign that will lead up to the next voting cycle and the usual last year on the ballot increase , I think he slides just over the 75 percent barrier . I will point out , however , that Jack Morris failed to benefit from the final year sympathy vote : After getting 67 . 7 percent in his 14th year on the ballot in 2013 , he fell to 61 . 5 percent in 2014 . But Morris doesn ' t have as strong a Hall of Fame case and was also hurt by the appearance of Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine on that year ' s ballot .
