There has long been a certain desire among journalists and politicians to make Marco Rubio happen . He s young and telegenic and has the sort of humble roots that narrative writers and image consultants slobber over . If he wins the nomination , his opponent in the general will be either Bernie Sanders or ( much more likely , sorry , Bernie fans ) Hillary Clinton . Either one gives the media the youth vs . decrepit old story it loves so much , as it can easily be inflated into a larger question of the country s direction , i . e . Can Rubio s youthful energy shake up the official , stodgy old Washington represented by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats , etc . etc .
