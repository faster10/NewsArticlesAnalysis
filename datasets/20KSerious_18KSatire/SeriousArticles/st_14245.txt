Marine vessels in Hong Kong can burn cheaper and more hazardous 3 . 5 sulfur oil , while in various ECA zones , vessels cannot exceed 0 . 5 percent . New regulations by the International Maritime Organization , a United Nations agency that is responsible for the safety of maritime vessels and works to prevent pollution from ships , is looking into forcing vessels to burn no more than 0 . 5 percent of sulfur by 2020 . This applies to bigger container and cruise ships , whilst smaller local craft are dealt with under other regulation .
