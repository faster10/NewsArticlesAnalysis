Someone in TOTC recently asked why Father Michael Pfleger encouraged the disruptive Black Friday protests on Michigan Avenue . It ' s because Pfleger has adopted thug tactics . Initially trying to help his local parishioners deal with racial inequality issues , a noble cause , he appears to have now adopted the mannerisms of the lowest element to accomplish this , and in doing so he sabotages his efforts . Black Friday shopping has nothing to do with the shooting he was protesting , so punishing these merchants seems to point to a confused , reactionary man more enamored with publicity than social reform . Mob action and threats are what thuggery is all about .
