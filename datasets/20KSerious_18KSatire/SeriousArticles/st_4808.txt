Two weeks ago , I spoke to a mum and dad in Newcastle who were trying to entertain their toddler in a play area with a cracked slide , and talked about other places nearby now covered in graffiti , and rendered all but unusable . The national statistics show how widespread this almost silent crisis is becoming . At the last count , 86 of the people in charge of local parks had seen cuts to their budgets since 2010 and almost half of local councils were considering either selling their parks , or somehow contracting them out . All over the country , in fact , you now see much the same sight : perhaps the most vivid , immediate embodiment of what some people call the public realm , rotting away at speed ? and now set to decline even further , as the Conservatives continue to strip money from councils budgets .
