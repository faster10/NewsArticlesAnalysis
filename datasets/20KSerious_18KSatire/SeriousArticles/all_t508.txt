John Boehner: House moving toward suit on Obama’s immigration steps
House Speaker John Boehner’s leadership team is preparing a resolution that could authorize further legal action against the Obama administration over its moves on immigration, he told his colleagues Tuesday morning. The resolution, which Boehner discussed in a closed Republican meeting Tuesday, could authorize the House to take several different forms of legal action against the administration, but no final course of action has been decided. For example, the resolution could authorize the House to join a lawsuit that states have filed against President Barack Obama over the executive action.

Republicans have been nearly uniformly opposed to Obama’s decision to change the enforcement of immigration laws by executive authority, and Boehner (R-Ohio) has been trying to find a way to respond. Congress has funded the Department of Homeland Security only until late February, and House Republicans have tried to gut the executive actions through legislation that Obama will never sign. A solo lawsuit could increase tension between the administration and Congress. The House has already sued Obama over his changes to Obamacare. The House was slow to file that lawsuit and cycled through a few attorneys before finalizing its strategy.
