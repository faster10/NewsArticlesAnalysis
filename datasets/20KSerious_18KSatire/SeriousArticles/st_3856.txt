I don ' t want to give the impression that I didn ' t laugh at times . I did " especially during the film ' s inspired end credits tease of future Jump Street installments . But I ' ve come to expect more from directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , who have been on a roll with the cult TV series " Clone High , " the first " Jump Street , " and most recently " The LEGO Movie . " The merry prankster duo have a real knack for cheeky pop culture mischief and placing clever new spins on shopworn properties . I get that with sequels , moviegoers are , to some extent , asking to see more of the same . But does the same have to feel quite so samey ? Grade : B
