It is ironic , to say the least , whenever India and Pakistan were able to engage each other in peace proceedings , the process is fractured either by the states themselves , given the bureaucratic mistrust , or by the non state actors . The most recent case in point of bilateral cooperation was manifested during Indian Prime Minister ( PM ) NarendraModi s visit to Pakistan on 25 December 2015 . Regardless of the media hype which attempted to make a case that Modi only stopped over in Lahore from his state visit to Afghanistan where he had a very warm exchange of views and policy commitments , the fact of the matter is Modi Nawaz meeting was well planned and supported by the two countries security establishments . In the case of Pakistan where the Sharif led civil government had been subdued to the mightymilitary , thanks to Imran Khan s sit in politics , it is but illogical to argue Sharif took a personal stance on India Pakistan relations . The Sharifs , being businessmen and with corporate interests in the expanding Indian market , might have personally preferred peace with Delhi but any such whims can not materialise in Pakistan until they are approved by the GHQ . This is a hard core reality of civil militaryrelations in Pakistan that , for the sake of corrective discourse , ought not to be overlooked .
