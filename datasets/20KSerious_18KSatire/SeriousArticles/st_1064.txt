Hassanzadeh became fascinated with energy while earning her bachelor s degree in law at Islamic Azad University in Tehran under Hassan Sedigh , one of Iran s leading oil and gas attorneys . She also interned in his law office , where she worked with executives at big oil companies from all over the world . The experience eventually helped win her a scholarship from Royal Dutch Shell to pursue a master s degree in law at the University of Cambridge in England in 2008 and 2009 . People are really intrigued by her , especially in the West , says Jonathan Stern , Hassanzadeh s dissertation adviser and the founder and chairman of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies natural gas research program . A young Iranian woman with great English skills , an academic background , real world experience , and a law degree isn t like anything anyone s ever seen before .
