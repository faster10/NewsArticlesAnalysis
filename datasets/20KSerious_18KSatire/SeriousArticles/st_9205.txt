And yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States . You want to talk about hard feelings ? There is plenty . Mexico has winners and losers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn ' t . The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grandparent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north . And more often than not , that person fit a profile dark skin , little education , from a poor village , etc .
