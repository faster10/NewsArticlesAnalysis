I d say it was a combination of things . Denver did a good job defensively . So , it s all interconnected between the receivers , the quarterback , the offensive line , the timing , the execution , the balance in the running game , longer yardages situations . It s all part of it . And in the end it just wasn t as good as it needed to be yesterday . Period . In any area . I wouldn t put it on any one guy or any one situation or one position or anything like that . Just in the end we came up short .
