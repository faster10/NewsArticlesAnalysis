Eick : Like any premiere , we ' re waiting for feedback . The context of success and failure is completely alien to me . I don ' t know what constitutes a hit . If I had a show on television , I wouldn ' t know what constitutes a hit anymore . It keeps changing . I don ' t know what the criterion is for success . If it ' s met , I suspect we ' ll get into a conversation about more of them . If it ' s not met , I ' m sure this will make a lovely DVD keepsake for someone . I am encouraged by the powers that be that they have very high expectations for this . The buzz about it is extremely strong and loud , and we would not be foolish to get our hopes up to anticipate future storytelling .
