A New York cop who scarcely seems to spend any time in the Big Apple , McClane heads out to Moscow to bail out a deadbeat son , Jack , who I don ' t recall featuring in the earlier movies . Jai Courtney , from " Jack Reacher " and " Spartacus : Blood and Sand , " is what they call " fresh meat " and a more conventional action hero than Justin Long was in McClane ' s last escapade . But on this evidence McClane junior hasn ' t inherited any of his father ' s charisma or wry wit . Mostly he just looks put out , understandable as screenwriter Skip Woods makes sure senior always has the last word . Not that any of Willis ' wisecracks are anything to write home about . That trademark smirk is stretched pretty thin .
