If those two were the last candidates standing it would make for a very interesting race ? two youthful , conservative Latino Senators representing the outsider and insider strains in the GOP . Considering the primary race so far , the better bet at the moment would seem to be Cruz . His strategy is more sophisticated and he better reflects the anti establishment zeitgeist in the party . But he is a very hardcore Tea Party conservative and has little ability to appeal to moderates or independents . Rubio is a much more congenial politician who could conceivably draw a broader segment of the electorate ? if the GOP base ever sobers up enough to care about that .
