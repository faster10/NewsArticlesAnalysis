The Russians have shown some lenience , claiming that Saleh Al Muslim can attend at a later date and didn t have to be present on Day One of Geneva III . Human rights lawyer Haitham Manaa , co president of the Syrian Democratic Forces fighting in the eastern provinces of Syria , was explicit that he would not go to Switzerland if his ally Al Muslim was not in the negotiating room . Additionally , ex Fforeign ministry spokesman Jihad Maqdisi , who also left Syria in 2012 , has declined attending Geneva III , despite being officially asked to do so by the Russians . He was among the three names forced upon the talks with Moscow , including Al Muslim and Qadri Jamil , the ex deputy Prime Minister .
