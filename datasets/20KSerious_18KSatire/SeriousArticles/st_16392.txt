A : The Beatles started out as atheists and agnostics and I think as everybody knows they became more interested in spiritual things . They went out to India in 1968 and I think in a way the Beatles became a spiritual force themselves . And I think that John actually saw that . He saw Christianity and rock ' n ' roll as competitors . Only three years later , after 1966 , you had the Woodstock festival and you get rock music almost performing a religious function . So I think in a way he was aware of what was happening . The Beatles were almost becoming a religion and exerting a spiritual force over people .
