Current players understand the legacy of great Steelers teams that came before the 2015 squad and are embracing it . We take pride in it , said linebacker Arthur Moats . Any time you are able to add to this legacy it s great you don t want to let those ( legendary ) guys down . They paved the way for us . They started the whole legacy . We are just glad to be able to carry the torch . Linebacker Sean Spence said , From talking to other guys around the league and how their organization works , all of us are blessed to be in such a great organization . Everyone is family here . That legacy includes the 28th playoff berth ( this year ) that has made the Steelers the leader in the league with that status over every other NFL team since the NFL merger in 1970 .
