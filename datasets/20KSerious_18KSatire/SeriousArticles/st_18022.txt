In the mid 1980s , I had an opportunity to represent an obscure and unhappy publication as its journalistic correspondent in the White House for a few years . I leaped at the chance , moving across the U . S . to be there , in the press room , almost daily . I didn ' t like who I worked for and I didn ' t like who was president at the time , but I loved the White House , especially on the few occasions when I was included among journalists invited to one of the many holiday parties held there .
