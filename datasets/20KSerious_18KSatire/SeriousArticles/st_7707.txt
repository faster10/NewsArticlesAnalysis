The Voting Rights Act was passed not only for the most extreme acts of intimidation , but also for the small changes , such as literacy tests and poll taxes , that made voting harder for people of color and poor whites . The last few years leading up to the 2012 elections saw the greatest efforts to pass restrictive voting laws since the post Reconstruction era , including limiting the type of ID that people can use , and requiring additional proof of citizenship to register and vote , all of which disproportionately impact people of color and the working poor . These adjustments unfairly shift the goal line and demonstrate why Section 5 is still needed .
