U2 ' s Bono , discussing the band ' s postponed Paris concert , told Rolling Stone that he was shocked because : " This is the first direct hit on music that we ' ve had in this so called War on Terror or whatever it ' s called . It ' s very upsetting . These are our people . This could be me at a show . You at a show , in that venue . It ' s a very recognizable situation for you and for me and the coldblooded aspect of this slaughter is deeply disturbing and that ' s what I can ' t get out of my head . "
