Besides , Paltrow is focused on other things at the moment , like building Goop as a brand . As she readies the launch of its new beauty line , the actress turned businesswoman is anticipating what her critics might say . " Sometimes I ' ll get annoyed if someone ' s like , ' Goop is so expensive ' . I ' m like , ' Have you looked at the website ? Have you seen the range of price points ? ' Cause we sell things that are 8 ' . I ' m like , ' At least have all your information ' , " Paltrow says . " Once in a while , if I ' m exhausted and overwhelmed , I ' ll be like , ' Ugh , that bugs me ! ' or , ' That hurt my feelings ' . But very rarely . I don ' t lose sleep over it . It ' s my business to live my life and learn my lessons . I don ' t care what anybody else thinks . "
