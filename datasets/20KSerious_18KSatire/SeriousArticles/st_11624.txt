Broncos outside linebacker Von Miller and defensive end DeMarcus Ware , along with the team s broad defense , crushed Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and the rest of the opposing team , with their 20 18 win . And now the team s eyes are set on the Vince Lombardi trophy . Coach Gary Kubiak , he kept everybody in the loop , no surprises , told us to concentrate on doing our jobs and good things would happen . I d like to be able to emulate what Coach Ditka did and win it . The moment doesn t come very often .
