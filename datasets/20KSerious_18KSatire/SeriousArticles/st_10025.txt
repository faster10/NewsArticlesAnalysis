James Petras , from Binghamton University ? shared his opinion with RT : " I think it is a case of mutual manipulation . The US is interested in incorporating Ukraine into the NATO alliance and using it as a pressure point against Russia . On the other hand Petro Poroshenko s economy is in dire straits it is in a negative spin it has few resources it lacks popular support . He is still engaged in the warfare with the Eastern regions . He has alliances among the most extreme right wing groups in Europe His crony capitalism has alienated middle class Ukrainians . I think there is a question here of a government with the few resources , and a superpower looking to manipulate the regime to serve its imperial interest . "
