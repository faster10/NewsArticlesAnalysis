Toward the end of that night s concert , during the break between the main body of the set and the encore , the band ran off stage right and Bowie slipped off stage left , descending a few steps down a short flight of stairs behind a massive column of speakers directly in front of us . I watched from 75 ? feet away as a crewmember handed Bowie a towel and a lit cigarette . Another member of his crew placed a sweaty highball glass on the railing next to him . My idol stood alone for a moment , a towel around the shoulders of his soft yellow suit , a cigarette dangling from his lips . He pressed the icy highball glass to his forehead . Seventeen thousand people chanted his surname , a mantra , an invocation . As the adulation built to a frenzy around him , he took a quiet moment to himself . I watched him , and , in that moment , discovered something about myself : I wanted that job .
