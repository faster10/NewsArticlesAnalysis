Had my partner been able to openly share his experience , he might have highlighted McCain ' s arguments about repeal of DADT affecting morale , recruitment and retention as moot points . In Afghanistan , my partner worked and lived alongside Danish , French and British troops , to name just a few . With nearly every NATO country allowing gay men and women to serve openly in their militaries , McCain would have had to forgo multinational operations and coalitions in order to fully " protect " his soldiers from exposure to " openly gay " personnel .
