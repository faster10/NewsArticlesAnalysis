This group still has plenty of flaws . Joakim Noah looks lost on the offensive end . Tony Snell is struggling to contribute at all , and Taj Gibson lacks the consistency in his game right now that made him so dependable over the past six seasons . Doug McDermott is still a liability on the defensive end , and E ' Twaun Moore still has some games where he struggles to find a rhythm . Having said that , the Bulls are starting to believe in themselves again on a nightly basis . The offense might not be there all the time , but the defensive intensity can be packaged and produced each night .
