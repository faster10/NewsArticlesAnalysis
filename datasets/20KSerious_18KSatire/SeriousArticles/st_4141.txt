Risky now from Fury as he goes southpaw . Still neither can land a punch , even when the cocky Brit puts his hands behind his back . Klitschko still not willing to let go with his right he ' s either enormously unsettled by Fury or is biding his time before letting fly . After a full two minutes , Klitschko finally throws the left hook but can ' t find a way through . Fury is going for the jabs at least , but he ' s not able to land anything . Klitschko finishes with an attempted , failed uppercut .
