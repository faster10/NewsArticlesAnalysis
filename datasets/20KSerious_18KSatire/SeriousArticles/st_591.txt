Obama opened his Jan . 12 State of the Union address with a promise : Tonight marks the eighth year that I ve come here to report on the state of the union . And for this final one , I m going to try to make it a little shorter . And he sort of succeeded ? if we only count the seven , not eight , official SOTU addresses . According to data from The American Presidency Project at the University of California , Santa Barbara , the latest speech clocked in at 58 minutes and 44 seconds , more than a minute shorter than 2013 s 59 minute 51 second address . ( And several minutes below Obama s average of one hour , two minutes and 45 seconds . )
