Sue Killen , chief executive of St John Ambulance , says Fabrice ' s case epitomises how vital first aid training is . ' His incident raised public awareness of the need for first aid to a new level , ' she said . ' As the tragedy unfolded on TV , millions saw how important it can be in an emergency . Fabrice was lucky he was surrounded by people who knew first aid , who were the difference between life and death . But it shouldn ' t be the case that people are lucky to have a first aider nearby it ' s a simple skill everyone can learn and we hope these awards encourage people to take that first step . '
