About the Bengals : They probably won ' t have Dalton and will hope for the best from second year backup QB AJ McCarron . He threw two interceptions against Pittsburgh , one a pick six , when he faced them last month in his first significant NFL action . Still , the Bengals boast plenty of assets , including a top tier wideout ( A . J . Green ) and tight end ( Tyler Eifert ) , a dual ? threat and diverse ground attack fueled by Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard , and a stingy defense that allowed more than 24 points only twice in 2015 . . . though the Steelers hung 33 on them in Week 14 .
