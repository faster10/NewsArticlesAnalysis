Not a fan of either team , nor am I pulling for one nor the other . That said , I do believe no matter who wins it ll be a great story . If Denver wins , Peyton is least in the discussion w 2SB wins , 4app all his MvP s , records Ect . Also GREAT Players like D . Ware ( Mathis , A . Smith , Talib . . ) will finally get a ring that s much deserved . On the flip side , Car wins they also have guys like Jared Allen ( Olsen , Davis , Johnson ) who like D . Ware have been Cam will be considered the LeBron of NFL . A freakish blend of size speed , a cannon for an arm , the ability to read a D put his guys in the best scenario to succeed . combo
