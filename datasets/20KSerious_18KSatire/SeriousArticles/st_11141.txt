But the greatest movie that I was a part of was " Singin ' in the Rain . " I was very fortunate that producer Arthur Freed took a young girl who had no training at all didn ' t dance , didn ' t sing , didn ' t do anything and gave her a chance to be in that film . And then I had to prove myself ! I owe a lot to him and MGM executives L . B . Mayer Mr Mayer and Benny Thau and Irving Thalberg . It was the era when they would take an unknown girl and make a star of her overnight . I was lucky . God was very good to me .
