Henry H . Goddard , a researcher who worked at the Vineland Training School for Feeble Minded Girls and Boys in New Jersey , invented the second great mythical family of eugenics , the Kallikaks , based on a young woman he had studied at Vineland . Although Goddard noted that she was attractive enough to get a man and have babies , the pseudonymous Deborah Kallikak had the mind of a child , and was certain to spawn another generation of mental and moral defectives . His book , The Kallikak Family , published in 1912 ( to a fine critical reception , Painter archly points out ) , argued that something had to be done to prevent their further spread . There are Kallikak families all about us , Goddard wrote they are multiplying at twice the rate of the general population . As Painter notes , many successful whites saw such flawed heredity as a threat to the welfare of the race . How can white supremacy stand when some whites are so clearly inferior ?
