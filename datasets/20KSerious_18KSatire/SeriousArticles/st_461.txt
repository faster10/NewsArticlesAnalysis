This all started when I met a graffiti artist named Tempt , who was paralyzed with ALS . I was a film producer , with no experience whatsoever in the field of technological medical devices . But when I learned how he was communicating with his family they ' d run their fingers over a piece of paper with the alphabet printed on it , he ' d blink when they ' d get to the letter he wanted , and , painstakingly , he ' d spell out a sentence I was moved , and angry , and a whole lot of other things . And I blurted out to his father , " We will find a way to get Tempt to paint again . "
