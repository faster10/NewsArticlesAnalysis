I have two pieces with my own company , Irish DreamTime that are in development , that we just got the writers on and just got the heads up from the studio . Two shows that I would be in from time to time . It ' s just interesting work out there . We ' ve started writing the scripts . . . I don ' t really want to talk about them right now , it ' s a little bit premature . The one that ' s going to be a half hour show , it ' s very cool . Comes from the world of " Dexter , " it has a sick attitude about it . TV is very exciting it ' s get in , get out .
