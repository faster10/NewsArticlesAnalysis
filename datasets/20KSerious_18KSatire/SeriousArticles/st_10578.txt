" We would never be part of an event like that , nor would we take money from the Trump campaign , " Fisher House vice president Kerri Childress said . " But Donald Trump has donated to Fisher House in the past , and his son Eric even hosted a golf tournament for us at one point . Because this money is coming from the Trump Foundation we can accept the money . We are very appreciative of his generosity in the past and we are at this point as well . We ' re very proud to accept the money and we will put it to the best use possible . "
