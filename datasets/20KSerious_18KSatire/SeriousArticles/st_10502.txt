Much of Kentucky s shift toward Republican control stems from Democrats losses in the eastern , Appalachian part of the state , where poverty is high but coal is king . Bevin pulled some of his best numbers in Kentucky s impoverished eastern counties , the Washington Post writes , where enrollment had been highest . The tweaks to the Medicaid expansion , as Bevin more recently has been terming them , will test Democrats belief that Republicans won t actually follow through on their rhetoric about taking back coverage that s already been granted because it would turn off beneficiaries who are culturally disposed to voting Republican . If Bevin undoes much of Kentucky s ACA success story and his popularity collapses , those many Republican presidential candidates who ve pledged to do away with Obamacare root and branch might take note . If he does so and it has no discernible effect on his support , though , Republicans will feel much more comfortable going after the law if they recover the White House in 2016 .
