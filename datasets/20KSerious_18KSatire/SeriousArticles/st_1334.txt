Cincinnati Bengals : Yes , I know it ' s beginning to be hard to remember , but there once were days when you wouldn ' t have wanted to trust Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton on a big stage . Those days appear to be ancient history , though , after his solid three touchdown performance against the Browns last Thursday night . Although tracking roving Texans pass rusher J . J . Watt will be quite the challenge for Dalton and Cincinnati ' s offense Monday night , the unit still ought to be able to weather the stiff test Houston ' s defense presents . ESPN ' s Football Power Index gives the Bengals a 78 . 7 percent chance of winning . The FPI also says they will win by more than 10 points . Don ' t be surprised if it isn ' t that lopsided . Texans quarterback Brian Hoyer has had his own past success in Cincinnati in prime time , beating the Bengals there while playing for the Browns last November . Bengals 27 , Texans 21 .
