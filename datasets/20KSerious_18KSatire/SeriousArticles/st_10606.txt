Marco Rubio , the best positioned candidate in the establishment wing , made his position clear on Sunday . You can have 1 , 000 people come in , and 999 of them are just poor people fleeing oppression and violence , but one of them is an ISIS fighter , he said during an interview on ABC s This Week . If that s the case , you have a problem , and there is no way to vet that out . Bush , meanwhile , staked out a similar position ? albeit with a Cruz endorsed caveat that we should try to find room for Christians . Chris Christie also got in on the tough talk , suggesting that he was so serious about closing our borders that he wouldn t even make an exception for Syrian orphans under age 5 . Meanwhile , John What Will We Tell St . Peter ? Kasich has dropped his support for taking refugees . And even Lindsey Graham ? perhaps the most pro refugee candidate in the GOP field ? now wants to call timeout on the whole thing .
