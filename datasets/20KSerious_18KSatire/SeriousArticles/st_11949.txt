What this campaign is about is transforming America , Sanders said . Nothing that I said to you today is utopian nothing is radical . Nothing that I have said does not exist in other countries , and nothing I have said to you today is not wanted and supported by the American people . The American people want to raise the minimum wage , they want pay equity , they want to create jobs by building our infrastructure , they want to make colleges and universities tuition free , they want to expand Social Security , not cut Social Security . They want us to deal effectively with climate change . They want to end a corrupt campaign finance system . None of this is radical . None of it is pie in the sky , and I told you how we could pay for each of these programs . The issue is not whether the American people want it the issue is whether or not we have the courage to take on the greed of the billionaire class , who want it all for themselves . That is what this campaign is about .
