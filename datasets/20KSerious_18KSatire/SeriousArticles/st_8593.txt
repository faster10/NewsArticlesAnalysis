My husband and I have lived in the Boston area for 18 years , we have run many marathons , and like so many folks , we had friends who were injured when those bombs when off . What struck us so profoundly about the attack , though , was not the destruction and devastation , but our response . Our response was profound and full of courage . First responders went running toward the blast areas to help . Runners , many of whom were doctors or veterans who had just finished running 26 . 2 miles , carried the injured to safety or ran to emergency rooms to help tend to the wounded .
