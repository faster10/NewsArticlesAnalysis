The email went on to say : ' The findings indicate that titanium white was used in a number of instances , making it impossible for the painting to have been painted before 1938 ( the titanium white used in the painting was sourced from rutile , a method that was patented by W . J . Kroll in 1938 before that date titanium white in its pure form was only available from 1910 onwards , so either way , the presence of titanium white is a sign that the painting cannot pre date 1910 ) . This strongly suggested that the painting we have analysed is indeed a forgery and most probably comes from the workshop of Mr Beltracchi ' .
