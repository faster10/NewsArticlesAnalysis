I m a big believer in natural ability , Trump told me during a discussion about his leadership traits , which he said came from a natural sense of how human relations work . If Obama had that psychology , Putin wouldn t be eating his lunch . He doesn t have that psychology and he never will because it s not in his DNA . Later in this discussion , Trump said : I believe in being prepared and all that stuff . But in many respects , the most important thing is an innate ability . Perhaps Trump s conviction that DNA ? not life experience ? is everything explains why he proudly claims that he s basically the same today as when he was a boy . When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now , I m basically the same , he said . The temperament is not that different . Academic research popularised by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2002 essay The Talent Myth demonstrates that achievement depends more on dedication and experience than in bred ability . But this message is lost on many well to do Americans who , researchers have found , believe their wealth affirms their innate superiority . The better off are also more inclined to believe that people get what they are entitled to have .
